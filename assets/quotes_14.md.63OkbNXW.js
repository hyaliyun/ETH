Early life Sydney Owenson was the daughter of Robert Owenson, alias MacOwen, and Jane Hill. Robert Owenson was an Irish Catholic and a professional actor, noted for his comedic performances. He had been raised in London, and while in England he met and married Jane Hill, the Protestant daughter of a trader from Shrewsbury. In 1776 Owenson and his wife returned to Ireland for good. The couple settled in Dublin and Owenson earned a living by performing in theatres around Dublin, Drumcondrath, and Sligo. Around 1778 the couple gave birth to Sydney, who was named after her paternal grandmother. The exact date of Sydney's birth remains unknown; one of Sydney's idiosyncrasies was that she was prone to be elusive about her actual age. Later in life she would claim that she was born on 25 December 1785, a lie she maintained to such an extent that even on her death certificate there is no certainty about her age, stating that she was \\"about 80 years\\". Sydney spent the earliest years of her childhood at the Owensons' home at 60 Dame Street in Dublin with her mother Jane and sister Olivia. Sydney was primarily educated by her mother, but she also received tutoring from a young boy named Thomas Dermody, a local prodigy whom their father had rescued from poverty. Her mother died in 1789, when Sydney was about ten years old, and her father sent her and her sister away to private schools to finish their education. Sydney spent three years at a Huguenot academy at Clontarf and then attended a finishing school in Earl Street, Dublin. After completing school Sydney moved with her father to Sligo. In 1798 the Owenson family was experiencing some financial hardships and Sydney was forced to leave home in search of employment. She was hired as a governess by the Featherstones of Bracklyn Castle, County Westmeath. In this environment she blossomed into an avid reader, a capable conversationalist, and an unabashed performer of songs and dances. It was at this period in her life that she began her writing career.OxfordDictionaryofNationalBiography Career Lady Morgan, stipple and line engraving by Robert Cooper, 1825, after Samuel Lover Italie, t. 2, 1821 She was one of the most vivid and hotly discussed literary figures of her generation. She began her career with a precocious volume of poems. She collected Irish tunes, for which she composed the words, thus setting a fashion adopted with signal success by Thomas Moore. Her novel St. Clair (1804), about ill-judged marriage, ill-starred love and impassioned nature worship, in which the influence of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (specifically his novel The Sorrows of Young Werther) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau was apparent, at once attracted attention. Another novel, The Novice of St. Dominick (1806), was also praised for its qualities of imagination and description. But the book which made her reputation and brought her name into warm controversy was The Wild Irish Girl (1806), in which she appeared as the ardent champion of her native country, a politician rather than a novelist, extolling the beauty of Irish scenery, the richness of the natural wealth of Ireland, and the noble traditions of its early history. She was known in Catholic and Liberal circles by the name of her heroine Glorvina. Patriotic Sketches and Metrical Fragments followed in 1807. She published The Missionary: An Indian Tale in 1811, revising it shortly before her death as Luxima, the Prophetess. Percy Bysshe Shelley admired The Missionary intensely and Owenson's heroine is said to have influenced some of his own orientalist productions. Miss Owenson entered the household of John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn, and in 1812 — persuaded by Lady Abercorn, the former Lady Anne Jane Gore — she married the philosopher and surgeon to the household, Sir Thomas Charles Morgan, but books still continued to flow from her facile pen. In 1814 she produced her best novel, O'Donnell. She was at her best in her descriptions of the poorer classes, of whom she had a thorough knowledge. Her elaborate study (1817) of France under the Bourbon Restoration was attacked with outrageous fury by John Wilson Croker in the Quarterly Review, the author being accused of Jacobinism, falsehood, licentiousness and impiety. She took her revenge indirectly in the novel Florence Macarthy (1818) —translated into French by Jacques-Théodore Parisot—, in which a Quarterly reviewer, Con Crawley, is insulted with supreme feminine ingenuity. Italy, a companion work to her France, was published in 1821 with appendices by her husband; Lord Byron bears testimony to the justness of its pictures of life. The results of Italian historical studies were given in her Life and Times of Salvator Rosa (1823). Then she turned again to Irish manners and politics with a matter-of- fact book on Absenteeism (1825), and a romantic novel with political overtones, The O'Briens and the O'Flahertys (1827). From William Lamb, Viscount Melbourne, Lady Morgan obtained a pension of £300. During the later years of her long life she published The Book of the Boudoir (1829), Dramatic Scenes from Real Life (1833), The Princess (1835), Woman and her Master (1840), The Book without a Name (1841), and Passages from my Autobiography (1859). Sir Thomas died in 1843, and Lady Morgan died on 14 April 1859 (aged about 82) and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Legacy Before her death in 1859, Lady Morgan enlisted the help of her friend Geraldine Jewsbury to help write her memoirs. The two had originally met in 1853 when Jewsbury was newly arrived to London. Lady Morgan became friends with Geraldine and helped her live the single life while in London. When Jewsbury wrote her friend's memoirs, she spoke of Lady Morgan's kindness and friendship in which she showed to Geraldine. Bust of Lady Morgan by David d'Angers Lady Morgan's autobiography and many interesting letters were edited with a memoir by William Hepworth Dixon in 1862. There is a bust of Lady Morgan in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The plaque identifying the bust mentions that Lady Morgan was \\"less than four feet tall.\\" Another bust by David d'Angers is exhibited in his museum in Angers (France).

The reserve is an area of coastal rainforest, woodland and grassland. It is an important area for plant biodiversity – over 50% of the 159 rare plants in Kenya are found in the Shimba Hills, including some endangered species of cycad and orchids. It is also a nationally important site for birds and butterflies. There are estimated to be approximately 700 elephants in the reserve. This population is unsustainably high – it causes significant damage to vegetation, threatening the endangered plant life. Conflict between humans and elephants has also reached critical levels. North of the Reserve, the Mwaluganje elephant sanctuary has been established to provide a route for elephants to leave the park. The remainder of the park boundary is fenced to prevent the elephants from invading farmland. The Kenya Wildlife Service has plans to relocate up to 400 elephants from Shimba to Tsavo East National Park in 2005. Shimba Hills contains Kenya's only population of Sable Antelope.

She was the second Navy ship named for the city of Trenton, New Jersey. She spent most of her pre-war career moving between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Trenton joined the Special Service Squadron in 1934, for a good-will tour of Latin America. In May 1939, she would join Squadron 40-T in protecting American interests during the Spanish Civil War and not return to the US until July 1940, when she carried the royal family of Luxembourg, fleeing from the Nazi occupation of their country. Built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Trenton was authorized on 1 July 1918, and assigned to William Cramp & Sons, Philadelphia on 24 January 1919. She was laid down on 18 August 1920, and launched on 16 April 1923, sponsored by Miss Katherine E. Donnelly. Trenton was commissioned on 3 November 1923, with future Admiral, Captain Edward C. Kalbfus in command. Trenton was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew, during peace time, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men. Trenton was powered by four Parsons steam turbines geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 White-Forster boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but was only capable of at a speed of Trentons main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After America's entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-in/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns in single mounts. Trenton was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 mines, but these were removed early in her career to make way for more crew accommodations. She also carried two triple and two twin, above-water, torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull. The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast and the conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor. Trenton carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably Vought VE-9s until the early 1930s when the ship may have operated OJ-2 until 1935 and Curtiss SOC Seagulls until 1940 when Vought OS2U Kingfishers were used on ships without hangars. Armament changes During her career Trenton went through several armament changes, some of these changes were save weight, but others were to increase her AA armament. The lower torpedo tube mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3-inch guns to eight, all mounted in the ship's waist. After 1940, the lower aft guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. The ship's anti-aircraft armament were augmented by three twin Bofors guns along with 12 Oerlikon cannons by the end of the war. Inter-war period On 24 May 1924, she stood out of New York Harbor for her shakedown cruise in the Mediterranean Sea. On 14 August 1924, while in transit from Port Said, Egypt, to Aden, Arabia, she was ordered to Bushire, Persia. She arrived on 25 August, and took on board the remains of Vice Consul Robert Imbrie. She received and returned the gun salute to the late vice consul and departed the same day. Following stops at Suez and Port Said, Egypt; and at Villefranche, France; Trenton arrived at the Washington Navy Yard on 29 September 1924. Trenton returning from her shakedown cruise in 1924. On 20 October 1924, while Trenton was conducting gunnery drills off the Virginia Capes near Norfolk, powder bags in her forward turret exploded, killing or injuring every member of the gun crew.United Press, \\"Explosion Wrecks Cruiser Turret: Six Are Dead 18 Are Hurt In Explosion\\", Madera Daily Tribune, Madera County, California, Tuesday 21 October 1924, Volume XXXIV, page 1. During the ensuing fire, Ensign Henry Clay Drexler and Boatswain's Mate First Class George Cholister attempted to dump powder charges into the immersion tank before they detonated but failed. Ensign Drexler was killed when the charge exploded, and Boatswain's Mate Cholister was overcome by fire and fumes before he could reach his objective. He died the following day. Both men were awarded the Medal of Honor, posthumously. Later that month, Trenton steamed north to join in the futile search for lost American motor yacht Leif Ericsson, which went missing with three aboard while en route from Bergen, Norway, to the United States. The search was suspended on 12 November as further attempts to locate it were deemed “futile” in light of the heavy weather in the region during the two months since the vessel was last heard from. Lost were William W. Nutting and Arthur Hildebrand, American writers, and Eric Todahal, a painter.Associated Press, “Abandon Search in North Atlantic for Lost Boat,” The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Thursday 13 November 1924, Volume LV, Number 74, page 1. Following that mission, the light cruiser operated along the United States East Coast until 3 February 1925, when she departed Philadelphia to join the rest of the Scouting Fleet off Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. After gunnery exercises, the fleet headed for the Panama Canal and transited it in mid-month. On 23 February, the combined forces of the Battle Fleet and Scouting Fleet departed Balboa, Panama, and steamed north to San Diego. En route, the ships participated in a fleet problem, then assembled in the San Diego-San Francisco area. On 15 April, the US Fleet put to sea for the Central Pacific and conducted another battle problem en route — this one designed to test fully the defenses of the Hawaiian Islands. After reaching Hawaiian waters, the Fleet as a whole conducted tactical exercises there until 7 June, when most of the Scouting Fleet headed back toward the Atlantic. Trenton — in Cruiser Division 2 (CruDiv 2) — sortied with the Battle Fleet on 1 July, for a cruise to the South Pacific and visits to Australia and New Zealand. After stopping at Samoa, the ships visited the ports of Melbourne, Wellington, Sydney, Auckland, Dunedin, and Lyttelton. Late in August, CruDiv 2 turned homeward and steamed via the Marquesas and Galapagos Islands and the Panama Canal to rejoin the Scouting Fleet near Guantanamo Bay on 4 October. After gunnery practice, Trenton returned to Philadelphia on 9 November. In January 1926, Trenton joined the other units of the Scouting Fleet and returned to Guantanamo for gunnery drills and tactical exercises. On 1 February, she departed Cuba with them, bound for Panama. For the next six weeks, she participated in combined maneuvers with units of both Battle Fleet and Scouting Fleet. In mid-March, the units of the Scouting Fleet returned to their home yards for repairs before leaving for summer training cruises with naval reservists and tactical exercises in the area around Narragansett Bay. In mid-September, she returned to Guantanamo Bay for winter maneuvers. Trenton participated in maneuvers until just before 25 December, when the units of the Scouting Fleet dispersed to their home ports for the holidays. Early in 1927, she joined the Scouting Fleet in combined maneuvers with the Battle Fleet near Guantanamo Bay. In May, Trenton was called upon to transport Colonel Henry L. Stimson, a special observer in Nicaragua during a period of internal disorder. She embarked Colonel and Mrs. Stimson at Corinto and carried them back to Hampton Roads. Following a review by President Coolidge in June, the various units of the two fleets departed Hampton Roads for their normal summer routines. CruDiv 2, of which Trenton was flagship, operated off Narragansett Bay; then, in the fall, rejoined the Scouting Fleet for gunnery and tactical exercises along the east coast between Chesapeake Bay and Charleston, South Carolina. In January 1928, Trenton and her division embarked Marines at Charleston and returned to Nicaragua, where they landed to assist in supervising the elections which resulted from Colonel Stimson's visit. She and her sister-ships rejoined the Scouting Fleet at Guantanamo and resumed maneuvers. On 9 March, CruDiv 2 parted company with the Scouting Fleet. The four light cruisers rendezvoused with the Battle Fleet off the California coast and headed for Hawaii, conducting drills en route. After exercises in the Hawaiian Islands, Trenton and cleared Honolulu to relieve CruDiv 3 on the Asiatic Station. During that tour of duty, she entertained Colonel Stimson, this time as Governor General of the Philippines. She participated in joint Army-Navy maneuvers in the Philippines and patrolled the northern Chinese coast. By late March 1929, Trenton was stationed at Zhifu to prevent a possible outbreak of anti-foreigner pogroms due to the Warlord Rebellion in northeastern Shandong. On one occasion, she put a landing force ashore at Zhifu. In May 1929, Trenton's division was detached from the Asiatic Fleet, and she steamed back to the United States along with Memphis and . The light cruiser was overhauled at Philadelphia in the latter part of 1929, and then rejoined the Scouting Fleet. For the next four years, Trenton resumed the Scouting Fleet schedule of winter maneuvers in the Caribbean followed by summer exercises off the New England coast. Periodically, however, she was ordered to the Isthmian coast to bolster the Special Service Squadron during periods of extreme political unrest in one or more of the republics of Central America. In the spring of 1933, Trenton moved to the Pacific and became flagship of the Battle Force cruisers. She operated in the eastern Pacific until September 1934. At that time, the ship returned to the Atlantic side of the Panama Canal to cruise with the Special Service Squadron. Over the next 15 months, Trenton visited ports in the Caribbean, in Central America, and South America as the squadron conducted a good-will cruise to Latin America. In January 1936, she retransited the canal and, after an overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard, rejoined the Battle Force until late in the spring of 1939. During that period, she made her second cruise to Australia in the winter of 1937 and 1938, for the sesquicentennial of the first colonization of that continent. In May 1939, she returned to the Atlantic and, after a stop at Hampton Roads, got underway on 3 June for Europe. There she joined Squadron 40-T, a small American naval force which had been organized in 1936, to evacuate United States citizens from Spain and to protect American interests during the Spanish Civil War. Trenton patrolled the western Mediterranean and waters off the coast of the Iberian peninsula until mid-July 1940, when she returned to the United States. During her homeward voyage, the light cruiser carried Luxembourg's royal family then in flight from Nazi aggression. World War II In November, Trenton reentered the Pacific and rejoined the Battle Force, becoming an element of CruDiv 3. From 1941 to mid-1944, the ship served with the Southeast Pacific Force. At the time of America's entry into the war early in December 1941, she was moored at Balboa, Canal Zone. During the early part of 1942, Trenton escorted convoys to Bora Bora in the Society Islands where the Navy was constructing a fuel depot. From mid-1942 to mid-1944, she patrolled the western coast of South America between the Canal Zone and the Strait of Magellan. During one of these sweeps, in September 1943, despite a radar contact which lasted for 15 minutes, she missed the German raider Michel, which later intercepted and sunk the Norwegian tanker India with all hands.Norwegian victims of Michel - MTIndia On 18 July 1944, Trenton headed north for duty in waters surrounding the Aleutians. After stopping for a time at San Francisco, she arrived at Adak, Alaska, on 2 September. A month later, she shifted bases to Attu. In October, Trenton joined and nine destroyers in two sweeps of the northern Kuril Islands — the first from 16–19 October, and the second from 22–29 October — as a diversion during the invasion of Leyte. She returned to the Kurils again on 3 January 1945, to bombard enemy installations on Paramushiru Island, then resumed Alaskan patrols. Trenton after her last overhaul in August 1944. For the remainder of the war, Trenton patrolled the waters off Alaska and the Aleutian Islands and made periodic sweeps of the Kuril Islands. On 18 February, she returned to Paramushiru to pound shore installations. A month later, she bombarded Matsuwa. On 10 June, the light cruiser shelled Matsuwa once more and made an anti-shipping sweep before conducting another bombardment during the evening hours of 11 June. From 23–25 June, Trenton, conducted her last offensive operation of the war, an anti-shipping sweep of the central Kuriles. Task Force 94 (TF 94) split into two units. Trenton encountered no enemy shipping, but the other unit sank five ships of a small convoy. Not long after that operation, the light cruiser steamed south for yard work. She reached San Francisco on 1 August, and the end of the war found her at Mare Island Navy Yard awaiting inactivation overhaul. Early in November, she headed south to Panama. Trenton transited the canal on 18 November, arrived at Philadelphia a week later, and was placed out of commission there on 20 December. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 21 January 1946. On 29 December, she was delivered to her purchaser, the Patapsco Scrap Co. of Bethlehem, Pa., for scrapping. Awards Trenton earned one battle star for World War II.

The band's work has also been named three times as a shortlist nominee for the Polaris Music Prize: in 2007 for Neon Bible, in 2011 for The Suburbs and in 2014 for Reflektor. The band has been described as indie rock, art rock, dance-rock, and baroque pop. They play guitar, drums, bass guitar, piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, glockenspiel, keyboard, synthesizer, French horn, accordion, harp, mandolin and hurdy-gurdy, and take most of these instruments on tour; the multi-instrumentalist band members switch duties throughout shows. History 2001–2003: Formation and early work Win Butler and Josh Deu founded Arcade Fire in Montreal around 2001, having first met at Phillips Exeter Academy as high school students. Butler and Deu's musical ideas began to develop and the first incarnation of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively.\\"Joshua Deu interview\\"/ Madeline, 'Deu discusses past with Arcade Fire, The Ultraviolet, November 13, 2010 (Deu currently is a Visual Arts instructor at Marlborough School (Los Angeles)) The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, \\"Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up saying yes to joining us, and I don’t know why. Maybe there was a little spark with Win.\\" The trio recorded a set of demos and began performing live in the second half of 2001.\\"Concordia 2001 performance\\" Setlist entry At that time, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kile (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi- instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003). The initial Montreal structure of the band began to dissolve in the summer of 2002, when they travelled to Butler's family farm on Mount Desert Island, Maine to record their self-titled EP.\\"Arcade Fire’s maternal spark\\", Portland Press Herald, Portland, ME, January 26, 2014. Retrieved on April 9, 2015. Tension between Butler and bassist Myles Broscoe led the latter to exit the band following the recording session. Richard Reed Parry, who had been enlisted to help the band record, began to collaborate with them during the sessions and would go on to join the band shortly afterwards. Around the same time, Joshua Deu left the band to resume his studies; he continued to collaborate on the visual aspects of the band. In the winter of 2003, the band celebrated the release of its EP with a show at Montreal's Casa del Popolo. Before a crowd packed beyond capacity, the band's set ended (in the middle of an encore) with an argument between Butler and Reed, who quit the band on-stage. Mills told gathered friends in the crowd immediately thereafter that he considered the band to have broken up, as such resigning from the band as well. Following the on-stage implosion, Butler's brother William Butler (subject of the early Arcade Fire song \\"William Pierce Butler\\") and Tim Kingsbury were brought in to replace Reed and Mills so that the band could continue, and they set out to promote the self-titled EP. The eponymous release (often referred to by fans as the Us Kids Know EP) was sold at early shows. After the band achieved fame, the EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release. Howard Bilerman joined the band on drums in the summer of 2003, and they began to play shows together, and record the album that would end up becoming Funeral. The promise shown by the new band in their early live shows allowed them to land a record contract with the independent record label, Merge Records, before the end of their first year together. When asked about the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: \\"It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that someone told me. It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it's probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him.\\" 2004–2006: Funeral Funeral was released in September 2004 in Canada and February 2005 in Great Britain. The title of the debut album referred to the deaths of several relatives of band members (prominently the Butlers' grandfather, composer/arranger Alvino Rey) during its recording. These events created a somber atmosphere that influenced songs such as \\"Une année sans lumière\\" (\\"A Year Without Light\\"), \\"In the Backseat\\", and \\"Haïti\\", Chassagne's elegy to her homeland. It received widespread critical acclaim and topped many year-end and decade-end lists. According to the website Metacritic, the album had the second most appearances on end-of-decade Top 10 lists, only behind Radiohead's Kid A. In the updated version of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it was ranked at #151. The album was critically and commercially acclaimed. It appeared on many top ten album lists for 2004 and 2005 (due to delayed international releases), with Pitchfork, Filter, No Ripcord, and The MTV2 2005 Review crowning it the album of the year. NME named Funeral second in their list of 2005's best albums. NME also named \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" the second best track. By November 2005, Funeral had gone gold in both Canada and the UK, and sold over half a million copies worldwide, a very large number for an independent release with minimal television or radio exposure. The album became Merge Records' first in the Billboard 200 chart and the label's biggest selling album to date, surpassing Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. The band booked small clubs for their 2004 tour, but growing interest forced many venue changes, far beyond the band's expectations, and the tour continued into mid-2005 throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, the SummerSonic Festival in Japan, and the Hillside Festival in Guelph. Taking much of the summer of 2005 off, the band made key festival appearances at the Halifax Pop Explosion, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Sasquatch! Music Festival, Lollapalooza, Vegoose Festival, Reading and Leeds Festival in the UK, Electric Picnic in Ireland and the Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands. Arcade Fire was featured on the April 4, 2005 cover of Time's Canadian edition. On May 1, 2005, the band performed at the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival. In May 2005, the band signed a short-term publishing contract with EMI for Funeral, and in June the band released a new single, \\"Cold Wind\\", on Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends. The BBC used the track \\"Wake Up\\" on an advertisement for their autumn 2005 season, and the tracks \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" and \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" on adverts in January 2006. On September 9, 2005, the band appeared on the British/US television special \\"Fashion Rocks\\", on which David Bowie joined them for \\"Wake Up\\". This recording, as well as recordings of the band's collaboration on Bowie's \\"Life on Mars\\" and \\"Five Years\\", were made available on the iTunes Music Store in a virtual live EP. The same trip to New York City took them to the Late Show with David Letterman and a concert in Central Park. The Central Park show featured a surprise appearance by Bowie. On September 11, 2005, Arcade Fire appeared on the long- running BBC music series Top of the Pops, performing \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\". The band also performed to a TV audience in Paris for Canal+, and the show was later screened on the British television's Channel 4. The band scored two number one songs on MTV2 (UK) NME Chart Show, with \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" and a three-week run with \\"Wake Up\\". This success followed Rough Trade Records's last-minute decision to release \\"Wake Up\\" only on 7\\" vinyl. \\"Wake Up\\" was played immediately before the Irish rock group U2 started their concerts on their 2005–06 Vertigo Tour; Arcade Fire subsequently opened three shows for that tour, and at the third in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, appeared on stage during U2's encore to join in a cover of Joy Division's \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\". Additionally, The Dan Patrick Show, a daily national sports talk show in the US, plays the song as a lead-out every Friday to signify the end of their show. The song was also heard numerous times during the Super Bowl telecast on February 5, 2010. Funeral and the single \\"Cold Wind\\" were nominated for Grammys in the Best Alternative Rock Album and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media categories (Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends), respectively. On April 2, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Arcade Fire received the Juno Award for Songwriters Of The Year for three songs from Funeral: \\"Wake Up\\", \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\", and \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\". The band was nominated for three BRIT Awards: Best International Group, Best International Album, and Best International Breakthrough Act. Arcade Fire made an appearance on the BBC show Later with Jools Holland on May 12, 2005, performing \\"Power Out\\" and \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\". On December 27, 2005, Funeral was ranked No. 1 on MTV2's \\"50 Greatest Albums of the Year\\" in the United Kingdom. On October 22, 2007, Funeral was ranked No. 8 in Bob Mersereau's book The Top 100 Canadian Albums. In late 2009, Pitchfork ranked the album No. 2 in their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s, behind Radiohead's Kid A. 2006–2010: Neon Bible Arcade Fire performing in support of Neon Bible at the United Palace Theater on May 7, 2007 During the downtime between Funeral and the beginning of recording sessions for Neon Bible, the band purchased a defunct church in the small Quebec town of Farnham, approximately southeast of Montreal, and spent the early part of 2006 converting it into a recording studio. The first track officially released from Neon Bible was \\"Intervention\\" in December 2006 on iTunes. Proceeds from this release were dedicated to Partners in Health. An error resulted in a second song, \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\\", appearing on iTunes for a short time. The album was leaked to peer-to-peer networks on January 26, 2007, and was officially released March 5, 2007 in the UK and March 6 in North America. Neon Bible premiered at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart and the Irish Album Charts, and number 2 on the US Billboard Top 200 charts and the UK Top 40 Album Chart for the week of March 12, 2007. The album was also number 1 on the Rock and Indie album charts. The first proper single, \\"Black Mirror\\", reached the No. 1 spot on CBC Radio 3's R3-30 chart for five consecutive weeks, from March 22 to April 19, 2007, and was the first single by any band ever to spend more than two weeks atop the chart. The album gained much critical acclaim (even being mooted as a strong contender for album of the year), and because of its success saw the band proclaimed the most exciting act on the earth by British music magazine Q. Paste voted it one of the five best albums of 2007.Paste Magazine issue No. 38 Trouser Press writer Jason Reeher ranked Neon Bible \\"among the best indie rock recordings of all time.\\" Arcade Fire made their first appearance on Saturday Night Live on February 24, 2007 (Episode 618), performing \\"Intervention\\" and \\"Keep the Car Running\\". Owen Pallett was not present as he was recording for his solo project. During the performance, one of Win Butler's guitar strings broke, prompting him to rip the strings from his acoustic guitar and smash it on the floor until it shattered. On this guitar, \\"sak vide pa kanpe\\" was written in duct tape across the front. A Haitian proverb meaning \\"An empty sack cannot stand up\\" in Creole, this may have been a reference to the extreme poverty of Haiti, the country of origin of Régine Chassagne. On July 10, 2007, Neon Bible was named to the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Patrick Watson was announced as the winner at a gala ceremony on September 24, 2007. However, due to the band's preference not to participate in compilation albums, they were the only nominee not to have a track on the Polaris promotional compilation 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Some media initially reported that the Polaris committee had snubbed the band by excluding them, leading the band and the committee to issue a joint press release confirming that the band chose not to have a track included on the album. The Neon Bible tour continued into September 2007 with 25+ dates scheduled in North America and Europe through mid-November. In Paris the band did a Take-Away Show video session shot by Vincent Moon. The band toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time in early 2008 as part of the 2008 Big Day Out festival. On October 14, 2007, Win Butler and Régine Chassagne made a surprise guest appearance at a Bruce Springsteen show in Ottawa, playing \\"State Trooper\\" and \\"Keep the Car Running\\". The band committed to give Partners in Health $1.00, £1.00, or €1.00 of every ticket sold on its 2008 European and North American tours. Arcade Fire further helped PIH, when it recorded \\"Lenin\\" on Red Hot Organization's latest album, Dark Was the Night. Sales from DWTN generated over $850,000 in money donated to AIDS related charities—$300,000 of which was given to PIH on Arcade Fire's behalf. In February 2008, Win Butler announced on the band's journal that the Neon Bible tour had come to an end, after one year of touring and a total of 122 shows (including 33 festivals) in 75 cities and 19 countries. Critics met the self-produced Neon Bible with acclaim. Publications like NME and IGN praised the album for its grandiose nature. Win Butler has been a vocal supporter of Barack Obama since the end of the New Hampshire Primary. Arcade Fire performed two free concerts for Obama in Cleveland and Nelsonville, Ohio on March 2, 2008 and March 3, 2008 before the state's March 4 primary. The band, with Superchunk, performed another two free concerts for Obama on May 1 in Greensboro, North Carolina, and on May 2 in Carrboro, North Carolina before the state's May 6 primary. On January 21, 2009, Arcade Fire and Jay-Z were the musical guests at the Obama Campaign Staff Ball at the DC Armory, at Obama's request. Butler thanked President Obama for his stated intent to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and repeatedly thanked the Obama staffers for their work during the election. The band was rumoured to be working with producer Markus Dravs on the soundtrack for the Richard Kelly film The Box. Win Butler denied the claims, but stated that he and Owen Pallett \\"may do an instrumental piece or two\\" for the film. In December 2008, Pitchfork reported the band set up the website miroir-noir.com to foreshadow the release of a concert film with the same title, reporting, \\"Miroir Noir will feature live footage from the Neon Bible tour.\\" The upcoming film was directed by Vincent Morisset. It was made available to pre-order on December 15, 2008 with the digital version available to download immediately, and the DVD shipping March 31, 2009. A re-recorded version of the band's song \\"Wake Up\\" from their 2004 debut album, Funeral, was used for the trailer of the Spike Jonze film Where the Wild Things Are, which was released in October 2009. The song \\"Wake Up\\" has also become popular on sports radio talk shows in the US In 2009, two nationally syndicated shows—The Dan Patrick Show and The Petros and Money Show—frequently used the song as \\"bumper\\" music. The National Football League featured this recording in commercials throughout the broadcast of the 2010 Super Bowl. The band donated the proceeds from licensing the song to the NFL to the charity Partners In Health. 2010–2012: The Suburbs On May 27, 2010, it was announced that a new double-sided 12\\" single would be released the same day as the full album, called The Suburbs, on August 2 in the UK and on August 3 in the US and Canada thanks to Merge Records. The album is produced by Markus Dravs, who had worked with the band on their previous album, 2007's Neon Bible, and was engineered by Marcus Paquin, who has also previously worked with the band. A track-by-track review ahead of The Suburbs release by The Quietus website said, \\"The progression is similar to the one William Blake takes us through in Songs of Innocence and of Experience that suggests forward momentum and maturity.\\" The album was released with eight different covers. The first show announced was Oxegen 2010 which took place in Ireland in July. The band announced that they would play songs from the new album in their headline performance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2010, with Win Butler noting, \\"We're really looking forward to playing the new songs live... [it's] like an inventor emerging from his basement after a year's work.\\" In July 2010, Arcade Fire announced they would be broadcasting their August 5 concert at Madison Square Garden live via YouTube. They later announced the video would be directed by Terry Gilliam. The Suburbs was released worldwide at the start of August 2010 to extensive critical acclaim comparable to Funeral and Neon Bible. During the 2010 tour, Arcade Fire gave a tribute to Jay Reatard performing the cover of \\"Oh, It's Such a Shame\\". Win Butler confessed to Zane Lowe that the band wanted Jay Reatard to support the band on this tour, but he had died. The Suburbs went on to debut at number one in the US (on the Billboard 200), selling 156,000 units in its first week. It was also number one in the UK and Canada. In August 2010, Arcade Fire and Google released an interactive music video, written and directed by Chris Milk and produced by B-Reel, which allows the viewer to enter the address where they grew up and the video is then \\"geopersonalised\\". This video utilizes the band's song \\"We Used to Wait\\" from The Suburbs, and showcases capabilities of HTML5 and Google's Chrome browser. On November 13, 2010, Arcade Fire made their second appearance on Saturday Night Live, performing \\"We Used to Wait\\" and \\"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\\". The album debuted at No. 1 on the Irish Albums Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the US Billboard 200 chart, and the Canadian Albums Chart. It won Album of the Year at the 2011 Grammy Awards, Best International Album at the 2011 BRIT Awards, Album of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards, and the 2011 Polaris Music Prize for best Canadian album. Two weeks after winning Grammy's Album of the Year, the album jumped from No. 52 to No. 12 on the Billboard 200, the album's highest ranking since August 2010. In a nod to the Butlers' maternal grandfather, Alvino Rey, who was an amateur radio operator, the logo used by the band from this time was a variation of that used by the American Radio Relay League. Also, when playing the single \\"We Used to Wait\\" live, the background video screen features a radio exchange between Rey and a Canadian operator having Call Sign VE3YV. The video also features many other amateur radio artifacts. Arcade Fire performed at the 53rd Grammy Awards in February 2011. The band was nominated for Grammy Awards in three categories: Album of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Best Alternative Music Album (for The Suburbs).The Gazette (January 13, 2011).

The film screened at the SXSW Film Festival 2011 and saw its online premiere on MUBI on June 27, 2011. Writing for the Canadian Press, Nick Patch called the film \\"a sci-fi puzzler that seems to blend the paranoia of Terry Gilliam films with the nostalgia of classic Steven Spielberg flicks.\\"Nick Patch, The Canadian Press, Spike Jonze- directed Arcade Fire film not intended as political statement, Retrieved June 27, 2011 On June 16, the album was named as a longlisted nominee (one of 40) for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.

The band wore carrés rouges (red squares) to show support for the 2012 Quebec student protests. Arcade Fire recorded a song for The Hunger Games soundtrack (The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond), called \\"Abraham's Daughter\\". The song is featured in the movie's end credits. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200. It sold more than 175,000 copies in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It's the first theatrical film soundtrack to top the chart since Michael Jackson's \\"This Is It\\" debuted at No. 1 on the list. It is also only the 16th soundtrack to debut at No. 1 in the history of the Billboard 200 chart (those soundtracks include film, television, and straight-to-video efforts). Arcade Fire also contributed to the movie's original score, The Hunger Games: Original Motion Picture Score. The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled \\"Horn of Plenty\\", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film. \\"We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise,\\" Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. \\"And there’s an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It’s like the Capitol’s idea of itself, basically.\\" He further added that \\"it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [Hunger] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film.\\" Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to Spin Mobile, \\"'Horn of Plenty' sounds both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem.\\"  2013–2015: Reflektor  Arcade Fire and Mercury Records confirmed that they would release a fourth album in late 2013. In December 2012, the band's manager Scott Rodger confirmed that Arcade Fire was in the studio working with regular producer of the band Markus Dravs and James Murphy, frontman of LCD Soundsystem.

BPRC is the oldest research center at The Ohio State University.Byrd Polar Research Center The name was changed to the Byrd Polar Research Center in 1987 after the polar explorer and aviator Richard E. Byrd when Ohio State purchased the Byrd papers from the Byrd family in 1985. Admiral Byrd did not attend Ohio State nor did work for the university. The acquisition of the Byrd Papers was the impetus for creating a Polar Archival program. The name was subsequently changed to the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center to capture the scope of research conducted at the center. BPRC conducts interdisciplinary research at the nexus of Earth Sciences and Engineering. BPRC is known for its ice core paleoclimatology research collecting ice core records from Earth's highest and most remote ice fields and modeling polar climate variability.Science Ice Man: Lonnie Thompson Scales Peaks for ScienceScience Kilimanjaro Ice Core Records: Evidence of Holocene Climate Change in Tropical AfricaAnnals of Glaciology Tropical glaciers, recorders and indicators of climate change, are disappearing globally Studies at BPRC include paleoclimatology, remote sensing, polar meteorology, glacier dynamics, satellite hydrology, paleoceanography, environmental geochemistry, and climate change. BPRC houses the Polar Rock Repository and the Goldthwait Polar Library. Research Groups Environmental Geochemistry This Environmental Geochemistry group collects and analyzes soil and water samples from many locations around the world to study biogeochemical cycles, anthropogenic influences on natural systems, and to use geochemistry as a tool to learn more about various hydrological, biological and physical processes. This group has conducted studies of the Dry Valleys region of Antarctica since 1993 as part of the NSF’s Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program.National Science Foundation, McMurdo Dry Valley Site ProfileMcMurdo Dry Valleys LTER Webpage Ongoing projects in Antarctica include drilling into the subglacial ecosystem of \\"Blood Falls\\" in the Dry Valleys and measuring glacial melt input into the Southern Ocean in West Antarctica. The Environmental Geochemistry group is also investigating hydrologic flowpaths in Panama using geochemical tracers. Additionally, the group has studied of the deposition of mercury on the landscape in the U.S. and in Antarctica, and led investigations of chemical and physical weathering of rocks of high-standing oceanic islands like Taiwan and New Zealand. Members of this group also study the impact of human activities in urban areas on streams and lakes around Ohio. Paleoceanography The Paleoceanography group uses information gathered from sea floor sediments to discover how changes in circulation, temperature, sea ice and glacier mass have affected the global climate system throughout Earth’s history.Progress in Oceanography Past glacial and interglacial conditions in the Arctic Ocean and marginal seas – a review These data from the past are used to assess present and future climate changes. The main focus of this group's research is on the Arctic Ocean and its history during the past several million years. Sea floor sediments contain mineral and biological particles that are used for investigating past climate changes. A common type of biological particles is foraminifers, single-celled, amoeba-like protists that have a shell and either live on the sea bottom or float in the upper water column. There are an estimated 4,000 species living today. Foraminifers are sensitive to changes in their environment such as temperature and salinity, which makes them useful indicators (proxies) of past climate changes. Satellite Hydrology This group uses satellite-based measurements to study rivers, lakes, wetlands, and floodplains. Led by Profs. Douglas Alsdorf and Michael Durand, group members primarily use passive and active microwave measurements such as radar to measure surface water and snowpack. This group is working to better quantify the amount of water stored in snowpacks in the United States using satellite measurements. This group is helping define an upcoming satellite, Surface Water and Ocean Topography. Rivers are fundamentally two-dimensional in their structure and function. This is evident in the Amazon River, where the floodplain width is measured in kilometers. Sensitive to climatic changes, arctic lakes pose another hydrologic measurement challenge. SWOT measurements will enable new under- standing of these complex systems. SWOT will track freshwater resources, and measure ocean currents. SWOT is a joint effort between NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the French space agency, CNES. Glacier Environmental Change The Glacier Environmental Change group researches patterns, processes, and impacts of environmental change, mostly in glaciated regions.Water Resources Overview, Youtube Video, Big Ten Network We integrate methods of glacial geology, climatology, hydrology, and biogeochemistry.Journal of Glaciology Tropical glacier meltwater contribution to stream discharge: a case study in the Cordillera Blanca, PeruAdvances in Geosciences Characterizing contributions of glacier melt and groundwater during the dry season in a poorly gauged catchment of the Cordillera Blanca Peru Specializing in tropical mountain regions, we study sites along the entire American Cordillera, in Africa, and in Central Ohio. Glaciers impact environments and societies on different scales, from valleys to mountain ranges, spanning far into Earth’s past. Understanding glacier environmental changes requires many techniques and perspectives. Precise measurements from sensors on satellites and airplanes quantify ongoing glacier volume changes; landforms and lake sediments reveal past glacier-climate changes; the hydrochemistry of surface waters reflects glacier melt contribution; and computer simulations help explain past and future dynamics. Polar Meteorology The Polar Meteorology group has developed a model (Polar MM5) that is used to forecast weather conditions in the polar regions. The model has been used to stimulate conditions on the North American continent during the last ice age. In addition to weather prediction, the Polar MM5 model has been used for several simulations that examine the current and past climates over ice sheets, including one that illustrates conditions on the North American continent during the last ice age. The Polar Meteorology Group also used the MM5 model to create what is called the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (or AMPS).Monthly Weather Review Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS): A Case Study from the 2000–01 Field SeasonAmerican Meteorological Society Real-Time Forecasting for the Antarctic: An Evaluation of the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) AMPS is a forecasting system used to make weather forecasts for Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean in support of the United States Antarctic Program. Polar Rock Repository BPRC maintains a large, unique collection of geological samples and materials at the Polar Rock Repository. The PRR is a national facility that houses rock sample collections from Antarctica obtained by U.S. scientists over the past 40+ years. Dr. Anne Grunow is the curator of the Polar Rock Repository. It is the only facility of its kind in the United States. The facility has storage capacity of ~140,000 rock samples and more than 30,000 samples have been catalogued already. The sample collections are available for researchers, educators, and museums to use. An online database and educational materials are available to help educate the public about polar geology.  Greenland Field Studies  1980s photogrammetrist Henry Brecher conducted aerial photographic surveys of major Greenland glaciers. 1990s Dr. Ellen Mosley- Thompson obtained ice cores from multiple locations, including GITS. Dr. Ken Jezek conducted radar studies in Greenland's accumulation and ablation zone. In 1995, Ken Jezek was at Swiss Camp. 2005 Jason Box assists Konrad Steffen in automatic weather station maintenance at Swiss Camp and sites that comprise the Greenland Climate Network. Jason Box returned to Greenland to: 1.) obtain an ice core from a position in southeast Greenland where the Polar MM5 model simulates a maximum in snow accumulation, 2.) install time lapse cameras pointed at two outlet glaciers, and 3.) conduct supra-glacial melt lake measurements. 2007 In June, 2007, Jason Box establishes time lapse cameras beside 5 major west Greenland outlet glaciers. In July–September, Jason Box prepares for and occupies a camp near the Arctic Circle for 7 weeks during which time he conducts surface energy budget (melt) and supra-glacial melt lake measurements. 2008 During a 3-week field campaign, Jason Box, Ian Howat, Slawek Tulaczyk, and Yushin Ahn conduct measurements of Store Glacier, west Greenland. Dr. Ian Howat installed GPS sensors on Store Glacier in west Greenland. 2009 Jason Box installed time lapse cameras at Petermann Glacier in anticipation of a large area loss that eventually did occur August, 2010. 2010 April–May, 2010, Jason Box co-led a 750 km Arctic Circle Traverse across the southern Greenland ice sheet to obtain 3 ice cores and snow radar data to study spatial and temporal patterns of snowfall rates.  Antarctica  BPRC scientists have obtained ice cores from multiple locations on the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The Transantarctic Mountains bisect the continental ice sheets, with different ice flow dynamics on either side. Radarsat (radar images collected by orbiting satellites) is being used to map the ice sheets. Ice sheet flow into the ocean is increasing and in western Antarctica, the ice stream is draining into the Ross Ice Shelf with marked acceleration. In March 2000, the largest observed iceberg in history broke away from the Ross Ice Shelf.  Peru  The Qori Kalis Glacier in Peru, the main outlet of the Quelccaya Ice Cap, is in retreat. The terminus of the glacier has shown reduction since 1963, with dramatic increases since 1980.  Africa  Dr. Lonnie Thompson has led research expeditions to the glaciers atop Mount Kilimanjaro. At the present rate of Kilimanjaro glacier decline, it is predicted that the snow cover will be completely gone by 2020.

Its name originates from the fact that it lies at the northwestern extremity of Oldham, with Royton and Chadderton lying immediately north and west respectively. Boundary Park was originally known as the Athletic Ground when it was opened in 1896 for Oldham's first professional football club, Oldham County F.C.. When County folded in 1899, Pine Villa F.C. took over the ground and changed their name to Oldham Athletic. Oldham Athletic A.F.C. have played their home games here since the stadium was opened. Oldham RLFC left their traditional home, Watersheddings, in 1997 and moved to Boundary Park, although they briefly moved to Hurst Cross in Ashton-under-Lyne in 2002, where they played until 2009, when the football club decided that they no longer wanted them as tenants. Overview The Lookers Stand on the Broadway side was knocked down as part of a proposed redevelopment (see below). Oldham Borough Council confirmed planning approval for the new North Stand in April 2013. This will have capacity for 2,671 spectators, plus a health and fitness suite, supporters' bar and event facilities. The hardcore Oldham fans are usually considered to be in the Chadderton Road End (Chaddy End); a traditional, small, one-tiered stand. Opposite that is the Rochdale Road End, where one third of the stand is given to away supporters, and home fans the rest, except when the opposition has a large away following, when the situation is reversed. In these cases, season ticket holders have to be reallocated. The main stand has existed since the time when the stadium was originally built, and is a small two-tiered structure. Terracing disused since the conversion to an all-seater can still be seen towards the end of this stand. Capacity The stadium currently has an all-seated capacity of 13,512. It became an all- seater venue during the 1994–95 season - the season after Oldham Athletic's relegation from the top flight of English football. In the early days, the stadium could hold nearly 50,000 people. The highest crowd ever recorded at Boundary Park is 47,671, for an FA Cup tie between Oldham and Sheffield Wednesday in 1930. The highest attendance for a league match was also recorded during the same season against Blackpool, with 45,304 attending for the promotion clash. \\"Fantastic in Plastic\\" Inside Boundary Park In 1986 the club installed an artificial pitch in order to generate more income for the club and this coincided with the club's upturn in fortunes under manager Joe Royle. In 1987, the club reached the play-offs and in 1989–90 the club went through what is regarded as one of the club's greatest ever seasons, reaching the League Cup Final and the semi-final of the FA Cup, and the club claimed major upsets in defeating the likes of Arsenal, Southampton, Everton and Aston Villa. Critics felt that the pitch gave the club an advantage, but in 1991 Royle responded to this. When the Portsmouth manager declared that Oldham couldn't play away from home, Royle stuck the article to the dressing room door and the team responded with a 4–1 victory. At the end of the 1990–91 season the club secured promotion to the top flight, the final match on the plastic pitch was probably one of the most memorable games played at the ground when Latics, in order to win the old Second Division, had to beat Sheffield Wednesday and rely on West Ham losing. After 60 minutes of the game, Sheffield Wednesday were 2–0 up, but Ian Marshall pulled a goal back, then Paul Bernard equalised with less than ten minutes to play. By this point, West Ham were losing. In time added on, Andy Barlow went down in the box and the referee awarded a penalty. Neil Redfearn stepped up to convert it and a mass pitch invasion followed, as it had been confirmed that West Ham had lost 2–1 at home to Notts County. In gaining promotion to the top flight, Oldham Athletic were forced to have the plastic pitch removed because of league rules. They stayed in the top division for three seasons (1991–92, 1992–93 and 1993–94) before being relegated, and after three disappointing seasons in the second tier were relegated again in 1997. They remained in the third division, which was later called League One, until they were relegated at the end of the 2017–18 season. Records Boundary Park is anecdotally known as being the coldest ground in the Football League, earning the nickname coined by Joe Royle, Ice Station Zebra. It is also the third-highest stadium, at 509 feet (155m) above sea level, of any Premier League or Football League clubMidfield Dynamo Football Site after the Hawthorns, home of West Bromwich Albion, 551 feet (168m) and Vale Park, home of Port Vale, 525 feet (160m).  Redevelopment  Outside of the Boundary Park ground There were plans in the late 1990s for a move to a new 20,000 seater stadium on adjoining waste ground, but these were scrapped. On 15 February 2006, the club unveiled plans for the redevelopment of their current ground. The plans would see every stand other than the Rochdale Road End being redeveloped. When completed it would initially be a 16,000 seater stadium, estimated to cost £80 million, and with a working name of the \\"Oldham Arena\\". On 14 November 2007, Oldham Athletic received planning permission for the Broadway Stand, whilst Oldham Borough Council rejected the further development of the stadium due to local objections regarding the height and size of a proposed block of flats. On 12 December 2007, after amending the plans, another council meeting gave permission for redevelopment. Facilities would include conferencing and a hotel plus the option of a casino.\\"Oldham Arena\\" , Oldham Athletic official site, 14 January 2008 Demolition of the Broadway Stand started on 8 May 2008, with the work completed before the start of the new season. The building of the new stand was due to commence in December 2008 and was expected to take 16 months.\\"Latics ready to make a stand in summer\\", Carl Marsden, Oldham Advertiser, 5 March 2008 On 5 September 2008, Simon Blitz told podcast World Soccer Daily that although Oldham still planned to continue the development of Boundary Park and surrounding areas, the plans were on hold for now because of the financial crisis of 2007–2010 and the subsequent downturn in the UK property market. Because of these problems, the club announced in the summer of 2009 that it was considering moving to a new stadium in Failsworth. This caused some controversy amongst supporters as despite Failsworth being officially part of the borough, it has a Manchester postcode. It is also only three miles from the City of Manchester Stadium and only one mile from the proposed new stadium of F.C. United of Manchester in Moston, Manchester. If all went to according to plan, the new stadium was anticipated to be ready for the beginning of the 2011–12 season. After being led to believe by Oldham Council that the Failsworth site was a deliverable option, the club were extremely disappointed to hear that the Charities Commission had turned down their application. Oldham Athletic had wasted millions of pounds on drawing up plans, purchasing land and legal fees - and stated that 'confidence in the current council's ability to deliver any proposal for a new stadium is at zero.' On 28 July 2011 the council offered the club £5.7 million to help with their redevelopment fund of Boundary Park, which would involve the redevelopment of the Broadway Stand. Oldham Council confirmed planning approval for the new North Stand in April 2013, including a 2,671 capacity stand, a health and fitness suite, supporters' bar and event facilities. Demolition and preparatory work started in the summer of 2013. Construction of the new North Stand is still ongoing, although the seating area in the stand was open for use on 17 October 2015 for the home match against Sheffield United. The new North Stand is significantly taller than the stand that it replaced although the capacity for supporters is roughly the same. The additional height allows for office space, corporate hospitality, retail opportunities and a gymnasium.

The region has a population of 113,000 (2016),Population of Georgia with Ozurgeti as the regional capital. Geography Relief map of Guria Guria is bordered by Samegrelo to the north- west, Imereti to the north, Samtskhe-Javakheti to the east, Ajaria to the south, and the Black Sea to the west. The province has an area of . Guria is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude. Subdivisions Subdivision of Guria Guria is divided into 4 entities (3 municipalities and 1 city), including : *City of Ozurgeti *Ozurgeti Municipality *Lanchkhuti Municipality *Chokhatauri Municipality History Flag of the Principality of Guria The toponym \\"Guria\\" is first attested in the c. 800 Georgian chronicle of Pseudo-Juansher.Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, p. 427. Peeters Bvba, . Guria first appears c. 1352 as a fief of the house of Vardanidze-Dadiani; and after 1463 it became a sovereign principality independent of the Kingdom of Georgia under a branch of that house, known thereafter by the name of Gurieli. The principality, comprising modern Guria and much of Adjara with the city of Batumi, was subsequently reduced in size and devastated in a series of conflicts with the Ottoman Empire. A Russian protectorate was established by the treaty concluded on June 19, 1810 between Mamia V Gurieli and the empire, and in 1829, during the regency for the last prince, the Gurieli David, the principality was annexed by Russia.Yust, Walter (ed., 1952), The Encyclopædia Britannica - A new survey of universal knowledge. Volume 14, p. 6. There were uprisings against Russian rule in 1819 and again in 1841. In 1840, Guria was made a county (uyezd) and renamed Ozurgeti, after one of its main towns. In 1846, it was transferred to the new Kutais Governorate. By 1904, the population was just under 100,000, occupying an area of approximately of mountains and swampy valleys, covered by corn fields, vineyards, and some tea plantations. It was the most ethnically homogenous of Georgian areas, with the peasantry and lesser rural nobility making up almost the entire population, with a high level of literacy and relatively high degree of economic self-satisfaction. The peasant protest movement, which originated in 1902 and culminated in an open insurrection against the government during the Russian Revolution of 1905, was the most effective and organized peasant movement in the empire. The peasants’ self- government, the so-called Gurian Republic, survived into 1906, when it was crashed and Guria devastated by the Cossack punitive expedition.Stephen F. Jones (2005), Socialism in Georgian Colors: The European Road to Social Democracy, 1883-1917, pp. 131-2. Harvard University Press, . The region was a native powerbase of the Georgian Social Democratic (Menshevik) Party which dominated the Democratic Republic of Georgia from 1918 to 1921. Guria was a scene of guerrilla resistance to the militarily imposed Soviet rule early in the 1920s. Under the Soviet government, Guria was an agrarian area divided into three administrative districts. In 1995, the Georgian government decreed the creation of the region (mkhare) of Guria, restoring the province's historical name to official usage. The Orthodox churches of Likhauri and Shemokmedi are the main historical buildings in the province. Origin of the name \\"Guria\\" As for the etymology of the name of Guria, some say that the root of the word refers to restlessness and the word should mean “the land of the restless” and may be associated with events during the eighth and ninth centuries when “Leon became the King of Abkhazeti, Guruls refused to obey the ruler of Odzrakho, ceased their vassal relations with Adarnase and Ashot Bagrationi and united with Leon” as it was described in Vakhushti Bagrationi’s historical works of the eighteenth century. According to a later explanation, in the times of Georgia’s prosperity, when its borders stretched from \\"Nikopsia to Daruband\\", Guria was situated in the heart of the Georgian territory. The linguistic evidence for the above hypothesis is the Megrelian for “heart” – “guri”. Economy Subtropic farming and tourism are a mainstay of the region's economy. Water is one of Guria's main assets. The province is famous for the mineral water of Nabeglavi, which is similar to Borjomi in its chemical composition, and the Black Sea health resort of Ureki, which is rich in magnetic sand. Guria is also one of the largest tea growing regions in Georgia. Demographics Ethnic and religious groups According to the 2014 census, Guria has a population of 113.000 inhabitants, which accounts for 3.1% of the total population of Georgia. 98% of the population is ethnic Georgian (mostly native Gurians), 1% is ethnic Armenian and the remaining 1% is composed of Ossetians and Russians and the majority of the population is Orthodox Christians (86%), followed by Islam. Gurians A Gurian man. The Gurians or Gurulebi (Georgian: გურულები) is one of the ethnographical groups of Georgians, inhabiting Guria.

She was the third Navy ship named for the city of Richmond, Virginia. Built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Richmond was originally authorized on 29 August 1916, and awarded to William Cramp & Sons, Philadelphia on 30 July 1917. She was laid down on 16 February 1920, and launched on 29 September 1921, sponsored by Miss Elizabeth S. Scott. Richmond was commissioned on 2 July 1923, with Captain David F. Boyd in command. Characteristics Richmond was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew, during peace time, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men. Power plant Richmond was powered by four Parsons steam turbines geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 White-Forster boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but was only capable of at a speed of Original armament Richmonds main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After America's entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-in/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti- aircraft guns in single mounts. Richmond was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 mines, but these were removed early in her career to make way for more crew accommodations. She also carried two triple and two twin, above- water, torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull. The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast and the conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor. Richmond carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably Vought VE-9s until the early 1930s when the ship may have operated OJ-2 until 1935 and Curtiss SOC Seagulls until 1940 when Vought OS2U Kingfishers were used on ships without hangars. Armament changes During her career Richmond went through several armament changes, some of these changes were save weight, but others were to increase her AA armament. The lower torpedo tube mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3-inch guns to eight, all mounted in the ship's waist. After 1940, the lower aft 6-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. The ship's anti-aircraft armament were augmented by three twin Bofors guns along with 12 Oerlikon cannons by the end of the war. Inter-war period On completion of a three-month shakedown cruise to Europe, Africa, and South America, Richmond underwent post-shakedown availability and in December departed Norfolk for New Orleans. There, at the end of 1923, she became flagship of the Scouting Force. In early January 1924, she got underway to participate in Fleet Problem III which tested Caribbean defenses and transit facilities of the Panama Canal. On the 19th, she arrived off Veracruz, rescued survivors of , wrecked on Blanquilla Reef; then proceeded to Tampico to stand by as political tension rose. On the 26th, she headed for Galveston, only to return to Mexico on 3 February to evacuate refugees from Puerto Mexico and transport them to Veracruz. On the 17th, she headed east and joined in exercises off Puerto Rico. In May, Richmond returned briefly to New Orleans, then steamed for the northeast coast and further exercises. Toward the end of July she departed Newport, R.I., for duty as a station ship along the route of USAAS's first aerial circumnavigation of the world. On 2 August, she attempted to take in tow the Douglas World Cruiser \\"Boston\\", downed on the Atlantic Ocean after engine trouble, but the floatplane capsized in rough seas, although the two crew were rescued. Then, from September through December, she underwent overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. Richmond in 1923 during high speed trials In January 1925, Richmond, flagship of Light Cruiser Divisions, Scouting Fleet, again participated in Caribbean exercises. In February, she transited the Panama Canal and during March trained off the California coast. In April, she steamed to Hawaii for joint Army-Navy maneuvers, after which she joined the Battle Fleet for a good will cruise to Australia and New Zealand. Returning to Norfolk on 23 November, Richmond operated off the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean through 1926. On 1 February 1927, she again transited the Panama Canal; conducted exercises in Hawaiian waters; then continued on to China, arriving at Shanghai on 3 April. She remained on the China Station for a year, with only infrequent diversions to the Philippines for repairs and exercises. On 14 April 1928, she sailed eastward and less than three months later departed San Pedro, California, for Corinto, Nicaragua with a Navy Battalion embarked. On 25 July, she retransited the Panama Canal and for the next six years operated off the New England and mid-Atlantic coasts and in the Caribbean with occasional interruptions for fleet problems and exercises in the eastern Pacific. From September 1934 to December 1937, Richmond operated off the west coast as a unit of the Scouting Fleet. On 12 February 1935, she rescued 64 members of the crew of the downed airship USS Macon.Raiser, M. A., Associated Press, \\"Airship Macon Sinks In Pacific After 81 Rescued By Naval Craft\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 13 February 1935, Volume 41, page 1. After 21 December 1937, she served as flagship of the Submarine Force, and on 10 May 1938, she headed back to the east coast. On 26 August, she returned to San Diego and resumed her previous duty with the Submarine Force. In the winter of 1939 and the fall of 1940, she returned to the Atlantic for fleet and submarine exercises, and, at the end of December 1940, hauled down the flag of the Submarine Force. With the new year, 1941, Richmond shifted to Pearl Harbor; and, from January to June, served as flagship, Scouting Force. Into October, she remained in Hawaiian waters, operating with Cruiser Division 3 (CruDiv 3), then she returned to California and in November began Neutrality Patrols off the west coasts of the Americas. On 7 December, she was en route to Valparaíso, Chile. World War II Recalled from her original mission, she took up patrol off Panama and in 1942 commenced escorting reinforcement convoys to the Galápagos Islands and Society Islands. Later, returning to patrols from Panama to Chile, she put into San Francisco for overhaul in December and in January 1943 sailed for the Aleutians. Richmond arrived at Unalaska on 28 January 1943. On 3 February, she became flagship of Task Group 16.6 (TG 16.6), a cruiser-destroyer task group assigned to defend the approaches to recently occupied Amchitka. On the 10th, she underwent her first enemy air raid and on the 18th she participated in the initial bombardment of Holtz Bay and Chichagof Harbor, Attu Island. The force then resumed patrols to enforce the blockade of enemy installations on Attu and Kiska. In March, the Japanese decided to run the blockade and on the 22nd dispatched a force of two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, four destroyers, and three transports from Paramushiro. TG 16.6, one light cruiser, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers, intercepted the Japanese on the 26th approximately 180 mi (290 km) west of Attu and 100 mi (160 km) south of the Komandorski Islands. The Japanese sent the transports and one destroyer on, then turned to meet Richmonds force. At 0840, the Battle of the Komandorski Islands began. Initially firing on Richmond, the Japanese soon concentrated on , the only American ship with the firing range to reach them. In the running, retiring action which ensued and lasted until shortly after noon, Salt Lake City went dead in the water, but continued firing. Richmond went to her aid as the American destroyers closed the Japanese for a torpedo attack. The enemy, however, low on fuel and ammunition did not press their advantage. Changing course, they headed west, pursued by the American destroyers. Salt Lake City regained power after four minutes and Richmond joined the destroyers, but the action was broken off as the Japanese outdistanced TG 16.6. The transports sent ahead by the Japanese turned back for the Kuriles before reaching Attu. TG 16.6 had succeeded in its mission. In May, a week-long struggle resulted in the reoccupation of Attu by American forces. In August, Kiska became the target, and Richmond joined in the preinvasion bombardment. The landings took place on the 15th and met no resistance. The Japanese had pulled out undetected, before the end of July. On 24 August, Richmond departed the Aleutians; underwent overhaul at Mare Island; then returned to Kiska. Through the remainder of the year, she conducted patrols to the west of the outer Aleutians. On 4 February 1944, she began bombardment missions in the Kuriles which continued, alternated with antishipping sweeps, for the remainder of World War II. With the end of hostilities, Richmond covered the occupation of northern Japan. On 14 September 1945, she departed Ominato for Pearl Harbor, where she was routed on to Philadelphia for inactivation. Decommissioned on 21 December, Richmond was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 January 1946, and was sold on 18 December to the Patapsco Scrap Co., Bethlehem, Pa. Awards Richmond earned two battle stars for World War II service.

It is fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows migrating wildlife to move between the park and the adjacent Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry season. Nairobi National Park is negatively affected by increasing human and livestock populations, changing land use and poaching of wildlife. Despite its proximity to the city and its relative small size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population,Riley 2005, p.90 and is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries.  History  British colonists arrived in the area where the park is in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had plentiful wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve. The conservationist Mervyn Cowie was born in Nairobi. Returning to Kenya after a nine-year absence in 1932, he was alarmed to see that the amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled. Expanding farms and livestock had taken the place of the game. He later recalled this place as a paradise that was quickly disappearing. At this time, the area that would later become Nairobi National Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve. Hunting was not permitted in the reserve, but nearly every other activity, including cattle grazing, dumping, and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed. Cowie started to campaign for the establishment of a national park system in Kenya. The government formed a committee to examine the matter. Officially opened in 1946, Nairobi National Park was the first national park established in Kenya. Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created.Porteous 2001, p.132 Cowie was named as director of Nairobi National Park and held this position until 1966. In 1989, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi burned twelve tons of ivory on a site within the park. This event improved Kenya's conservation and wildlife protection image.Honey 1999, p.300  Geography  The park covers an area of and is small in comparison to most of Africa's national parks.Brett 1995, p.11 The park's altitude ranges between . It has a dry climate.Prins 2000, p.143 The park is the only protected part of the Athi-Kapiti ecosystem, making up less than 10% of this ecosystem.Prins 2000, p.142 The park has a diverse range of habitats and species. The park is located about from the Nairobi's centre. There is electric fencing around the park's northern, eastern, and western boundaries.Morell 1996 Its southern boundary is formed by the Mbagathi River. This boundary is not fenced and is open to the Kitengela Conservation Area (located immediately south of the park) and the Athi-Kapiti plains. There is considerable movement of large ungulate species across this boundary.  Flora  The park's predominant environment is open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands of the park have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river in the south of the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.  Fauna  A Masai giraffe in Nairobi National Park. The park has a large and diverse wildlife population. Species found in the park include African buffalo, baboon, eastern black rhinoceros, gazelle, Grant's zebra, cheetah, Coke's hartebeest, hippopotamus, African leopard, lion, common eland, impala, Masai giraffe, ostrich, vultures and waterbuck.Hodd 2002, p.115 Herbivores, including wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela conservation area and migration corridor to the south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species. A Rüppell's vulture in the park The David Sheldrick Trust runs a sanctuary in the park that hand-rears orphaned elephant and rhinoceros calves, and later releases them back into secure sanctuaries. Orphaned and sick animals are brought to the sanctuary from all over Kenya. The sanctuary is located close to the park's main entrance. It was opened in 1963. It was set up by Daphne Sheldrick after the death of her husband David Sheldrick, the anti-poaching warden of Tsavo National Park.Hodd 2002, p.115-117 Nairobi National Park is sometimes called Kifaru Ark, which means \\"Rhinoceros Sanctuary\\".Bailey 2007, p.60 It is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries, and it is one of only a few parks where visitors can be certain of seeing a black rhinoceros in its natural habitat.  Conservation  A giraffe in Nairobi National Park, with Nairobi's skyline in the background. Mervyn Cowie oversaw the development of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into the establishment of the parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948, 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.Prins 2000, p.164-165 Treaties with the Maasai in 1904 and 1911 forced them to give up all of their northern grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya. Some of the people that lost land there were resettled in the Kitengela area. The Maasai's pastoral life did not create any conflicts with the wildlife. Today the Kitengela's former Maasai group-ranches have been privatized and some of the land has been sold to farmers. Houses, cultivated plots, schools, shops, and bars are found on the Kitengela plains. Some of the park's revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park. Many Maasai landowners have formed the Kitengela Landowners Association, which works with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to both protect the wildlife and find benefits for the locals. The park and the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild herbivore populations. The plains to the south of the park are important feeding areas during the wet season.Prins 2000, p.165 Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.  Tourism and education  Nairobi National Park is the main tourist attraction for visitors to Nairobi. Visitor attractions include the park's diverse bird species, cheetah, hyena, leopard, and lion. Other attractions are the wildebeest and zebra migrations in July and August, the Ivory Burning Site Monument, and the Nairobi Safari Walk and animal orphanage. Inhabitants of Nairobi visit the park and thousands of Kenyan children on school field trips visit the park each week. The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has lectures and video shows about wildlife and guided tours of the park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.

Career He was born in Weston, Ontario and was a medical graduate at the University of Toronto. As a cancer researcher at the Banting and Best Medical Research Institute at University of Toronto, Franks developed an idea that resulted in the world's first anti- gravity suit or G-suit. Franks had noted that his test tubes often broke when subjected to severe centrifugal force. He had solved the problem by first inserting them into larger and stronger liquid-filled bottles. In 1940, the anti gravity suit was developed under the name Franks Flying Suit by Wilbur R. Franks and his colleagues at the Banting and Best Medical Research Institute at the University of Toronto. The suit was made with rubber and water-filled pads. It counteracted the effects of high G forces on aircraft pilots, which otherwise would cause them to black out. These suits were used during World War II and all G-Suits worn by air force pilots as well as astronauts and cosmonauts around the world are based on his original designs. When testing his first prototype, Franks stated: > \\"The suit had been cut to fit me perfectly, standing up. . . . In the > airplane I was sitting down, and when the pressure hit I thought it was > going to cut me in two. The idea became practical only when we realized that > great areas of the body could be left outside the fluid system.\\" In 1941 fellow Canadian scientist, Dr. Sir Frederick Banting, co-discoverer of insulin, died in a plane crash near Musgrave Harbour, Canada while on his way to England to assist Franks in the testing of the suit. Recognition and awards Wilbur Franks received an OBE for his work in early 1944 for giving \\"the Allied forces a tremendous tactical advantage\\" and \\"saving the lives of thousands of Allied fighter pilots.\\" With this invention, over five times more pilots survived than they would've without the G-suit. In 1984, Franks was inducted into Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame. Franks work was also noticed in the United States where he was awarded the Legion of Merit, the Theodore C. Lyster Award and the Eric Lilencrantz Award. Legacy There is a Wilbur R. Franks Award that is given by the Canadian Society of Aviation Medicine for contributions to aviation medicine.

Allport. 1931. Student Attitudes. Syracuse, N.Y.: Craftsman This is also described as \\"no one believes, but everyone thinks that everyone believes\\". Pluralistic ignorance is a bias about a social group, held by the members of that social group.Krech, David, and Richard S. Crutchfield. 1948. Theory and Problems of Social Psychology. New York: McGraw-Hill Pluralistic ignorance may help to explain the bystander effect. If no-one acts, onlookers may believe others believe action is incorrect, and may therefore themselves refrain from acting. Research Prentice and Miller found that, on average, private levels of comfort with drinking practices on campus were much lower than the perceived average. In the case of men, they found a shifting of private attitudes toward this perceived norm, a form of cognitive dissonance. Women, on the other hand, were found to have an increased sense of alienation on the campus but lacked the attitude change detected in men, presumably because norms related to alcohol consumption on campus are much more central for men than for women. Research has shown that pluralistic ignorance plagues not only those who indulge, but also those who abstain: from gambling, smoking and drinking and among some who follow vegetarianism. The latter has found that pluralistic ignorance can be caused by the structure of the underlying social network, not cognitive dissonance. The theory of pluralistic ignorance was studied by Floyd Henry Allport and his students Daniel Katz and Richard Schanck. He produced studies of racial stereotyping and prejudice, and attitude change, and his pursuit of the connections between individual psychology and social systems helped to found the field of organizational psychology. Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, in her spiral of silence theory, argued that media biases lead to pluralistic ignorance.Noelle-Neumann, Elisabeth (1993) The Spiral of Silence: Public Opinion – Our Social Skin (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Examples Pluralistic ignorance was blamed for exacerbating support for racial segregation in the United States. It has also been named a reason for the illusory popular support that kept the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in power, as many opposed the regime but assumed that others were supporters of it. Thus, most people were afraid to voice their opposition. Another case of pluralistic ignorance concerns drinking on campus in countries where alcohol use is prevalent at colleges and universities. Students drink at weekend parties and sometimes at evening study breaks. Many drink to excess, some on a routine basis. The high visibility of heavy drinking on campus, combined with reluctance by students to show any public signs of concern or disapproval, gives rise to pluralistic ignorance: Students believe that their peers are much more comfortable with this behavior than they themselves feel. Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\"Andersen, H.C. (1837). Andersen's Fairy Tales. Children's Classics. is a famous fictional case of pluralistic ignorance. In this story two con artists come into the Emperor's kingdom and convince him that they make the finest clothes in all of the land that can only be seen by anyone who was not stupid. The con artists continued to steal gold, silk and other precious items for their \\"unique creation\\". Out of fear for being seen as stupid, all of the emperor's men and townspeople kept silent about the fact they could not see the emperor's clothes until finally a small child comes forth and says that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes. Once the child is willing to admit that he cannot see any clothes on the emperor, the emperor and townspeople finally admit that the emperor has been tricked and that there was never an outfit being made. Pluralistic ignorance has also been blamed for large majorities of the public remaining silent on climate change—while 'solid majorities' of the American and UK public are concerned about climate change, most erroneously believe they are in the minority with their concern. It has been suggested that pollution-intensive industries have contributed to the public's underestimation of public support for climate solutions. For example, in the U.S., support for pollution pricing is high, yet public perception of public support is much lower. Men's conceptions of how they are expected to conform to norms of masculinity present additional examples of pluralistic ignorance. Specifically, most college age men are uncomfortable with other men \\"bragging about sexual acts and giving details,\\" but erroneously believe themselves to be in the minority for their discomfort. Similarly, college age men underestimate other men's \\"desire to make sure they have consent when sexually active\\". This \\"role-conflict\\" can have deleterious consequences for men's physical and mental health, as well as for society. Netflix's \\"Derren Brown: The Push\\" explores some aspects of these concepts. https://www.netflix.com/title/80220000 According to a 2020 study, the vast majority of young married men in Saudi Arabia express private beliefs in support of women working outside the home but they substantially underestimate the degree to which other similar men support it. Once they become informed about the widespread nature of the support, they increasingly help their wives obtain jobs. Consequences Pluralistic ignorance has been linked to a wide range of deleterious consequences. Victims of pluralistic ignorance see themselves as deviant members of their peer group: less knowledgeable than their classmates, more uptight than their peers, less committed than their fellow board members, less competent than their fellow nurses (see the Dunning-Kruger effect operating in the opposite direction). This can leave them feeling bad about themselves and alienated from the group or institution of which they are a part. In addition, pluralistic ignorance can lead groups to persist in policies and practices that have lost widespread support: This can lead college students to persist in heavy drinking, corporations to persist in failing strategies, and governments to persist in unpopular foreign policies. At the same time, it can prevent groups from taking actions that would be beneficial in the long run: actions to intervene in an emergency, for example, or to initiate a personal relationship. Pluralistic ignorance can be dispelled, and its negative consequences alleviated, through education. For example, students who learn that support for heavy drinking practices is not as widespread as they thought drink less themselves and feel more comfortable with the decision not to drink. Alcohol intervention programs now routinely employ this strategy to combat problem drinking on campus.Prentice, D. (2007). Pluralistic ignorance. In Encyclopedia of Social Psychology, Sage Publishing Retrieved from http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/socialpsychology/n402.xml Misconceptions Pluralistic ignorance can be contrasted with the false consensus effect. In pluralistic ignorance, people privately disdain but publicly support a norm (or a belief), while the false consensus effect causes people to wrongly assume that most people think like they do, while in reality most people do not think like they do (and express the disagreement openly). For instance, pluralistic ignorance may lead a student to drink alcohol excessively because she believes that everyone else does that, while in reality everyone else also wishes they could avoid binge drinking, but no one expresses that due to the fear of being ostracized. A false consensus for the same situation would mean that the student believes that most other people do not enjoy excessive drinking, while in fact most other people do enjoy that and openly express their opinion about it. A study undertaken by Greene, House, and Ross used simple circumstantial questionnaires on Stanford undergrads to gather information on the false consensus effect. They compiled thoughts on the choice they felt people would or should make, considering traits such as shyness, cooperativeness, trust, and adventurousness. Studies found that when explaining their decisions, participants gauged choices based on what they explained as \\"people in general\\" and their idea of \\"typical\\" answers. For each of the stories those subjects said that they personally would follow a given behavioral alternative also tended to rate that alternative as relatively probable for \\"people in general\\": those subjects who claimed that they would reject the alternative tended to rate it as relatively improbable for \\"people in general\\". It was evident that the influence of the subjects' own behavior choice affected the estimates of commonness. Although it would seem as if the two are built on the same premise of social norms, they take two very oppositional stances on a similar phenomenon. The false consensus effect considers that in predicting an outcome, people will assume that the masses agree with their opinion and think the same way they do on an issue, whereas the opposite is true of pluralistic ignorance, where the individual does not agree with a certain action but go along with it anyway, believing that their view is not shared with the masses (which is usually untrue).

Originally, Edge was a supporting character; a relatively sympathetic media mogul who acquired The Daily Planet and employed Clark Kent as a television journalist for his WGBS TV network. After the Crisis on Infinite Earth series led to a wholesale revision of the DC Universe, the character was revised as a supervillain, leader of the mob known as Intergang and one of Superman's enemies. Publication history Morgan Edge first appeared in Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #133 and was created by Jack Kirby. Kirby based his physical appearance on actor Kevin McCarthy, while his personality was inspired by television executive James T. Aubrey. According to Kirby's production assistant Mark Evanier, Kirby \\"wanted to explore the theme of organized crime gaining a foothold in corporate America - particularly a giant media conglomerate. Given the shady background of the company that acquired Warner Bros. and DC, it was something of an inside joke\\". However, under prodding from editorial staff who preferred Edge to be an ongoing supporting character rather than a villain who would ultimately have to be brought to justice (and thus written out of the series), the \\"Morgan Edge\\" connected to Intergang was revealed to be an imposter. Fictional character biography Pre-Crisis In his original incarnation, Edge was the president of the Galaxy Broadcasting System (owners of television station WGBS), the media corporation which eventually bought the Daily Planet. Edge was in many ways a stereotype of a ruthless capitalist, intervening in the Planets homey atmosphere and challenging the authority of the somewhat older Perry White, but he was a decent man who had moments of good-heartedness and maintained reasonably friendly relationships with most of his employees, including Clark Kent. Following the takeover of the Planet, Edge transferred Kent to the news division, making him a traveling correspondent and later anchorman on WGBS. This move added several TV co- workers to the Superman supporting cast, including fretful producer Josh Coyle, sports broadcaster Steve Lombard, weather forecaster Oscar Asherman, and co-anchor Lana Lang (who had been one of Clark's childhood friends in Smallville). As one of the wealthiest men in Metropolis, Edge was a major political figure in the city and frequently encountered Superman, the subject of many of his network's news stories, whom he, like most others, failed to realize was also Clark Kent. Although rarely integral to a plotline, Edge was a supporting character in many Superman stories. For a while it appeared that Edge was connected to the Apokolips-sponsored crime organisation Intergang, but this was revealed to be a clone created by the 'Evil Factory', a genetics laboratory working for Darkseid.Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #152 (September 1972) For example, this clone attempted to have Jimmy Olsen, the Guardian and, incidentally, a random Daily Planet employee named Goody Rickels, a Don Rickles lookalike, murdered as part of a cover-up.Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #139 (August 1971) In a back-up story in Action Comics #468 (February 1977), it was revealed that Morgan Edge's birth name was Morris Edelstein. After he won his first TV station in a game of poker, he changed his name to Morgan Edge and kept the details of his past closely guarded. Post-Crisis When DC continuity was rebooted after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Edge remained president of WGBS, but his ties to the Planet and friendship with Superman were retconned away, and he was genuinely connected to Intergang. He was eventually exposed by the Daily Planet, in articles by Clark Kent and Cat Grant, who was working for WGBS undercover. Edge was imprisoned, but even managed to cause trouble there by publishing his autobiography On the Edge, which dumped upon his father as well as Cat Grant, revealing that she slept her way into a scoop. After his release from jail, Morgan Edge returned as sponsor of the Superman Revenge Squad. Prior to his imprisonment, one of his actions generated much fan anger, in which Edge sadistically and gleefully ran over a raccoon on the road, prompting one fan to write in saying \\"Lex Luthor treats people like animals, but even he does not run them over intentionally\\". Recently, Morgan Edge has resurfaced as a powerful media pundit, with the show Edge of Reason, where he gives off anti-Kryptonian spin for General Lane. He is also seen in a \\"flash-forward\\" panel in Adventure Comics #1, making a mysterious deal with Despero. The New 52 In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Morgan Edge appears as a powerful and self-centered media mogul and the new owner of the Daily Planet, he is seen as the sponsor of the Challengers of the Unknown program before they all leave due to his ruthless business strategy. This version of Morgan Edge is depicted as a bald African American man with a goatee.Superman vol. 3 #1 (Oct. 2011) Although a tough businessman, Edge did recognize talent, and awarded Lois Lane the editorship of the Daily Planet. Edge's multiple media holdings become a benefit to Superman as Lois Lane, now director of Edge's Metropolis news station, has said building's security cameras \\"hacked\\" to provide vital intelligence on a rampaging villain.Superman vol. 3 #2 (Dec. 2011) Prior to DC Rebirth, in the last issue of the 2011 Justice League series, it is mentioned that Lex Luthor had bought the Daily Planet from him.Justice League Vol. 2 #52 In other media Television * In the Super Friends animated series, his company the Galaxy Broadcasting Company, and its mother conglomerate Galaxy Communications are both referenced in the series, although he never actually appeared in the show. * In Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, a character similar to Morgan Edge is named Bill Church, Jr. (portrayed by Bruce Campbell). He appeared as the head of the \\"Intergang\\" crime organization. His father Bill Church, Sr. was played by Peter Boyle and he had a wife Mindy Church, who was played by Jessica Collins. Like Morgan Edge, Bill Church, Jr. owned a TV station, which was called \\"Multiworld Communications\\" instead of the comics' \\"Galaxy Communications\\". This character was an amalgamation of Morgan Edge and Bruno Mannheim. * Morgan Edge has appeared in Justice League episode \\"Secret Society\\" Pt. 1 voiced by an uncredited Brian George. Edge is portrayed as a billionaire collector of unique oddities, but one who has no moral qualms against collecting sentient beings as if they were property, as he does with Clayface. Gorilla Grodd and his Secret Society broke into his mansion to free Clayface from his prison. He attempted to flee on a boat while disguised as a chef, but Killer Frost froze the water and Morgan's alligator shoes gave away his identity to the Secret Society. Gorilla Grodd had him lead them to where Clayface was stored. As the other Secret Society members enter the room, Killer Frost (off screen) entraps Morgan Edge in ice, presumably freezing him to death. * Morgan Edge is a recurring villain in Smallville initially played by Rutger Hauer in the first appearance, and later by Patrick Bergin. He has appeared as a Metropolis crime lord, and old friend of Lionel Luthor. In the episode \\"Exile\\", Clark Kent stole the money from a bank while one of Edge's gangs were in the middle of a heist. Edge approached Clark in his apartment and offered him a job. At first Clark turned him down, but after Lana found him, he decided he could use the money to disappear and meets Edge to accept his offer. Edge asked him to break into Lionel's LuthorCorp office and steal a package from a titanium reinforced safe. Clark later learned that the item he stole was the blood sample taken by Helen Bryce. Jonathan Kent destroyed it immediately. Edge came to Smallville and demanded the package. Clark told him that he didn't have it, but Edge took Jonathan and Martha Kent hostage to force Clark to give it to him. Clark used a piece of green meteor rock to cut his arm and give him a new sample. Edge returned the blood to Lionel and told him that he could provide him with the source. Lionel was very interested because he did not know the source. Edge's thugs brought Clark to Metropolis in the back of a truck for the hand off, but Clark used his heat vision to create an explosion, which destroyed the truck. Lionel believed that Edge set him up to be killed. Edge fell into the water after being shot by Lionel's security, where he was presumed dead. Morgan survived, however, and was found by Lex Luthor. This time, Edge had received plastic surgery in order to hide from Lionel. Edge ultimately confesses, on tape, to the murder of Lionel's parents, but ultimately conspires with Lionel to break Lex's fragile psyche and discredit his testimony. Lex eventually tracks down Edge, also shooting him, but he manages to escape. In one last attempt, Edge attempts to kill Lex using his car, but is shot several times and killed before he has a chance to do so. * Morgan Edge is a recurring character in the third season of Supergirl, portrayed by Adrian Pasdar. In the episode \\"Girl of Steel\\", Edge has led a successful restoration of National City following the Daxamite invasion. He also wants to tear down the city's waterfront slum and replace it with high rise buildings, and he secretly employs the tech-mercenary Bloodsport to destroy the area with a cloaked submarine. The attack is stopped by Supergirl, although there is no evidence proving Edge's involvement. Edge also tries to buy Catco out from under Cat Grant (who has become White House Press Secretary) to silence his critics. However, Lena Luthor buys the company before Edge does.http://ew.com/recap/supergirl-season-3-premiere/ In \\"Damage\\", a company of his poisons kids in swimming pools making the doctors think it's lead poisoning. Edge says it is a result of Lena's solution to get rid of the Daximites. After an attempt on Lena's life and killing his accomplice, Morgan Edge used a loophole upon his confrontation by Supergirl stating that the man he killed had used him to frame Lena Luthor and she did National City a favor. In \\"Reign\\", Morgan Edge and Lena Luthor still have tension against each other; Edge also becomes a target of Reign, but he survives. In the episode \\"For Good\\", Lilian Luthor targets Morgan Edge for poisoning Lena. While Supergirl defeats Lilian (who was wearing a version of her son's Lexosuit in battle), Winn Schott Jr. and Jimmy Olsen defeat Morgan Edge. As both Lilian and Morgan are arrested by the authorities, Morgan shouts that they have nothing on him. Film * WGBS News can be seen in Man of Steel.

Description The original HeroQuest was an adventure board game created in 1989 by Milton Bradley in conjunction with the British company Games Workshop. Later the same year, Games Workshop released Advanced HeroQuest, a similar but more complex game. Changes from HeroQuest include more complex and RPG-like rules, a modular board and the use of henchmen. The included quests feature the heroes entering a Skaven-infested dungeon in order to retrieve a magical artifact. While the only monsters included in the miniatures set are the rat men known as Skaven, statistics for all the monsters that appear in the HeroQuest game are given, and it is possible to meet some or all of them via the random generation encounter tables. Contents The boxed set includes: * 64-page rule book that includes four introductory scenarios * 42 plastic 25 mm miniatures and doors * 78 counters and interlocking room and corridor sections that are combined to produce modular maps Gameplay The game uses 12-sided dice for skill and combat resolution. Both heroes and monsters are defined by Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, Toughness, Wounds, Speed, Intelligence, and Bravery. Combat is resolved in melee by rolling a target figure that is determined by the difference between the target's and player's Weapon Skills; in ranged combat, the target number is determined by how far away the target is versus the character's Ballistic Skill. In both cases, if the target number is achieved, the attacker rolls a number of dice determined by Strength and what weapon was being used. The number of dice that exceed the opponent's Toughness becomes the number of Wounds inflicted. Expansion An expansion to Advanced HeroQuest called Terror In The Dark was released in 1991, adding new monsters, treasures and spells. The included quest featured the heroes being pitted against the Lichemaster, one of the adversaries from the original HeroQuest. Reception In the January 1990 edition of Games International (Issue 12), Philip A. Murphy's original impression was that this was exactly the same game as the original HeroQuest, albeit produced by Games Workshop rather than Milton-Bradley. Nevertheless he admired the production values, calling all the components \\"a true delight and all other producers [...] could learn a lesson from GW's attention to quality components.\\" However, Murphy did not like \\"the constant references, by word and image, to Warhammer this, Warhammer that, Citadel miniatures, Citadel paints, future supplements and White Dwarf magazine.\\" While he felt that the original game by Milton-Bradley \\"had been rushed out of production [...] and could have been much better with more playtesting\\", Murphy felt that Advanced HeroQuest had the opposite problem, calling it \\"overproduced and a tad too complex.\\" He concluded by giving the game an average rating of 3 out of 5, saying \\"it should be magnificent, and indeed at times it is. But just as often, it's a great disappointment.\\" The German website Spielphase gave the game a rating of 5 out of 6, saying, \\"You get a lot of material for your money. [...] Even if I'm not a big fan of role- playing games or thematically related board games, I have to acknowledge that a reality is represented quite well by tables and a varied game is possible over a long period of time.\\" References See also * Warhammer Quest External links * Advanced Heroquest Rulebook PDF *MK Games Advanced Heroquest Fan Page Based on images found at this page at BoardGameGeek.com Category:Board games introduced in 1989 Category:Cooperative board games Category:Games Workshop games ","title":"Advanced HeroQuest"},{"id":"1098781","text":"The Uttoxeter Canal was a thirteen-mile extension of the Caldon Canal running from Froghall as far as Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, England. It was authorised in 1797, but did not open until 1811. With the exception of the first lock and basin at Froghall, it closed in 1849, in order that the Churnet Valley line of the North Staffordshire Railway could be constructed along its length. The railway has since been dismantled and there are plans to reinstate the canal. History The Uttoxeter Canal was promoted by the Trent and Mersey Canal Company and authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1797.Canal to Nowhere, Jim Shead, Waterways World March 2006 This was a political move, designed to prevent a rival scheme for a canal to Uttoxeter. The planned Commercial Canal was intended to link the Chester Canal at Nantwich to the Ashby Canal at Moira, passing through Stoke-on-Trent and Uttoxeter, and would have had a serious impact on the profitability of the Trent and Mersey Company if it had been built. Powers to alter the proposed route at Alton were included in an act of Parliament obtained in 1802, but because the new canal was not expected to be profitable, construction was delayed. Ten years after the Act was passed, work began under the direction of the canal engineer John Rennie, with the canal opening on 3 September 1811. It is sometimes referred to as a branch of the Caldon Canal. 19 locks were required to drop the level of the canal as it passed down the valley of the River Churnet. Froghall Basin was the transshipment point for limestone brought from Caldon Low quarries, a few miles to the east. The limestone was carried along a plate tramway, one of the first to use iron rails, which was built in 1758. The tramway was rebuilt on a new alignment in 1785, and completely rebuilt in 1800. In 1849, it was replaced by a cable railway. Three locomotives worked the tracks at Froghall Basin, named Toad, Frog and Bobs. The quarries ceased operation in 1920. There was a proposal to construct a branch to Ashbourne, and another in 1839 to extend the canal along the Dove Valley to link up with the Trent and Mersey Canal, but no details of the precise routes have survived. The canal was not a financial success, and the Trent and Mersey Company made plans to close it. However, the canal company was taken over by the North Staffordshire Railway, and with the exception of the first lock and the basin at Froghall, which remained in use until about 1930, the canal was closed by the railway company on 15 January 1849. A large part of it was subsequently filled in, and used for the route of the Churnet Valley railway line (which incidentally, although it is now dismantled, had the first automatic, train-operated level-crossing in the UK, at Spath, just outside Uttoxeter.) A few bridges from the Uttoxeter Canal still exist, with the occasional milepost visible, including two which have been relocated to the bowling green in Denstone village. Very little can be seen of the canal in Uttoxeter, but there is still evidence it existed, as there is an area called \\"The Wharf\\". Restoration The Caldon and Uttoxeter Canals Trust is looking at the feasibility of restoring the canal from Froghall to Uttoxeter. The situation is complicated by the fact that the revived Churnet Valley Railway terminates at Froghall, and they were originally going to reopen the railway to Oakamoor, but they are currently engaged in extending their line at the opposite end towards Leek. If the canal is reopened, the original route is now occupied by the JCB factory at Rocester, and so there is a proposal to construct a new route from Denstone which would follow the River Churnet more closely to a new terminus near the Uttoxeter gravel pits, which are nearly worked out. The first lock and Froghall basin have been restored and were opened in July 2005.

The game is a simplified re-release of the earlier publication, The Warlord. Apocalypse went out of print during the 1980s, but The Warlord was re-released in 2012. Gameplay The game is conceptually similar to Risk but played on a map of Western Europe (the original covered Eastern Europe as well), and unlike Risk allows simulation of nuclear weapons. A novel concept in the game is that rather than rolling dice to resolve combat, the attacking player conceals a die beneath a cup and the defender must attempt to guess the number which is displayed. The attacker is constrained from selecting certain numbers depending on the circumstances of the combat. This system brings a psychological element to the game: selecting a large number (up to the size of the attacking army) will enable a successful attack to move more units into the area, possibly able to continue to attack another area, but will increase the attacker's losses should the defender guess correctly. Legacy A computer game version, Apocalypse: The Game of Nuclear Devastation, was published by Red Shift under license from Games Workshop. It was released in 1983 for the ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro. Reception David Ladyman reviewed Apocalypse in The Space Gamer No. 39. Ladyman commented that \\"The graphics and component design are up to Games Workshop's usual high standard. The rules are short and clear. I would consider recommending Apocalypse if an equivalent game wasn't on the market at a cheaper price. Risk, as I said above, is very similar\\". John Olsen reviewed Apocalypse for White Dwarf #26, giving it an overall rating of 9 out of 10, and stated that \\"Apocalypse is a superb game and I would award it a 10 unhesitatingly, except that many games take a long time to finish.\\" References External links * Category:Board games introduced in 1980 Category:Board wargames Category:Games Workshop games ","title":"Apocalypse (board game)"},{"id":"1098795","text":"Frances Ridley Havergal (14 December 1836 – 3 June 1879) was an English religious poet and hymnwriter. Take My Life and Let it Be and Thy Life for Me (also known as I Gave My Life for Thee) are two of her best known hymns. She also wrote hymn melodies, religious tracts, and works for children. She did not occupy, and did not claim for herself, a prominent place as a poet, but she carved out a niche for herself. Early life and education Frances Ridley Havergal was born into an Anglican family, at Astley in Worcestershire, 14 December 1836. Her father, William Henry Havergal (1793–1870), was a clergyman, writer, composer, and hymnwriter. Her brother, Henry East Havergal, was a priest in the Church of England and an organist. When she was five, her father removed to the Rectory of St. Nicholas, Worcester. In August, 1850, she entered Mrs. Teed's school, who had a strong influence on her. In the following year she says, \\"I committed my soul to the Saviour, and earth and heaven seemed brighter from that moment.\\" A short sojourn in Germany followed. In 1852/3, she studied in the Louisenschule, Düsseldorf, and at Oberkassel. Havergal's scholastic acquirements were extensive, embracing several modern languages, together with Greek and Hebrew. On her return to England, she was confirmed in Worcester Cathedral, 17 July 1853. Career In 1860, she left Worcester upon her father resigning the Rectory of St. Nicholas, and resided at different periods in Leamington, and at Caswell Bay, Swansea, broken by visits to Switzerland, Scotland, and North Wales. It was during this time—1873—that she read J. T. Renford's little booklet All For Jesus, which \\"lifted her whole life into sunshine, of which all she had previously experienced was but as pale and passing April gleams, compared with the fullness of summer glory.\\" She led a quiet life, not enjoying consistent good health. She supported the Church Missionary Society. Havergal's hymns were frequently printed by J. & R. Parlane as leaflets, and in Caswall & Co. as ornamental cards. They were gathered together from time to time and published in her works as follows:— (1) Ministry of Song, 1869; (2) Twelve Sacred Songs for Little Singers, 1870; (3) Under the Surface, 1874; (4) Loyal Responses, 1878; (5) Life Mosaic, 1879; (6) Life Chords, 1880; and (7) Life Echoes, 1883. About fifteen of the more important of Havergal's hymns, including “Golden harps are sounding,” “I gave my life for thee,\\" “Jesus, Master, Whose I am,” “Lord, speak to me,” “O Master, at Thy feet,” “Take my life and let it be,” “Tell it out among the heathen,\\" &c.;, are annotated under their respective first lines. The rest, which are in collections, number nearly fifty. These are noted here, together with dates and places of composition, from the Havergal manuscripts and the works in which they were published. Those which were printed in Parlane's Series of Leaflets are distinguished as (P., 1872, &c.;) and those in Caswall's series (C., 1873, &c;). Most of these hymns are given in Snepp's Songs of Grace and Glory, 1872 and 1876, his †. 1874, and the Musical ed., 1880, and many of them are also in several other hymn-books, including H. A. & M., Thring, Church Hys., Hy. Comp., &c.;, and some of the leading American collections. Death and legacy Memorial plaque situated near Caswell Bay Astley, Worcestershire, St Peter's Church: grave of Frances Ridley Havergal and of her father William Henry Havergal Havergal died of peritonitis near Caswell Bay on the Gower Peninsula in Wales at age 42. She is buried in the far western corner of the churchyard at St Peter's parish church, Astley, together with her father and near her sister, Maria Vernon Graham Havergal.A Guide and History of the Parish Church of St Peter. Astley, Worcestershire (2010), p. 20 Her sisters saw much of her work published posthumously. Havergal College, a private girls' school in Toronto, is named after her. The composer Havergal Brian adopted the name as a tribute to the Havergal family. Style and themes Her hymns praised the love of God, and His way of salvation to this end, and for this object, her whole life and all her powers were consecrated. She lived and spoke in every line of her poetry. Her religious views and theological bias were distinctly set forth in her poems, and may be described as mildly Calvinistic, without the severe dogmatic tenet of reprobation. The burden of her writings was a free and full salvation, through the Redeemer's merits, for every sinner who will receive it, and her life was devoted to the proclamation of this truth by personal labours, literary efforts, and earnest interest in Foreign Missions.

The eldest son of the 17th Earl of Derby, he held minor political office before being appointed Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in 1938, sitting in the cabinet alongside his brother Oliver Stanley. However, Stanley died only five months after this appointment, aged 44; his eldest son, Edward John Stanley, later succeeded to the earldom in his stead. Background and education Stanley was born in Marylebone, London, the eldest son and heir apparent of Edward Stanley, later to become 17th Earl of Derby, by Lady Alice Montagu. He was spectacularly well-connected to leading political families. His father was at the time of Stanley's birth Conservative MP for Westhoughton, Lancashire, and went on to serve as Secretary of State for War from 1916 to 1918 and from 1922 to 1924. His paternal grandfather, the 16th Earl of Derby, was a former Lancashire MP, Colonial Secretary, and Governor-General of Canada. His great-uncle, the 15th Earl, twice served as Foreign Secretary and was Prime Minister Lord Salisbury's stepfather, while his best-known ancestor was his great- grandfather, the 14th Earl, who was Leader of the Conservative Party for 22 years (1846–1868; the longest tenure in that office) and Prime Minister three times (1852, 1858–59, and 1866–68). His paternal grandmother, Lady Constance Villiers, was daughter of Lord Clarendon, who himself served on three occasions as Foreign Secretary. Lord Stanley's uncles Sir Arthur and Sir George also served as Conservative MPs. His maternal grandfather was William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester, also a Conservative peer and MP. His maternal grandmother Louisa von Alten married after the death of the Duke of Manchester, Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, also known as Lord Hartington, who for a time (before inheriting his peerage) was Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons. His sister Victoria married Neil Primrose, the son of Liberal Prime Minister Lord Rosebery. Oliver Stanley was his younger brother, and his son Richard became an MP. He became known by the courtesy title Lord Stanley in 1908, when his father succeeded in the earldom of Derby. He was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford.thepeerage.com Rt. Hon. Sir Edward Montagu Cavendish Stanley, Lord Stanley Military career Lord Stanley was commissioned a second lieutenant on 2 July 1914. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards on 15 November 1914, later with seniority from 3 November 1914, and became a substantive lieutenant on 11 November 1914. On 29 January 1916, he was made a supernumerary temporary captain with the Guards, relinquishing the rank on 12 May 1916. Lord Stanley was appointed adjutant of the newly formed Household Battalion on 9 September 1916, again as a temporary captain. He received a substantive captaincy on 26 September 1916 and served as adjutant until 12 January 1917. He was appointed a staff captain and seconded on 13 August 1917, and made a brigade major on 22 January 1918, a post he held until 11 March 1918. He served as a general staff officer, 3rd grade, from 6 May 1918 to 8 October 1918. On 9 October 1918, he was again appointed a brigade major, serving in that capacity until 2 November 1919. Lord Stanley was awarded the Military Cross on 3 June 1919, for his service in Italy. On 27 November 1920, he retired from the Army and entered the reserve of officers as a captain. Political career Lord Stanley was first elected to Parliament on 28 June 1917 in a by-election in Liverpool Abercromby. He left Parliament the following year, when the seat was abolished for the 1918 general election. During this time, he was the Baby of the House. He returned to Parliament in the 1922 general election when he was elected for Fylde. He served under Stanley Baldwin as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1924 to 1927 and was a Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1927 to 1929. On the formation of the National Government after the 1931, Stanley was made Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty under Ramsay MacDonald. On 26 February 1934, he was admitted to the Privy Council. In 1935 he was made Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs by Baldwin, and later that year was made Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty. Two years later, Lord Stanley became Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma. On 16 May 1938 he entered the cabinet as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. His brother, Oliver, was also in the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. However, in October 1938, five months after being appointed to the cabinet, Lord Stanley died in Marylebone, aged 44. Neville Chamberlain paid tribute to him in the House of Commons: \\"So great, indeed, was his keenness and his interest in Imperial relations that he insisted on carrying out his intention to visit Canada, although even then he was suffering from the disease which has now ended fatally. Perhaps in that office he would have, for the first time, found an opportunity of showing the full extent of his powers, for those who knew him best had long recognised that he possessed to an exceptional degree the high qualities of steady judgment and sterling good sense, combined with a complete and utter selflessness and integrity of purpose.\\"theyworkforyou.com House of Commons debates, 1 November 1938 Family Lord Stanley married the Honourable Sibyl Louise Beatrix Cadogan, daughter of Henry Cadogan, Viscount Chelsea, in 1917; they had three sons. He died in Marylebone, London, in October 1938, aged 44, predeceasing his father by ten years. His eldest son Edward succeeded his grandfather in the earldom in 1948. Another son, Richard, later became MP for Fylde North. Lady Stanley died in June 1969, aged 76.

These computer programs are complex tree structures that learn and adapt by changing their sizes, shapes, and composition, much like a living organism. And like living organisms, the computer programs of GEP are also encoded in simple linear chromosomes of fixed length. Thus, GEP is a genotype–phenotype system, benefiting from a simple genome to keep and transmit the genetic information and a complex phenotype to explore the environment and adapt to it. Background Evolutionary algorithms use populations of individuals, select individuals according to fitness, and introduce genetic variation using one or more genetic operators. Their use in artificial computational systems dates back to the 1950s where they were used to solve optimization problems (e.g. Box 1957Box, G. E. P., 1957. Evolutionary operation: A method for increasing industrial productivity. Applied Statistics, 6, 81–101. and Friedman 1959Friedman, G. J., 1959. Digital simulation of an evolutionary process. General Systems Yearbook, 4, 171–184.). But it was with the introduction of evolution strategies by Rechenberg in 1965 that evolutionary algorithms gained popularity. A good overview text on evolutionary algorithms is the book \\"An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms\\" by Mitchell (1996). Gene expression programming belongs to the family of evolutionary algorithms and is closely related to genetic algorithms and genetic programming. From genetic algorithms it inherited the linear chromosomes of fixed length; and from genetic programming it inherited the expressive parse trees of varied sizes and shapes. In gene expression programming the linear chromosomes work as the genotype and the parse trees as the phenotype, creating a genotype/phenotype system. This genotype/phenotype system is multigenic, thus encoding multiple parse trees in each chromosome. This means that the computer programs created by GEP are composed of multiple parse trees. Because these parse trees are the result of gene expression, in GEP they are called expression trees. Encoding: the genotype The genome of gene expression programming consists of a linear, symbolic string or chromosome of fixed length composed of one or more genes of equal size. These genes, despite their fixed length, code for expression trees of different sizes and shapes. An example of a chromosome with two genes, each of size 9, is the string (position zero indicates the start of each gene): :\`012345678012345678\` : :\`L+a-baccd**cLabacd\` where “L” represents the natural logarithm function and “a”, “b”, “c”, and “d” represent the variables and constants used in a problem. Expression trees: the phenotype As shown above, the genes of gene expression programming have all the same size. However, these fixed length strings code for expression trees of different sizes. This means that the size of the coding regions varies from gene to gene, allowing for adaptation and evolution to occur smoothly. For example, the mathematical expression: :\\\\sqrt{(a-b)(c+d)} \\\\, can also be represented as an expression tree: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP expression tree, k-expression Q*-+abcd.png |} where \\"Q” represents the square root function. This kind of expression tree consists of the phenotypic expression of GEP genes, whereas the genes are linear strings encoding these complex structures. For this particular example, the linear string corresponds to: :\`01234567\` : :\`Q*-+abcd\` which is the straightforward reading of the expression tree from top to bottom and from left to right. These linear strings are called k-expressions (from Karva notation). Going from k-expressions to expression trees is also very simple. For example, the following k-expression: :\`01234567890\` : :\`Q*b**+baQba\` is composed of two different terminals (the variables “a” and “b”), two different functions of two arguments (“*” and “+”), and a function of one argument (“Q”). Its expression gives: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP expression tree, k-expression Q*b**+baQba.png |} K-expressions and genes The k-expressions of gene expression programming correspond to the region of genes that gets expressed. This means that there might be sequences in the genes that are not expressed, which is indeed true for most genes. The reason for these noncoding regions is to provide a buffer of terminals so that all k-expressions encoded in GEP genes correspond always to valid programs or expressions. The genes of gene expression programming are therefore composed of two different domains – a head and a tail – each with different properties and functions. The head is used mainly to encode the functions and variables chosen to solve the problem at hand, whereas the tail, while also used to encode the variables, provides essentially a reservoir of terminals to ensure that all programs are error-free. For GEP genes the length of the tail is given by the formula: :t = h(n_\\\\max-1)+1 where h is the head's length and nmax is maximum arity. For example, for a gene created using the set of functions F = {Q, +, −, *, /} and the set of terminals T = {a, b}, nmax = 2. And if we choose a head length of 15, then t = 15 (2–1) + 1 = 16, which gives a gene length g of 15 + 16 = 31. The randomly generated string below is an example of one such gene: :\`0123456789012345678901234567890\` : :\`*b+a-aQab+//+b+babbabbbababbaaa\` It encodes the expression tree: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP expression tree, k-expression *b+a-aQa.png |} which, in this case, only uses 8 of the 31 elements that constitute the gene. It's not hard to see that, despite their fixed length, each gene has the potential to code for expression trees of different sizes and shapes, with the simplest composed of only one node (when the first element of a gene is a terminal) and the largest composed of as many nodes as there are elements in the gene (when all the elements in the head are functions with maximum arity). It's also not hard to see that it is trivial to implement all kinds of genetic modification (mutation, inversion, insertion, recombination, and so on) with the guarantee that all resulting offspring encode correct, error-free programs. Multigenic chromosomes The chromosomes of gene expression programming are usually composed of more than one gene of equal length. Each gene codes for a sub- expression tree (sub-ET) or sub-program. Then the sub-ETs can interact with one another in different ways, forming a more complex program. The figure shows an example of a program composed of three sub-ETs. Expression of GEP genes as sub-ETs. a) A three-genic chromosome with the tails shown in bold. b) The sub-ETs encoded by each gene. In the final program the sub-ETs could be linked by addition or some other function, as there are no restrictions to the kind of linking function one might choose. Some examples of more complex linkers include taking the average, the median, the midrange, thresholding their sum to make a binomial classification, applying the sigmoid function to compute a probability, and so on. These linking functions are usually chosen a priori for each problem, but they can also be evolved elegantly and efficiently by the cellular system of gene expression programming. Cells and code reuse In gene expression programming, homeotic genes control the interactions of the different sub-ETs or modules of the main program. The expression of such genes results in different main programs or cells, that is, they determine which genes are expressed in each cell and how the sub-ETs of each cell interact with one another. In other words, homeotic genes determine which sub-ETs are called upon and how often in which main program or cell and what kind of connections they establish with one another. Homeotic genes and the cellular system Homeotic genes have exactly the same kind of structural organization as normal genes and they are built using an identical process. They also contain a head domain and a tail domain, with the difference that the heads contain now linking functions and a special kind of terminals – genic terminals – that represent the normal genes. The expression of the normal genes results as usual in different sub-ETs, which in the cellular system are called ADFs (automatically defined functions). As for the tails, they contain only genic terminals, that is, derived features generated on the fly by the algorithm. For example, the chromosome in the figure has three normal genes and one homeotic gene and encodes a main program that invokes three different functions a total of four times, linking them in a particular way. Expression of a unicellular system with three ADFs. a) The chromosome composed of three conventional genes and one homeotic gene (shown in bold). b) The ADFs encoded by each conventional gene. c) The main program or cell. From this example it is clear that the cellular system not only allows the unconstrained evolution of linking functions but also code reuse. And it shouldn't be hard to implement recursion in this system. Multiple main programs and multicellular systems Multicellular systems are composed of more than one homeotic gene. Each homeotic gene in this system puts together a different combination of sub-expression trees or ADFs, creating multiple cells or main programs. For example, the program shown in the figure was created using a cellular system with two cells and three normal genes. Expression of a multicellular system with three ADFs and two main programs. a) The chromosome composed of three conventional genes and two homeotic genes (shown in bold). b) The ADFs encoded by each conventional gene. c) Two different main programs expressed in two different cells. The applications of these multicellular systems are multiple and varied and, like the multigenic systems, they can be used both in problems with just one output and in problems with multiple outputs. Other levels of complexity The head/tail domain of GEP genes (both normal and homeotic) is the basic building block of all GEP algorithms. However, gene expression programming also explores other chromosomal organizations that are more complex than the head/tail structure. Essentially these complex structures consist of functional units or genes with a basic head/tail domain plus one or more extra domains. These extra domains usually encode random numerical constants that the algorithm relentlessly fine-tunes in order to find a good solution. For instance, these numerical constants may be the weights or factors in a function approximation problem (see the GEP-RNC algorithm below); they may be the weights and thresholds of a neural network (see the GEP-NN algorithm below); the numerical constants needed for the design of decision trees (see the GEP-DT algorithm below); the weights needed for polynomial induction; or the random numerical constants used to discover the parameter values in a parameter optimization task. The basic gene expression algorithm The fundamental steps of the basic gene expression algorithm are listed below in pseudocode: :1. Select function set; :2. Select terminal set; :3. Load dataset for fitness evaluation; :4. Create chromosomes of initial population randomly; :5. For each program in population: ::a) Express chromosome; ::b) Execute program; ::c) Evaluate fitness; :6. Verify stop condition; :7. Select programs; :8. Replicate selected programs to form the next population; :9. Modify chromosomes using genetic operators; :10. Go to step 5. The first four steps prepare all the ingredients that are needed for the iterative loop of the algorithm (steps 5 through 10). Of these preparative steps, the crucial one is the creation of the initial population, which is created randomly using the elements of the function and terminal sets. Populations of programs Like all evolutionary algorithms, gene expression programming works with populations of individuals, which in this case are computer programs. Therefore, some kind of initial population must be created to get things started. Subsequent populations are descendants, via selection and genetic modification, of the initial population. In the genotype/phenotype system of gene expression programming, it is only necessary to create the simple linear chromosomes of the individuals without worrying about the structural soundness of the programs they code for, as their expression always results in syntactically correct programs. Fitness functions and the selection environment Fitness functions and selection environments (called training datasets in machine learning) are the two facets of fitness and are therefore intricately connected. Indeed, the fitness of a program depends not only on the cost function used to measure its performance but also on the training data chosen to evaluate fitness The selection environment or training data The selection environment consists of the set of training records, which are also called fitness cases. These fitness cases could be a set of observations or measurements concerning some problem, and they form what is called the training dataset. The quality of the training data is essential for the evolution of good solutions. A good training set should be representative of the problem at hand and also well-balanced, otherwise the algorithm might get stuck at some local optimum. In addition, it is also important to avoid using unnecessarily large datasets for training as this will slow things down unnecessarily. A good rule of thumb is to choose enough records for training to enable a good generalization in the validation data and leave the remaining records for validation and testing. Fitness functions Broadly speaking, there are essentially three different kinds of problems based on the kind of prediction being made: :1. Problems involving numeric (continuous) predictions; :2. Problems involving categorical or nominal predictions, both binomial and multinomial; :3. Problems involving binary or Boolean predictions. The first type of problem goes by the name of regression; the second is known as classification, with logistic regression as a special case where, besides the crisp classifications like \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", a probability is also attached to each outcome; and the last one is related to Boolean algebra and logic synthesis. =Fitness functions for regression= In regression, the response or dependent variable is numeric (usually continuous) and therefore the output of a regression model is also continuous. So it's quite straightforward to evaluate the fitness of the evolving models by comparing the output of the model to the value of the response in the training data. There are several basic fitness functions for evaluating model performance, with the most common being based on the error or residual between the model output and the actual value. Such functions include the mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, relative squared error, root relative squared error, relative absolute error, and others. All these standard measures offer a fine granularity or smoothness to the solution space and therefore work very well for most applications. But some problems might require a coarser evolution, such as determining if a prediction is within a certain interval, for instance less than 10% of the actual value. However, even if one is only interested in counting the hits (that is, a prediction that is within the chosen interval), making populations of models evolve based on just the number of hits each program scores is usually not very efficient due to the coarse granularity of the fitness landscape. Thus the solution usually involves combining these coarse measures with some kind of smooth function such as the standard error measures listed above. Fitness functions based on the correlation coefficient and R-square are also very smooth. For regression problems, these functions work best by combining them with other measures because, by themselves, they only tend to measure correlation, not caring for the range of values of the model output. So by combining them with functions that work at approximating the range of the target values, they form very efficient fitness functions for finding models with good correlation and good fit between predicted and actual values. =Fitness functions for classification and logistic regression= The design of fitness functions for classification and logistic regression takes advantage of three different characteristics of classification models. The most obvious is just counting the hits, that is, if a record is classified correctly it is counted as a hit. This fitness function is very simple and works well for simple problems, but for more complex problems or datasets highly unbalanced it gives poor results. One way to improve this type of hits-based fitness function consists of expanding the notion of correct and incorrect classifications. In a binary classification task, correct classifications can be 00 or 11. The \\"00\\" representation means that a negative case (represented by \\"0”) was correctly classified, whereas the \\"11\\" means that a positive case (represented by \\"1”) was correctly classified. Classifications of the type \\"00\\" are called true negatives (TN) and \\"11\\" true positives (TP). There are also two types of incorrect classifications and they are represented by 01 and 10. They are called false positives (FP) when the actual value is 0 and the model predicts a 1; and false negatives (FN) when the target is 1 and the model predicts a 0. The counts of TP, TN, FP, and FN are usually kept on a table known as the confusion matrix. Confusion matrix for a binomial classification task. So by counting the TP, TN, FP, and FN and further assigning different weights to these four types of classifications, it is possible to create smoother and therefore more efficient fitness functions. Some popular fitness functions based on the confusion matrix include sensitivity/specificity, recall/precision, F-measure, Jaccard similarity, Matthews correlation coefficient, and cost/gain matrix which combines the costs and gains assigned to the 4 different types of classifications. These functions based on the confusion matrix are quite sophisticated and are adequate to solve most problems efficiently. But there is another dimension to classification models which is key to exploring more efficiently the solution space and therefore results in the discovery of better classifiers. This new dimension involves exploring the structure of the model itself, which includes not only the domain and range, but also the distribution of the model output and the classifier margin. By exploring this other dimension of classification models and then combining the information about the model with the confusion matrix, it is possible to design very sophisticated fitness functions that allow the smooth exploration of the solution space. For instance, one can combine some measure based on the confusion matrix with the mean squared error evaluated between the raw model outputs and the actual values. Or combine the F-measure with the R-square evaluated for the raw model output and the target; or the cost/gain matrix with the correlation coefficient, and so on. More exotic fitness functions that explore model granularity include the area under the ROC curve and rank measure. Also related to this new dimension of classification models, is the idea of assigning probabilities to the model output, which is what is done in logistic regression. Then it is also possible to use these probabilities and evaluate the mean squared error (or some other similar measure) between the probabilities and the actual values, then combine this with the confusion matrix to create very efficient fitness functions for logistic regression. Popular examples of fitness functions based on the probabilities include maximum likelihood estimation and hinge loss. =Fitness functions for Boolean problems= In logic there is no model structure (as defined above for classification and logistic regression) to explore: the domain and range of logical functions comprises only 0's and 1's or false and true. So, the fitness functions available for Boolean algebra can only be based on the hits or on the confusion matrix as explained in the section above. Selection and elitism Roulette-wheel selection is perhaps the most popular selection scheme used in evolutionary computation. It involves mapping the fitness of each program to a slice of the roulette wheel proportional to its fitness. Then the roulette is spun as many times as there are programs in the population in order to keep the population size constant. So, with roulette-wheel selection programs are selected both according to fitness and the luck of the draw, which means that some times the best traits might be lost. However, by combining roulette-wheel selection with the cloning of the best program of each generation, one guarantees that at least the very best traits are not lost. This technique of cloning the best-of-generation program is known as simple elitism and is used by most stochastic selection schemes. Reproduction with modification The reproduction of programs involves first the selection and then the reproduction of their genomes. Genome modification is not required for reproduction, but without it adaptation and evolution won't take place. Replication and selection The selection operator selects the programs for the replication operator to copy. Depending on the selection scheme, the number of copies one program originates may vary, with some programs getting copied more than once while others are copied just once or not at all. In addition, selection is usually set up so that the population size remains constant from one generation to another. The replication of genomes in nature is very complex and it took scientists a long time to discover the DNA double helix and propose a mechanism for its replication. But the replication of strings is trivial in artificial evolutionary systems, where only an instruction to copy strings is required to pass all the information in the genome from generation to generation. The replication of the selected programs is a fundamental piece of all artificial evolutionary systems, but for evolution to occur it needs to be implemented not with the usual precision of a copy instruction, but rather with a few errors thrown in. Indeed, genetic diversity is created with genetic operators such as mutation, recombination, transposition, inversion, and many others. Mutation In gene expression programming mutation is the most important genetic operator. It changes genomes by changing an element by another. The accumulation of many small changes over time can create great diversity. In gene expression programming mutation is totally unconstrained, which means that in each gene domain any domain symbol can be replaced by another. For example, in the heads of genes any function can be replaced by a terminal or another function, regardless of the number of arguments in this new function; and a terminal can be replaced by a function or another terminal. Recombination Recombination usually involves two parent chromosomes to create two new chromosomes by combining different parts from the parent chromosomes. And as long as the parent chromosomes are aligned and the exchanged fragments are homologous (that is, occupy the same position in the chromosome), the new chromosomes created by recombination will always encode syntactically correct programs. Different kinds of crossover are easily implemented either by changing the number of parents involved (there's no reason for choosing only two); the number of split points; or the way one chooses to exchange the fragments, for example, either randomly or in some orderly fashion. For example, gene recombination, which is a special case of recombination, can be done by exchanging homologous genes (genes that occupy the same position in the chromosome) or by exchanging genes chosen at random from any position in the chromosome. Transposition Transposition involves the introduction of an insertion sequence somewhere in a chromosome. In gene expression programming insertion sequences might appear anywhere in the chromosome, but they are only inserted in the heads of genes. This method guarantees that even insertion sequences from the tails result in error-free programs. For transposition to work properly, it must preserve chromosome length and gene structure. So, in gene expression programming transposition can be implemented using two different methods: the first creates a shift at the insertion site, followed by a deletion at the end of the head; the second overwrites the local sequence at the target site and therefore is easier to implement. Both methods can be implemented to operate between chromosomes or within a chromosome or even within a single gene. Inversion Inversion is an interesting operator, especially powerful for combinatorial optimization. It consists of inverting a small sequence within a chromosome. In gene expression programming it can be easily implemented in all gene domains and, in all cases, the offspring produced is always syntactically correct. For any gene domain, a sequence (ranging from at least two elements to as big as the domain itself) is chosen at random within that domain and then inverted. Other genetic operators Several other genetic operators exist and in gene expression programming, with its different genes and gene domains, the possibilities are endless. For example, genetic operators such as one-point recombination, two-point recombination, gene recombination, uniform recombination, gene transposition, root transposition, domain-specific mutation, domain-specific inversion, domain-specific transposition, and so on, are easily implemented and widely used. The GEP-RNC algorithm Numerical constants are essential elements of mathematical and statistical models and therefore it is important to allow their integration in the models designed by evolutionary algorithms. Gene expression programming solves this problem very elegantly through the use of an extra gene domain – the Dc – for handling random numerical constants (RNC). By combining this domain with a special terminal placeholder for the RNCs, a richly expressive system can be created. Structurally, the Dc comes after the tail, has a length equal to the size of the tail t, and is composed of the symbols used to represent the RNCs. For example, below is shown a simple chromosome composed of only one gene a head size of 7 (the Dc stretches over positions 15–22): :\`01234567890123456789012\` : :\`+?*+?**aaa??aaa68083295\` where the terminal \\"?” represents the placeholder for the RNCs. This kind of chromosome is expressed exactly as shown above, giving: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP expression tree with placeholder for RNCs.png |} Then the ?'s in the expression tree are replaced from left to right and from top to bottom by the symbols (for simplicity represented by numerals) in the Dc, giving: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP expression tree with symbols (numerals) for RNCs.png |} The values corresponding to these symbols are kept in an array. (For simplicity, the number represented by the numeral indicates the order in the array.) For instance, for the following 10 element array of RNCs: :C = {0.611, 1.184, 2.449, 2.98, 0.496, 2.286, 0.93, 2.305, 2.737, 0.755} the expression tree above gives: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP expression tree with RNCs.png |} This elegant structure for handling random numerical constants is at the heart of different GEP systems, such as GEP neural networks and GEP decision trees. Like the basic gene expression algorithm, the GEP-RNC algorithm is also multigenic and its chromosomes are decoded as usual by expressing one gene after another and then linking them all together by the same kind of linking process. The genetic operators used in the GEP-RNC system are an extension to the genetic operators of the basic GEP algorithm (see above), and they all can be straightforwardly implemented in these new chromosomes. On the other hand, the basic operators of mutation, inversion, transposition, and recombination are also used in the GEP-RNC algorithm. Furthermore, special Dc-specific operators such as mutation, inversion, and transposition, are also used to aid in a more efficient circulation of the RNCs among individual programs. In addition, there is also a special mutation operator that allows the permanent introduction of variation in the set of RNCs. The initial set of RNCs is randomly created at the beginning of a run, which means that, for each gene in the initial population, a specified number of numerical constants, chosen from a certain range, are randomly generated. Then their circulation and mutation is enabled by the genetic operators. Neural networks An artificial neural network (ANN or NN) is a computational device that consists of many simple connected units or neurons. The connections between the units are usually weighted by real-valued weights. These weights are the primary means of learning in neural networks and a learning algorithm is usually used to adjust them. Structurally, a neural network has three different classes of units: input units, hidden units, and output units. An activation pattern is presented at the input units and then spreads in a forward direction from the input units through one or more layers of hidden units to the output units. The activation coming into one unit from other unit is multiplied by the weights on the links over which it spreads. All incoming activation is then added together and the unit becomes activated only if the incoming result is above the unit's threshold. In summary, the basic components of a neural network are the units, the connections between the units, the weights, and the thresholds. So, in order to fully simulate an artificial neural network one must somehow encode these components in a linear chromosome and then be able to express them in a meaningful way. In GEP neural networks (GEP-NN or GEP nets), the network architecture is encoded in the usual structure of a head/tail domain. The head contains special functions/neurons that activate the hidden and output units (in the GEP context, all these units are more appropriately called functional units) and terminals that represent the input units. The tail, as usual, contains only terminals/input units. Besides the head and the tail, these neural network genes contain two additional domains, Dw and Dt, for encoding the weights and thresholds of the neural network. Structurally, the Dw comes after the tail and its length dw depends on the head size h and maximum arity nmax and is evaluated by the formula: :d_{w} = hn_\\\\max The Dt comes after Dw and has a length dt equal to t. Both domains are composed of symbols representing the weights and thresholds of the neural network. For each NN- gene, the weights and thresholds are created at the beginning of each run, but their circulation and adaptation are guaranteed by the usual genetic operators of mutation, transposition, inversion, and recombination. In addition, special operators are also used to allow a constant flow of genetic variation in the set of weights and thresholds. For example, below is shown a neural network with two input units (i1 and i2), two hidden units (h1 and h2), and one output unit (o1). It has a total of six connections with six corresponding weights represented by the numerals 1–6 (for simplicity, the thresholds are all equal to 1 and are omitted): {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:Neural network with 5 units.png |} This representation is the canonical neural network representation, but neural networks can also be represented by a tree, which, in this case, corresponds to: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP neural network with 7 nodes.png |} where \\"a” and \\"b” represent the two inputs i1 and i2 and \\"D” represents a function with connectivity two. This function adds all its weighted arguments and then thresholds this activation in order to determine the forwarded output. This output (zero or one in this simple case) depends on the threshold of each unit, that is, if the total incoming activation is equal to or greater than the threshold, then the output is one, zero otherwise. The above NN-tree can be linearized as follows: :\`0123456789012\` : :\`DDDabab654321\` where the structure in positions 7–12 (Dw) encodes the weights. The values of each weight are kept in an array and retrieved as necessary for expression. As a more concrete example, below is shown a neural net gene for the exclusive-or problem. It has a head size of 3 and Dw size of 6: :\`0123456789012\` : :\`DDDabab393257\` Its expression results in the following neural network: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:Expression of a GEP neural network for the exclusive- or.png |} which, for the set of weights: : W = {−1.978, 0.514, −0.465, 1.22, −1.686, −1.797, 0.197, 1.606, 0, 1.753} it gives: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP neural network solution for the exclusive-or.png |} which is a perfect solution to the exclusive-or function. Besides simple Boolean functions with binary inputs and binary outputs, the GEP-nets algorithm can handle all kinds of functions or neurons (linear neuron, tanh neuron, atan neuron, logistic neuron, limit neuron, radial basis and triangular basis neurons, all kinds of step neurons, and so on). Also interesting is that the GEP-nets algorithm can use all these neurons together and let evolution decide which ones work best to solve the problem at hand. So, GEP-nets can be used not only in Boolean problems but also in logistic regression, classification, and regression. In all cases, GEP-nets can be implemented not only with multigenic systems but also cellular systems, both unicellular and multicellular. Furthermore, multinomial classification problems can also be tackled in one go by GEP-nets both with multigenic systems and multicellular systems. Decision trees Decision trees (DT) are classification models where a series of questions and answers are mapped using nodes and directed edges. Decision trees have three types of nodes: a root node, internal nodes, and leaf or terminal nodes. The root node and all internal nodes represent test conditions for different attributes or variables in a dataset. Leaf nodes specify the class label for all different paths in the tree. Most decision tree induction algorithms involve selecting an attribute for the root node and then make the same kind of informed decision about all the nodes in a tree. Decision trees can also be created by gene expression programming, with the advantage that all the decisions concerning the growth of the tree are made by the algorithm itself without any kind of human input. There are basically two different types of DT algorithms: one for inducing decision trees with only nominal attributes and another for inducing decision trees with both numeric and nominal attributes. This aspect of decision tree induction also carries to gene expression programming and there are two GEP algorithms for decision tree induction: the evolvable decision trees (EDT) algorithm for dealing exclusively with nominal attributes and the EDT-RNC (EDT with random numerical constants) for handling both nominal and numeric attributes. In the decision trees induced by gene expression programming, the attributes behave as function nodes in the basic gene expression algorithm, whereas the class labels behave as terminals. This means that attribute nodes have also associated with them a specific arity or number of branches that will determine their growth and, ultimately, the growth of the tree. Class labels behave like terminals, which means that for a k-class classification task, a terminal set with k terminals is used, representing the k different classes. The rules for encoding a decision tree in a linear genome are very similar to the rules used to encode mathematical expressions (see above). So, for decision tree induction the genes also have a head and a tail, with the head containing attributes and terminals and the tail containing only terminals. This again ensures that all decision trees designed by GEP are always valid programs. Furthermore, the size of the tail t is also dictated by the head size h and the number of branches of the attribute with more branches nmax and is evaluated by the equation: :t = h(n_\\\\max-1)+1 \\\\, For example, consider the decision tree below to decide whether to play outside: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:Decision tree for playing outside.png |} It can be linearly encoded as: :\`01234567\` : :\`HOWbaaba\` where “H” represents the attribute Humidity, “O” the attribute Outlook, “W” represents Windy, and “a” and “b” the class labels \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\" respectively. Note that the edges connecting the nodes are properties of the data, specifying the type and number of branches of each attribute, and therefore don't have to be encoded. The process of decision tree induction with gene expression programming starts, as usual, with an initial population of randomly created chromosomes. Then the chromosomes are expressed as decision trees and their fitness evaluated against a training dataset. According to fitness they are then selected to reproduce with modification. The genetic operators are exactly the same that are used in a conventional unigenic system, for example, mutation, inversion, transposition, and recombination. Decision trees with both nominal and numeric attributes are also easily induced with gene expression programming using the framework described above for dealing with random numerical constants. The chromosomal architecture includes an extra domain for encoding random numerical constants, which are used as thresholds for splitting the data at each branching node. For example, the gene below with a head size of 5 (the Dc starts at position 16): :\`012345678901234567890\` : :\`WOTHabababbbabba46336\` encodes the decision tree shown below: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP decision tree, k-expression WOTHababab.png |} In this system, every node in the head, irrespective of its type (numeric attribute, nominal attribute, or terminal), has associated with it a random numerical constant, which for simplicity in the example above is represented by a numeral 0–9. These random numerical constants are encoded in the Dc domain and their expression follows a very simple scheme: from top to bottom and from left to right, the elements in Dc are assigned one-by-one to the elements in the decision tree. So, for the following array of RNCs: : C = {62, 51, 68, 83, 86, 41, 43, 44, 9, 67} the decision tree above results in: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP decision tree with numeric and nominal attributes, k-expression WOTHababab.png |} which can also be represented more colorfully as a conventional decision tree: {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" File:GEP decision tree with numeric and nominal attributes.png |} Criticism GEP has been criticized for not being a major improvement over other genetic programming techniques.

Growing up in a patrician Bremen family, he showed interest in natural sciences from an early age. He studied at the Technical University of Munich (1901), TU Berlin (1902) and University of Munich (1903) and Berlin before obtaining a doctorate at the University of Göttingen in 1907. He became professor of electrical engineering at the Technische Hochschule Dresden in 1911 at the age of 29, thus obtaining the world's first chair in this discipline. In 1919, he discovered the Barkhausen effect (named after him), which provided evidence for the magnetic domain theory of ferromagnetism. When the magnetic field through a piece of ferromagnetic material like iron is changing, the magnetization of the material changes in a series of tiny discontinuous jumps, which can be heard as a series of clicks in a loudspeaker attached to a coil of wire around the iron. It was later determined that these jumps were caused by the movement of the magnetic domains in the iron, as the domain walls snap past defects in the crystal lattice. The energy lost in these dissipative events is responsible for the shape of the hysteresis curve of iron and other ferromagnets. This effect is widely used in research, and physics education as a simple experiment to demonstrate the reality of magnetic domains. In 1920, he invented the Barkhausen-Kurz oscillator, with K. Kurz, the first vacuum tube electronic oscillator to use electron transit-time effects. It was the first vacuum tube oscillator that could operate at ultrahigh frequency, up to 300 MHz, and inspired later microwave transit-time tubes such as the klystron. In 1921 he derived the first mathematical conditions for oscillation in electrical circuits, now called the Barkhausen stability criterion. They are widely used today in the design of electronic oscillators and general feedback amplifier circuits. In 1933 Barkhausen signed the Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State.

It was created by order of the Polish State National Council on 1 January 1944. Its aims were to fight against Nazi Germany in occupied Poland, support the Soviet Red Army against the German forces and to aid in the creation of a pro-Soviet Union communist government in Poland. Along with the National Armed Forces, it was one of the military resistance organizations that refused to join the structures of the Polish Underground State or its military arm, the Home Army. The People's Army was much smaller than the Home Army, but propaganda in communist Poland espoused the myth that the reverse was the case. Due to their close affiliation with the Soviet Union, which de facto controlled Armia Ludowa and its predecessors, Armia Ludowa can be seen as both a part of the Polish resistance as well as the Soviet partisan movement.  Background  In 1939, 17 days after the German invasion, the Soviet Union also invaded Poland. There was no formal declaration of war by either side. The Polish government in exile established in London maintained contacts with its representatives in occupied Poland, the Polish Underground State. In 1943 following the revelations about the Katyn massacre and Polish government insistence on investigation, the Soviet Union broke off the diplomatic relations with the London Polish government, intending to establish a competing structure of power. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the communist supporters in Poland, aided by Soviet advisers, had formed partisan units and created their own independent underground organization, whose aims were to support the Soviet military against German forces and aid the creation of a pro-Soviet communist government in Poland. Thus the Gwardia Ludowa (GL, People's Guard) was created in 1942. Along with a portion of the National Armed Forces, this communist-led underground was one of the military resistance organizations in Poland that refused to join the structures of the Polish Underground State, and its military arm, the Home Army (Armia Krajowa).  History   Creation  On 1 January 1944 the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN) replaced the Gwardia Ludowa with the AL. The KRN intended to gain volunteers from other groups. Upon its establishment, the organization comprised some 10,000 members. By the end of July 1944 (when much of Poland had been occupied by the Red Army) there were some 20,000–30,000 members, 5,000 of them being Soviet nationals. Lower estimates quote about 14,000 as its peak strength, whereas high estimates double the middle number, up to 50,000–60,000. About 6,000 of them were active full-time partisans. Whatever its exact size, AL was much smaller (\\"a fraction of\\") than the primary Polish resistance organization, the Armia Krajowa (Home Army). At the same time, GL/AL was much better armed than Armia Krajowa (Home Army, AK); thanks to Soviet air drops, and it might have even had a surplus of weaponry. It also had less strict discipline.  Polish People's Army  Seven months after it came into existence, on 21 July 1944, the People's Army was integrated into the Polish Military in the USSR and formed the new People's Army of Poland (Ludowe Wojsko Polskie, LWP). After the Red Army and the Soviet-organized 1st Polish Army entered Poland late in 1944 and early 1945, most People's Army members joined the communist 1st Polish Army. After the war, many of its members joined the ranks of the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of Poland, or the Milicja Obywatelska (police).  Operations, propaganda and criticism  Armia Ludowa at a forest near Lublin According to AL's claims, it carried out about 900 operations, killing 20,000 Germans, derailing 350 trains, and destroying 79 bridges. However, GL/AL exploits were significantly exaggerated by the communist propaganda in the People's Republic of Poland. Polish historian Piotr Gontarczyk estimates that only about 5–10% of officially recorded GL/AL action really took place, and that in the majority instances when GL/AL fought the German military it was when GL/AL was defending itself from German anti- partisan operations, with instances of GL/AL attacking Germans on its own initiative being very rare. Rather than engaging military targets, GL/AL preferred softer targets, such as German administration offices. That changed in 1944, when GL/AL grew stronger, and began engaging the German military more actively. According to Polish-American historian Mieczysław B. Biskupski, AL was less concerned with fighting the Germans than with fighting the Home Army. According to Gontarczyk and Janusz Marszal, however, this was relatively uncommon, at least with regards to direct actions; however GL/AL would often pass anonymous tips about AK to the Gestapo. The People's Army took part in the Warsaw Uprising. While official claims held that some 1,800 People's Army soldiers fought there, modern research suggests the actual number to have been about 500. As the GL/AL had a much poorer support network than the Home Army, which was supported by the Polish Underground State, and Soviet air drops did not supply the People's Army with foodstuffs, it often had to resort to forced requisitions, described by modern historians as \\"banditry\\". It often targeted mansions and churches. There were also incidents of GL/AL soldiers murdering Jews or fighting among themselves. In one of its most secret and controversial actions, agents of the then-GL on 17 February 1944 seized an important document archive of the Underground State. Documents of importance to the communist activists were taken, and the remainder was turned over to the Gestapo agent who had been duped into participating in the GL operation. Seven members of the Underground State were taken prisoner by the Germans in a cleanup operation, and likely, executed soon afterward.  Leadership  The commander of the Armia Ludowa was General Michał Rola-Żymierski, and the chief of staff was a member of the Central Committee of the Polish Workers' Party, Colonel Franciszek Jóźwiak. AL leadership took orders from the Soviet Union, and representing Soviet, not Polish, interests of the state. The Polish Institute of National Remembrance, in its official description of GL/AL, goes so far as to declare this organization part of the Soviet partisans rather than Polish resistance in World War II.

The refer to the three sacred mountains of Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan and Mount Yudono, which are clustered together in the ancient province of Dewa (modern-day Yamagata Prefecture). Holy to the Japanese Shinto religion and especially the mountain ascetic cult of Shugendo, Dewa Sanzan are a popular pilgrimage site visited by many, including famed haiku poet Matsuo Bashō. The Haguro Five-story Pagoda is a recognised national treasure of Japan. History The Dewa Sanzan mountains are particularly noteworthy as having the oldest history of mountain worship in Japan. The mountains were first opened as a religious centre over 1400 years ago in 593 by prince Hachiko, who was the first-born son of Emperor Sushun, the 32nd emperor of Japan and reigning emperor at the time. Prince Hachiko arrived in Dewa province in 593 after fleeing the Soga clan upon the assassination of his father. He then devoted the rest of his life to religious pursuits, eventually enduring difficult ascetic exercises and a period of penance, which led to his worship of Haguro Gongen, the deity of the mountain. Following this, the prince began worship at the Gassan and Yudono mountains, which led to the enshrinement of all three deities at the temple located on the summit of Mount Haguro. Following the establishment of the Dewa Sanzan mountains as a center of ascetic religious beliefs, many people began to make yearly pilgrimages to the mountains to pay reverence, even arduously trekking thousands of miles to visit the shrines during the summer months. These pilgrimages held significance to many religions and the mountains served as a place of learning for various belief systems, but were most particularly important to shugendō. Several notable individuals made this pilgrimage to the Dewa Sanzan to include En no Gyōja, the founder of shugendō asceticism, as well as Kūkai, the founder of the Shingon Sect. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Japanese government dissolved the pattern of Shintō- Buddhist amalgamation and Shintō was selected as the official state religion. Shugendō was adversely affected by this split and many shugendō priests returned to a secular life. Following the end of World War II however, shugendō was allowed to enjoy a status as a minor religious group. These changes in religious association also altered the designation of the shrines located on the Dewa Sanzan. Today, the shrines at Mount Haguro and Mount Yudono are designated as kokuhei shosha, while the shrine on Mount Gassan, Gassan Shrine is now considered a kanpei taisha. Significance in Japanese religion Folk religion has continued throughout the ages to be a very major force in the life of the Japanese people, particularly the aspect of the association between religious beliefs and practices with sacred mountains. This practice of mountain worship holds a significant place in Japanese beliefs and had become widespread throughout Japan’s history. It has been observed that nearly every high mountain top has had its own dedicated shrine at one point, with some receiving pilgrimages every year from thousands of worshippers. This collection of diverse phenomena linking religious activities and beliefs with sacred mountains is referred to as sangaku shinkō. The Dewa Sanzan are very holy to both the religions of Shintō and Buddhism, but in particular are very significant and sacred to the shugendō religious system of beliefs, as they represent great spiritual significance. Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan, and Mount Yudono each have their own shrine, though the primary shrine itself, Dewa Shrine, is located at the summit of Mount Haguro. The primary shrine is unique in that it venerates all three sacred mountains. Every year, mountain ascetic devotees known as yamabushi - which are laymen practitioners of shugendo - pay reverence to the Dewa Sanzan. Mount Haguro is significant in this role as it serves as the entryway to Mount Gassan and Mount Yudono. Though Mount Haguro is the smallest of the three mountains, it is the only mountain of Dewa that is accessible all throughout the year, as heavy snowfall prohibits pilgrimage to the other two mountains of Dewa during the winter months. It is the most well known of the three mountains of Dewa both locally and internationally, as it serves as the location of the Haguro Five-story Pagoda, one of Japan's national treasures. Mount Gassan is the tallest of the three sacred mountains and is well known for its natural scenery and beauty, as it plays host to a variety of rare alpine plants and other marsh vegetation. The hiking path on Mt. Gassan leads all the way to its peak, the second highest point in the Shonai Region of Japan. Due to heavy snow however, it is often only accessible during late spring to the early fall. Mount Yudono is viewed as being the heart of the three sacred mountains and is considered the most holy of ascetic disciplinary practice grounds. Many ascetics and yamabushi believe they have not completed their pilgrimage, and thus entered the holy land, until they have reached Mount Yudono. Mount Yudono is famous for its goshintai, a sacred object believed to be directly connected to a god. The shrine on Yudono is also revered as hallowed land which must be kept secret, and even today, photography and video recordings are prohibited. References * Earhart, H. Byron. (1965).

During their career, they have released four studio albums: Perhaps, I Suppose (2001), MCMLXXXV (2003), released through Nitro Records, gained moderate airplay with single \\"White Lights\\" on MTV2 and Fuse. A third effort, The Comfort of Home (2005), was released and concluded with the band going off for a long period. History Rufio was formed when bassist Jon Berry was a freshman in college and the other three members, Scott Sellers, Mike Jimenez, and Clark Domae were in high school. Sellers and Domae had been acquainted for some time and found a shared talent in the guitar. Sellers met Berry and they began playing together in various groups and sessions. Around the same time, the two purchased a 4-track to record the songs they were writing. After Berry and Sellers began recording, they asked Jimenez to listen to their recordings and play drums with them. Domae joined shortly after and completed the official lineup. The band took their name from the character Rufio, leader of the Lost Boys in the absence of Peter Pan in the 1991 film Hook. Rufio released its debut record, Perhaps, I Suppose..., in 2001 on The Militia Group label. The band then returned in June 2003 with MCMLXXXV, released on Nitro Records, which was recorded with producer Nick Raskulinecz. Rufio went on to play on the Warped Tour that summer. The band's third album, The Comfort of Home, was released in July 2005. The band embarked on a tour that fall, with MxPx and Relient K. In late January 2006, Berry and Jimenez left Rufio, citing creative differences. Following the loss of two members, the band pulled out of their tour with No Use for a Name. While no official statement had then been made regarding a breakup, in a 2006 interview, No Use for a Name acknowledged as much. Since leaving Rufio, Jimenez formed a new band called Science Fiction Theater. Sellers and Domae started a band called BigCity. On April 5, 2007, the band announced on their MySpace page that they were to play an official farewell show on June 1, 2007, at The Glass House in Pomona, California, followed by a South American tour. The statement in full read: > \\"Farewell show and South American tour. well... it's been a while friends... > and we've finally decided that its time to do an official farewell show with > all the members of Rufio on June 1. We thought it would be a good way to > show our appreciation to all our hometown friends and fans who have > supported us from the very beginning. We figured the Glasshouse would be a > very appropriate venue to host the show and we hope to see ALLLL of you > there! we'll be playing a variety of songs, and even oldies we rarely play! > It's going to be a sad night but it also means the birth of new projects and > new music!

Love, Rufio.\\" However, the band played a few gigs in 2008, and on December 27, 2009, drummer Terry Stirling Jr. announced the release of an EP to be entitled The Loneliest. Rufio announced it was recording an album that was slated for release in the summer of 2010, followed by worldwide touring. In October 2010, Domae announced that he was leaving the band to pursue other projects. In a YouTube video released by Stirling Jr., he has reportedly left Rufio to pursue other endeavors as of April 2011. In July 2012, the band responded to a fan comment, stating that they were breaking up. Sellers has moved on from Rufio and was involved with the production and guest vocals for the band The Lost Boys Club, which continues on the part of Rufio being the leader of The Lost Boys. The band announced that they would be playing a one-off reunion show on June 18, 2015, at the Montebello Amnesia Rockfest.

After three days of manoeuvering or lying becalmed in sight of one another, the fleets found themselves near the island of Fidonisi, about 100 miles south of Kinburn. Voynovitch formed a line on the port tack NE and then SE as the wind veered. The Turks bore up and attacked from windward just after 3 pm. The leading Russian ships, the frigates Berislav and Stryela, forced the leading Turks out of line, but were in danger of being cut off until the Russian second-in-command Fyodor Ushakov aboard Sv. Pavel closed the gap. Hasan Pasha then attacked the leading Russian ships, while his Vice- and Rear- Admirals attacked Voynovitch, but his ship damaged, Hasan himself had to leave the line and just before 5 pm the Turks withdrew. They had lost 1 xebec sunk. Between 15 and 17 July, the Russian and Turkish fleets manoeuvered to the west of the Crimea; on 18 July, the Turks had disappeared.

Battle The Russian fleet, under Ushakov, sailed from Sevastopol on 13 July 1790 for the southern Crimea, after hearing a report that the Ottoman fleet had been sighted there. On 19 July it anchored at the mouth of the Kerch Strait and sent privateers out in search of the Ottomans. At 10 am they reported a sighting and 30 minutes later the Ottoman fleet came into view from the east. With the wind from the ENE, Ushakov formed a line on the port tack (i.e. south-east). The Ottomans turned from their group formation and formed a parallel line to the east of the Russian line. Seeing that the Ottoman battle-line contained just their battleships, Ushakov sent 6 frigates to form a second line to leeward of the main line, and between about 12pm and 3pm, 3 hours of indecisive longish-range fighting followed, but then the wind changed direction to NNE and the Russians luffed, turning toward the Ottoman line. The Ottomans reversed course, 2 of their ships colliding as they did so, because some ships turned left and others turned right. As the Russians steered toward the tail-end of the Ottomans line, and with the wind from the north, the Ottoman admiral steered away, to the SW. At about 7pm firing ceased. The Russians followed all night, but by morning, the faster ships of the Ottomans were out of sight. Russian casualties were 29 killed and 68 wounded, with very little damage to ships.

He is also known as Richard Rolle of Hampole or de Hampole, since at the end of his life he lived near a Cistercian nunnery in Hampole, now in South Yorkshire. In the words of Nicholas Watson, scholarly research has shown that \\"[d]uring the fifteenth century he was one of the most widely read of English writers, whose works survive in nearly four hundred English ... and at least seventy Continental manuscripts, almost all written between 1390 and 1500.\\" Life In his works, Rolle provides little explicit evidence about his early life and education. Most, if not all, of our information about him comes from the Office of Lessons and Antiphons that was composed in the 1380s in preparation for his canonisation, although this never came about.Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), p9. Born into a small farming family and brought up at Thornton-le-Dale near Pickering, he studied at the University of Oxford where he was sponsored by Thomas de Neville, the Archdeacon of Durham. While there, he is said to have been more interested in theology and biblical studies than philosophy and secular studies.This is according to Lesson I of the Office drawn up in the 1380s in preparation for his anticipated canonisation. Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), p. 14. He left Oxford at age eighteen or nineteen—dropping out before he received his MA—to become a hermit.He apparently took two of his sister's favourite tunics and ripped them to form them into a homemade hermit's habit. Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), p. 13. Leaving the family home, he first went to Pickering and housed with a squire, John Dalton, for perhaps three years. It was probably while still living with Dalton, two years and eight months after becoming a hermit, Rolle had his first mystical experience. Around a year later, he felt similarly after listening to a choir, and he began to take less interest in all things temporal.Maynard Smith, p. 345 Dalton himself was arrested and his lands confiscated in 1322; the lack of mention of this fact in accounts of Rolle's life makes it likely that he was no longer living with Dalton by this point.Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), p. 18. It is unclear where Rolle lived from 1321/2 until his death in 1349. One theory is that Rolle spent the early 1320s at the renowned Sorbonne, becoming well-trained in theology, and perhaps being ordained there.Maynard Smith, p. 346 This theory is based on the entries in three seventeenth-century manuscripts at the Sorbonne, assumed to be copies of medieval originals, which record a Ricardus de Hampole as being admitted to the Sorbonne in 1320, entering the prior's register in 1326, and noting that he died in 1349 among the sisters of Hampole near Doncaster in Yorkshire. Scholars, however, are divided on the authenticity of this material.See Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), pp. 22-3 for a summary of the various scholarly positions on this theory. Bernard McGinn, The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism, (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p. 340, dismisses the stories about Paris as ‘legends’. Whether or not Rolle studied in Paris, it is probable that most if not all of this time was spent in Richmondshire, either living with his family at Yafforth, or, given the uncertain political conditions in the region at the time, wandering from patron to patron.Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), p. 23. Around 1348, Rolle knew the Yorkshire anchoress Margaret Kirkby, who was his principal disciple and the recipient of much of his writingsPastors and visionaries: religion ... - Google Books and would be important in establishing his later reputation. Rolle died in Michaelmas 1349 at the Cistercian nunnery at Hampole. Because of his time spent there, where he was director of the inmates, he is sometimes known as Richard Rolle of Hampole, or de Hampole. It is unclear what his function was there: he was not the nuns' official confessor, who was a Franciscan (in any case, it is unlikely he would have had ecclesiastical sanction for this, since unless the theory about his ordination in Paris is correct, he was probably not ordained, since his name is not in the list of those ordained in the dioceses of York or Durham in the relevant years).Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), p. 24. However he wrote The Form of Living and his English Psalter for a nun there, Margaret Kirkby (who later took up a similar life to Rolle, as an anchoress), and Ego Dormio for a nun at Yedingham.Maynard Smith, p. 347 It is possible that he died of the Black Death, but there is no direct evidence for this. He was buried first in the nuns' cemetery at Hampole. Later records of people making offerings of candles at his shrine show that he was moved first to the chancel and then to his own chapel. Works Rolle probably began writing in the early 1330s, and continued until his death – but there is no certain chronology of his various works. He wrote in both Latin and English, with his English works apparently all dating from after c1340.Bernard McGinn, The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism, (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p341. The precise dating of Rolle's works is a matter of much modern dispute. The dates set out by Hope Emily Allen in 1927 have been widely used by later writers, but in 1991 Nicholas Watson set out a rather different vision of the chronology of Rolle's writing.See Hope Emily Allen, Writings Ascribed to Richard Rolle Hermit of Hampole and Materials for his Biography, (New York, 1927); Nicholas Allen, Richard Rolle and the Invention of Authority, (Cambridge: CUP, 1991), pp. 273-294. Some of the difficulties are summarised in John A Alford, 'Richard Rolle and Related Works' in ASG Edwards, ed, Middle English Prose: A Critical Guide to Major Authors and Genres, (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1984), pp. 35-60. In one of his best-known works, Incendium Amoris (The Fire of Love), Rolle provides an account of his mystical experiences, which he describes as being of three kinds: a physical warmth in his body, a sense of wonderful sweetness, and a heavenly music that accompanied him as he chanted the Psalms. The book was widely read in the Middle Ages, and described the four purgative stages that one had to go through to become closer to God: described as open door, heat, song, and sweetness. His last work was probably the English The Form of Living, written in autumn 1348 at the earliest. It is addressed to Margaret Kirkby, who entered her enclosure as a recluse on 12 December 1348, and is a vernacular guide for her life as an anchorite.Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), p41. His works are often classified into commentaries, treatises and epistles. As such, the commentaries are: * Commentary on the Readings in the Office of the Dead taken from Job. This commentary on nine readings from the Book of Job which form part of the readings for the office of the dead was used extensively by York clergy in the fifteenth century. Surviving in forty- two manuscripts, it was the first of Rolle's works to be printed, in Oxford in 1483. * Commentary on the Canticles, a commentary on the first two and a half verses of the Song of Songs. It survives in thirty manuscripts. * Two Commentaries on the Psalter. One is in Latin, and may belong to the very early period after Rolle left Oxford. The second is an English commentary with translation of the Latin Psalms into English, which was designed to help Margaret Kirkby to understand the doctrines behind the Psalms she was to chant in her anchorage. For nearly 200 years this commentary remained the only authorised translation of the Bible into English; it did not need diocesan permission for its use. It exists in about 20 manuscripts.Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), p. 66. * Treatise on Psalm 20, in Latin * Super Threnos, a commentary on the Lamentations of Jeremiah * Commentary on the Apocalypse, on the first six chapters of the Book of Revelation * Other commentaries on the Lord's Prayer, the Magnificat and the Apostles' Creed * An English explication of the Ten Commandments * Super Mulierem Fortem, a comment on Proverbs 31:10 Other works include: * Two English Meditations on the Passion * Judica me Deus, probably his first work, written around 1330. This survives in four versions, and is an apologia for his hermit lifestyle, making use of the pastoral manual of a fellow Yorkshireman, William of Pagula.Bernard McGinn, The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism, (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p343. * Contra Amatores Mundi (Against the Lovers of the World), which survives in 42 manuscripts.Bernard McGinn, The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism, (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p344. Oddly, Jonathan Hughes, 'Rolle, Richard (1305x10–1349)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008) states that only seven manuscripts of this survive. This appears to be a mistake. * Incendium Amoris (The Fire of Love), written before 1343 (the date of Rolle's marginal note), which survives in 44 manuscripts (15 from the Continent) and one Middle English translation.Bernard McGinn, The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism, (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p344. * Melos Amoris (or Melum Contemplativorum) (The Melody of Love), which survives in 10 manuscripts. * The Form of Living, his last work, which survives in 30 manuscripts. It contains 12 chapters and was written at Hampole for Margaret Kirkby when she was living in a cell in Richmondshire. Three letters survive. All are addressed to single recipients, and contain much similar material:Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), p48. * Emendatio Vitae (Emending of Life). This was the most popular work of Rolle, with 110 manuscripts (17 from the Continent), and seven independent Middle English translations. * Ego Dormio, a Middle English prosimetrum, one of two letters written for nuns. (the title comes from the incipit of the work, and is from Song of Songs 5.2) * The Commandment, one of two letters written for nuns. Works once thought to be Rolle's: * While the most popular poem in Middle English, The Pricke of Conscience, was once attributed to him, it is now known to have been written by an anonymous Yorkshire author in the 14th century. * It is now thought that De Dei Misericordia, a comment on Psalm 88:2, was written by John Waldeby in the later fourteenth century. Later reputation and veneration Richard Rolle inspired a flourishing cult, especially in the north of England, which was still active at the time of the English Reformation. Part of this may have been due to the efforts of Margaret Kirkby, who moved to the priory, probably between 1381 and 1383, to be near the body of her master, Rolle. Margaret may have spent the last 10 years of her life here,Pastors and visionaries: religion and secular life in late medieval Yorkshire by Jonathan Hughes p87 and between 1381 and 1383 a liturgical office for Rolle, including a great deal of biographical information about him, was written; it likely includes stories about him remembered by older members of the community. Rolle's works were widely read in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, more so even than Chaucer.Richard Rolle, the English writings, translated, edited, and introduced by Rosamund S. Allen. Classics of Western Spirituality, (New York / London: Paulist Press / SPCK, 1988), p33. Works of his survive in about 470 manuscripts written between 1390 and 1500, and in 10 sixteenth- and early- seventeenth-century printed editions (including the sixteenth-century edition by Wynkyn de Worde). In some manuscripts, Rolle's Commentary on the Psalter is interpolated with Lollard teaching, providing indications of one group who read his work. Rolle's work was not uncontroversial. He was criticised by Walter Hilton and the author of The Cloud of Unknowing; a defence of Rolle's work was written by the hermit Thomas Basset in the late fourteenth century against the attack of an unnamed Carthusian.See Michael G Sargent, 'Contemporary criticism of Richard Rolle', in Kartäusermystik und -Mystiker, 5 vols, (Salzburg, 1981-2), vol 1, pp160-205. The shrine and priory at his burial place of Hampole was dissolved on 19 November 1539. The remains can be seen in an old schoolhouse in Hampole. Rolle is honoured in the Church of England on 20 January and in the Episcopal Church (USA) together with Walter Hilton and Margery Kempe on 28 September.

He is a former chief of police on Anjouan and has studied extensively in France and the United States. He was part of a military coup on Anjouan in August 2001 and soon became President. It is alleged he rigged the elections to become the first president of Anjouan in March 2002, in part due to his leading role in the separatist movement. He was ousted by the combined forces of the Government of the Union of Comoros and the African Union in the March 2008 invasion of Anjouan. Presidency disputed On April 26, 2007, the country's Federal Constitutional Court proclaimed the Presidency of Anjouan vacant, declaring Bacar's period in office after his first term ended on April 14 to be illegal. Two days later, Comorian President Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, with the support of the African Union (AU), appointed M. Dhoihirou Halidi as interim President of Anjouan. However, he was never allowed to take office and Bacar, in defiance of both the Union of Comoros government and the AU, independently organised a presidential election. The Union government withheld election material from Anjouan to try and prevent the poll from taking place, but Bacar printed his own ballot papers, went ahead with the vote on 10 June and claimed a landslide victory of 90 percent. He was inaugurated for a second term as the President of Anjouan on 14 June. Both the AU and the Union government said if an election were held on Anjouan it would be declared \\"illegal\\". Bacar's inauguration ceremony deepened the electoral crisis, making it highly unlikely that the official Anjouan poll, postponed to 17 June, would be held. In his inauguration speech, Bacar declared himself \\"the president of all Anjouan\\" and appealed to the Union government \\"not to throw oil onto the fire\\". France, the country's former colonial power, expressed its support for the Union government and the AU stance against Bacar in a statement released on 15 June, and noted that the 10 June election was only the first round in the presidential elections, with the second round scheduled for 24 June. The statement urged Bacar to respect the 17 June date for holding Anjouan's official election, and allow it to be supervised by AU troops and monitored by international observers. Since this time the situation had deteriorated markedly and the government of Comoros determined that talks had failed and a military solution was required. During February and March 2008 troops from the Comoros with support from the African Union began massing for an amphibious assault of the island of Anjouan and the termination of the presidency of Mohamed Bacar. Agence France-Presse reported that 'the first batch' of African Union troops arrived in the Comoros Islands on March 20, 2008, \\"African troops patrol Anjouan after renegade leader flees\\" (March 27, 2008) Yahoo!Singapore News while the BBC reported that the first African Union troops arrived on March 11, 2008.\\"AU troops arrive in the Comoros\\" (March 11, 2008) BBC In an interview with Agence France-Presse on March 12, 2008, Bacar said that he had \\"always been open to dialogue\\" and that there should be a round table to discuss Comoran problems. He said that holding a new election in Anjouan would be acceptable if a round table was in favor of it. According to Bacar, some of the countries backing military intervention are undemocratic themselves, and it was hypocritical for them to try to \\"give [Anjouan] lessons in democracy\\"; he said that an invasion would ultimately solve nothing and that he was ready to fight and die if necessary.\\"Anjouan's Bacar says he is ready to negotiate\\" (March 12, 2008) Agence France-Presse. Removal from office A tense period punctuated by several incidents of military incursions on Anjouan continued from the beginning of March with notable events including an abortive Comoron raid on Domoni in the south of the island, the seizure of two Anjouan soldiers on the coast close to Sima and the crash of a French military helicopter also near Sima. The end came when, in the early hours of March 25, the island was invaded by a combined Comoros and African Union force. The island's capital, airport, seaport and second city were all overrun by dawn to scenes of jubilation from the local population. Early reports indicated that the government of Mohamed Bacar had fled to the interior of the island and were in hiding; however, later reports from the Comoros government on March 25 stated that Bacar had fled the island incognito seeking exile in Mayotte: > \\"Colonel Mohamed Bacar has been spotted in the village of Sadanpoini where > he is heading without doubt for a place to flee on board a kwassa (small > canoe) towards Mayotte island, it seems, according to various sources, that > he is dressed as a woman.\\" > \\\\- Abdourahim Said Bacar, Comoran government spokesman. \\"Anjouan leader > flees \\"dressed as woman\\" - gov't\\" (March 25, 2008) Reuters: Africa Soon afterwards, the French government confirmed that Bacar had fled to Mayotte.\\"Comoros island president flees\\"(March 26, 2008) Al Jazeera.\\"Comoros Rebel Leader on French Island\\" (March 27, 2008) Associated Press (The New York Times) He requested that France grant him political asylum, and the French government said that it was considering the request.

Subsequently, the French moved Bacar to the nearby island of Réunion\\"Anjouan: Bacar relaxé mais devrait être placé en rétention administrative\\", AFP (AngolaPress), March 29, 2008 . on the night of March 27-28, along with 23 of his supporters who accompanied him when he fled to Mayotte. It was thought that he would be charged on Réunion with weapons possession and illegal entry due to his arrival on Mayotte by speedboat. Comoran President Ahmed Abdallah Sambi said that if the French objected to extraditing Bacar to Comoros, where the death penalty is allowed, then it could send him to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for trial. Thousands of Comorans participated in a protest on March 28 to demand that Bacar be extradited; it was widely believed in the Comoros that France secretly worked to protect him. In its extradition request, the Comoran government accused Bacar of \\"embezzlement of public funds, homicide, rape, torture and other abuses against the people of Anjouan\\".\\"Le colonel Bacar remis en liberté par la cour d'appel mais assigné à résidence\\", AFP (Jeuneafrique.com), April 18, 2008 . The case against Bacar and his 23 supporters, based on illegal entry and weapons possession, was dismissed by a court in Saint-Denis, Réunion on March 29. However, they were ordered to be placed in administrative detention; they were kept at air base 181. An order (reconduite à la frontière) to expel Bacar and his men back to the Comoros was issued on March 28, but it was subsequently revoked. On March 31, Bacar and his men requested political asylum. Bacar's lawyers also requested a temporary residence permit for them, but this was rejected by the court in Saint-Denis. On April 1, a new order was signed for the expulsion of Bacar and his men. At a court hearing on April 2, Bacar said that he had \\"confidence in French justice\\"; his lawyers said that they would appeal the order for his expulsion.\\"La Réunion: l'ex-président d'Anjouan visé par un arrêté de reconduite à la frontière\\", AFP (Jeuneafrique.com), April 2, 2008 . On April 2, the Assembly of the Union of the Comoros accused France of taking Bacar from Anjouan to Mayotte. Replying to this allegation, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Pascale Andréani said on April 3 that Bacar had managed to flee Anjouan \\"under unclear circumstances\\". Andréani said that Bacar was under house arrest on Réunion and that his request for asylum was being reviewed.\\"Comores: Bacar a quitté Anjouan dans ces conditions \\"non éclaircies\\", selon Paris\\" , AFP (Gaboneco.com), April 3, 2008 . On April 5, he and his men were detained at the request of the Saint-Denis public prosecutor. Bacar was moved to a different cell on April 7 due to threats he had received from other inmates.\\"Ex-president gets new prison cell in Reunion jail due to inmate threats\\", African Press Agency, April 8, 2008. Bacar appealed his detention, and on April 18 the Saint-Denis Court of Appeal ordered that he and his men be released, although they were to be kept under house arrest at air base 181. The Comoran government was given \\"until May 4 to send a file documenting its extradition request\\". Reports on May 15 said France rejected Bacar's request for asylum. Nevertheless, the French refugee office ruled that he could not be extradited to Comoros because of the risk of persecution. France's State Secretary for Overseas, Yves Jégo, said France would support the Comoran government's efforts. \\"We will continue to act in consultation with the Comoros so that the law can be applied and Col Bacar can be tried.\\" \\"Comoran rebel asylum plea refused\\", BBC News (May 15, 2008).\\"France denies asylum to ousted Comoros leader\\" , AFP, May 15, 2008. In his trial for weapons possession and illegal entry at the Saint-Denis Court of Appeal, Bacar's lawyers argued that Bacar and his men had needed the weapons for self-defense when they travelled from Anjouan to Mayotte and that they had surrendered the weapons to the police on Mayotte upon arrival. On June 5, 2008, Bacar was acquitted on the charge of illegal entry\\"Anjouan: prison avec sursis pour l'ex-président Bacar mais avis négatif d'extradition\\" , AFP, June 5, 2008 . but was given a suspended sentence of three months imprisonment for entering the country with weapons.\\"Reunion expels rebel Comoros leader\\" , AFP, July 19, 2008.

With all his appeals exhausted, Bacar, his brother, and two of his men were expelled from Réunion on the morning of July 19. They were taken to Cotonou, Benin, on a French government flight; the Beninese government had agreed to allow Bacar to stay in Benin. Bacar said that on this occasion that he intended to stay there for as long as his presence was allowed, and he expressed a desire to \\"reflect on our past errors\\". Comoran government spokesman Abdourahim Said Bakar said that the government was \\"disappointed\\" by the expulsion of Bacar to Benin, reiterating the government's position that he should face trial in the Comoros or before an international court.  Embargo  With the decree (EG) Nr. 243/2008 from 17. March 2008 the European Commission introduced restrictive measures against Bacar's former government. All financial and commercial resources of Mohamed Bacar, Jaffar Salim, Mhamed Abdou Madi, Ali Mchindra, Houmadi Souf, Rehema Boinali, Dhoihirou Halidi and Abdou Bacar are frozen. This also affects all companies, corporations, foundations and so on of these persons. Every payment or financial or commercial help to these people has to be approved.

Bradford in 1976. It is a quick and accurate spectroscopic analytical procedure used to measure the concentration of protein in a solution. The reaction is dependent on the amino acid composition of the measured proteins. Principle Figure 1. Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, the binding dye for the Bradford Method Color reaction of protein and Bradford reagent The Bradford assay, a colorimetric protein assay, is based on an absorbance shift of the dye Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye exists in three forms: anionic (blue), neutral (green), and cationic (red). Under acidic conditions, the red form of the dye is converted into its blue form, binding to the protein being assayed. If there's no protein to bind, then the solution will remain brown. The dye forms a strong, noncovalent complex with the protein's carboxyl group by van der Waals force and amino group through electrostatic interactions. During the formation of this complex, the red form of Coomassie dye first donates its free electron to the ionizable groups on the protein, which causes a disruption of the protein's native state, consequently exposing its hydrophobic pockets. These pockets in the protein's tertiary structure bind non-covalently to the non-polar region of the dye via the first bond interaction (van der Waals forces) which position the positive amine groups in proximity with the negative charge of the dye. The bond is further strengthened by the second bond interaction between the two, the ionic interaction. The binding of the protein stabilizes the blue form of the Coomassie dye; thus the amount of the complex present in solution is a measure for the protein concentration, and can be estimated by use of an absorbance reading. The cationic (unbound) form is green / red and has an absorption spectrum maximum historically held to be at 465 nm. The anionic bound form of the dye which is held together by hydrophobic and ionic interactions, has an absorption spectrum maximum historically held to be at 595 nm. The increase of absorbance at 595 nm is proportional to the amount of bound dye, and thus to the amount (concentration) of protein present in the sample. Unlike other protein assays, the Bradford protein assay is less susceptible to interference by various chemical compounds such as sodium, potassium or even carbohydrates like sucrose, that may be present in protein samples. An exception of note is elevated concentrations of detergent. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a common detergent, may be found in protein extracts because it is used to lyse cells by disrupting the membrane lipid bilayer and to denature proteins for SDS- PAGE. While other detergents interfere with the assay at high concentration, the interference caused by SDS is of two different modes, and each occurs at a different concentration. When SDS concentrations are below critical micelle concentration (known as CMC, 0.00333%W/V to 0.0667%) in a Coomassie dye solution, the detergent tends to bind strongly with the protein, inhibiting the protein binding sites for the dye reagent. This can cause underestimations of protein concentration in solution. When SDS concentrations are above CMC, the detergent associates strongly with the green form of the Coomassie dye, causing the equilibrium to shift, thereby producing more of the blue form. This causes an increase in the absorbance at 595 nm independent of protein presence. Other interference may come from the buffer used when preparing the protein sample. A high concentration of buffer will cause an overestimated protein concentration due to depletion of free protons from the solution by conjugate base from the buffer. This will not be a problem if a low concentration of protein (subsequently the buffer) is used. In order to measure the absorbance of a colorless compound a Bradford assay must be performed. Some colorless compounds such as proteins can be quantified at an Optical Density of 280 nm due to the presence of aromatic rings such as Tryptophan, Tyrosine and Phenylalanine but if none of these amino acids are present then the absorption cannot be measured at 280 nm.  Advantages  Many protein-containing solutions have the highest absorption at 280 nm in the spectrophotometer, the UV range. This requires spectrophotometers capable of measuring in the UV range, which many cannot. Additionally, the absorption maxima at 280 nm requires that proteins contain aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine (Y), phenylalanine (F) and/or tryptophan (W). Not all proteins contain these amino acids, a fact which will skew the concentration measurements. If nucleic acids are present in the sample, they would also absorb light at 280 nm, skewing the results further. By using the Bradford protein assay, one can avoid all of these complications by simply mixing the protein samples with the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye (Bradford reagent) and measuring their absorbances at 595 nm, which is in the visible range. The procedure for Bradford protein assay is very easy and simple to follow. It is done in one step where the Bradford reagent is added to a test tube along with the sample. After mixing well, the mixture almost immediately changes to a blue color. When the dye binds to the proteins through a process that takes about 2 minutes, a change in the absorption maximum of the dye from 465 nm to 595 nm in acidic solutions occurs. This dye creates strong noncovalent bonds with the proteins, via electrostatic interactions with the amino and carboxyl groups, as well as Van Der Waals interactions. Only the molecules that bind to the proteins in solution exhibit this change in absorption, which eliminates the concern that unbound molecules of the dye might contribute to the experimentally obtained absorption reading. This process is more beneficial since it is less pricey than other methods, easy to use, and has high sensitivity of the dye for protein. After 5 minutes of incubation, the absorbance can be read at 595 nm using a spectrophotometer; an easily accessible machine. This assay is one of the fastest assays performed on proteins. The total time it takes to set up and complete the assay is under 30 minutes. The entire experiment is done at room temperature. The Bradford protein assay can measure protein quantities as little as 1 to 20 μg. It is an extremely sensitive technique. The dye reagent is a stable ready to use product prepared in phosphoric acid. It can remain at room temperature for up to 2 weeks before it starts to degrade. Protein samples usually contain salts, solvents, buffers, preservatives, reducing agents and metal chelating agents. These molecules are frequently used for solubilizing and stabilizing proteins. Other protein assay like BCA and Lowry are ineffective because molecules like reducing agents interfere with the assay. Using Bradford can be advantageous against these molecules because they are compatible to each other and will not interfere. The linear graph acquired from the assay (absorbance versus protein concentration in μg/mL) can be easily extrapolated to determine the concentration of proteins by using the slope of the line. It is a sensitive technique. It is also very simple: measuring the OD at 595 nm after 5 minutes of incubation. This method can also make use of a Vis spectrophotometer.  Disadvantages  The Bradford assay is linear over a short range, typically from 0 µg/mL to 2000 µg/mL, often making dilutions of a sample necessary before analysis. In making these dilutions, error in one dilution is compounded in further dilutions resulting in a linear relationship that may not always be accurate. Basic conditions and detergents, such as SDS, can interfere with the dye's ability to bind to the protein through its side chains. However, there are some detergent-compatible Bradford reagents. The Bradford assay depends on the sequence of the protein. Thus, if the protein does not contain an ideal number of aromatic residues, then the dye will not be able to bind to the protein efficiently. Another disadvantage of the Bradford Protein Assay is that this method depends on comparing the absorbance of the protein to that of a standard protein. If the protein does not react to the dye in a similar way as the standard protein, it is possible that the concentration measured will be inaccurate. The reagents in this method tend to stain the test tubes. Same test tubes cannot be used since the stain would affect the absorbance reading. This method is also time sensitive. When more than one solution is tested, it is important to make sure every sample is incubated for the same amount of time for accurate comparison. It is also inhibited by the presence of detergents, although this problem can be alleviated by the addition of cyclodextrins to the assay mixture. Much of the non-linearity stems from the equilibrium between two different forms of the dye which is perturbed by adding the protein. The Bradford assay linearizes by measuring the ratio of the absorbances, 595 over 450 nm. This modified Bradford assay is approximately 10 times more sensitive than the conventional one. The Coomassie Blue G250 dye used to bind to the proteins in the original Bradford method readily binds to arginine and lysine groups of proteins. This is a disadvantage because the preference of the dye to bind to these amino acids can result in a varied response of the assay between different proteins. Changes to the original method, such as increasing the pH by adding NaOH or adding more dye have been made to correct this variation. Although these modifications result in a less sensitive assay, a modified method becomes sensitive to detergents that can interfere with sample.  Sample Bradford procedure   Materials  * Lyophilized bovine plasma gamma globulin * Coomassie Brilliant Blue 1 * 0.15 M NaCl * Spectrophotometer and cuvettes * Micropipettes  Procedure (Standard Assay, 20-150 µg protein; 200-1500 µg/mL)  # Prepare a series of standards diluted with 0.15 M NaCl to final concentrations of 0 (blank = No protein), 250, 500, 750 and 1500 µg/mL. Also prepare serial dilutions of the unknown sample to be measured. # Add 100 µL of each of the above to a separate test tube (or spectrophotometer tube if using a Spectronic 20). # Add 5.0 mL of Coomassie Blue to each tube and mix by vortex, or inversion. # Adjust the spectrophotometer to a wavelength of 595 nm, using the tube which contains no protein (blank). # Wait 5 minutes and read each of the standards and each of the samples at 595 nm wavelength. # Plot the absorbance of the standards vs. their concentration. Compute the extinction coefficient and calculate the concentrations of the unknown samples.  Procedure (Micro Assay, 1-10 µg protein/mL)  # Prepare standard concentrations of protein of 1, 5, 7.5 and 10 µg/mL. Prepare a blank of NaCl only. Prepare a series of sample dilutions. # Add 100 µL of each of the above to separate tubes (use microcentrifuge tubes) and add 1.0 mL of Coomassie Blue to each tube. # Turn on and adjust a spectrophotometer to a wavelength of 595 nm, and blank the spectrophotometer using 1.5 mL cuvettes. # Wait 2 minutes and read the absorbance of each standard and sample at 595 nm. # Plot the absorbance of the standards vs. their concentration. Compute the extinction coefficient and calculate the concentrations of the unknown samples. Using data obtained to find concentration of unknown In summary, in order to find a standard curve, one must use varying concentrations of BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) in order to create a standard curve with concentration plotted on the x-axis and absorbance plotted on the y-axis. Only a narrow concentration of BSA is used (2-10 ug/mL) in order to create an accurate standard curve. Using a broad range of protein concentration will make it harder to determine the concentration of the unknown protein. This standard curve is then used to determine the concentration of the unknown protein. The following elaborates on how one goes from the standard curve to the concentration of the unknown. First, add a line of best fit, or Linear regression and display the equation on the chart. Ideally, the R2 value will be as close to 1 as possible. R represents the sum of the square values of the fit subtracted from each data point. Therefore, if R2 is much less than one, consider redoing the experiment to get one with more reliable data. Graph 1. Actual BSA data attained from a micro scale UV-Vis Spectrophotometer The equation displayed on the chart gives a means for calculating the absorbance and therefore concentration of the unknown samples. In Graph 1, x is concentration and y is absorbance, so one must rearrange the equation to solve for x and enter the absorbance of the measured unknown. It is likely that the unknown will have absorbance numbers outside the range of the standard. These should not be included calculations, as the equation given cannot apply to numbers outside of its limitations. In a large scale, one must compute the extinction coefficient using the Beer-Lambert Law A=εLC in which A is the measured absorbance, ε is the slope of the standard curve, L is the length of the cuvette, and C is the concentration being determined. In a micro scale, a cuvette may not be used and therefore one only has to rearrange to solve for x. Table 1. Actual assay data for determine concentration of unknown based on line of best fit of the above standard curve In order to attain a concentration that makes sense with the data, the dilutions, concentrations, and units of the unknown must be normalized (Table 1). To do this, one must divide concentration by volume of protein in order to normalize concentration and multiply by amount diluted to correct for any dilution made in the protein before performing the assay.

Biography Born in Torquay, Devon, Brown was the son of a fisherman and prominent Baptist and it was through following his father that he came to preach, gaining much experience as a public speaker. He soon came to the attention of the local Liberals and became a prominent public speaker at political meetings. Brown served in the First World War: in 1914 he joined the Sportsman's Battalion and in 1916 was commissioned as an officer in the Somerset Light Infantry. He was mentioned in dispatches and was awarded the Military Cross. After three unsuccessful attempts in other constituencies, he was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Rugby in the 1923 general election but lost his seat in the 1924 general election. In 1927 he returned to Parliament in a by-election at Leith. During this time he became a devoted follower of Sir John Simon as the latter became increasingly at odds with the leader of the Liberals, David Lloyd George, and the party's support, from 1929, for the minority Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald. In 1931 he followed Simon in resigning the Liberal party whip and then subsequently in setting up the Liberal Nationals. In cabinet In the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald, Brown became Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health in November 1931. The following year the official Liberal Cabinet ministers resigned from the government and Brown was promoted to become Secretary for Mines. In 1935 when MacDonald was succeeded as Prime Minister by Stanley Baldwin, Brown entered the Cabinet as Minister of Labour. This proved controversial as many believed that the Minister of Transport Leslie Hore- Belisha, had a stronger claim to be the next Liberal National to enter the Cabinet, though as unemployment was one of the government's biggest problems, many others felt that Brown's appointment to the job was not one to envy. He held the post for the next five years under both Baldwin and his successor, Neville Chamberlain. One of his most prominent achievements was the Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936 which extended social security to nearly all workers in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. In another sphere he oversaw the formation of the National Joint Advisory Committee which assisted in wage control, compulsory arbitration, and direction of labour. He also helped workers in distributing to organise and took great pride when in 1937 the Trades Union Congress passed a unanimous resolution thanking him for this. In 1939 his department was expanded to incorporate overseeing National Service. Party leadership When Chamberlain fell in 1940 he was succeeded by Winston Churchill who moved Brown to the position of Secretary of State for Scotland, an unusual move as Brown, despite sitting for a Scottish constituency, was English by birth. At the same time Brown became the leader of the Liberal Nationals after Sir John Simon was transferred to the House of Lords. Brown served as Secretary of State for Scotland for a year before becoming Minister of Health for two years and finally Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Brown's tenure as leader of the Liberal Nationals was one of decline, as the party saw its influence diminish. Many in the party had regretted the division of Liberal forces a decade earlier and Brown undertook negotiations with the Liberal Party leader Sir Archibald Sinclair over a potential reunion, but these talks foundered on the question of continued support for the National Government after the war. The change in the leadership of the Conservatives was also unfavourable and when, in 1945, Churchill formed his \\"Caretaker\\" government he did not include Brown or any other senior Liberal Nationals in the Cabinet, despite claiming to head a \\"National\\" administration. Brown was instead appointed Minister of Aircraft Production. In the 1945 general election Brown lost his seat. Retirement and legacy After the war Brown devoted his attention to the church, often visiting other parts of the Commonwealth. Brown had a reputation for being a fast speaker and many contemporary political commentators estimated that he could deliver a statement to the House of Commons faster than any other minister. The size of his voice was also noted. Baldwin once saw Brown in a phonebox at the House of Commons and is said to have remarked, \\"I didn't think he needed a phone to communicate with his constituents.\\" Another more famous story reflecting on Brown's strong voice, is told of when Stanley Baldwin was living at 11 Downing Street he was startled by a great shouting in the building. When informed that it was Ernest Brown talking to Scotland, Baldwin said \\"Why doesn't he use the telephone?\\" References Bibliography * Torrance, David, The Scottish Secretaries (Birlinn 2006)  External links   Parliamentary Archives, Papers of Ernest Brown MP, 1881-1962 Category:1881 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Chancellors of the Duchy of Lancaster Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Edinburgh constituencies Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Chamberlain peacetime government, 1937–1939 Category:Ministers in the Chamberlain wartime government, 1939–1940 Category:Ministers in the Churchill caretaker government, 1945 Category:Ministers in the Churchill wartime government, 1940–1945 Category:National Liberal Party (UK, 1931) politicians Category:People from Torquay Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Scottish Baptists Category:Scottish Liberal Party MPs Category:Secretaries of State for Scotland Category:Somerset Light Infantry officers Category:UK MPs 1923–1924 Category:UK MPs 1924–1929 Category:UK MPs 1929–1931 Category:UK MPs 1931–1935 Category:UK MPs 1935–1945 ","title":"Ernest Brown (British politician)"},{"id":"1098922","text":"Edefors Old Church Harads () is a locality situated in Boden Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden, approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of the Arctic Circle, with 501 inhabitants in 2010.

It is a nocturnal, omnivorous crustacean. They are gregarious and thrive in tropical areas near water. Distribution The Australian land hermit crab is endemic to northern parts of Australia including northern Western Australia, Northern Territory and northern Queensland.  Biology  The Australian land hermit crab (Coenobita variabilis) reaches a carapace length of . They closely resemble the Pacific hermit crab (Coenobita compressus) in appearance and they both have a shortened aquatic development stage. Australian land hermit crabs are light brown to pale brown in colour, with two dark ovals on the front of the head. Their eyestalks are long and are the same colour as the body. Each claw has a dark vertical stripe. They have dark brown spots all over the legs. The abdomen is short and fat. Shell preference Photo of a Coenobita variabilis land hermit crab from Australia. The preferred seashells of C. variabilis include Babylonia, Nerita, Phasianella, Thais, Tonna and Turban seashells. They are also found to be fond of several varieties of land snail shells such as Aratan snail and rice snail. As the hermit crabs grow, they must exchange their shell for a larger one. Since intact gastropod shells are not an unlimited resource, there is frequently strong competition for the available shells, with hermit crabs fighting over shells. The availability of empty shells depends on the abundance of the gastropods and hermit crabs, but most importantly on the frequency of organisms that prey on gastropods but leave the shells intact. A hermit crab with a shell which is too tight cannot grow as fast as hermit crabs with well-fitting shells, and is more likely to be eaten. Although hermit crabs need to change shells regularly, they will not abandon their old shell unless they have a larger and newer one to change into and unless they feel safe.

HMWK is inactive until it either adheres to binding proteins beneath an endothelium disrupted by injury, thereby initiating coagulation; or it binds to intact endothelial cells or platelets for functions other than coagulation.  Other names  In the past, HMWK has been called HMWK-kallikrein factor, Flaujeac factor (1975), Fitzgerald factor (1975), and Williams-Fitzgerald-Flaujeac factor, - the eponyms being for people first reported to have HMWK deficiency. Its current accepted name is to contrast it with low-molecular-weight kininogen (LMWK) which has a similar function to HMWK in the tissue (as opposed to serum) kinin-kallikrein system.  Structure and function  HMWK is an alpha-globulin with six functional domains. It circulates as a single- chain 626 amino acid polypeptide . The heavy chain contains domains 1, 2, and 3; the light chain, domains 5 and 6. Domain 4 links the heavy and light chains. The domains contain the following functional sites: *Domain 1 - calcium binding *Domain 2 - cysteine protease inhibition *Domain 3 - cysteine protease inhibition; platelet and endothelial cell binding *Domain 4 - bradykinin generation *Domain 5 - heparin and cell binding; antiangiogenic properties; binding to negatively charged surfaces *Domain 6 - prekallikrein and factor XI binding (amino acids 420 to 510)(histidine rich) HMWK is one of four proteins which interact to initiate the contact activation pathway (also called the intrinsic pathway) of coagulation: the other three are Factor XII, Factor XI and prekallikrein. HMWK is not enzymatically active, and functions only as a cofactor for the activation of kallikrein and factor XII. It is also necessary for the activation of factor XI by factor XIIa. HMWK is also a precursor of bradykinin; this vasodilator is released through positive feedback by kallikrein. HMWK is a strong inhibitor of cysteine proteinases. Responsible for this activity are domains 2 and 3 on its heavy chain.  Genetics  The gene for both LMWK and HMWK is located on the 3rd chromosome (3q26).  Measurement  Measurement of HMWK is usually done with mixing studies, in which plasma deficient in HMWK is mixed with the patient's sample and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is determined. Results are expressed in % of normal - a value under 60% indicates a deficiency.  Clinical features  The existence of HMWK was hypothesised in 1975 when several patients were described with a deficiency of a class of plasma protein and a prolonged bleeding time and PTT. There is no increased risk of bleeding or any other symptoms, so the deficiency is a trait, not a disease.

(1560–1622), a mathematician and counselor to Duke Joachim Frederick of Liegnitz. The family eventually moved to Schweidnitz in Lower Silesia (today Świdnica, Poland). At an early age Maria married (in 1623) the lawyer David von Gerstmann. After his death in 1626, she married (in 1630) Elias von Löwen, also from Silesia.Article „Löwen, Elias von“ in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayrischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 19 (1884), ab Seite 311, Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe in Wikisource, URL: http://de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:L%C3%B6wen,_Elias_von&oldid;=810951 (Version vom 21. August 2009, 02:44 Uhr UTC) Elias von Lowen was also known as Elie de Loewen was a physician at Pitschen and studied astronomy. Elias von Lowen was Maria's tutor and encouraged Maria to pursue astronomy before their marriage in 1630. Together they made observation of Venus on December 14, 1627 and Jupiter on April 1628. Other areas of study included medicine, poetry, painting, music, mathematics, ancient languages, and history. Elias and Maria had three sons: Elias Theodor, Anton Heinrich and Franz Ludwig. During the Thirty Year's War from 1618 to 1648 Maria and Elias von Löwen stayed in the Cistercians convent of Olobok, Poland. While at the cloister in Poland, Cunitz expanded her astronomical tables to include all of the planets at any moment in time. At the end of the Thirty Year's War the couple returned to their home at Pitschen in Silesia. In 1650, Maria privately published of her own expense Urania propitia in German and Latin as a dedication to Emperor Ferdinand III. Urania propitia was a simplification of Kepler's Rudolphine Tables due to their difficulty of producing calculations and applications, because the use of logarithms. In the evening of May 25, 1656 in Pitschen, Silesia a large fire destroyed most of the homes in the city, including Maria's home, Maria lost astronomical instruments and Elias lost medical instruments. The fire consumed Maria's books, letters, and more than 200 records of astronomical observations. Maria became a widow again in 1661, and died at Pitzen on August 22, 1664. The year of Maria's birth is uncertain. No birth, baptism or similar documents have ever been located. The year was speculated about in the first major German-language publication about Maria Cunitz of 1798.Johann Ephraim Scheibel: Nachrichten von der Frau von Lewen geb. Cunitzin. In: Astronomische Bibliographie, der 3. Abteilung, zweite Fortsetzung, Schriften aus dem siebzehnten Jahrhundert von 1631 bis 1650 aus der Reihe Einleitung zur mathematischen Bücherkenntnis. Nr. 20, Breslau 1798, pages 361-378. Paul Knötel appears to be the first to give the year 1604 as the year of Maria's birth.Paul Knötel: Maria Cunitia. In: Friedrich Andreae (Hrsg.): Schlesier des 17. bis 19. Jahrhunderts, Schlesische Lebensbilder. Nr. 3, Breslau 1928, pages 61-65. This date seemed to make sense since her parents married the previous year. Other authors later appear to have repeated the same year. The proof that Maria was actually born in 1610 is furnished by an anthology with congratulation poems on her first wedding, in connection with a letter of Elias A Leonibus to Johannes Hevelius from the year 1651, noted by Ingrid Guentherodt.Ingrid Guentherodt: Maria Cunitia.

Nr. 20, 1991, pages 547-584. Full details concerning the family of Maria Cunitz have been published by KIaus Liwowsky. Accomplishments The publication of the book Urania propitia (Olse,Name Olse as on Blaeu's 1645 map of Silesia :File:Blaeu 1645 - Silesia Ducatus.jpg Silesia, 1650) gained Cunitz a European reputation. Cunitz's husband, Elias von Löwen, wrote a preface in Urania propitia to cast out any rumors that it was Elias von Löwen that computed the tables and to show support for his wife. Urania propitia was written in Latin and German to further accessibility in the simplification of Kepler's Rudolphine tables (1627) by correcting several of Kepler's errors. Maria's work allowed for simpler algorithms leading to fewer calculations and errors, but Maria created new errors by omitting some of the small coefficients in her formulas. Urania propitia provided new tables, new ephemera, and a more elegant solution to Kepler's Problem, which is to determine the position of a planet in its orbit as a function of time. Today, her book is also credited for its contribution to the development of the German scientific language.Ingrid Güntherodt (Guentherodt), Maria Cunitz und Maria Sibylla Merian: Pionirinnen der Deutsches Wissenschaftssprache im 17. Jahrhundret, Zeitschrift für Germanistische Linguistik, Vol. 14, 1, pp. 23-49, DOI: 10.1515/zfgl.1986.14.1.23, Oct.2009. Due to her many talents and accomplishments, Cunitz was called the \\"Silesian Pallas\\" by J.B. Delambre, who also compared her to Hypatia of Alexandria during his study of history in astronomy.

Urania propitia was privately published and as of 2016 there are nine physical copies in the world along with multiple online copies. Physical copies can be found in the Library of the Astronomical Observatory of Paris, Library of the University of Florida, in the exhibit of Galileo and Kepler at the University Libraries of Norman, Oklahoma, and Bloomington Lilly Library of Indiana University. Prior to June 10, 2004 the first edition of Urania propitia was located at The Library of The Earls of Macclesfield in the Shirburn Castle: Part 2 Science A-C section. The book was sold at the Sotheby's auction house for $19,827 USD.  Nationality  left Maria Cunitz is usually characterized as Silesian, for example in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition of 1911. She was born and spent most of her life in the Holy Roman Empire, which included non-German minorities, ruled by the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy.

About three centuries after Maria's lifetime it was reassigned to Poland after World War II. During Maria's lifetime, nationality did not play as significant a role in determining person's identity as it does today.\\"The Dynamics of the Policies of Ethnic Cleansing in Silesia in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\\" by Tomasz Kamusella, Open Society Institute, Center for Publishing Development, Budapest, Hungary, 1999, Nevertheless, multiple later sources felt the need to assign to Maria Cunitz a nationality relevant to their own time. She has mostly been described as German, for example in the Biographical Dictionary of Woman in Science.Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie, Joy Dorothy Harvey, \\"The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives from Ancient Times to the Mid-20th Century\\", Routledge, 2000, pg. 309, She published in German. She has been also described as PolishStorm Dunlop, Michèle Gerbaldi, \\"Stargazers: the contribution of amateurs to astronomy\\", Springer-Verlag, 1988, pg. 40 and some consider her to be the first Polish woman astronomer.

The oxides undergo carbothermal reduction in the furnaces, producing the ferromanganese. Ferromanganese is used as a deoxidizer for steel. Henry Bessemer invented the use of ferromanganese as a method of introducing manganese in controlled proportions during the production of steel.

History On the collapse of the Almohad Caliphate's rule around 1236, the kingdom of Tlemcen became independent under the rule of the Zayyanids, and Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan.Delfina S. Ruano (2006), Hafsids, in Josef W Meri (ed.), Medieval Islamic Civilization: an Encyclopedia. Routledge., p. 309. Ibn Zyan was able to maintain control over the rival Berber groups, and when faced with the outside threat of the Marinids, he formed an alliance with the Sultan of Granada and the King of Castile, Alfonso X. After ibn Zyan's death, the Marinid sultan besieged Tlemcen for eight years and finally captured it in 1337–48, with Abu al-Hasan 'Ali as the new ruler. After a period of self-rule, it was governed again by the Marinid dynasty from 1352–59 under Abu Inan Faris. The Marinids reoccupied it periodically, particularly in 1360 and 1370.http://www.qantara- med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=603⟨=en In both cases, the Marinids found that they were unable to hold the region against local resistance.I. Hrbek (1997), The disintegration of political unity in the Maghrib, in Joseph Ki-Zerbo & Djibril T Niane (eds.) (1997), General History of Africa, vol. IV: Africa from the Twelfth to the Sixteenth Century (abridged ed.) UNESCO, James Curry Ltd., and Univ. Calif. Press., pp. 34–43. but these episodes appear to have marked the beginning of the end of the Zayyanid dynasty. In the 15th century, expansion eastward was attempted, but proved disastrous, as consequences of these incursions they were so weakened that over the following two centuries, the Zayyanid kingdom was intermittently a vassal of Hafsid Ifriqiya, Marinid Morocco, or Aragon. When the Spanish took the city of Oran from the kingdom in 1509, continuous pressure from the Berbers prompted the Spanish to attempt a counterattack against the city of Tlemcen (1543), which was deemed by the Papacy to be a crusade. The Spanish failed to take the city in the first attack, although the strategic vulnerability of Tlemcen caused the kingdom's weight to shift toward the safer and more heavily fortified corsair base at Algiers. In 1554, the Kingdom of Tlemcen became a protectorate of the Ottoman Empire, which later deposed the Zayyanid dynasty and annexed the country to the Regency of Algiers. The failure of this kingdom from ever being a formidable foe can be linked to a number of reasons. First, they had no geographical or cultural unity. They also constantly faced internal issues, and they did not have fixed frontiers, and finally most important was the fact that they depended on Arab nomads for their military.

She is notable as the first American journalist to be expelled from Nazi Germany in 1934 and as one of the few women news commentators on radio during the 1930s. She is regarded by some as the \\"First Lady of American Journalism\\" and was recognized by Time magazine in 1939 as being equal in influence to Eleanor Roosevelt. Life and career Dorothy Thompson was born in Lancaster, New York, in 1893, one of three children of Peter and Margaret (Grierson) Thompson. Her siblings were Peter Willard Thompson and Margaret Thompson (later Mrs. Howard Wilson). Her mother died when Dorothy was seven (in April 1901), leaving Peter, a Methodist preacher, to raise his children alone. Peter soon remarried, but Dorothy did not get along with his new wife, Elizabeth Abbott Thompson. In 1908, Peter sent Dorothy to Chicago to live with his two sisters to avoid further conflict. Here, she attended Lewis Institute for two years before transferring to Syracuse University as a junior. At Syracuse, she studied politics and economics and graduated with a degree in 1914. Because she had the opportunity to be educated, unlike many women of the time, Thompson felt that she had a social obligation to fight for women's suffrage in the United States, which would become the base of her ardent political beliefs. Shortly after graduation, Thompson moved to Buffalo, New York and became involved in the women's suffrage campaign. She worked there until 1920, when she went abroad to pursue her journalism career. Journalism in Europe Sinclair Lewis and Dorothy Thompson during their honeymoon caravan trip in England, 1928 After working for women’s suffrage in the United States, Thompson relocated to Europe in 1920 to pursue her journalism career. She was interested in the early Zionist movement. Her big break occurred when she visited Ireland in 1920 and was the last to interview Terence MacSwiney, one of the major leaders of the Sinn Féin movement. It was the last interview MacSwiney gave before he was arrested days later and died two months after that. Because of her success abroad, she was appointed Vienna correspondent for the Philadelphia Public Ledger. While working in Vienna, Thompson focused on becoming fluent in German. She met and worked alongside correspondents John Gunther and G. E. R. Gedye. In 1925, she was promoted to Chief of the Central European Service for the Public Ledger. She resigned in 1927 and, not long after, the New York Post appointed her head of its Berlin bureau in Germany. There she witnessed firsthand the rise of the National Socialist or Nazi party. According to her biographer, Peter Kurth, Thompson was \\"the undisputed queen of the overseas press corps, the first woman to head a foreign news bureau of any importance.\\" During this time Thompson cultivated many literary friends, particularly among exiled German authors. Among her acquaintances from this period were Ödön von Horváth, Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, Stefan Zweig and Fritz Kortner. She developed a close friendship with author Carl Zuckmayer. In Berlin she even got involved in a lesbian affair with German author Christa Winsloe, while still married, claiming \\"the right to love\\".Lewis, Jone Johnson. \\"Dorothy Thompson Quotes.\\" Women's History\\" 7 Mar 2010 Thompson's most significant work abroad took place in Germany in the early 1930s. While working in Munich, Thompson met and interviewed Adolf Hitler for the first time in 1931. This would be the basis for her subsequent book, I Saw Hitler, in which she wrote about the dangers of him winning power in Germany. Thompson described Hitler in the following terms: \\"He is formless, almost faceless, a man whose countenance is a caricature, a man whose framework seems cartilaginous, without bones. He is inconsequent and voluble, ill poised and insecure. He is the very prototype of the little man.\\" Later, when the full force of Nazism had crashed over Europe, Thompson was asked to defend her \\"Little Man\\" remarks; it seemed she had underestimated Hitler. The Nazis considered both the book and her articles offensive and, in August 1934, Thompson was expelled from Germany. She was the first American journalist to be kicked out. At the New York Tribune Dorothy Thompson House, New York City, New York In 1936 Thompson began writing \\"On the Record\\", a New York Tribune syndicated newspaper column. It was read by over ten million people and carried by more than 170 papers. She also wrote a monthly column for the Ladies' Home Journal for 24 years (1937–1961); its topics were far removed from war and politics, focusing on gardening, children, art, and other domestic and women's-interest topics. Radio and the Herschel Grynszpan affair Around the same time as she started \\"On the Record\\", NBC hired Thompson as a news commentator. She began in 1936 and remained with NBC until 1938. Her radio broadcasts went on to become some of the most popular in the United States, making her one of the most sought after female public speakers of her time. When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Thompson went on the air for fifteen consecutive days and nights. In 1938, Thompson championed the cause of a Polish-German Jewish teenager, Herschel Grynszpan, whose assassination in Paris of a minor German diplomat, Ernst vom Rath, had been used as propaganda by the Nazis to trigger the events of Kristallnacht in Germany. Thompson's broadcast on NBC radio was heard by millions of listeners, and led to an outpouring of sympathy for the young assassin. Under the banner of the Journalists' Defense Fund, over $40,000 USD was collected, enabling famed European lawyer Vincent de Moro- Giafferi to take up Grynszpan's case. Fame and controversy In 1939, Thompson was featured on the cover of Time, with an accompanying picture of her speaking into an NBC radio microphone. The article was captioned \\"she rides in the smoking car\\" and it declared that \\"she and Eleanor Roosevelt are undoubtedly the most influential women in the U.S.\\" She was one of the most respected women of her age. The article explained Thompson's influence: \\"Dorothy Thompson is the U.S. clubwoman's woman. She is read, believed and quoted by millions of women who used to get their political opinions from their husbands, who got them from Walter Lippmann.\\" In Woman of the Year (1942) Katharine Hepburn played Tess Harding, a character directly based on Thompson. The Broadway musical is based on Thompson as well, this time played by Lauren Bacall. In 1941, Thompson wrote \\"Who Goes Nazi?\\" for Harper's Magazine. She was a keynote speaker at the Biltmore Conference, and by war's end was regarded as one of the most effective spokespersons for Zionism. Thompson switched her views round radically after a trip to Palestine in 1945, and ran into difficulties, including accusations of anti-Semitism, which she strongly rebuffed, after being warned that hostility toward Israel was, in the American press world, \\"almost a definition of professional suicide\\".Maguire, Gil (April 28, 2015), \\"Obama's role model to journalists – Dorothy Thompson – turned against Zionism and was silenced US Politics\\".

Family life Thompson with Lewis and son in 1935 She was married three times, most famously to second husband and Nobel Prize in literature winner Sinclair Lewis. In 1923 she married her first husband, Hungarian Joseph Bard; they divorced in 1927. Thompson married Lewis in 1928 and acquired a house in Vermont. They had one son, Michael Lewis, born in 1930.\\"Michael Lewis, the actor, Sinclair's son, dies at 44\\", New York Times, March 7, 1975. Retrieved April 29, 2018. The couple divorced in 1942.

It was discovered on 16 October 1941, by Finnish astronomer Liisi Oterma at Turku Observatory in Southwest Finland. It was later named after Finnish geodesist Tauno Kukkamäki.  Orbit and classification  Kukkamäki is a stony S-type asteroid. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.4–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 11 months (1,429 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. Kukkamäki was first identified as at Lowell Observatory in 1929, extending the body's observation arc by 12 prior to its official discovery observation.  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Kukkamäki measures between 9.86 and 12.14 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.193 and 0.337, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and derives a diameter of 11.30 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.1.  Lightcurve  During an asteroid survey conducted at McDonald Observatory and CTIO in the 1980s, a rotational lightcurve of Kukkamäki was obtained by astronomer Richard Binzel. The photoelectric observation gave a well-defined rotation period of 4.06 hours with a brightness variation of 0.32 magnitude (), superseding a previous result based on a fragmentary lightcurve.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Finnish geodesist Tauno Kukkamäki (1909–1997), who was the director of the Finnish Geodetic Institute for many years and the president of the International Association of Geodesy. He was also a distinguished disciple of Yrjö Väisälä. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 November 1979 ().

The engine was only used in the Saturn S-series line of vehicles (SL, SC, SW) from 1991 through 2002. It was available in chain-driven SOHC or DOHC variants. This was an innovative engine for the time using the lost foam casting process for the engine block and cylinder head. Saturn was one of the first to use this casting process in a full-scale high-production environment. Both engine types used the same engine block. Engine block The engine utilized a water- cooled aluminum block. The main bearing caps were made of ductile iron and held in place with two bolts each. The cylinder block bores had interference fit cast iron liners for the piston rings to sit against. The engine block was made from 319.1 aluminum alloy and the liners were made from grey iron. Crankshaft The crankshaft was supported by five main bearings with thrust taken at the middle bearing. 1991 and 1992 engines had a different crankshaft than 1993 and later engines, whose crankshafts had reluctor ring slots advanced ten degrees for easier starting. 1991 to 1998 crankshafts incorporated four counterweights, while those from 1999 to 2002 incorporated eight. Connecting rods and pistons From 1991 to 1998 the connecting rods were forged steel with standard type crank pin bearings. SOHC engines during that period used a dished piston design whereas the twin cam engines used a flat top piston with 2 recesses for the intake valves. Twin cam pistons received several re-designs throughout the production run aimed at reducing oil consumption issues. These included reducing the clearance between the top of the piston and the first compression ring, redesigning the skirts on the pistons and the oiling ports on the bottom of the pistons. For the 1999 model year all pistons were totally redesigned. Both engines used the flat top pistons with 2 valve recesses and featured a new hypereutectic design with coated skirts. Also for 1999 all connecting rods switched to a powder forged design and cracked bearing caps. The piston pins floated in the connecting rod bushings. The pistons were cast aluminum alloy with the piston pins being retained with snap rings. Timing chain The timing chain was hydraulic tensioned and had a ratchet mechanism to keep the chain tight. The timing chain rode on one pivoting chain guide resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper timing chain guide in between the camshaft sprockets. The timing chain was lubricated via cast-off from the top of the cylinder head and one 'squirter' on the oil pump housing. The SOHC and DOHC engines used different timing chain sets. SOHC LK0/L24 The SOHC (LK0/L24) cylinder head had 8 valves and was made of lost foam cast aluminum. The camshaft was located in the center of the cylinder head and driven by a chain off the front crankshaft sprocket. Motion from the camshaft was transmitted to the eight valves by the hydraulic lifters and rocker arms. The LK0 engine first used TBI (Throttle Body Injection) for fuel delivery and was rated at at 5000 rpm and at 2400 rpm from 1991 to 1994. The L24 engine received MPFI (Multi-Port Fuel Injection) in 1995 which increased power output to at 5000 rpm and at 2400 rpm. In 1999, these engines switched from the recessed top pistons of the previous models to all new flat top pistons that were also used in the twin cam models. The cylinder head was also redesigned to keep the compression ratio at 8.8:1 even with the flat top pistons and now featured provisions for an air injection reaction system. This engine was used from 1995 to 2002. The SOHC engine was available on the base model S-series vehicles (SC1, SL, SL1, SW, SW1) 1992 through 1998 L24 cylinder heads developed issues with cracks developing in the fifth camshaft journal, located closest to #4 cylinder. The hairline crack would develop between the oil feed port of that journal and the coolant passages in the cylinder head. Symptoms would range from overheating to low coolant, however, most cars affected by this issue exhibited oil migration into the cooling system. The resulting mixture of the two fluids would result in a thick brown \\"milkshake\\"-like mixture, visible in the coolant overflow tank. Saturn released unadvertised policy which would cover this issue, extending the warranty on the cylinder head to 6 years or . Repair required the replacement of the cylinder head. and flushing of the coolant system. Badly affected cars would see coolant in the oil, as well as oil in the coolant, and would require the replacement of the complete engine assembly. Until the cylinder head casting was redesigned some time in 1998, some vehicles would require this repair more than once, and replacement cylinder heads could develop the same crack. It was estimated that between 2% and 5% of SOHC Saturn S-Series vehicles were affected by this defect. DOHC engines had a different cylinder head, and did not suffer the same issue. DOHC LL0 The Twin Cam LL0 engine in a 1992 SC2 The DOHC cylinder head had 16 valves and was made of lost foam cast aluminium. The camshafts were held in the cylinder head with bearing caps and driven by a chain off the front crankshaft sprocket. Motion from the camshafts was transmitted to the 16 valves by direct-acting hydraulic lifters. LL0 cylinder heads were changed slightly in 1995, when Saturn adopted electronic, linear EGR mechanisms, over the previous vacuum actuated design. The head casting was changed to accommodate different mounting surface of the new valve. All LL0 engines used MPFI and were rated at at 6000 rpmSaturn corporation specification sheet as shown on website http://www.saturnfans.com/photos/showphoto.php?photo=53949 and at 4800 rpm. The DOHC engine was available on the upper-level model S-series vehicles (SC2, SL2, SW2). A revision of the LL0 appeared in 1999 and used a roller camshaft with hydraulic lifters and rocker arms, but power was unchanged. Also for 1999 provisions for a new air injection reaction system was introduced aimed at improving engine emissions.

It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification, and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives. It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead. The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels. Letters refer to powered axles, and numbers to unpowered (or idler) axles. \\"A\\" refers to one powered axle, \\"B\\" to two powered axles in a row, \\"C\\" to three powered axles in a row, and \\"D\\" to four powered axles in a row. \\"1\\" refers to one idler axle, and \\"2\\" to two idler axles in a row. A dash (\\"-\\") separates trucks, or wheel assemblies. A plus sign (\\"+\\") refers to articulation, either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers. 1A-A1 \\"1A-A1\\" means there are two trucks (or wheel assemblies) under the unit. Each truck has one powered axle and one idler axle, with the idler axles to the outside. Examples include Budd RDC Diesel MU (DMU) cars. 1B-1B \\"1B-1B\\" means there are two trucks with a leading idler axle in front of two powered axles. This arrangement was used to upgrade the B-B arrangement of two EMC 1800 hp B-B locomotives owned by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1938, for greater stability at speed. 1-D \\"1-D\\" means there are two trucks or groups of axles; the \\"1\\" truck is under the front of the unit, and has one idler axle. The remaining 4 axles are rigidly mounted to the frame behind this lead truck (or grouped in a second truck). This is roughly the equivalent of a 2-8-0 Consolidation in the Whyte notation, particularly when built as a 1-truck/4 rigid axle locomotive. The only known examples are a series of diesel boxcab locomotives built and owned by the Texas Mexican Railway.Texas-Mexican 701A 2-A1A \\"2-A1A\\" means there are two trucks or wheel assemblies. The \\"2\\" truck is under the front of the unit, and has two idler axles in a row. The \\"A1A\\" truck is under the rear of the unit, and has one powered axle, one idler axle, and one more powered axle. An example is the FM OP800 railcar, six of which were built by the St. Louis Car Company exclusively for the Southern Railway in 1939. 2-B \\"2-B\\" means there are two trucks, or wheel assemblies. The \\"2\\" truck is under the front of the unit, and has two idler axles in a row. The \\"B\\" truck is under the rear of the unit, and has two powered axles. Examples include the three lightweight power cars built by ALCO/ACF in 1935 and 1937 for use with the Rebel streamliners. 3-A1A \\"3-A1A\\" means there are two trucks or wheel assemblies. The \\"3\\" truck is under the front of the unit, and has three idler axles in a row. The \\"A1A\\" truck is under the rear of the unit, and has one powered axle, one idler axle, and one more powered axle. An example is the later built FM OP800 railcar, six of which were built by the St. Louis Car Company exclusively for the Southern Railway in 1939. A1-1A \\"A1-1A\\" means there are two trucks or wheel assemblies under the unit. Each truck has one powered axle and one idler axle, with the powered axles to the outside.

The \\"2\\" truck is under the back of the unit, and has two idler axles in a row. An example is the Silver Charger power car for the General Pershing Zephyr. A1A-3 \\"A1A-3\\" means there are two trucks. The \\"A1A\\" truck is under the front of the unit, and has one powered axle, one idler axle, and one more powered axle. The \\"3\\" truck is under the back of the unit, and has three idler axles in a row. An example is the Baldwin DR-6-2-10 cab unit, only one of which was built for the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1948. A1A-A1A \\"A1A-A1A\\" means there are two trucks under the unit. Each truck has two powered axles, with an idler axle between them. This spreads the weight of the locomotive more evenly over the track and counteracts the tendency of trucks to oscillate at high speeds, which is a problem with two axle trucks. The idler wheels may be smaller than the powered wheels. Examples include the EMD E-units and ALCO PAs, which were high speed passenger locomotives, and the dual service FM Erie-built. BNSF took delivery of ES44C4 locomotives with this type of truck in 2009. A1A-B+B \\"A1A-B+B\\" means there are three trucks. The first truck has three axles, with the center one unpowered. A pair of two-axle trucks, each with both axles powered, are connected by a span bolster under the rear of the unit. The only example to date of this arrangement was a single experimental EMD SDP45. B \\"B\\" means there are two powered axles under the unit. These axles are not articulated relative to other parts of the locomotive. This arrangement is only used on very small locomotives, such as the EMD Model 40. This arrangement is sometimes referred to as 0-4-0, the Whyte notation equivalent. B-1 \\"B-1\\" means there are two trucks. The \\"B\\" truck is under the front of the unit, and has two powered axles. The \\"1\\" truck is under the back of the unit, and has one idler axle. Examples include the three EMD LWT12 locomotives built by EMD in 1956. B-2 \\"B-2\\" means there are two trucks. The \\"B\\" truck is under the front of the unit, and has two powered axles. The \\"2\\" truck is under the back of the unit, and has two idler axles in a row. Examples include the three lightweight RP-210 locomotives built by Baldwin in 1956 and 1957 for use with Pullman-Standard Train-X equipment. B-A1A \\"B-A1A\\" means there are two trucks. The \\"B\\" truck is under the front of the unit, and has two powered axles. The \\"A1A\\" truck is under the back of the unit, and has one powered axle, one idler axle, and one more powered axle. Examples include some of the FM C-liners (most passenger units) built from 1950 to 1955, and the EMD FL9. B-B \\"B-B\\" means there are two identical trucks. Each truck has two powered axles, a currently popular configuration used in high-speed, low-weight applications such as intermodal trains and high-speed rail, as well as in switching. Examples include the EMD GP (General Purpose), EMD F-units, EMD SW1500, Acela Express Power Cars, Siemens Charger, Siemens ACS-64 and GE Genesis units. High speed (\\"time\\") freight trains, with guaranteed schedules often use B-B locomotives of 3,800 HP (950 HP per axle), but this application, too, has largely been replaced by higher-powered, 4,500 HP C-C locomotives (750 HP per axle). An American Colloquialism of \\"B-B\\" is \\"Four axle\\". B-2-B \\"B-2-B\\" means there are three trucks. The center truck has two unpowered axles and the truck at each end has two powered axles. The locomotive frame must either articulate or allow for significant side play to be provided to the center truck. B-B-B \\"B-B-B\\" means there are three trucks. Each truck has two powered axles. The locomotive frame must either articulate or allow for significant side play to be provided to the center truck. The EMD GM10B was a notable example. See also Bo-Bo-Bo. B+B+B \\"B+B+B\\" means there are three articulated sets of two powered axles each under the unit. The locomotive frame must allow for significant side play to be provided to the center axle set, as well as allowing for end play for the end sets. The ten Mexican Railway GE boxcab electrics of 1923 are examples of this wheel arrangement. 2-B+B-2 \\"2-B+B-2\\" means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two idler axles, and inboard of it are two powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The PRR DD1 and DD2 electric locomotives used this arrangement. 2-B+B+B+B-2 \\"2-B+B+B+B-2\\" means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two idler axles, and inboard of it are two powered axles, hinged to yet another set of two powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. Examples include the Milwaukee Road EF-1 \\"Boxcab\\" electrics. B+B-B+B \\"B+B-B+B\\" means there are four trucks under the unit. Within each truck, there are two powered axles, and pairs of them are connected by span bolsters. One example would be the General Electric U50, built from 1963 to 1965. The 4500 horsepower (3.4 MW) turbine locomotives built by GE for Union Pacific also used this arrangement. The EFVM railway of Brazil uses narrow gauge GE \\"BB\\" locomotives with this arrangement, both with \\"standard\\" and wide cabs. A GE BB40-9W, for instance, is a wide cab GE Dash 9-40CW series locomotive with a B+B-B+B wheel arrangement. B-B+B-B \\"B-B+B-B\\" means that the locomotive has four trucks. Each truck contains two powered axles. The middle pair of trucks are connected by a span bolster. In most cases, the locomotive is articulated over the span bolster. The Union Pacific's M-10002 diesel streamliner and New York Central's T-Motor Third rail electric locomotives are examples of this type. This arrangement also includes locomotives made of two permanently coupled B-B units, such as some EMD FT units which had a solid drawbar connecting two units instead of the typical couplers. B-B-B-B \\"B-B-B-B\\" means there are four trucks. Each truck has two powered axles. The locomotive frame must allow for significant side play to be provided to the center trucks. B-B+B-B+B-B \\"B-B+B-B+B-B\\" means that the locomotive has six trucks. Each truck contains two powered axles. The only known locomotives to have this configuration were the two EMD TR3 locomotives made of three permanently coupled B-B units, which had solid drawbars connecting the units instead of the typical couplers. C \\"C\\" means there are three powered axles under the unit. They are not articulated relative to other parts of the locomotive. This arrangement is only used on very small locomotives (e.g. the PRR B1). This arrangement is sometimes referred to as 0-6-0, the Whyte notation equivalent. C-B \\"C-B\\" means there are two trucks. The \\"C\\" truck is under the front of the unit, and has three powered axles. The \\"B\\" truck is under the rear of the unit, and has two powered axles. C-C \\"C-C\\" means there are two identical trucks. Each truck has three powered axles. Examples include the EMD SD (Special Duty), GMD GF6C, EMD GM6C, PRR E44, Virginian EL-C and GE Evolution Series units, except the ES44C4 and ET44C4 which use the A1A-A1A wheel arrangement. This is a currently popular configuration used in low-speed, high-weight applications, such as unit coal trains. General (\\"manifest\\") freight trains also use C-C locomotives. See also Co-Co. An American colloquialism of \\"C-C\\" is \\"Six axle\\". 1-C+C-1 \\"1-C+C-1\\" means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with one idler axle, and inboard of it are three powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The PRR FF1 and FF2 electric locomotives used this arrangement. 2-C+C-2 \\"2-C+C-2\\" means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two idler axles, and inboard of it are three powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The Pennsylvania Railroad's GG1 electric locomotives were notable examples of this arrangement. 2+C-C+2 \\"2+C-C+2\\" means there are two sets of axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a guiding truck with two idler axles, and inboard of this, and hinged to it, is a truck with three powered axles. The GE steam turbine-electric locomotives of 1939 were notable examples of this arrangement. 2-C1+2-C1-B \\"2-C1+2-C1-B\\" means there are five trucks. Only the first three axles on the four-axle trucks were powered, as were both axles in the last truck; the first and middle trucks had two unpowered axles each. The only examples of this arrangement were three unique coal-fired steam-turbine locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway between 1947 and 1948. This locomotive is sometimes called the M-1. C-C+C-C \\"C-C+C-C\\" means there are four trucks under the unit. Each truck has three powered axles. The only examples of this type were the 8500 horsepower (6.3 MW) turbine locomotives built by General Electric for Union Pacific. These locomotives consisted of two permanently coupled C-C units. C+C-C+C \\"C+C-C+C\\" means there are four trucks. Each truck has three powered axles and pairs of them are connected by span bolsters. This arrangement was used on the Jawn Henry coal-fired steam-turbine locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works for the Norfolk & Western Railway in May, 1954. 1-D-1 \\"1-D-1\\" means there are three trucks under the unit. At either end are trucks with one idler axle; the center truck has four powered axles. The original 1904-1909 New York Central S-Motor third rail electric locomotives, for the Grand Central Terminal electrification and the Great Northern Z-1 electric locomotives for the Cascade Tunnel electrification, used this arrangement. 2-D-2 \\"2-D-2\\" means there are three trucks. At either end are trucks with two idler axles; the center truck has four powered axles. The PRR R1 electric locomotive used this arrangement. D-D \\"D-D\\" means there are two trucks. Each truck has four powered axles. Examples include the EMD DD units. D-D locomotives so far have fallen out of favor as nearly all of these have been twin-engined locomotives, which placed too much horsepower in too few axles, thereby making these consists rather inflexible (each locomotive featured two prime movers, making each unit essentially a pair of high-powered B-B locomotives on a common frame as far as traction and power was concerned). In fact, a usual consist of a D-D unit included a leading C-C unit and a trailing C-C unit, for a total of about 12,600 HP (with four total prime-movers). With today's higher horsepower C-C units (about 4,300 HP apiece), three such C-C units exceeds the total power of the usual D-D consist by 300 HP (with one fewer prime-mover than a usual D-D consist, thereby significantly improving reliability and dramatically reducing maintenance). Although at this time the term D-D is associated with twin- prime-mover locomotives of high power, this does not preclude the possibility of a D-D with a single prime mover of high power some time in the future, nor of the term being used to describe a two-truck electric locomotive. The EMD DDM45 is a narrow-gauge adaptation of the SD45, which required additional axles due to the use of smaller traction motors. 2-D+D-2 \\"2-D+D-2\\" means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two idler axles, and inboard of it are four powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. Examples include the Baldwin DR-12-8-1500/2 \\"Centipede\\" diesel locomotives and the GE \\"Little Joe\\" electric locomotives. B-D+D-B \\"B-D+D-B\\" means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two powered axles, and inboard of it are four powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The W-1 class of electric locomotives built by General Electric for the Great Northern Railway used this arrangement. 1B+D+D+B1 \\"1B+D+D+B1\\" means there are four sets of articulated axles under the unit. At each end, there is one unpowered axle and two powered axles, hinged to a set of four powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The \\"Bi-Polar\\" electric locomotives used by the Milwaukee Road used this arrangement. (B+B-B+B)+(B+B-B+B) \\"(B+B-B+B)+(B+B-B+B)\\" means there are 2 units, each with 4 trucks in a B+B-B+B wheel arrangement. Example include the Virginian Railway's EL-2B electric locomotives.

During an unplanned accidental jibe (or gybe), neither the crew nor the boat is set up properly to execute a planned jibe. As a result, the uncontrolled boom will swing across the boat potentially inflicting injury or knocking crew members overboard. The mainsheet or traveller can also inflict serious injury. Uncontrolled jibes may also damage the boat itself. Rigging a preventer on a yacht's mainsail is often performed when the wind is behind the beam (i.e. when it's coming from more than 90° off the bow). It can also be useful at other times when there is more swell than wind, a situation when the wind may not have the strength to keep the boom in place as the boat dips and rolls. On any boat that is sailing downwind without a preventer, strict 'heads-down' procedures must be enforced anywhere within the boom's arc. Certain areas of the side-decks and maybe the cockpit also have to be strictly 'no-go' to all crew depending on what the boom and mainsheet could do in unchecked full swing. The preventer with the most mechanical advantage is a line, from the end of the boom, led outside the shrouds and a long way forward - perhaps right up to the bow - through a block, back to the cockpit and secured within reach of the mainsheet. Many cruising sailors prefer to rig two tackles (port and starboard) that run from the midpoint of the boom to blocks on a track such as the headsail-sheet-block track. These tackles are typically a 2 - 4 part tackles for greater purchase. This rig can also be used as a boom vang without taking up space under the mast that may be essential to the cruising sailor for dinghy stowage and other uses. There is a possibility of breaking the main boom with a preventer rig such as this, but many modern yachts are considered to have short enough booms and be beamy enough to overlook this possibility in normal use. For example, while running with the preventer cleated, a large swell could roll the boat, dipping the boom end into the water, snapping the boom in half. Care should be taken when selecting the rope which is used for preventer lines. To reduce the shock loads on the tackles, for example in an unexpected jibe, three-strand nylon line may be preferred over of braided cored line. Boom Brake Boom brake with line. The brake shackles to the bottom of the boom, and the line attaches to the base of the shrouds. Tensioning the line actuates the brake. Another form of preventer is the boom brake, which, when sailing downwind, can also be used to jibe the mainsail in a slow, measured action. The brake usually rides on a line running perpendicular to, and below the boom. When the boom brake is actuated, friction on the line either works as a preventer (stops the boom from moving in the direction that would slacken the main sheet), or slows the boom’s speed while jibing. The brake is actuated by either tensioning the line upon which it rides or by using a second line to adjust the brake itself. Jibing When jibing a fully loaded mainsail in a following sea, the following procedure may be used. Using the steering, the stern of the boat is carefully brought up into the wind. Then the leeward, working preventer is released little by little, while the mainsheet is shortened to bring in the boom. It is important to maintain at least a turn or two around the preventer's cleat the whole time ready to catch an early jibe during this stage of the manoeuvre. The mainsheet should pull the preventer around its cleat, without it being offered any slack. All the while it is also necessary to take in slack on the lazy preventer to keep it under control (i.e. prevent it getting tangled around something) until it is needed. When the boom is as near as possible to midships (near to running fore-and-aft along the boat's centreline), the working preventer is slackened, the lazy one tightened, and the mainsheet made very secure. It is important that all crew are safe from where the boom may swing, and a call of \\"Jibe-ho\\" is a traditional last warning for this. At this point, a slight steering adjustment will actually jibe the sail. The course of the boat may slew further than expected, which can be ignored as it gives a shorthanded crew time to do the next three things: Run out the mainsheet as fast as possible without burning the hands, ensuring that the newly-lazy preventer runs free, then tighten in and secure the newly working preventer.

The album marked a startling change in the band's sound, shifting from radio-friendly pop rock to garage rock, comparable to the sound of The Strokes. Produced by Dave Fridmann (Weezer, MGMT), it is the first album to feature current drummer Jeff Conrad (ex-Big City Rock). It has been credited with earning the band's first significant fan base, as well as some minor commercial success. During the recording of the album, drummer and co-founder Jason Schwartzman left the band to pursue his acting career. The song \\"By the Bed\\" is about Alex's grandmother, and what she told him on her deathbed. The song \\"Jabberjaw\\" deals with anger and frustration. Alex Greenwald commented on this song in Nylon magazine: The music video for album's single, \\"Big Brat\\" had significant airplay beginning in December 2003. It cuts between scenes of an urban performance of the song to the band shooting a low budget zombie film in the relative location. The actual zombie film being shot was used as an alternate music video for the song available to fans on the band's website. Recording and production The album was Phantom Planet's first without drummer Jason Schwartzman, who announced midway through the sessions that he was leaving to pursue acting full-time. \\"He finally made the adult decision between the two sides of him,\\" Greenwald said of his friend, with whom he co-founded the group at age thirteen. \\"It was a little strange at first, but there's no bad blood. We're still best friends.\\" Schwartzman, the star of several films, including Rushmore, The Darjeeling Limited, Funny People, and television shows like Bored to Death, can be heard on half the album's tracks, while the rest feature new drummer Jeff Conrad.

Its vision is to \\"transform Australia into a society that protects, respects and connects with the natural world that sustains us.\\"The Wilderness Society – Australia It is a community-based organisation with a philosophy of non-violence and consensus decision-making. While the Wilderness Society is a politically unaligned group, it actively engages the community to lobby politicians and parties. The Wilderness Society comprises a number of separately incorporated organisations and has Campaign Centres located in all Australian capital cities (except Darwin and Canberra) and a number of regional centres. History \\"Dr Robert Brown\\" describing rafting the Franklin River early that year The Wilderness Society was formed initially as the Tasmanian Wilderness Society (TWS) and was transition from the South West Tasmania Action Committee. Former logo The group was originally established in 1976 from the members of the Lake Pedder Action Committee and the Southwest Tasmania Action Committee Along with the United Tasmania Group, they had protested against the earlier flooding of Lake Pedder. The group already had established interstate branches as the South West Tasmania Action Committee (in NSW branch the word 'Action' was not included), so it was already a nationwide organisation. Significantly, all but four of the twenty-three people attending the inaugural meeting of the Tasmanian Wilderness Society in 1976 were members of the United Tasmania Group.Pam Walker, The United Tasmania Group, University of Tasmania Honours thesis, 1986 Following the success of the campaign against the Franklin Dam, and the national approach being more important due to other issues interstate, it became known as The Wilderness Society. In the year 2005, Tasmanian forestry business Gunns brought a litigation case against the group in the Melbourne Supreme Court, in a case dubbed the \\"Gunns 20\\", claiming that the activities of environmental activists had damaged Gunns' profits. Gunns claimed $3.5 million from the Wilderness Society, but in March 2009, Gunns was ordered to pay the Wilderness Society $350,000 in damages and to cease the action.  Campaigns  The Wilderness Society spent considerable energy in its first decades of existence arguing that wilderness was a specific quality in parts of Australia's environment that was vital to preserve for future generations. The political response in most states of Australia is that there are now wilderness inventories and acknowledgement of areas of wilderness. The Wilderness Society's campaigns have included: * the Franklin river * stopping logging in old growth forestsAustralia's forests — The Wilderness Society * preventing destruction of endangered species habitats; * protecting Queensland's Wild RiversHelp us protect Cape York Peninsula's Wild Rivers! — Wild Rivers and Cape York Peninsula; * nationwide campaign to mitigate the effects of climate change keep fossil fuels in the ground; * the Kimberley Campaign; as part of its long-running campaign against a proposal to industrialise the James Price Point headland near Broome, the organisation presented a concert on 5 October 2012. The concert featured performances from The John Butler Trio, Clare Bowditch and Missy Higgins, and a speech by the former leader of the Australian Greens and former TWS director, Dr Bob Brown. * since 2018 New Nature Laws campaigning for strong, national nature laws and an independent watchdog agency to enforce these Nature laws that work Game Changer In November 2013 the Wilderness Society unveiled their Game Changer proposal.https://www.wilderness.org.au/articles/game-changer-forum Game Changer acknowledged the changed role of the Wilderness Society's to protect nature across the country. The organisation highlighted protecting nature against the current threats of climate change, fossil fuel extraction and the winding back of environmental laws as key challenges Australia (and the World) faced in the 21st century. Funding Traditionally fundraising was performed through The Wilderness Society Shops. The shops were particularly popular for their calendars and posters by photographers such as Peter Dombrovskis and Olegas Truchanas, and were also central locations for the public to make donations and for members to meet. Since the rise of the internet, fundraising has increasingly become centralised around internet based activities, such as the TWS website, online store and extensive email lists, although it also still contacts supporters through regular postal communications as well. As of 2013, TWS maintained physical shops in Hobart and Launceston in Tasmania, and Newcastle, New South Wales, however limited merchandise could also be purchased at the campaign centres located in each state capital. The Wilderness Society now raises funds through a number of sources, mainly donations, including advocacy gifts and gifts in wills, subscriptions from members, grants, sales of merchandise, and interest and other investment income. For the 2012 financial year the Society specifically had a total income of $13,780,530, with 86% of this raised through donations, 6% through investments, 5% from members subscriptions, 2% from grants, and 1% from sales. For the same year total expenses were $13,705,494, distributed as 52% on campaigning, 19% on investment in new members and supporters, 13% on organisational support and governance, and 16% on income generation. Political involvement The inaugural director of The Wilderness Society was Kevin Kiernan, followed by Norm Sanders, who was later elected to the seat of Denison in the Tasmanian Parliament in 1980 for the Australian Democrats. He was Australia's first parliamentarian to be elected on an environmental platform. Dr. Bob Brown, became the director of The Wilderness Society in 1978, and with him the group increased their influence on Tasmanian politics. Brown was elected to the Tasmanian parliament in 1983 to fill the vacancy left when Norm Sanders resigned his seat, and with the group of fellow conservationists elected subsequently, he went on to become part of the political party known as the Tasmanian Greens. Bob Brown was later elected to represent Tasmania and the Greens in the Senate in the Federal parliament. While The Wilderness Society has worked with the Australian Greens on certain campaigns, it is not affiliated with them or any other political party, as a politically unaligned environmental non-government organisation.

Historical background In the Primary Chronicle which is traditionally believed to have been written by a monk of Kyiv Cave Monastery by the name of Nestor and finished in 1113, a special place is held by the legend about the foundation of Kyiv by three brothers. In the legend, Nestor places those brothers onto various hills of Kyiv. Geographically, the old Kyiv is located on a higher right bank of Dnieper which is an extension of the Dnieper Upland where remnants of the Church of the Tithes are located. The Chronicle further states that there were people (\\"who did not know what were saying\\") who considered Kyi a mere ferryman. But, then it argues that Kyi as a prince of his gens was visiting Czargrad and received great honors from the Emperor. Dmitry Likhachov combined attestations of the Nikon Chronicle which also indicates that Kyi with a great army marched onto Czargrad and received great honors from the Emperor. During his expedition to Constantinople, Kyi also found a city of Kyivets on the Danube. Nestor also names the approximate date of the assault on Kyiv by the Khazar Empire as \\"after the death of Kyi\\" which confirms the hypothesis of Boris Rybakov, 6th-7th centuries. In his chronicle Nestor does not indicate the date of Kyi's death nor the existence or absence of his heirs who continued to rule after his death. The chronicle does mention a meeting between local residents with the arrived Askold and Dir who asked them referring to Kyiv, whose city it was and received the answer that the three brothers who built it were long dead and the residents now paid tribute to the Khazars. However, the Polish historian Jan Długosz drew attention to the Przemysł Chronicle that asserts \\"after the death of Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv their children and grandchildren who descended from them by direct lineage ruled for many years\\". Excerpt from the Ruthenian Primary Chronicles Translation by Dmitry Likhachov Translation by Samuel Hazzard Cross Archaeological excavations Graphic depiction of archaeological excavations in Kyiv by Vikentiy Khvoyka Archaeological excavations have shown that there was indeed an ancient settlement starting with the 6th century. Some speculate that Kyi was a real person, a knyaz (prince) from the tribe of the Polans. According to legend, Kyi, the eldest brother, was a Polianian Prince, and the city was named after him.http://www.ukrainians- world.org.ua/eng/peoples/ff653263602957f1/. In addition, the legend says that the appearance of a large city on the hilly banks of the Dnieper was predicted by Andrew the Apostle. Historiographical interpretation Many historians consider as truthful the existence of Kyi and his princely rule around the 6th century. Among such historians are Boris Rybakov, Dmitry Likhachov, Aleksey Shakhmatov, Alexander Presnyakov, Petro Tolochko, Nataliia Polonska-Vasylenko, and others. The legend personal names have similar equivalents from an Armenian chronicle from the 7th century, History of Taron, by Zenob Glak. In it, two Kyivan brothers Kyi and Khoryv have almost the same counterparts in brothers Kouar and Horian, while Polyans have it in district Balounik. The legend also has parallels in the Croatian origo gentis of five brothers and two sisters (Kloukas, Lobelos, Kosentzis, Mouchlo, Chrobatos, Touga and Bouga) from the 30th chapter of De Administrando Imperio by Constantine VII (10th century), and the Bulgarian apocryphal chronicle (12th century) about the ethnogenesis of the Bulgarians. All three speak about people who migrated to a foreign land, whose leader was of the same name (Kyi in Kyiv, Chrobatos in Croats, and Slav in Bulgarians), while Kyivan and Croatian mention a sister. The female personality and number three can be found also in three daughters (youngest Libuše) of Duke Krok from Chronica Boemorum (12 century), two sons and daughter (Krakus II, Lech II, and Princess Wanda) of Krakus legendary founder of Kraków from Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae (12-13th century), and three brothers Lech, Czech, and Rus from Wielkopolska Chronicle (13th century). Khoryv or Horiv, and his oronym Khorevytsia, some scholars related to the Croatian ethnonym of White Croats. Paščenko related his name, beside to the Croatian ethnonym, also to the solar deity Hors. Near Kyiv there is a stream where previously existed a large village named Horvatka or Hrovatka (it was destroyed in the time of Joseph Stalin), which flows into Stuhna River. Modern tributes The sculpture of Kiyv founders interim bank note in 1990s. In addition to the respective hills and the river, there are Shchekavytska and Khoryva Streets in Kyiv's ancient neighborhood of Podil. In 1982, Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv and Lybid were depicted (standing on an ancient riverboat) in a sculpture at the river-side of Navodnytsky Park. The monument, created by Vasyl Borodai, soon became iconic for the city and has been used as Kyiv's unofficial emblem. In the 2000s another statue was installed at the central square, Maidan Nezalezhnosti.

He was chosen by the Parliament of Singapore to be the next President of Singapore when former president Devan Nair stepped down from the position and Wee was sworn in on 2 September 1985. For the ensuing initial presidential election, the first in Singapore to be decided by popular poll, Wee decided not to enter his candidacy and went into retirement upon the completion of his second and final term as President. Wee was the Ambassador to the Republic of Korea from 1981 to 1984, Ambassador to Japan from 1980 to 1984 and the High Commissioner to Malaysia from 1973 to 1980 before he was elected as the President of Singapore by the Parliament of Singapore. Early life Born in Singapore on 4 November 1915, Wee Kim Wee was the son of Wee Choong Lay and Chua Hay Luan. His father Wee Choong Lay was a ship purser but went blind when Wee Kim Wee was six years old. His mother Chua Hay Luan was the younger sister of Chua Kim Teng, the father of Chua Jim Neo and maternal grandfather of Lee Kuan Yew.Lee Kuan Yew and late president Wee Kim Wee are relatedCHUA Lay HuanCHUA Kim Teng, 蔡金鼎 Wee lost his father when he was eight and his mother when he was nineteen. He received his primary education at Pearl's Hill School and secondary education at Outram SchoolSPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW IN MOVING THE MOTION ON THE ELECTION OF MR WEE KIM WEE AS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE ON 30 AUG 85 IN PARLIAMENT before enrolling in Raffles Institution. However, Wee did not complete his secondary education and dropped out after two years at the institution in January 1930. Career 1930 to 1973: Journalism In 1930, Wee started out as a clerk working for the newspaper The Straits Times, before becoming a reporter focusing on political issues. He eventually became one of the paper's main reporters. He married his wife, Koh Sok Hiong () in 1936 when he was a 21 year old reporter. In 1941 he joined the United Press Associations, and was its chief correspondent in the 1950s. He returned to The Straits Times in 1959, and was appointed deputy editor in Singapore. In 1963 he was awarded the Public Service Medal. In 1966, he interviewed the former Indonesian president Suharto, reporting the latter's intention to end the three-year confrontation with Malaysia (see Konfrontasi). He broke the news with a front-page headline using Suharto's own words: \\"Suharto: 'Peace: The sooner the better'\\". In 1973, he was awarded the Public Service Star as the editorial manager of the Straits Times. 1973 to 1984: Diplomacy Wee retired in 1973 from journalism to become the High Commissioner to Malaysia, a position he held for seven years. He was then appointed ambassador to Japan in September 1980, and to South Korea in February 1981. At the end of his diplomatic career in 1984, he was appointed chairman of the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation - the predecessor of the current MediaCorp Studios. 1985 to 1993: Presidency Wee became the President of Singapore and the Commander-in-Chief in 1985, and was also appointed as the Chancellor of National University of Singapore during the same period. Until Wee's second term as President, the selection of the presidential candidate was determined solely by the Parliament of Singapore. During Wee's second term, the Singapore Parliament amended the constitution in January 1991 to allow for the direct election of the President, who could veto civil service appointments and the use of government reserves. The creation of an elected presidency was a major constitutional and political change in Singapore's history as under the revision, as the President is empowered to veto government budgets and appointments to public office. He can examine the government's exercise of its powers under the Internal Security Act and religious harmony laws and investigate cases of corruption. For the ensuing initial presidential election, the first in Singapore to be decided by popular poll, Wee decided not to enter his candidacy and went into retirement upon the completion of his second and final term as President. He was also awarded the Darjah Utama Temasek in 1993. Later years (1994–2004) After retiring from presidency, Wee was appointed as deputy registrar of marriages. He was then awarded the Doctor of Letters (honorary degree) by the National University of Singapore for his contributions to public service and his contributions to the University of Singapore as its chancellor till 1993. Wee became the Director of Cathay Organisation Holdings in 1999. In 2004, Wee published his autobiography, Glimpses and Reflections. From the royalties and other donations, half a million Singapore dollars were donated to eight charities. Death and Legacy Wee died of prostate cancer in his home at Siglap Plain on 2 May 2005 at 5:10am SST at the age of 89. Before his death, he had asked to be cremated and for the ashes to be placed at Mandai Columbarium with those of ordinary citizens instead of Kranji War Cemetery, where late dignitaries are usually buried. His state funeral saw a large crowd who attended to pay their last respects at the Istana, where his body lied in state. Wee was survived by his wife of 69 years, Koh Sok Hiong (1916 - 2018), their son Bill Wee Hock Kee (1936 - 2015), six daughters, 13 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren. In 2006, Nanyang Technological University renamed its School of Communication Studies after Wee to the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information. The Centre for Cross-Cultural Studies at Singapore Management University, renamed after Wee as the Wee Kim Wee Centre. Wee Kim Wee Legacy Fund at Nanyang Technological University is named after him.

A historical name for this measure is the kaolin-cephalin clotting time (KCCT), reflecting kaolin and cephalin as materials historically used in the test. Apart from detecting abnormalities in blood clotting, partial thromboplastin time is also used to monitor the treatment effect of heparin, a widely prescribed drug that reduces blood's tendency to clot. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) measures the overall speed at which blood clots by means of two consecutive series of biochemical reactions known as the intrinsic pathway and common pathway of coagulation. PTT measures the following coagulation factors: I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V (proaccelerin), VIII (anti-hemophilic factor), X (Stuart–Prower factor), XI (plasma thromboplastin antecedent), and XII (Hageman factor). The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is often used in conjunction with another measure of how quickly blood clotting takes place called the prothrombin time (PT). The prothrombin time (PT) measures the speed of clotting by means of the 'extrinsic pathway. Methodology Blue Top Vacutainer tube used for PT and PTT blood tests Partial thromboplastin time is typically analyzed by a medical technologist or a laboratory technician on an automated instrument at 37 °C (as a nominal approximation of normal human body temperature). The test is termed \\"partial\\" due to the absence of tissue factor from the reaction mixture. * Blood is drawn into a test tube containing oxalate or citrate, molecules which act as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma (as partial thromboplastin time is most commonly measured using blood plasma). * A sample of the plasma is extracted from the test tube and placed into a measuring test tube. * Next, an excess of calcium (in a phospholipid suspension) is mixed into the plasma sample (to reverse the anticoagulant effect of the oxalate enabling the blood to clot again). * Finally, in order to activate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, an activator (such as silica, celite, kaolin, ellagic acid) is added, and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. Some laboratories use a mechanical measurement, which eliminates interferences from lipemic and icteric samples. Interpretation The typical reference range is between 30 seconds and 50 s (depending on laboratory). Shortening of the PTT is considered to have little clinical relevance, but some research indicates that it might increase risk of thromboembolism. Normal PTT times require the presence of the following coagulation factors: I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII. Notably, deficiencies in factors VII or XIII will not be detected with the PTT test. Prolonged APTT may indicate: * use of heparin (or contamination of the sample) * antiphospholipid antibody (especially lupus anticoagulant, which paradoxically increases propensity to thrombosis) * coagulation factor deficiency (e.g., hemophilia) * sepsis — coagulation factor consumption * presence of antibodies against coagulation factors (factor inhibitors) To distinguish the above causes, mixing tests are performed, in which the patient's plasma is mixed (initially at a 50:50 dilution) with normal plasma. If the abnormality does not disappear, the sample is said to contain an \\"inhibitor\\" (either heparin, antiphospholipid antibodies or coagulation factor specific inhibitors), while if it does disappear a factor deficiency is more likely. Deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, XI and XII and rarely von Willebrand factor (if causing a low factor VIII level) may lead to a prolonged aPTT correcting on mixing studies. History The aPTT was first described in 1953 by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This is the reason why the color of the Vacutainer tube top is Carolina blue.

Following his early death several streets, places, parks, schools and public libraries were named after him.Riconoscimenti – VieRiconoscimenti – PiazzeRiconoscimenti – ParchiRiconoscimenti – BibliotecheRiconoscimenti – Scuole Biography De André was born in Genoa in a family of Piedmontese origins (the father Giuseppe was born in Turin and the mother in Pocapaglia), and was welcomed into the world by Gino Marinuzzi's \\"Country Waltz\\" on the home gramophone. Twenty-five years later, he would set his \\"Waltz for a Love\\" to Marinuzzi's waltz tune. When the Second World War broke out, the De André family had to seek refuge on a country farm near Revignano, a frazione of Asti, in Piedmont. There, the child Fabrizio befriended Giovanna \\"Nina\\" Manfieri, a girl of his same age, which was his constant companion during childhood, and whose memories were immortalized in \\"Ho visto Nina volare\\" [\\"I saw Nina flying\\"], one of De André's last songs.Interview with Nina Manfieri within the Dentro Faber documentary series, DVD 5: Le donne [\\"Women\\"]. His father, who was an antifascist pursued by the police, joined the partisans. In 1945, at the end of the war, the family moved back to Genoa, where the father became an important member of Genoa's ruling class, as CEO, and later chairman of Eridania, a sugar factory. Fabrizio's first primary school was that of the Marcellian Sisters, and he later attended the Cesare Battisti public school and the Liceo Classico \\"Cristoforo Colombo\\"; after his school leaving examination, he enrolled in the Law School of the University of Genoa, although he did not graduate, dropping out when he had only a few exams left. (He later stated he was glad to have dropped out from his law studies and taken up music instead, as he would have become a very bad lawyer rather than a good songwriter.) De André first played the violin, then the guitar, and he joined a number of local jazz bands, as jazz was his \\"first love\\". First recordings In 1960, De André recorded his first two songs, Nuvole barocche (\\"Baroque Clouds\\") and E fu la notte (\\"And There Was Night\\"); in 1962, he married Enrica \\"Puny\\" Rignon, a Genoese woman nearly ten years older than him. That same year the couple had their first and only son, Cristiano, who would follow in his father's footsteps and become a musician and songwriter as well. In the following years De André wrote a number of songs which made him known to a larger public, soon becoming classic hits: La guerra di Piero (\\"Piero's War\\"), La ballata dell'eroe (\\"The Hero's Ballad\\"), Il testamento di Tito (\\"Titus's Will\\"), La Ballata del Michè (\\"Mickey's Ballad\\"), Via del Campo (literally \\"Field Street\\", a famous street in Genoa), La canzone dell'amore perduto (\\"The Song of the Lost Love\\"), La città vecchia (\\"The Old [side of] Town\\"), Carlo Martello ritorna dalla battaglia di Poitiers (\\"Charles Martel on His Way Back from Poitiers\\", written together with actor Paolo Villaggio, one of De André's closest friends), and La canzone di Marinella (\\"Marinella's Song\\"). Volume 1 Volume I De André's first LP, Volume 1, was issued shortly after (1967), followed by Tutti morimmo a stento (\\"We All Barely Died\\") and Volume 3; both LPs soon reached the top of the Italian hit-parade. The former contained a personal version of Eroina (\\"Heroin\\") by the Genoese poet Riccardo Mannerini, entitled \\"Cantico dei drogati\\" (\\"Canticle of the Junkies\\"). La buona novella In 1970, De André wrote La buona novella (\\"Glad Tidings\\" – a literal rendition of the etymology of gospel), a concept album based on Christ's life as told in the Apocrypha. The album was very controversial, especially the song Il testamento di Tito (\\"Titus's Will\\"), in which one of the thieves crucified with Jesus violently refutes the Ten Commandments. He had written a number of songs (like Preghiera in Gennaio, \\"Prayer in January\\", and Si chiamava Gesù, \\"His Name Was Jesus\\") in which he showed a Christian-like open-minded spirit and in the meantime invited the audience in his own delicate way to think about the manipulation of the church. Non al denaro non all'amore né al cielo In 1971, he wrote another celebrated concept album, Non al denaro non all'amore né al cielo (\\"Neither to money, nor to love, nor to Heaven\\"), based on Edgar Lee Masters's Spoon River Anthology; in an interview, the LP was introduced by Fernanda Pivano, the first Italian translator of the \\"Anthology\\" and one of Cesare Pavese's most intimate friends. Fabrizio De André's name began to be associated with literature and poetry, and some of his songs found their way into school books. Storia di un impiegato and Canzoni In 1973, he wrote his most \\"political\\" album, Storia di un impiegato (\\"Story of an Employee\\"). The following year, De André issued Canzoni (\\"Songs\\"), a collection of his translations from Georges Brassens, Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. The album also included a number of his old songs from the 1960s. Volume 8 In 1975, De André (who in the meantime had divorced his wife Puny and begun a relationship with the folksinger Dori Ghezzi) wrote Volume 8 with another famous Italian singer-songwriter, Francesco De Gregori. With this album, he broke with \\"tradition\\" to find a new approach to poetry and music. The lyrics show how deep the influence of modern poetry is on De André's work. 1975 marked a real change in De André's life: he began to perform in a series of memorable concerts (after his first performances of the early 1960s, he had always refused to appear in public, except for a couple of TV broadcasts) and planned to move to Sardinia with his new love. For this purpose, he purchased the Agnata homestead near Tempio Pausania in the northern part of the island, where he set to farming and cattle breeding. In 1977, the couple had a daughter, Luisa Vittoria (nicknamed \\"Luvi\\"). The following year De André issued a new LP, Rimini. Most songs included on this album were written together with Massimo Bubola, a young singer-songwriter from Verona. Concerts with PFM and kidnapping 1979 was another milestone in De André's life. The year began with a series of distinguished live concerts from which a double LP was compiled; De André was accompanied by one of the most renowned Italian progressive rock bands, Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM); the albums were released as In Concerto - Arrangiamenti PFM (1979), and In Concerto – Volume 2 (1980). At the end of August, however, De André and Ghezzi were kidnapped for ransom by a gang of bandits in Sardinia (Anonima sarda) and held prisoner in the Alà dei Sardi mountains. The couple were released four months later with a ransom reportedly being paid. As De André stated in some interviews, he was helped by his father to find the money and had to start a tour shortly after the release of the Indiano album to repay him. When the bandits were apprehended by the police, De André was called as a witness before the Court. He showed compassion for some of his kidnappers, since he had been well treated by his \\"guardians\\" and declared his solidarity with them. \\"They were the real prisoners, not me\\", he said. He said he understood they were driven by need, but he did not show any compassion for the higher echelon of the group that organized his kidnapping, since they were already rich. This incident, and the hard life of the Sardinian people, gave him inspiration for his following album, released in 1981. The album is untitled but, due to the image of a Native American warrior on the cover, the media called it L'Indiano (\\"The Indian\\"). In De André's poetical vision, Native Americans merge with poor Sardinian shepherds as an allegory for the marginalization and subjugation of people who are \\"different\\". The song Hotel Supramonte, is dedicated to the kidnapping and to Dori Ghezzi, who was with him during those days. The album also contains one of his most famous songs, Fiume Sand Creek (\\"Sand Creek River\\"): in De André's unique, allusive way it tells the story of the massacre of defenseless Native Americans by US Army troops on 29 November 1864. Crêuza de mä In 1984, he turned to his native Genoese dialect; in collaboration with former PFM member Mauro Pagani he wrote one of his most celebrated albums, Crêuza de mä (\\"Path to the sea\\", the term \\"Crêuza\\" actually indicating a narrow road bordered by low walls, typical of Genoa and Liguria in general). The songs are a tribute to the traditional music from the Mediterranean basin. The album was awarded several prizes and was hailed as \\"the best Italian album of the 1980s\\". David Byrne named it as one of his favourite albums, and Wim Wenders said that it was this album that introduced him to the music of De André, whom the director names as one of his favourite artists. As Pagani has repeatedly stated, De André wrote all the lyrics for the album, while the music was almost entirely Pagani's. 1990s In 1989, De André married Ghezzi; the following year a new album was issued, Le nuvole (\\"The Clouds\\"), which included two more songs in the Genoese dialect, one in the Gallurese dialect of Northern Sardinia (\\"Monti di Mola\\") and one in the Neapolitan dialect, the highly ironic \\"Don Raffaè\\", a mockery of Camorra boss Raffaele Cutolo (also incorporating a number of spoofed stereotypes about Camorra and Naples). A new series of well received live concerts followed, from which a double LP, 1991 concerti (\\"Concerts 1991\\"), was issued. In 1992, he started a new series of live concerts, performing in a number of theatres for the first time. De André's last original album, Anime salve (\\"Saved Souls\\"), was issued in 1996. Written in collaboration with Ivano Fossati, it represents a sort of \\"spiritual will\\", and includes songs such as \\"Khorakhané\\" (dedicated to the Muslim Roma people), \\"Disamistade\\" (a return to his beloved Sardinian themes, which has been translated into English and sung by The Walkabouts) and \\"Smisurata preghiera\\" (\\"Limitless Prayer \\"), based on poems within short stories featured in the collection The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll, by Colombian writer and storyteller Álvaro Mutis. De André also sang a version of this song with its original Colombian Spanish lyrics, \\"Desmedida plegaria\\", which he never officially released (although he gave a copy of the recording to Mutis as a gift). In 1997, he undertook a new tour of theatre concerts and a new collection, called M'innamoravo di tutto, was issued (I Used to Fall in Love with Everything, a quote from one of his older songs, \\"Coda di Lupo\\" – \\"Wolf's Tail\\"), focusing on his earlier works. The Anime salve concert tour went on up to the late summer of 1998, when De André was forced to stop it after the first symptoms of a serious illness, which was later diagnosed as lung cancer. De André died in Milan on 11 January 1999, at 2:30 am. Two days later, he was buried in his native town, Genoa; the ceremony was attended by a crowd of about 20,000. He is buried in the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno, in the De André family chapel. Fabrizio De André and faith In the concept album La buona novella (The Good News) (1970), De André gives us the ultimate expression of his religious vision, making a clear humanization of the divine. In a 1998 concert at the Teatro Brancaccio in Rome, De André made the following statements about the album:Contained in the DVD of the show. alt= The attitude taken by De André against the political use of religion and the Church hierarchy is often sarcastic and highly critical about their contradictory behaviour, such as, for example, in the songs Un blasfemo, Il testamento di Tito, La ballata del Miché and the last verses of Bocca di rosa.Livio Gatti Bottoglia, Non al denaro, non all'amore né al cielo, mensile Civetta, marzo 1999 After the kidnapping, the religious vision of De André had a new development; Posthumous releases and tributes After De André's untimely passing, various releases in various formats appeared as tributes to him and to his career. *In 2000, a tribute concert called Faber, amico fragile... (Faber, frail friend... – titled after De André's nickname in Genoese and the title of one of his best-known songs) was held at Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa, organized by Dori Ghezzi and her Fabrizio De André Foundation. It featured Ghezzi, both of De André's sons and several prominent Italian artists from all genres, giving their own takes on De André's repertoire. In 2003, a live recording of the show was released as a double album; Adriano Celentano, who made several mistakes (due to a lack of proper rehearsals) during his live performance of \\"La guerra di Piero\\" and was booed as a result, re-recorded the song in a studio. \\"Rimini\\", sung by Luvi De André at the very end of the show, was omitted from the album release for unknown reasons.Discogs entry for Faber, amico fragile... *2004 saw the release of Fabrizio De André in Concerto, a DVD chronicling the singer's last-ever filmed live performances, on 14 and 15 February 1998 at Teatro Brancaccio in Rome. The release, which also included an extensive backstage section as a bonus, was overseen by Ghezzi and De André's longtime live director Pepi Morgia.Discogs entry for In Concerto (2004) *In 2005, the 3-CD collection In direzione ostinata e contraria [In a stubborn and opposite direction] was released. Its title was taken from a line in \\"Smisurata preghiera\\", the final track on De André's final album Anime salve (see above), and was chosen by Dori Ghezzi to symbolize her late husband's anticonformist, against-the-grain attitude. The collection included a selection of tracks, made by Ghezzi and Gian Piero Reverberi, from all of De André's official studio albums, as well as the first CD release of \\"Titti\\" (originally issued as the B-side to the 1980 standalone single \\"Una storia sbagliata\\") and an unreleased song, \\"Cose che dimentico\\" [Things I am forgetting], originally written by De André with his son Cristiano in 1998 and recorded by both of them. All the songs on the collection underwent a meticulous and careful process known as \\"de-mastering\\", during which engineers Antonio Baglio and Claudio Bozano went back to the original master tapes and painstakingly removed all of the subsequent layers of remastering to obtain flat digital transfers of the tapes as they were originally intended to sound. The collection was a hit, and was followed by a second volume in 2006.Discogs entry for In direzione ostinata e contrariaDiscogs entry for In direzione ostinata e contraria 2 *Also in 2005, singer and multi-instrumentalist Morgan recorded and released a track-by-track remake/re-recording of Non al denaro non all'amore né al cielo, followed by a tour of Italy and Europe. Morgan's remake is very faithful to the original album, except for the addition of short instrumental interludes between tracks to highlight the concept album aspect of the work; a number of vintage synths, played by Morgan and electronic musician Daniele \\"Megahertz\\" Dupuis (a frequent collaborator of his), were added to the instrumentation. Two wordless vocal melodies sung by Edda Dell'Orso on the original album were re-played by Megahertz on theremin.Discogs entry for Morgan's remake of Non al denaro non all'amore né al cielo *In 2007, sound engineer Paolo Iafelice, one of De André's trusted collaborators in his later years (he took care of Field recordings and other production tasks on Anime salve), undertook a restoration process of De André's historical live recordings from his 1979 tour with PFM. He applied to the tapes the same \\"de-mastering\\" process as on the 2005–2006 collections and mixed them anew, to bring out previously obscured details and to straighten out a few recurring production issues on the original recordings, such as the unintentional variations of tape speed on some songs. The result of Iafelice's efforts was released as Fabrizio De André & PFM in Concerto.Discogs entry for Fabrizio De André & PFM in Concerto *In 2009, Cristiano De André took on an extensive tribute tour of Italy named De André canta De André [DeA sings DeA], originally started on the tenth anniversary of his father's passing, where he performed De André Senior's songs with new rock/hard rock arrangements by keyboard player and programmer Luciano Luisi. The tour, which went on well onto 2010, played to packed audiences throughout Italy and yielded a two-volume live album; both volumes were released as CD+DVD bundles and were followed in 2017 by a third similar release.Discogs entries for De André canta De André, Vol. 2 and Vol. 3 *In 2011, RCS MediaGroup and Corriere della Sera issued Dentro Faber [Inside Faber – De André's nickname in Genoese], an eight-DVD documentary series about De André's life and career, featuring interview clips, rehearsal and behind-the-scenes excerpts, live performances (including several previously unreleased ones), Music videos and narration by Cristiano De André, both in the third and in the first person (as his father). The DVDs were originally released only in Newsstands, as bundles with Sunday editions of Corriere della Sera.Discog entry for Dentro Faber *Also in 2011, British conductor, arranger and composer Geoff Westley, as part of his long curriculum of collaborations with Italian artists, wrote new orchestral arrangements for ten songs selected by Dori Ghezzi and himself from De André's entire career. Westley recorded his arrangements with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and overlaid them with De André's original, isolated studio vocals. The resulting tribute album, which also featured \\"virtual duets\\" with Franco Battiato and Vinicio Capossela, was released as Sogno n° 1, to commercial and critical acclaim.Discogs entry for Sogno n° 1 *In 2012, Ghezzi's label Nuvole Productions, by agreement with the Italian branch of Sony Music, released I concerti [The Concerts], a 16-CD box set collecting all of the existing recordings of De André's live shows. Each 2-CD set features a complete show in its original running order (including spoken interludes and intros) and all of the recordings are previously unreleased in this form. Some of them, namely the ones from 1975–'76 and 1981–'84, were sourced from private recordings by fans and radio broadcasts; although the sound quality of these tapes is slightly inferior to the other professionally recorded concerts, they were included for their historical significance. The recordings from 1997–'98 are officially authorized Soundboard recordings and feature different mixes than earlier live releases compiled from the same material. All of the recordings were digitally restored and remastered.I concerti box set on Fabrizio De André's official website *In 2018, De Agostini released Fabrizio De André in Vinile, an almost-complete collection of De André's recorded output, both studio and live, on 21 vinyl albums. It includes the first-ever vinyl releases, some of them double or triple, of the live material originally featured on the 2012 box set I concerti, as well as the first-ever vinyl release of Anime salve. Although it was presented as fully complete and exhaustive, the collection does not include De André's early 1960s recordings for Karim (which are indeed excluded from all of his posthumous releases); his 1980 standalone single \\"Una storia sbagliata/Titti\\" and his 2003 virtual duet with Mina on \\"La canzone di Marinella\\", are also not featured, although a live recording of \\"Una storia sbagliata\\" is included on the 1981–82: L'indiano double live album. Each album in the collection was accompanied by an album-sized booklet of photos and liner notes, and all of them were sold exclusively in newsstands. Live performance peculiarities As evidenced by the various live performance clips featured within the Dentro Faber documentary series (as noted above), De André was very shy and reserved throughout his career, even as a live performer – indeed, he started performing live only in 1975, with a concert residency at the famous \\"Bussola\\" nightclub in Viareggio, after having reached several high points in his career, because he did not feel confident enough to perform before a live audience. Furthermore, he always viewed his live shows as either a \\"necessary evil\\" or as a job. Because of this, his live performances feature a number of idiosyncratic, eccentric behaviours and attitudes.All information taken from clips included within Dentro Faber. *He hardly ever sung anything while standing up (the song \\"Ottocento\\", from Le nuvole, which he performed during his 1991 tour in support of the album, being a notable exception), preferring instead to sit on a simple wooden chair; he seldom thanked his audience vocally, expressing instead his thanks as small bows from his chairDuring his 1979 concerts with PFM, most of the verbal interaction with the audience, including thanks, was handled by the band's drummer and de facto leader Franz Di Cioccio., and he very rarely delivered standard spoken introductions to single songs (such as \\"The next song is...\\"), although, when performing a series of songs from the same album or an album in its entirety, he spoke at length about the significance and the (lyrical) contents of the album; occasionally, he used a spoken introduction to a song (such as his 1998 concert intro to \\"Via del Campo\\") as a pretext for exposing his ideas and beliefs. While speaking, he would occasionally look down to his prompt book (see below), although his spoken parts were never written beforehand. *In the early years of his career, he only played his own classical nylon-string guitar, systematically refusing to play any other or newer instruments, as he believed his own playing to be worthless in comparison to his band members. (In a 1975 performance with New Trolls as his backing band, he introduced guitarist Ricky Belloni as \\"Ricky Belloni on guitar – the real one!\\")Band intros taken from La Bussola e Storia di un impiegato, CD 1, track 6, I concerti box set (2012). Starting from 1981, Massimo Bubola, who owned a large collection of guitars, convinced him to switch to a better-sounding pre- amplified Ovation guitar; he subsequently used various other brands of Acoustic guitars. It took him ten more years, and Mauro Pagani's influence, to embrace ethnic instruments, such as the bouzouki and the Middle Eastern oud. *In a 1989 interview with Vincenzo Mollica for a special TG1 issue, De André admitted that he used to drink at least one liter of straight whisky before his shows, to win his severe stage fright, and that his intoxicated state often led him to unintentionally amusing mistakes on stage – such as a comment in a 1979 show with PFM, when, after performing the title track to his 1978 album Rimini, he stated that a similar story to the one in the song was told much better in «I Vitellini» by Felloni – a spoonerism for the 1965 film I Vitelloni by Federico Fellini. In the mid-Eighties, after his doctor informed him that his drinking habit was turning into an addiction which could potentially harm his liver, De André adopted an even worse \\"cure\\" for his stage fright – namely, chain smoking, which would ultimately lead to his demise. *He always performed with a \\"prompt book\\", including copies of his lyrics, all in his own handwriting, laid out in front of him on a music stand with a table lamp on top. However, the actual usefulness of the prompt book is doubtful: De André can be seen not using it at all in several occasions (either not looking at it while singing or distancing himself from it, by sitting cross-legged on the stage floor), and he can also be heard singing wrong lyrics every now and then – such as his 14 February 1998 show in Rome (as testified on In Concerto), when he ends the third verse of his song \\"Crêuza de mä\\" by singing the last two lines of the fourth verse, then sings the same lines again in their correct place. (He can also be seen with a wry smile on his face, incongrously with the serious mood of the lyrics, immediately after realizing his mistake.)

From 1580 till his death he served five times as Grand Vizier. Early life Sinan Pasha, also known as Koca Sinan (Sinan the Great), was born in Topojan in Luma territory and was of Albanian origin. In a Ragusan document of 1571 listing members of the Ottoman Sultan's governing council, Sinan is described as coming from a Catholic family that converted to Islam. His father was named Ali Bey and Sinan Pasha had family ties with Catholic relatives such as the Giubizzas.Malcolm, Noel (2015). Agents of Empire: Knights, Corsairs, Jesuits and Spies in the Sixteenth-century Mediterranean World. Oxford University Press. . pp.264–265. \\"Sinan came from a small village in north-eastern Albania. As the writer Lazaro Soranzo put it, very probably deriving his information from Bartolomeo's cousin Antonio Bruni, he was 'an Albanian from Topojan in the sancak [district] of Prizren'. Attempts by some Serb historians to claim a Serbian origin for him are unconvincing. While the group of villages around Topojan was ethnically mixed at this time, probably with a Slav predominance, Topojan was mainly Albanian, and there is good evidence that Sinan's family background was neither Slav or Orthodox. From the fact that documents from the later part of his life refer to his father as 'Ali bey', some have supposed that he was born a Muslim; but it is much more likely that he came from a Catholic family (as the relationship with the Giubizzas strongly suggests), and that once he and his brothers had prospered in their Ottoman careers they persuaded their father to convert, the better to share in that success with them. A Ragusan document of 1571, listing all the 'renegades' in the Sultan's governing council, described Sinan as a Catholic Albanian' by origin.\\" pp.267–268. \\"One of the criticisms made of Sinan repeatedly by Mustafa Ali of Gallipoli was that he promoted an Albanian clique in the military and the government administration; Mustafa Ali wrote admiringly of the Bosnians, such as patron Lala Mustafa and Mehmed Sokollu, and scathingly about Albanians.\\" Austrian orientalist Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall called him the \\"unbridled Albanian\\". Mustafa Ali of Gallipoli repeatedly criticized Sinan for promoting an Albanian clique in the administration. Career Sinan Pasha was appointed governor of Ottoman Egypt in 1569, and was subsequently involved until 1571 in the conquest of Yemen, becoming known as Fātiḥ-i Yemen (\\"Victor of Yemen\\"). In 1580, Sinan commanded the army against the Safavids in the Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590), and was appointed grand vizier by Sultan Murad III. He was, however, disgraced and exiled in the following year, owing to the defeat of his lieutenant Mehmed Pasha, at Gori (during an attempt to provision the Ottoman garrison of Tbilisi). He subsequently became governor of Damascus and, in 1589, after the great revolt of the Janissaries, was appointed grand vizier for the second time. He was involved in the competition for the throne in Wallachia between Mihnea Turcitul and Petru Cercel, and ultimately sided with the former (overseeing Petru's execution in March 1590). Another revolt of Janissaries led to his dismissal in 1591, but in 1593 he was again recalled to become grand vizier for the third time, and in the same year he commanded the Ottoman army in the Long War against the Habsburgs, he was faced with massive casualties on the northern front, which was weakened by the death of Bosnian commander Telli Hasan Pasha during the Battle of Sisak. In 1593, he captured Veszprém and Palota after a 3-4 days of siege and turned his attention to the Sisak, where Telli Hasan Pasha and Ahmed Pasha had died. He soon captured Sisak and came back to Belgrad. The burning of Saint Sava's relics by the Ottomans, painting by Stevan Aleksić (1912); Sinan Pasha ordered the relics to be burned When Habsburgs invaded Szécsény and Nógrád he demanded help from Istanbul. The agha of Janissaries, Sokolluzade Lala Mehmed Pasha, came to help in a short time. Then he started besieging Györ (Yanuk) and captured the castle. In 1594 during the Uprising in Banat, he ordered for the relics (remains) of Saint Sava to be brought from Mileševa to Belgrade, where he then had them set on fire in order to discourage the Serbs. In spite of his victories he was again deposed in February 1595, shortly after the accession of Mehmed III, and banished to Malkara. In August, Sinan was in power again, called on to lead the expedition against Prince Michael the Brave of Wallachia. His defeat in the Battle of Călugăreni, the Battle of Giurgiu, and the series of unsuccessful confrontations with the Habsburgs (culminating in the devastating siege and fall of Ottoman-held Esztergom), brought him once more into disfavour, and he was deprived of the seal of office (19 November). The death of his successor Lala Mehmed Pasha three days later caused Sinan to become grand vizier for the fifth time. He died suddenly in the spring of 1596, leaving behind a large fortune. Sinan Pasha is buried in Istanbul near the Grand Bazaar. Legacy Sinan Pasha commanded the Ottoman Army in the Battle of Călugăreni (1595). Sinan Pasha became grand vizier five times between 1580 and his death in 1596. He had many rivals but he was also a very wealthy man. During his lifetime Sinan Pasha was criticized by Ottoman bureaucrats such as Mustafa Âlî who wrote that Sinan promoted Albanians into the Ottoman government and military. Contemporary Turkish historians also note that he remained close to his heritage and would give those of Albanian stock preference for high-level positions within the empire. In 1586, at his request, Sultan Murad III issued a decree exempting five villages in Luma from all taxes. Sinan Pasha constructed the fortress of Kaçanik in the Kosovo Vilayet with an imaret (soup kitchen), two hans (Inn), a hamam (Turkish bath) and a mosque that still bears his name. In 1590, he had the Pearl Kiosk built above the seaward walls on the sea of Marmara. It served as Murad III's final residence before his death. One of his final projects in Constantinople was a külliye completed in from 1593 to 1594 by Davut Aga, the chief imperial architect of the time. It is distinguished by the complex masonry and decorations of its türbe and sebil. He was a major builder of caravanserais, bridges, baths and mosques. These included the town of Kaçanik in Kosovo, important buildings in Thessalonika and Belgrade, as well as in Istanbul and other countries in the Arab world.

It was the first socialist party to operate in the Ottoman Empire and in Iran, also known as Persia.Social Democrat Hunchakian Party Among its founders were Avetis Nazarbekian, Mariam Vardanian, Gevorg Gharadjian, Ruben Khan-Azat, Christopher Ohanian, Gabriel Kafian and Manuel Manuelian. Its original goal was attaining Armenia's independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Armenian national liberation movement.Lebanon a Country Study By Federal Research Division - Page 185 The party is also known as Hentchak, Henchak, Social-Democratic Hentchaks, Huntchakians, Hnchakian, Henchags, its name is taken from its newspaper Hunchak, meaning \\"clarion\\" or \\"bell\\", and is taken by party members to represent \\"a call or awakening, for enlightenment and freedom\\". History All seven founders of the party were Eastern Armenian Marxist students who had left Russian Armenia to further their education in various universities of Western Europe. They were young, in their twenties, and supported by their affluent bourgeois families. They were influenced by social-democratic revolutionary ideology, contacted Frederick Engels, Georgi Plekhanov and later Vladimir Lenin. Mariam Vardanian had worked with Russian revolutionaries in Saint Petersburg. For the purpose of furthering revolutionary activity in Turkish Armenia, they formed the Hunchakian Revolutionary Party in August, 1887.

In 1894 in Athens and London the party published a socialist scientific monthly, Gaghapar, which for the first time published \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" in Armenian, translated by Avetis and Mariam Nazarbekians. The First General Conference of Hunchakian party took place in London, in September 1896. In the Caucasus the Hunchakian party has also played a prominent role, it combated the russification policy of Viceroy Grigory Golitsyn, the Russian governor of Caucasus. In 1903 Paramaz organized the assassination attempt of Grigory Golitsyn. Paramaz was also one of the organizers of self-defence troops during the Armenian-Tatar massacres of 1905-06. Activities in the Ottoman Empire On July 27, 1890, Hunchakian activists Harutiun Jangülian, Mihran Damadian and Hambartsum Boyajian headed Kum Kapu Affray in Constantinople, which demanded the implementation of reforms in the Western Armenian provinces. In the early 1890s frequent clashes between the Armenian inhabitants of Sason and the Turkish forces took place because of Sassontsis' refusal to pay retroactive taxes to the Turkish government.

Thus the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, alongside all the other Armenian traditional political parties effectively became a party of the Armenian diaspora only. But the party remained in general a supporter of the development of the Armenian SSR for many decades, in sharp contrast to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) that remained opposed to the Communist regime in Armenia. This resulted at many times in feuds and rift between the Hunchaks and the Dashnaks in many centers of the Armenian diaspora, a situation becoming worse with religious differences, with the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party supporting Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin of the Armenian Apostolic Church and the ARF supporting the Holy See of Cilicia. In these conflicts, the Armenian Democratic Liberal Party was seen as a political ally on the side of the SDHP and in opposition to the ARF. Activities in Lebanon In the 1950s, it clashed, sometimes violently, with the Dashnak Party, due to tensions that escalated when the ARF elected Bishop Zareh as Zareh I, Catholicos of Cilicia, a move that was rejected by the Hunchaks. This period was characterized by an escalation of conflict between the ARF on one side, and the SDHP and the ally ADL (Ramgavars) on the other side. In the midst of increasing sectarian strife in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which led to the Lebanese Civil War, however, Lebanon's Armenian community began to close ranks, and in 1972, the Hunchakian Party ran a joint ticket with the Dashnaks. In 2000, the Hunchakian Party joined forces with Rafik Hariri's Future Movement, which swept the city of Beirut. SDHP Central Committee Member Dr Yeghia Jerejian was a member of Lebanese Parliament for many years. Currently the party is represented in the parliament by Sebouh Kalpakian. Modern In 1991 Yeghia Najarian headed SDHP organization in independent Armenia and founded \\"Hnchak Hayastani\\" official organ. In the early 1990s, the party took part in the self-defense of Zangezur (Paramaz battalion) and Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (Jirair-Mourad battalion led by Gevorg Guzelian). The party formed part of the Armenian opposition and had a representative at the National Assembly of Armenia. The party is also active in the Armenian diaspora and in Lebanon as well, where it competes for the six National Assembly seats reserved for ethnic Armenians. The party subscribes to a socialist ideology and advocates a planned economy for Lebanon. Social Democrat Hunchakian Party has an official newspaper in Lebanon which is the Ararad daily newspaper. Party's 20th General Conference took place in September 2013, in Yerevan and Tsakhkadzor, with the participation of delegates from 17 countries.Партия Гнчакян считает недостаточным прогресс в деле укрепления демократии Armenia Today, 20.09.2013 Affiliate organizations The Hunchakian party has established affiliate organizations such as the AEBU which is an organization that helps with educational, health and social care, the Dekhrouni Student & Youth Association (founded in 1952, in Beirut), the Gaidz Youth Organization (founded in 1910, in Constantinople), Nor Serount Cultural Association (founded in 1954, in Beirut), and HMM (Homenmen) which is an independent sporting organization but strongly affiliated with the SDHP (not to be confused with Homenetmen considered largely affiliated with the ARF). Party publications Hunchak journal Hunchak (also Hnchak, Hentchak, \\"Bell\\" in Armenian) was the official organ of the party. It was founded by Avetis Nazarbekian and published in 1887-1915, 1935–1940, in France, Greece, Britain and United States. The main purpose of the paper was the propagand of the Armenian national movement for the liberation, the resistance in Western Armenian regions. Hunchak also supported the ideology of social-democracy and worker's consolidation.

Possessing heavy belt armor and featuring an armored flight deck (a first for any Japanese aircraft carrier), she represented a major departure from prior Japanese aircraft carrier design and was expected to not only survive multiple bomb, torpedo, or shell hits, but also continue fighting effectively afterwards. Built by Kawasaki at Kobe, she was laid down on 10 July 1941, launched almost two years later on 7 April 1943 and finally commissioned on 7 March 1944. She sank on 19 June 1944 during the Battle of the Philippine Sea due to explosions resulting from design flaws and poor damage control after suffering a single torpedo hit from an American submarine. Design Taihō was approved for construction in the 1939 4th Supplementary Programme. Her design was that of a modified . Under the Modified Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942, Taihō was to be the first of a new generation of Japanese aircraft carriers, which would include Taihō, 15 of a modified design (which turned into the ) and five of an improved Taiho design (G-15 Project).Reynolds (1968), p.61 Hull Taihos waterline belt armor varied between abreast the machinery to around the magazines. The armor below the waterline was designed to withstand a charge. Internal torpedo protection comprised a anti-splinter steel bulkhead, inboard of the outer plating. The weight of Taihos armor immersed her hull so deeply that her lower hangar deck was barely above the load waterline and the bottoms of her two elevator wells (which formed the roofs of her fore and aft aviation fuel tanks) were actually below the waterline. This latter fact played an important role in her subsequent destruction during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Taihōs aviation fuel tanks were only partially protected with armor, as naval designers opted earlier to devote greater protection to their carriers' bomb and torpedo magazines. The empty air spaces around the aviation fuel tanks turned out to be the ship's downfall; all subsequent Japanese carriers had theirs filled with concrete to protect against splinters and shock damage, although it was poor damage control that ultimately sank Taiho. To improve seakeeping and airflow over the forward end of the deck, Taihōs bow was plated up to flight deck level, giving her a similar appearance to British s. Machinery Taihōs eight oil-fired Kampon RO-GO boilers were capable of generating . Her four Kampon steam turbines were each geared to separate propeller shafts. She had a top speed of . Taihōs maximum fuel oil stowage of gave her a radius of at .Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.5 Taihō had two rudders positioned along the longitudinal center-line of the ship: a semi-balanced main rudder (so-called because a portion of the rudder comes before the hinged axis and therefore requires less force to turn) located astern and an unbalanced auxiliary rudder forward of the main rudder. Both were turned via electro-hydraulically powered steering gears, but the auxiliary rudder could also be turned via a diesel engine in the event the primary steering gear was damaged.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.6 Flight deck Taihō was the first Japanese aircraft carrier to feature an armored flight deck, designed to withstand multiple bomb hits with minimal damage. The armor varied slightly in thickness between and formed a protective lid over an enclosed upper hangar whose sides and ends were unarmored. The floor of the upper hangar was also unarmored but the lower hangar deck had plating.Brown, p.29 Taihōs flight deck, measuring long and wide, had the largest total area of any Japanese carrier until the completion of and was offset to port to compensate for the weight of her island structure.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.12 Unlike all pre-war Japanese carriers, Taihōs flight deck was not wooden-planked. Rather, the steel deck was covered with a newly developed latex coating approximately thick. This offered several advantages over wood: it was cheaper, it saved weight, it required fewer man- hours to apply and it was less likely to interfere with air operations in the event of minor damage. On the negative side, the material had only mediocre anti-skid qualities and tended to become brittle and crack over time.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.74 Fourteen hydraulically operated arrester wires were distributed transversely across the flight deck between the fore and aft elevators. Taihō also had three hydraulically powered crash barriers, designed to abruptly stop any plane failing to catch an arrester wire upon landing. Two were located abreast the island and one was set at the bow.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.23 Taihō was equipped with two large armored elevators, capable of transferring aircraft weighing up to between decks. The elevators were widely spaced apart, with one at the far aft end of the ship and one forward of the island. It was originally desired to install a third elevator amidship, but because of wartime urgency this was deleted from the final design, thus saving both time and material. The elevators were roughly pentagonal in shape, with the aft elevator measuring long and wide. The forward elevator was slightly smaller in width. It took approximately 15 seconds to raise an aircraft from the lower hangar deck to the flight deck and the same to lower one.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.13 Hangars Taihōs upper and lower hangars were approximately long and high. The upper hangar was wider than the lower. Fighters were normally stowed in the middle and forward sections of the upper hangar and were raised to flight deck level using the bow elevator to facilitate more rapid handling. Dive bombers occupied the remaining upper hangar spaces with torpedo bombers stowed in the lower hangar. With greater all-up weights and longer take-off runs than the fighters, these planes were brought up to the flight deck using the aft elevator where they could then be spotted as far astern as possible. As a fire safety precaution, the carrier's two hangars were divided into sections (five on the upper and four on the lower), separated by fire-proofed fabric curtains. The curtains were intended to limit the supply of air to and delay the spread of any fire breaking out on the hangar decks. Further protection against fire was supplied by a foam spray system fed by two rows of pipes and nozzles running along the walls and ends of the hangars. The lower hangar could also be flooded with carbon dioxide where the likelihood of fuel vapor build-up was greatest.Brown, p.6 Taihos original design specified installation of two catapults on her forward bow for power-assisted take-offs. However, as the Imperial Japanese Navy had not developed a workable catapult for carrier decks by the time of Taihos construction, these were eventually deleted from the requirements. The IJN instead opted to use rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG) when necessary. This consisted of two solid-propellant (cordite) rockets attached to either side of a plane's fuselage. Generating of thrust for three seconds, they were able to get an aircraft airborne in a much shorter distance than normally required.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.14 On Taihōs port side, abreast the aft elevator, stood a collapsible crane with a lifting capacity. When not in use, it could be folded and lowered below flight deck level through an opening in the deck, thus eliminating a potentially hazardous obstruction during air operations. Taihōs single large funnel, built into the island, was angled 26° from the vertical to starboard and carried the ship's exhaust gases well clear of the flight deck. This arrangement, atypical of most Japanese carriers, was similar to that successfully employed on and and would later be repeated on .Gardiner and Chesneau (1980), p.183 Three Type 96 searchlights were positioned along the outer edges of the flight deck: two on the port side and one to starboard, just aft of the island. Like the collapsible crane, these could be lowered below flight deck level to prevent interference with normal flight activity. A fourth searchlight was mounted to the starboard side of the carrier’s island on a projecting sponson.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.62 Armament Taihos armament comprised 12 of the brand-new /65 caliber Type 98 anti-aircraft guns arranged in six twin-gun turrets: three on the port side and three to starboard. The guns were electro-hydraulically powered; however, in the event of a power failure they could function manually at reduced effectiveness. Operated by a crew of 11, the average firing rate was 15 rounds per minute with a maximum effective horizontal range of and a maximum effective vertical range of .Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.49 In addition, Taihō carried 17 triple-mount anti- aircraft cannons (51 barrels total). Sixteen of these were mounted on sponsons just below flight deck level: eight to port, six to starboard and two at the stern. The 17th unit was positioned on the flight deck, just ahead of the island. The triple-mounts were electrically powered (though manual operation was possible) and normally required a crew of nine. They had a practical firing rate of 110–120 rounds per minute and a maximum effective range of . The Type 96 cannon was the Japanese Navy's standard small-caliber anti- aircraft weapon from 1936 through the end of the war in 1945 and was an adaptation of a French design.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.53 Taihō had two Type 94 triaxially stabilized fire control directors, one mounted on the flight deck ahead of the island and one amidships on the port side, just below flight deck level. These controlled the gun turrets and were electro-hydraulically powered.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.58 The triple-mount cannons were controlled by seven Type 95 fire control units, each of which could direct the fire of two or three mounts.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.61 Radar Taihōs original design made no provisions for radar installation as the Imperial Japanese Navy did not possess any shipborne surface, fire control or air search radar at the war's outset in September 1939. Not until January 1941, when a Japanese naval technical mission arrived in Germany, did the IJN learn that European nations were using pulsed radar for combat purposes. In August that same year, the Navy Ministry initiated a crash plan to speed up radar development, resulting in (among others) the Type 21 and Type 13 air search radars.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.64 Prior to completion in 1944, Taihō was fitted with two Type 21 air search radars, one mounted atop the island on the anti-aircraft control platform and one on the lower bridge deck at the aft end of the island. She also had one Type 13 air search set installed with an antenna mounted on the signal mast above the bridge. The Type 21 had a maximum effective range of while the Type 13 had a range of Friedman, p.207 Aircraft Taihōs planned air complement varied considerably throughout her design and construction. Initially, it was envisioned she would carry 126 aircraft (with 30 of these in reserve). Later, this was pared down to 64, raised again to 78 and finally reduced to 53. One reason for the discrepancy in numbers was (in sharp contrast to the United States) the Imperial Japanese Navy's lack of insistence that its carrier planes have the smallest possible folded wingspan (many designs' folded only near the tips, while the wings of the Yokosuka D4Y Suisei dive-bomber did not fold at all). Her aircraft capacity was also changed based on previous wartime experience and the fact that Taihō was expected to carry larger newer-model carrier planes still under development at the time of her construction: 24 Mitsubishi A7M2 Reppu \\"Sam\\" fighters, 25 Aichi B7A2 Ryusei \\"Grace\\" torpedo- dive bombers and four Nakajima C6N1 Saiun \\"Myrt\\" reconnaissance planes. As none of these types were available at the time of her commissioning, Taihō went to sea with older-model aircraft.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.32 Prior to 13 June 1944, Taihō carried 65 aircraft: 22 Mitsubishi A6M5 Reisen (Zero) fighters, 22 Yokosuka D4Y1 Suisei \\"Judy\\" dive bombers (of which four were the D4Y1-C reconnaissance types), three Aichi D3A2 \\"Val\\" dive bombers and 18 Nakajima B6N2 Tenzan \\"Jill\\" torpedo bombers. By 19 June 1944, however, the day the Battle of the Philippine Sea took place, she had already lost nine aircraft due to various causes and had just 56 planes remaining for actual combat.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.48 Service history Battle of the Philippine Sea Taihō at anchor at Lingga Roads. The carrier is in the background. Taihō was formally commissioned on 7 March 1944. After several weeks of service trials in Japan's Inland Sea, she was deployed to Singapore, arriving there on 5 April. Taihō was then moved to Lingga Roads, a naval anchorage off Sumatra, where she joined veteran carriers and in the First Carrier Division, First Mobile Force. All three carriers engaged in working up new air groups by practicing launch and recovery operations and acting as targets for mock aerial attacks staged from Singapore airfields by their own planes.Evans, p.304 On 15 April, Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa officially transferred his flag from Shōkaku to Taihō to take advantage of the carrier's extensive command facilities. Shortly thereafter, the First Mobile Force departed Lingga and arrived on 14 May at Tawi-Tawi off Borneo, where the fleet could directly refuel with unrefined Tarakan Island crude oil and await execution of the planned Kantai Kessen (\\"decisive battle\\") known as Operation A-GO.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.84 When American carrier strikes against the Marianas indicated an invasion of Saipan was imminent, the Japanese Combined Fleet staff initiated Operation A-GO on 11 June. Taihō and the rest of Ozawa's First Mobile Force departed Tawi-Tawi on 13 June, threading their way through the Philippine Islands and setting course for Saipan to attack American carrier forces operating in the vicinity. Fate On 19 June 1944, Taihō was one of nine Japanese aircraft carriers involved in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. At 07:45 she turned into the wind to launch her contribution (16 Zeros, 17 \\"Judy\\" dive bombers and nine \\"Jill\\" torpedo bombers) to Ozawa's second attack wave. As Taihōs planes circled overhead to form up, American submarine , which had spotted Ozawa's carriers earlier that morning, reached an ideal attack position and fired a spread of six torpedoes at the carrier. One of Taihōs strike pilots, Warrant Officer Sakio Komatsu, saw the torpedo wakes, broke formation and deliberately dived his plane into the path of one torpedo; the weapon detonated short of its targetReynolds (1968), p.192 and four of the remaining five missed. The sixth torpedo, however, found its mark and the resulting explosion holed the carrier's hull on the starboard side, just ahead of the island. The impact also fractured the aviation fuel tanks and jammed the forward elevator between the flight deck and upper hangar deck. With the ship down 1.5m (5ft) by the bows due to flooding, the forward elevator pit filled with a mixture of seawater, fuel oil and aviation gasoline, Taihos captain marginally reduced her speed by a knot and a half to slow the ingress of seawater into the hull where the torpedo had struck. As no fires had started, Vice-Admiral Ozawa ordered that the open elevator well be planked over by a flight deck damage control party in order to allow resumption of normal flight operations. By 09:20 am, using wooden benches and tables from the petty officers' and sailors' mess rooms, this task was completed. Ozawa then launched two more waves of aircraft. Meanwhile, leaking aviation gasoline accumulating in the forward elevator pit began vaporizing and the fumes soon permeated the upper and lower hangar decks. The crew recognised the danger but, through inadequate training, lack of practice or incompetence, their response was ineffectual. They bungled attempts to pump out the damaged elevator well, and failed to cover the fuel with foam from the hangar's fire suppression system.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.91 Because Taihōs hangars were completely enclosed, mechanical ventilation was the only means of exhausting fouled air and replacing it with fresh air. Ventilation duct gates were opened on either side of hangar sections No. 1 and No. 2 and, for a time, the carrier's aft elevator was lowered to try to increase the draught. But this failed to have any appreciable effect and air operations were resumed about noon, requiring the elevator to be periodically raised as aircraft were brought up to the flight deck. In desperation, damage control parties used hammers to smash out the glass in the ship's portholes. Sinking Taihōs chief damage control officer eventually ordered the ship's general ventilation system switched to full capacity and, where possible, all doors and hatches opened to try to rid the ship of fumes. However, this just resulted in saturation of areas previously unexposed to the vapors and increased the chances of accidental or spontaneous ignition. About 14:30 that afternoon, 6½ hours after the initial torpedo hit, Taihō was jolted by a severe explosion. A senior staff officer on the bridge saw the flight deck heave up, and the sides of the ship blew out. Taihō dropped out of formation and began to settle in the water, clearly doomed. Though Admiral Ozawa wanted to go down with the ship, his staff prevailed on him to survive and to transfer his flag to the cruiser . Taking the Emperor's portrait, Ozawa transferred to Haguro by destroyer. After he left, Taihō was torn by a second thunderous explosion and sank stern first at 16:28, taking 1,650 officers and men out of a complement of 2,150 down with her.Ahlberg/Lengerer, p.93Dull, p.320 She sank at coordinates .

The PDC was one of the few parties within National Opposition Front (FRENO) (a coalition of eight opposition parties formed in March 1979) that offered a programmatic alternative to military government policy by calling for substantial social reforms and expanded participation in democratic processes.Library of Congress, Federal Research Division. Panama: A Country Study. Ed. Sandra W. Meditz and Dennis M. Hanratty. Washington: GPO, 1989. Pp. 314. The PDC advocated for introducing nationalist social reforms to preclude revolutionary action. Its leader, Ricardo Arias Calderón, was the main promoter of the formation of a united opposition against the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). The leaders of the party strongly opposed the government, seeing in its actions \\"a furthering of communist penetration into Central America.\\" The PDC re-registered on 28 August 1980.Electoral Tribunal, Reseñas de Juntas Directivas por Partido The PDC won 20.6% of the vote and two seats in the 1980 legislative elections (to 19 of the 56 seats in the newly formed National Legislative Council, the other 37 being filled by nominees of a non-party National Assembly of Community Representatives established in 1972). In December 1981, Calderón was elected president of the Organization of Christian-Democratic Parties of America. In 1984, it was part of the Democratic Opposition Alliance (ADO), which supported the presidential candidacy of Arnulfo Arias of Authentic Panameñista Party (PPA). Ricardo Arias Calderón was a Second Vice-Presidential candidate.Banks, p. 637. The ADO lost the presidential and legislative elections following suspected widespread fraud by the military. In 1987, the PDC became increasingly involved in confrontations with the government, openly campaigning by strikes (supported mainly by businesses rather than labor unions) and street demonstrations (which were often violently repressed) for the resignation or removal of General Manuel Noriega. Ricardo Arias Calderón referring to charges against Manuel Noriega of murder, drug trafficking, corruption, and electoral fraud, described him as \\"virtually a dictator and gangster\\". For the 1989 elections, the PDC was the main component of the Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition (ADOC), with the Guillermo Endara as the coalition's presidential candidate. Calderón was viewed as a likely successor to Arias as the principal spokesman for the opposition, eventually accepting nomination as ADOC First Vice- Presidential candidate in 1989. The PDC polled 261,598 votes (40.18%), coming in first among twelve nominees.Nohlen, p. 533 After the official ratification of the results following the US military invasion in December 1989, Calderón became First Vice-President and Interior and Justice Minister, and the PDC became the largest party in the Legislative Assembly with 28 of the 67 seats. Emboldened by a plurality within the Legislative Assembly, the PDC was estranged from its coalition partners in September 1990 when they joined with the opposition PRD to reject its nominees for chamber officials. The party stayed within the ADOC until April 1991, when its ministerial delegation was ousted by President Guillermo Endara for displaying \\"disloyalty and arrogance.\\" That had followed months of infighting during which Calderón had publicly described Guillermo Endara's economic program, which advocated severe austerity measures and the privatization of state enterprises, as \\"senseless.\\" Its withdrawal from the ADOC coalition government caused a political crisis. In succeeding months, the PDC became the leader of the opposition, to such an extent that it was exerting strong influence within such organizations as the Civic Crusade, an organization from which Endara had drawn his strongest support and called for a plebiscite to decide on his desirability of Endara remaining in office.Political parties of the world. 5th ed. Edited by Alan J. Day. Harlow: Longman. 2002. Pp 367. . In September 1991, the PDC was judged firmly to have secured its political influence on parliamentary committees as a direct result of facilitating the victory of a dissident Authentic Liberal Party (PLA) candidate in the election of a new President of the Legislative Assembly. Calderón resigned as First Vice-President of the Republic in December 1992 in a move that was seen as reflecting a desire to distance himself from Endara. In 1994, Eduardo Vallarino, the candidate of PDC, unsuccessfully ran in the presidential elections, obtaining only 25,476 votes (2.39%). As a result, the party only managed to gain one seat in the legislative elections. For the 1999 elections, the PDC was the main component of the Opposition Action Alliance (AAO), with the PDC's Alberto Vallarino Clement as the coalition's presidential candidate. He polled 221,459 votes (17.38%) and came fourth (the PDC – 140,824 and 11.05%). The PDC won 5 legislative seats.Nohlen, p. 534 On 10 September 2001, the PDC changed its name to People's Party. In 2004, the PP allied with the New Fatherland (PN) and its candidate Martín Torrijos Espino of Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). In 2009, the PP allied with the One Country for All (UPPT) and its candidate Balbina Herrera of Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD).Electoral Tribunal In 2014, the PP allied with the Panameñista Party and its candidate Juan Carlos Varela to form the El Pueblo Primero alliance, which won the election with 39% of the vote on May 4, 2014. As a result, several members of the party are currently serving in the Varela Administration, highlighted by the party's president Milton Henriquez who serves as Minister of Government. The PP is a full member of the Christian Democrat International and Christian Democratic Organization of America.

He supported the CUP, the political party which came to power after the Ottoman coup d'état of 1913.  Biography  He became first secretary to Sultan Abdul Hamid II shortly after the Sultan's accession, and is said to have contributed to the realizations of his majesty's design of concentrating power in his own hands; later he became successively minister of the interior and then governor of Bursa, reaching the high post of grand vizier in 1879. He was grand vizier seven more times under Abdul Hamid II, and once under his successor, Mehmed V. He was known for his opposition to the extension of foreign influence in Turkey. In 1896, he took refuge at the British embassy in Constantinople, and, though then assured of his personal liberty and safety, remained practically a prisoner in his own house. He came into temporary prominence again during the revolution of 1908. On 22 July he succeeded Mehmed Ferid Pasha as grand vizier, but on the 6 August was replaced by the more liberal Kâmil Pasha, at the insistence of the Young Turks. Also during 1908, Mehmed Said Pasha bought the famed Istanbul arcade in the Beyoğlu district, today known as Çiçek Pasajı (\\"Flower Passage\\").

It is the third of a series of live-action musical feature films starring Jim Henson's Muppets with special appearances by Art Carney, James Coco, Dabney Coleman, Gregory Hines, Linda Lavin, and Joan Rivers. The film was produced by Henson Associates and TriStar Pictures, and was filmed in New York City during the summer of 1983 and released theatrically the following summer. It was the first film to be directed solely by Oz (who also performs Sam the Eagle, Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, and Animal), who previously co-directed The Dark Crystal with Henson. The film introduced the Muppet Babies, as toddler versions of the Muppet characters in a fantasy sequence. The eponymous animated television series premiered on CBS in September 1984, airing until 1991. This is also the final Muppet film to be released before the deaths of Jim Henson and Richard Hunt. Plot Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and the rest of the Muppets have graduated from Danhurst College and entertain their fellow graduates with their theatrical production of Manhattan Melodies. Upon the suggestion of taking the show to Broadway, the Muppets proceed with the idea, certain they will become stars instantly. Arriving in Manhattan, the group meet producer Martin Price (Dabney Coleman), but the police arrive and reveal he is a wanted con artist named Murray Plotsky. Plotsky is arrested, leaving the Muppets' hopes dashed. They try other theatrical producers to no avail, leading to their morale and finances taking a nosedive. Thinking they are becoming a burden to Kermit when he snaps at them, the rest of the Muppets agree to go their separate ways for new occupations, though Miss Piggy secretly remains in Manhattan to keep an eye on Kermit. Though disappointed by the development, Kermit vows to make the show a hit and enlists the assistance of diner owner Pete (Louis Zorich), his daughter Jenny (Juliana Donald) who is an aspiring fashion designer, and the diner's staff of rats led by Rizzo. Attempting to promote the show, Kermit first poses as an eccentric producer bragging about the musical's quality but the producer he meets (John Landis) discards the script after Kermit makes his exit. Kermit then poses as a famous playwright, having the rats insert a caricature picture at Sardi's restaurant by replacing Liza Minnelli's picture with it. When Liza Minnelli comes in and notices it missing, she asks Vincent Sardi Jr. if she did something wrong to get it removed. When the rats are exposed, Sardi discovers Liza's picture near Kermit. This causes Kermit and the rats to get thrown out of the restaurant. Kermit learns from letters that Scooter got a job as a house manager at a movie theater in Cleveland, Ohio where he finds The Swedish Chef as the popcorn server and Lew Zealand as a dedicated viewer of a 3-D movie; Fozzie joins some other bears in hibernating within the forests of Maine where he has a hard time hibernating; Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem have a gig in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania performing in a retirement home; The Great Gonzo and Camilla the Chicken are trying to make a successful water act in Michigan; and Rowlf the Dog is working at a dog kennel in Delaware. While in Central Park, Jenny comforts Kermit about his losses, while an envious Miss Piggy watches. When a thief steals her purse, Miss Piggy borrows a pair of roller skates and furiously gives chase until she captures him, but reunites with Kermit in the process and they make up. Piggy takes a job at Pete's diner. Kermit then receives a letter from producer Bernard Crawford (Art Carney) who is interested in the musical. However, the letter was actually written by his son, Ronnie Crawford (Lonny Price), who is struggling to prove himself as a producer and believes that \\"Manhattan Melodies\\" is good. Bernard himself is hesitant but agrees to fund the show. A thrilled Kermit heads back to the diner but is so happy that he walks into oncoming traffic and is struck by a passing car. The rest of the Muppets are summoned back to New York, only to discover that Kermit has disappeared. At the hospital, Kermit's doctor discovers that he has lost memory of his life. He makes his way to Madison Avenue where he meets a trio of frogs, Bill, Gill, and Jill, who work in advertising and offer him a job when he comes up with a slogan. He takes the job and begins going by \\"Phil.\\" The rest of the Muppets search for Kermit, with Gonzo at one point trying to persuade Mayor Edward I. Koch to assist. Bill, Gill, Jill, and Kermit/\\"Phil\\" end up visiting Pete's diner where Kermit's friends recognize him when he plays the show's opening number with spoons. At the Biltmore Theatre on opening night, the Muppets try to help Kermit remember. When Kermit laughs at the idea of being in love with Miss Piggy, she karate chops him, restoring his memory. Kermit, realizing the show needs more Muppets, requests that the Madison Avenue frogs, the dogs, the bears, the chickens, and others become supernumeraries. The show is a success, culminating in what is intended to be a staged wedding between Kermit and Miss Piggy's characters, only for a real minister to appear. With all of the Muppets, the Sesame Street Muppets, and Uncle Traveling Matt from Fraggle Rock present, Kermit and Miss Piggy get married as the film ends.

Having directed The Great Muppet Caper and The Dark Crystal back-to-back, Henson decided to serve as the producer along with David Lazer. Upon selecting fellow Muppet performer and The Dark Crystal co-director Frank Oz to handle directorial duties, Henson stated, \\"I was looking at the year ahead and I thought my life was very busy and I thought maybe it was a time to have Frank directing one of these.\\" Shortly after, Oz confirmed his involvement to the project. The first draft titled The Muppets: The Legend Continues, written by Muppet Caper scribes Jay Tarses and Tom Patchett, was dismissed by Oz for being \\"way too over jokey\\". After being given Henson's encouragement to tinker with the script, Oz revised the screenplay in an effort to develop the \\"oomph of the characters and their relationships\\". Once the script was completed and the sets were built, special consultant David Misch was brought in to write cameos for some guest star appearances. Originally, this list of guest stars contained the likes of Dustin Hoffman, Steve Martin, Michael Jackson, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor, and Laurence Olivier to name a few. According to Misch, Hoffman was going to play a Broadway producer and planned to do an imitation of legendary film producer Robert Evans (The Godfather), which he later did in the film Wag the Dog. However, at the last minute, Hoffman decided that the role could be offensive to Evans and dropped out, following which all the other big names dropped out as well. Because of the dropped cameos, Misch and director Oz ended up rewriting most of the film's dialogue. Release Marketing The Muppets Take Manhattan was adapted by Marvel Comics in 1984, as the 68-page story in Marvel Super Special #32. The adaptation was later re-printed into a three-issue limited series, released under Marvel's Star Comics imprint (November 1984 – January 1985). The film's script was adapted into comic form by writer Stan Kay with art by Dean Yeagle and Jacqueline Roettcher. Unlike in the film, the comic depicts Gonzo, Floyd Pepper, Animal, Janice, Dr. Teeth, and Zoot in their customary outfits from The Muppet Show. In addition, a book-and-record set of the film was released in the form of a vinyl record through the Muppet Music Records label. Box office Although the film did not out-gross its predecessors, it did gross $25,534,703 making it the second highest-grossing G-rated film of 1984 (behind the re-issue of Disney's Pinocchio). Critical reception The Muppets Take Manhattan opened on July 13, 1984 to mostly positive reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 83% of 23 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.9 out of 10. The site's consensus stated that \\"if it's not quite as sharp as The Muppet Movie, The Muppets Take Manhattan is still a smart, delightfully old-fashioned tale that follows the formula established by the first two movies -- a madcap adventure assisted by a huge group of human stars.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a three star rating (out of four) stating in his review that \\"the plot of [the] movie has been seen before.\\" However, Ebert went on to say that just about everything in the film was enjoyable and that Kermit finally solves his long-lasting identity crisis. In his 2009 Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film a three star rating (out of four) as well citing that the film is an \\"enjoyable outing with bouncy songs, [with a] nice use of N.Y.C. locations.\\" Home media Unlike the Henson's previous films (The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, and The Dark Crystal), The Muppets Take Manhattan was originally released by TriStar Pictures and not produced by ITC Entertainment; mainly because ITC was suffering from extreme financial difficulties at the time. Therefore, unlike the previous films, the distribution rights to The Muppets Take Manhattan did revert to The Jim Henson Company in 1998, but did not revert to The Walt Disney Company in 2004. Due to this, it is one of three Muppet films (along with Muppets from Space and the direct-to-video feature Kermit's Swamp Years) whose home video distribution rights are still controlled by Sony Pictures, and not the Walt Disney Studios (The film rights are co-owned by TriStar Pictures and The Jim Henson Company). The Muppets Take Manhattan was first released on VHS and the now defunct CED Videodisc format by CBS/Fox Video in 1985, which then reissued it in 1991, followed by a release from Columbia TriStar Home Video and Jim Henson Home Entertainment on June 1, 1999. The 1999 VHS contained a slightly edited cut from previous versions, possibly derived from the TV broadcast version. Cuts include removal of the audio from the TriStar logo, the scenes of Animal shouting \\"Bad man!\\" to Mr. Price, removal of the words \\"Oh my God\\" in one scene, and scenes with Miss Piggy hitting the purse snatcher. A DVD version was released on June 5, 2001 with the cuts from the 1999 VHS version restored. A Blu-ray edition was released on August 16, 2011, and contains the same bonus features as the DVD. Music Jeff Moss was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the music he composed for The Muppets Take Manhattan, but lost to Purple Rain by Prince. Soundtrack The Muppets Take Manhattan: The Original Soundtrack contains all of the songs written by Jeff Moss and prominent score cues composed by Ralph Burns from the film, as well as several portions of dialogue and background score. The album reached No. 204 on Billboard's Bubbling Under the Top LP's chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children, but lost to Shel Silverstein's audio edition of Where the Sidewalk Ends. This is the only Muppet film soundtrack that has not been released on CD. However, three tracks from the album can be found on the 2002 compilation album The Muppet Show: Music, Mayhem, and More. A new version of \\"Together Again (Again)\\" was performed in the 2014 film Muppets Most Wanted and its soundtrack. Cancelled follow-up series In February 2019, it was announced that Once Upon a Time showrunners Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz were working with actor Josh Gad on a TV series titled Muppets Live Another Day, set after the film's events, for Disney+. The series was to focus on the Muppets, who disbanded some time after the film's events, reuniting after Rowlf disappears. However, in September 2019, it was announced that the series had been scrapped due to creative differences following an executive change at The Muppets Studio.

He is most famous for leading the Ottoman constitutional movement of 1876 and introducing the First Constitutional Era, but was also a leading figure of reform in the educational and provincial administrations. He was part of a governing elite which recognized the crisis the Empire was in and considered reform to be a dire need. Midhat Pasha is described as a person with a liberal attitude and is often considered as one of the founders of the Ottoman Parliament. He was described by Caroline Finkel as \\"a true representative of Tanzimat optimism, who believed that separatist tendencies could be best countered by demonstrating the benefits of good government.\\" For the British, his reforming zeal was an aberration, based on individual strength of personality. They believed Midhat Pasha could not succeed, citing the inefficient and corrupt nature of the Ottoman state, and the fractured nature of its society. The Midhat Pasha Souq in Damascus still bears his name. Early life Midhat Pasha was born in Istanbul in the Islamic month of Safar, 1238 AH (which began on 18 October 1822), into a well-established family of Muslim scholars. Born into an ilmiyye family, he received a private and medrese education. His father was Hadjdji 'Air Efendi-Zade Hadjdji Hafiz Mehemmed Eshref Efendi, a native of Ruse. The family seem to have been professed Bektashis. He spent his youth in his parents' home in Vidin, Lovech and later Istanbul, where his father held judicial office. In 1836 he worked in the secretariat of the grand vizier, and in 1854 the Grand Vizier Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha gave him the task of pacifying the province of Adrianople, and he succeeded in putting down banditry in the Balkans in 1854-1856. In 1858 he spent six months traveling in western Europe for studies, including in Vienna, Paris, Brussels and London. Governor of Niš, Danube and Baghdad Midhat Pasha in his middle age In 1861 he was appointed governor of Niš, where he was instrumental in introducing the vilayet system in the Balkans. He was governor of the Danube Province from 1864 to 1868. During his governorship, he built countless schools and educational institutes, built hospitals, granaries, roads and bridges, paying for these projects through voluntary contributions from the people. He clashed with the Grand Vizier Ali Pasha, which led to his appointment as governor of Baghdad in 1869, as the appointment to such a remote posting was intended as a punishment. After his arrival in Baghdad in 1869, he opened a series of government schools, as the city previously had no state educational institutions. He also emphasized reforming the Sixth Army, and to that end he opened military schools. The military schools were to have the more lasting impact: by 1900, the civil preparatory high school was attended by only 96 students, compared to 256 for the military preparatory school, and 846 for the military middle school in the same year. He helped modernize the province, and he re-established Ottoman rule in al-Hasa. He enacted the vilayet system in Baghdad, and applied the 1858 land decree under which miri land could be granted to individuals, under a system known as nizam tapu. Sir Henry Dobbs recognised the three years of Midhat Pasha's governorship as the most stable and secure period of Ottoman rule in the region. He left the post in 1872, returning to Istanbul. Appointment as Grand Vizier Midhat Pasha played a major role in the abolition of slavery in the Ottoman Empire He was appointed Grand Vizier by Abdülaziz in 1872, but his first tenure came to an abrupt end, mainly due to his clashes with Abdülaziz over financial and economic issues. He was dismissed after two months. He also served as Minister of Justice in 1873 and 1875, but his tenure in these offices was short-lived, owing to his inclination towards a constitutional regime. The emerging internal, financial and diplomatic crises of 1875–1876 provided him with a chance to introduce the constitution of 1876. On 15 June 1876, an Ottoman infantry officer named Çerkes Hasan assaulted a meeting in the mansion of Midhat Pasha, where all the chief ministers were present. The Minister of War Huseyin Avni Pasha was shot, and the Foreign Minister Rashid Pasha was killed, as was one of Midhat's servants, named Ahmed Aga. In total, 5 were killed and 10 were wounded, and Hasan was sentenced to death for the crime, in an incident known as the Çerkes Hasan Olayı. Midhat Pasha was again appointed Grand Vizier, in place of Mehmed Rushdi Pasha, on 19 December 1876. When he was appointed, he promised to continue on the path of reform, and announced on 23 December 1876 that a constitution would be promulgated and a representative parliament established. Though not a member of the commission that drafted the constitution, he played an important part in its adoption. The constitution provided for equal rights for all citizens without distinction of race or creed, abolition of slavery, an independent judiciary based on civil (rather than religious) law, universal elementary education, and a bicameral parliament, with a Senate appointed by the Sultan and a directly-elected Chamber of Deputies. Popular support for the constitution began to plummet when it became known that it was to grant equal rights for non-Muslims. The softas, which had been Midhat's supporters just months earlier, became largely opposed. Midhat Pasha managed to pressure Abdul Hamid II into approving the constitution, but the Sultan was able to include the notorious article 113, which gave him the power to banish anyone from the empire without trial or other legal procedure. Abdul Hamid had no real interest in constitutionalism, and on 5 February 1877, he exiled Midhat Pasha. Sent to Brindisi on the imperial yacht, from there he visited France, Spain, Austria-Hungary and the United Kingdom, where he wrote memoranda supporting the Ottoman cause in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, and a pamphlet defending Ottoman reforms. Midhat's popularity in Europe, coupled with British pressure, led Abdul Hamid to allow him to return from exile, and he arrived in Crete on 26 September 1878. After the war ended, Sultan Abdul Hamid II dismissed the government and returned to despotic rule. Governor of Syria Statue of Midhat Pasha in Ankara The intervention of the British led to his appointing as governor again, and he became governor of the Vilayet of Syria on 22 November 1878, a post he held until 31 August 1881. During his tenure he endeavoured to reform the province. He used a charitable association for education, which had been formed by some of Beirut's prominent Muslim citizens, into a centrepiece of his educational reform, and encouraged the formation of similar associations in Damascus and elsewhere. He admitted many Arabs in the civil service, including in the positions of qaimaqam and mutasarrif, and gave minorities broad representation in the administration. He encouraged the development of the press, and the number of newspapers rose to more than twelve. He took an interest in the construction of roads, and in the maintenance of security. He involved local notables in the financing of local projects, such as the tramway system in Tripoli and the founding of the Beirut Chamber of Commerce. He then resigned the post, as he felt Istanbul was offering him an insufficient amount of support. Imprisonment and death He served briefly in İzmir as governor of the vilayet of Aydin, but on 17 May 1881, after only a few months on that post, he was arrested. Ahmed Cevdet Pasha, the justice minister, brought him to Istanbul, where he was charged with the murder of Sultan Abdülaziz. The interrogation and court proceedings took place at Yildiz. In conclusion, he was convicted and charged with the murder, and was sentenced to death. However, later on, the execution was commuted to life imprisonment in Taif in Hejaz. He died in his cell in 26 April 1883 in a mysterious circumstance. Some historians claim that these to be trumped-up accusations. As they believe that confessions were extracted from some suspects through the use of torture, and the use of forged evidence and paid witnesses led to his conviction, and he was sentenced to death. However, they claim that the british pressure impeded his execution, so he was imprisoned in the fortress of Taif, in Hejaz. It was reported that, soon after his arrival, the Emir of Mecca received a message from Constantinople demanding the death of Midhat from \\"an accident\\". The incumbent Emir Abdul Muttalib was a close friend of Midhat however, and no action was taken by him. As a result, Osman Pasha, governor of Hejaz, surrounded the Emir's summer residence in Taif and imprisoned him. After that, Midhat Pasha's fate was sealed. He was assassinated in his cell on 26 April 1883.

A RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 anti-ballistic missile is launched from USS Shiloh, a U.S. Navy Ticonderoga-class cruiser. Phased Array Ballistic Missile Early Warning System at RAF Fylingdales Missile defense is a system, weapon, or technology involved in the detection, tracking, interception, and destruction of attacking missiles. Originally conceived as a defense against nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), its application has broadened to include shorter-ranged non-nuclear tactical and theater missiles. The United States, Russia, China, India, Israel, France, and Taiwan have all developed such air defense systems. In the United States, missile defense was originally the responsibility of the U.S. Army. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency has developed maritime systems and command and control that will eventually be transferred to the Navy and Air Force for operation and sustainment. Missile defense categories India's Advanced Air Defense (AAD) endo-atmospheric anti- ballistic missile Missile defense can be divided into categories based on various characteristics: type/range of missile intercepted, the trajectory phase where the intercept occurs, and whether intercepted inside or outside the Earth's atmosphere: Type/range of missile intercepted These types/ranges include strategic, theater and tactical. Each entails unique requirements for intercept, and a defensive system capable of intercepting one missile type frequently cannot intercept others. However, there is sometimes overlap in capability. Strategic Targets long-range ICBMs, which travel at about 7 km/s (15,700 mph). Examples of currently active systems: Russian A-135 system which defends Moscow, and the U.S. Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system that defends the United States from missiles launched from Asia. Geographic range of strategic defense can be regional (Russian system) or national (U.S. system). Theater Targets medium-range missiles, which travel at about 3 km/s (6,700 mph) or less. In this context, the term \\"theater\\" means the entire localized region for military operations, typically a radius of several hundred kilometers. Defense range of theater defensive systems is usually on this order. Examples of deployed theater missile defenses: Israeli Arrow missile, American THAAD, and Russian S-400. Tactical Targets short-range tactical ballistic missiles, which usually travel at less than 1.5 km/s (3,400 mph). Tactical anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs) have short ranges, typically 20–80 km (12–50 miles). Examples of currently-deployed tactical ABMs: American MIM-104 Patriot and Russian S-300V. Trajectory phase Ballistic missiles can be intercepted in three regions of their trajectory: boost phase, midcourse phase, or terminal phase. Boost phase Intercepting the missile while its rocket motors are firing, usually over the launch territory (e.g., American aircraft-mounted laser weapon Boeing YAL-1 [program canceled]). Advantages: *Bright, hot rocket exhaust makes detection and targeting easier. *Decoys cannot be used during boost phase. *At this stage, the missile is full of flammable propellant, which makes it very vulnerable to explosive warheads. Disadvantages: *Difficult to geographically position interceptors to intercept missiles in boost phase (not always possible without flying over hostile territory). *Short time for intercept (typically about 180 seconds). Mid-course phase Intercepting the missile in space after the rocket burns out (example: American Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Chinese SC-19 & DN- series missiles, Israeli Arrow 3 missile). Advantages: *Extended decision/intercept time (the coast period through space before reentering the atmosphere can be several minutes, up to 20 minutes for an ICBM). *Very large geographic defensive coverage; potentially continental. Disadvantages: *Requires large, heavy anti-ballistic missiles and sophisticated powerful radar which must often be augmented by space-based sensors. *Must handle potential space-based decoys. Terminal phase Intercepting the missile after it reenters the atmosphere (examples: American Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, Chinese HQ-29, American THAAD, American Sprint, Russian ABM-3 Gazelle) Advantages: *Smaller, lighter anti-ballistic missile is sufficient. *Balloon decoys do not work during reentry. *Smaller, less sophisticated radar required. Disadvantages: *Very short intercept time, possibly less than 30 seconds. *Less defended geographic coverage. *Possible blanketing of target area with hazardous materials in the case of detonation of nuclear warhead(s). Intercept location relative to the atmosphere Missile defense can take place either inside (endoatmospheric) or outside (exoatmospheric) the Earth's atmosphere. The trajectory of most ballistic missiles takes them inside and outside the Earth's atmosphere, and they can be intercepted in either place. There are advantages and disadvantages to either intercept technique. Some missiles such as THAAD can intercept both inside and outside the Earth's atmosphere, giving two intercept opportunities. Endoatmospheric Endoatmospheric anti-ballistic missiles are usually shorter ranged (e.g., American MIM-104 Patriot Indian Advanced Air Defence). Advantages: *Physically smaller and lighter *Easier to move and deploy *Endoatmospheric intercept means balloon-type decoys won't work Disadvantages: *Limited range and defended area *Limited decision and tracking time for the incoming warhead Exoatmospheric Exoatmospheric anti-ballistic missiles are usually longer-ranged (e.g., American GMD, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense). Advantages: *More decision and tracking time *Fewer missiles required for defense of a larger area Disadvantages: *Larger/heavier missiles required *More difficult to transport and place compared to smaller missiles *Must handle decoys  Countermeasures to Missile Defense  Given the immense variety by which a defense system can operate (targeting nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), tactical, and theater missiles), there are some unarguably effective exoatmospheric (outside the Earth's atmosphere) countermeasures an attacking party can use to deter or completely defend against certain types of defense systems, ranges of ACBM's, and intercept locations. Many of defenses to these countermeasures have been implemented and taken into account when constructing missile defense systems, however, it does not guarantee their effectiveness or success. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency has received scrutiny in regards to their lack of foresight of these countermeasures, causing many scientists to perform various studies and data analysis as to the true effectiveness of these countermeasures.  Decoys  A common countermeasure that attacking parties use to disrupt the efficacy of Missile Defense Systems are the simultaneous launching of decoys from the primary launch site or from the exterior of the main attacking missile itself. These decoys are usually small, lightweight dud rockets that take advantage of the interceptor sensors tracking and fool it by making many different targets available in an instant, This accomplished via the releasing of decoys in certain phases of flight. Because objects of differing weights follow the same trajectory when in space, decoys released during the midcourse phase can prevent interceptor missiles from accurately identifying the warhead. This could force the defense system to attempt to destroy all incoming projectiles, which masks the true attacking missile and lets it slip by the defense system.  Common Types of Decoys  Since there can be many forms of this type of deception of a missile system, different categorizations of decoys have developed, all of which operate and are designed slightly different. Details of these types of decoys and their effectiveness were provided in a report by a variety of prominent scientists in 2000. = Replica decoys = This categorization of decoy is the most similar to the standard understanding of what a missile decoy is. These types of decoys attempt to mask the attacking ICBM via the release of many similar missiles. This type of decoy confuses the missile defense system by the sudden replication the sheer amount of similar targets there are. Knowing that no defense system is 100% reliable, this confusion within the targeting of the defense system would cause the system to target each decoy with equal priority and as if it was the actual warhead, allowing the real warheads chance of passing through the system and striking the target to increase drastically. = Decoys using Signature Diversity = Similar to replica decoys, these types of decoys also take advantage of the limitations in number within the missile defense systems targeting. However, rather than using missiles of similar build and trace to the attacking warhead, these types of decoys all have slightly different appearances from both each other and the warhead itself. This creates a different kind of confusion within the system; rather than creating a situation where each decoy (and the warhead itself) appears the same and is therefore targeted and treated exactly like the \\"real\\" warhead, the targeting system simply does not know what is the real threat and what is a decoy due to the mass amount of differing information. This creates a similar situation as the result of the replica decoy, increasing the chance that the real warhead passes through the system and strikes the target. = Decoys using Anti-Simulation = This type of decoy is perhaps the most difficult and subversive for a missile defense system to determine. Instead of taking advantage of the missile defense system's targeting, this type of decoy intends to fool the operation of the system itself. Rather than using sheer quantity to overrun the targeting system, an anti-simulation decoy disguises the actual warhead as a decoy, and a decoy as the actual warhead. This system of \\"anti-simulation\\" allows the attacking warhead to, in some cases, take advantage of the \\"bulk-filtering\\" of certain missile defense systems, in which objects with characteristics of the warhead poorly matching those expected by the defense are either not observed because of sensor filters, or observed very briefly and immediately rejected without the need for a detailed examination. The actual warhead may simply pass by undetected, or rejected as a threat.  Cooled Shrouds  Another common countermeasure used to fool missile defense systems are the implementation of cooled shrouds surrounding attacking missiles. This method covers the entire missile in a steel containment filled with liquid oxygen, nitrogen, or other sub-zero coolants that prevent the missile from being easily detected. Because many missile defense systems use infrared sensors to detect the heat traces of incoming missiles, this capsule of extremely cold liquid either rends the incoming missile entirely invisible to detection or reduces the system's ability to detect the incoming missile fast enough.  Other types of Infrared stealthing  Another commonly applied countermeasure to missile defense is the application of various low-emissivity coatings. Similar to cooled shrouds, these warheads are fully coated with infrared reflective or resistant coatings that allow similar resistance to infrared detection that cooled shrouds do. However, because the most effective coating that has been discovered so far is gold, this method is often overstepped by cooled shrouds.  Biological/Chemical Weapons  This is perhaps the most \\"gung-ho\\" approach to countering missile defense systems that are designed to destroy ICBMs and other forms of nuclear weaponry. Rather than using many missiles equipped with nuclear warheads as their main weapon of attack, this idea involves the release of biological or chemical sub-munition weapons/agents from the missile shortly after the boost phase of the attacking ICBM. Because missile defense systems are designed with intent to destroy main attacking missiles or ICBMs, this system of sub-munition attack is too numerous for the system to defend against while also distributing the chemical or biological agent across a large area of attack. There is currently no proposed countermeasure to this type of attack except through diplomacy and the effective banning of biological weaponry and chemical agents within war. However, this does not guarantee that this countermeasure to missile defense system will not be abused via extremists/terrorists. An example of this severe threat can be further seen in North Korea's testing of anthrax tipped ICBMs in 2017.  Command and Control  127th Command and Control Squadron - Distributed Common Ground System  Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC)  Command and control systems is a hardware and software interface that integrates a multitude of sensory information at a centralized center for the ballistic missile defense system (BMDS). The command center allows for human management in accordance to the incorporated sensory information- BMDS status, system coverage, and ballistic missile attacks. The interface system helps build an image of the battle scenario or situation which enables the user to select the optimal firing solutions. Seal of the United States Strategic Command USCG Command Control and Communications The first C2BMC system became operational in the year 2004. Since then, many elements have been added to update the C2BMC which act to provide further sensory information and allow for enhanced communications between combatant commanders. The C2BMC is even capable of initiating live planning system before any engagement has even started.  GMD Fire Control and Communication (GFC)  The function of GMD is to provide combatants the ability to seek and destroy intermediate and long range ballistic missiles en route to the US homeland via Ground-based Midcourse Defense systems (GBI). Data is transmitted from the Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS), and compiles an image using the coordinated information. The GFC is able to relay real-time data once GBI missiles have been launched. The GMD can also work to receive information from the C2BMC which allows Aegis SPY-1, and TPY-2 to contribute to the defense system A problem with GMD is that the ground systems have increasingly becoming obsolete as the technology was initially installed as early as the 1990s. As such, the ground sensors been replaced sometime in 2018. The update will add the capability of handling up to 44 GBI's; it will also reduce overlapping redundancies and inefficiencies.  Link-16  Link-16 is a data link that networks communication between land, air, and sea forces to support joint operations and improve operability. The system is intended to improve the interoperability for joint operations of NATO as well as coalition forces. Link-16 is also used by the U.S. Army and Navy for air and sea operations. An important feature of Link-16 is its ability to broadcast information simultaneously to as many users as needed. A unique feature of Link-16 is its ability to act as nodes which allows for a multitude of distributed forces to operate cohesively. The newest generation of Link-16 is the Multifunctional Information Distribution System Low Volume Terminal (MIDS LVT). It is a much smaller unit that can be fitted on air, ground, and sea units to incorporate data. The MIDS LVT terminals are installed on most bombers, aircraft, UAV's, tankers, allowing for the incorporation of most air defense systems.  Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS)  The IBCS is seen as the future for command and control systems for U.S. army defense systems. It's designed to integrate data relaying between weapon launchers, radars, and the operators which allow air defense units to fire interceptors with information being relayed amongst radars. This advantage of such system increases the area in which an air unit can defend. More importantly, it will reduce interceptor waste by reducing the probability more than one air defense unit launch unnecessary interceptors towards the same target. The IBCS is intended to replace other command and control systems already in use. The IBCS is also capable of being comparable with that of foreign military. There are some intentions for the use of IBCS on a global level with the global C2BMC system.CSIS Briefs (22 March 2020) Inflection Point: Missile Defense and Defeat in the 2021 Budget \\"Army and Navy investments in air and missile defenses are beginning to transition from research and development to procurement\\" MDA/ SDA/ DARPA/ Missile Defense Agency logo The IBCS system is intended to be operational in 2019; between 2016 and 2017, implementation of IBCS had to be put on hold due to software issues with the system.  Capabilities of IBCS  * use data from multiple sensors to integrate into a single picture * select different weapons depending on the threat * allows for ease of engagement due to its versatility instead of being limited to a particular unit capabilities. History In the 1950s and 1960s, Missile Defense meant defense against strategic (usually nuclear-armed) missiles. The technology mostly centered around detecting offensive launch events and tracking inbound ballistic missiles, but with limited ability to actually defend against the missile. The Soviet Union achieved the first nonnuclear intercept of a ballistic missile warhead by a missile at the Sary Shagan antiballistic missile defense test range on 4 March 1961. Nike Hercules missiles Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the United States Project Nike air defense program focused initially on targeting hostile bombers before shifting focus to targeting ballistic missiles. In the 1950s, the first United States anti-ballistic missile system was the Nike Hercules, which had the ability to intercept incoming short-range ballistic missiles, but not intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) or ICBMs. This was followed by the Nike Zeus, which was capable of intercepting ICBMs by using a nuclear warhead, upgraded radar systems, faster computers, and control systems that were more effective in the upper atmosphere. However it was feared the missile's electronics may be vulnerable to x-rays from a nuclear detonation in space. A program was started to devise methods of hardening weapons from radiation damage.A History of Exceptional Service in the National Interest, Leland Johnson, Sandia National Laboratories, 1997, p. 101 By the early 1960s the Nike Zeus was the first anti-ballistic missile to achieve hit-to-kill (physically colliding with the incoming warhead). In 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara diverted funds from the Zeus missile program, and instead directed that funding to the development of the Nike-X system, which utilized the high-speed, short-range Sprint missile. These missiles were meant to intercept incoming warheads after they had descended from space and were only seconds from their targets. To accomplish this, Nike-X required advances in missile design to make the Sprint missile quick enough to intercept incoming warheads in time. The system also included advanced active electronically scanned array radar systems and a powerful computer complex. During the development of Nike-X, controversy over the effectiveness of anti- ballistic missile systems became more prominent. Critiques of the Nike-X included an estimate that the anti-ballistic missile system could be defeated by Soviets manufacturing more ICBMs, and the cost of those additional ICBMs needed to defeat Nike-X would also cost less than what the United States would spend on implementing Nike-X. Additionally, McNamara reported that a ballistic missile system would save American lives at the cost of approximately $700 per life, compared to a shelter system that could save lives at a lower cost of approximately $40 per life. As a result of these estimations, McNamara opposed implementation of Nike-X due to the high costs associated with construction and perceived poor cost-effectiveness of the system, and instead expressed support for pursuing arms limitations agreements with the Soviets. After the Chinese government detonated their first hydrogen bomb during Test No. 6. in 1967, McNamara modified the Nike-X program into a program called Sentinel. This program's goal was to protect major U.S. cities from a limited ICBM attack, especially on one from China. This would be done by building fifteen sites across the continental US, and one site in each of Alaska and Hawaii. This in turn reduced tensions with the Soviet Union, which retained the offensive capability to overwhelm any U.S. defense. McNamara favored this approach as deploying the Sentinel program was less costly than a fully implemented Nike-X program, and would reduce Congressional pressures to implement an ABM system. In the months following the announcements regarding the Sentinel program, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated: \\"Let me emphasize—and I cannot do so too strongly—that our decision to go ahead with a limited ABM deployment in no way indicates that we feel an agreement with the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic nuclear offensive and defensive forces is in any way less urgent or desirable.\\" The Soviet Union began installing the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system around Moscow in 1965 and would become operational by 1971, but there were known flaws with the design such as an inability to defend against MIRV style weapons. During installation, a Ministry of Defense commission concluded that the system should not be fully implemented, reducing the capabilities of the completed system. That system was later upgraded to the A-135 anti-ballistic missile system and is still operational. As part of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972, all radars for detecting missiles were placed on the edges of the territory and faced outward. The SALT I talks began in 1969, and led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972, which ultimately limited the U.S. and U.S.S.R. to one defensive missile site each, with no more than 100 missiles per site. This included both ABM interceptor missiles as well as launchers. Originally, the agreement made by the Nixon administration and the Soviet Union stated that both of the two nations were each allowed to have two ABM defensive systems present in their own countries. The goal was to effectively have one ABM defense system located near each nation's capital city as well as another ABM defense system placed near the nation's most important or strategical ICBM field. This treaty allowed for an effective form of deterrence for both sides as if either side were to make an offensive move, the other side would be capable of countering that move. However, a few years later in 1974 both sides reworked the treaty to include only one ABM defensive system present around an ICBM launch area or the nation's capital city. This occurred once both sides determined the other side was not going to construct a second ABM defensive system. Along with limiting the amount of ballistic missile defense systems each nation could have, the treaty also stated if either country desired to have a radar for incoming missile detection, the radar system must be located on the outskirts of the territory and must be aligned in the opposite direction of one's own country. This treaty would end up being the precedent set for future missile defense programs, as any systems that were not stationary and land-based were a violation of the treaty. As a result of the treaty and of technical limitations, along with public opposition to nearby nuclear-armed defensive missiles, the U.S. Sentinel program was re-designated the Safeguard Program, with the new goal of defending U.S. ICBM sites, not cities. The U.S. Safeguard system was planned to be implemented in various sites across the US, including at Whiteman AFB in Missouri, Malmstrom AFB in Montana, and Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 placed a limit of two ABM systems within the US, causing the work site in Missouri to be abandoned, and the partially- completed Montana site was abandoned in 1974 after an additional agreement between the US and USSR that limited each country to one ABM system. As a result, the only Safeguard system that was deployed was to defend the LGM-30 Minuteman ICBMs near Grand Forks, North Dakota. However, it was deactivated in 1976 after being operational for less than four months due to a changing political climate plus concern over limited effectiveness, low strategic value, and high operational cost.John W. Finney (25 November 1975). \\"Safeguard ABM System to Shut Down\\". New York Times. \\"the utility of Safeguard to protect Minuteman will be essentially nullified in the future\\" An artist's concept of a Space Laser Satellite Defense System as a part of the Strategic Defense Initiative In the early 1980s, technology had matured to consider space based missile defense options. Precision hit-to-kill systems more reliable than the early Nike Zeus were thought possible. With these improvements, the Reagan Administration promoted the Strategic Defense Initiative, an ambitious plan to provide a comprehensive defense against an all-out ICBM attack. In pursuit of that goal, the Strategic Defense Initiative investigated a variety of potential missile-defense systems, which included systems utilizing ground- based missile systems and space-based missile systems, as well as systems utilizing lasers or particle beam weapons. This program faced controversy over the feasibility of the projects it pursued, as well as the substantial amount of funding and time required for the research to develop the requisite technology. The Strategic Defense Initiative earned the nickname \\"Star Wars\\" due to criticism from Senator Ted Kennedy in which he described the Strategic Defense Initiative as \\"reckless Star Wars schemes.\\".Sharon Watkins Lang. SMDC/ASTRAT Historical Office. Where do we get \\"Star Wars\\"? Archived February 27, 2009, at the Wayback Machine. The Eagle. March 2007. Reagan established the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) to oversee the development of the program's projects. Upon request by the SDIO, the American Physical Society (APS) performed a review of the concepts being developed within SDIO and concluded that all of the concepts pursuing use of Directed Energy Weapons were not feasible solutions for an anti-missile defense system without decades of additional research and development.The Science and Technology of Directed Energy Weapons (Technical report). APS. April 1987. Following the APS's report in 1986, the SDIO switched focus to a concept called the Strategic Defense System, which would utilize a system of space- based missiles called Space Rocks which would intercept incoming ballistic missiles from orbit, and would be supplemented by ground-based missile defense systems. In 1993, the SDIO was closed and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) was created, which focuses on ground-based missile defense systems utilizing interceptor missiles. In 2002, BMDO's name was changed to its current title, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). See National Missile Defense for additional details. In the early 1990s, missile defense expanded to include tactical missile defense, as seen in the first Gulf War. Although not designed from the outset to intercept tactical missiles, upgrades gave the Patriot system a limited missile defense capability. The effectiveness of the Patriot system in disabling or destroying incoming Scuds was the subject of Congressional hearings and reports in 1992. Various ICBMs utilized by varying countries. In the time following the agreement of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, it was becoming increasingly more and more difficult for the United States to create a new missile defense strategy without violating the terms of the treaty. During the Clinton administration, the initial goal the United States had interest in, was to negotiate with the former Soviet Union, which is now Russia, and hopefully agree to a revision to the treaty signed a few decades prior. In the late 1990s the United States had interest in an idea termed NMD or National Missile Defense. This idea essentially would allow the United States to increase the number of ballistic missile interceptors that would be available to missile defense personnel at the Alaska location. While the initial ABM treaty was designed primarily to deter the Soviet Union and help create a period of détente, the United States was primarily fearing other threats such as Iraq, North Korea, and Iran. The Russian government was not interested in making any sort of modification to the ABM treaty that would allow for technology to be developed that was explicitly banned when the treaty was agreed upon. However, Russia was interested in revising the treaty in such a way that would allow for a more diplomatic approach to potential missile harboring countries. During this period, the United States was also seeking assistance for their ballistic missile defense systems from Japan. Following the testing of the Taepo Dong missile by the North Korean government, the Japanese government became more concerned and inclined to accept a partnership for a BMD system with the United States. In late 1998, Japan and the United States agreed to the Naval Wide Theater system which would allow the two sides to design, construct, and test ballistic missile defense systems together. Nearing the end of Clinton's time in office, it had been determined that the NMD program was not as effective as the United States would have liked, and the decision was made to not employ this system while Clinton served out the rest of his term. The decision on future of the NMD program was going to be given to the next president in line, who ultimately would end up being George W. Bush. In the late 1990s, and early 2000s, the issue of defense against cruise missiles became more prominent with the new Bush Administration. In 2002, President George W. Bush withdrew the US from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, allowing further development and testing of ABMs under the Missile Defense Agency, as well as deployment of interceptor vehicles beyond the single site allowed under the treaty. During the Bush's time in office, the potentially threatening countries to the United States included North Korea as well as Iran. While these countries might not have possessed the weaponry that many countries containing missile defense systems had, the Bush administration expected an Iranian missile test within the next ten years. In order to counter the potential risk of North Korean missiles, the United States Department of Defense desired to create missile defense systems along the west coast of the United States, namely in both California and Alaska.NORAD Distant Early Warning Line (DEW) station in western Greenland is visible in the distance beyond the snow-drifted equipment pallets in the foreground of this photograph. The DEW Line was designed to track inbound ballistic missiles.|225x225px There are still technological hurdles to an effective defense against ballistic missile attack. The United States National Ballistic Missile Defense System has come under scrutiny about its technological feasibility. Intercepting midcourse (rather than launch or reentry stage) ballistic missiles traveling at several miles per second with a \\"kinetic kill vehicle\\" has been characterized as trying to hit a bullet with a bullet. Despite this difficulty, there have been several successful test intercepts and the system was made operational in 2006, while tests and system upgrades continue.Army Times, , 2007, and Moreover, the warheads or payloads of ballistic missiles can be concealed by a number of different types of decoys. Sensors that track and target warheads aboard the kinetic kill vehicle may have trouble distinguishing the \\"real\\" warhead from the decoys, but several tests that have included decoys were successful. Nira Schwartz's and Theodore Postol's criticisms about the technical feasibility of these sensors have led to a continuing investigation of research misconduct and fraud at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In February 2007, the U.S. missile defense system consisted of 13 ground-based interceptors (GBIs) at Fort Greely, Alaska, plus two interceptors at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The U.S. planned to have 21 interceptor missiles by the end of 2007. The system was initially called National Missile Defense (NMD), but in 2003 the ground-based component was renamed Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD). As of 2014, the Missile Defense Agency had 30 operational GBIs. Defending against cruise missiles is similar to defending against hostile, low-flying manned aircraft. As with aircraft defense, countermeasures such as chaff, flares, and low altitude can complicate targeting and missile interception. High-flying radar aircraft such as AWACS can often identify low flying threats by using doppler radar. Another possible method is using specialized satellites to track these targets. By coupling a target's kinetic inputs with infrared and radar signatures it may be possible to overcome the countermeasures. In March 2008, the U.S. Congress convened hearings to re- examine the status of missile defense in U.S. military strategy. Upon taking office, President Obama directed a comprehensive review of ballistic missile defense policy and programs. The review's findings related to Europe were announced on 17 September 2009. The Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR) Report was published in February 2010. NATO missile defense system HMS Diamond firing an Aster missile for the first time in 2012. Mechanisms The Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) is the senior NATO committee which acts as the tasking authority for the theater missile defense program. The ALTBMD Program Management Organization, which comprises a steering committee and a program office hosted by the NATO C3 Agency, directs the program and reports to the CNAD. The focal point for consultation on full- scale missile defense is the Reinforced Executive Working Group. The CNAD is responsible for conducting technical studies and reporting the outcome to the Group. The NRC Ad hoc Working Group on TMD is the steering body for NATO- Russia cooperation on theater missile defense. In September 2018, a consortium of 23 NATO nations met to collaborate on the Nimble Titan 18 integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) campaign of experimentation.(October 17, 2018) Nimble Titan - Experimentation with collective integrated air and missile defense Missile defense By early 2010, NATO will have an initial capability to protect Alliance forces against missile threats and is examining options for protecting territory and populations. This is in response to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, including missiles of all ranges. NATO is conducting three missile defense–related activities: Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense System capability Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense System is \\"ALTBMD\\" for short. As of early 2010, the Alliance has an interim capability to protect troops in a specific area against short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles (up to 3,000 kilometers). The end system consist of a multi-layered system of systems, comprising low- and high- altitude defenses (also called lower- and upper-layer defenses), including Battle Management Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (BMC3I), early warning sensors, radar, and various interceptors. NATO member countries provide the sensors and weapon systems, while NATO has developed the BMC3I segment and facilitate the integration of all these elements. Missile Defense for the protection of NATO territory A Missile Defense Feasibility Study was launched after NATO's 2002 Prague summit. The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) and NATO's Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) were also involved in negotiations. The study concluded that missile defense is technically feasible, and it provided a technical basis for ongoing political and military discussions regarding the desirability of a NATO missile defense system. During the 2008 Bucharest summit, the alliance discussed the technical details as well as the political and military implications of the proposed elements of the U.S. missile defense system in Europe. Allied leaders recognized that the planned deployment of European- based U.S. missile defense assets would help protect North American Allies, and agreed that this capability should be an integral part of any future NATO- wide missile defense architecture. However, these opinions are in the process of being reconstructed given the Obama administration's decision in 2009 to replace the long-range interceptor project in Poland with a short/medium range interceptor. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has stated that NATO's pattern of deployment of Patriot missiles indicates that these will be used to defend against Iranian missiles in addition to the stated goal of defending against spillover from the Syrian civil war.\\"Lavrov: Turkey's Patriot Missiles to Counter Iran Threats\\" Theater Missile Defense cooperation with Russia Under the auspices of the NATO-Russia Council, a 2003 study assessed possible levels of interoperability among in-theater missile defense systems of NATO allies and Russia. Together with the interoperability study, several computer-assisted exercises have been held to provide the basis for future improvements to interoperability and to develop mechanisms and procedures for joint operations in the area of in-theater missile defense.

The project, called ACCS Theatre Missile Defense 1, will bring new capabilities to NATO's Air Command and Control System, including updates for processing ballistic missile tracks, additional satellite and radar feeds, improvements to data communication and correlation features. The upgrade to its theatre missile defense command and control system will allow for NATO to connect national sensors and interceptors in defense against short and medium-range ballistic missiles. According to NATO's Assistant Secretary General for Defense Investment Patrick Auroy, the execution of this contract will be a major technical milestone forward for NATO's theatre missile defense. The project was expected to be complete by 2015. An integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) capability will be delivered to the operational community by 2016, by which time NATO will have a true theatre missile defense.John Keller (September 3, 2019) The Navy's Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Is About to Get a Major Radar Upgrade by 2025 Defense systems and initiatives *Akash missile surface-to-air missile defense system *Arrow missile *Chū-SAM (中SAM) Japan's JGSDF Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missile *David's Sling *HQ-9 regional air defence/anti- ballistic missile * IAMD The SMDC is leading the Army's laser efforts to replace MIM-104 Patriot. *Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program *Iron Dome * Italian-French SAMP/T missile air defense system *KS-1 regional air defence missile *L-SAM *Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) *Patriot surface- to-air missile system *Hawk medium range surface-to-air missile (SAM) system *RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 *Russian A-135 anti-ballistic missile system *S-400 Triumf *Skyguard chemical laser-based area defense system proposed by Northrop Grumman *Sky Bow *Strategic Defense Initiative (\\"Star Wars\\") *Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) *Vigilant Eagle Airport surface- to-air missile protection system See also *Anti-satellite weapon *Missile Defense Agency *National Missile Defence in Canada *Surface-to-air missile References Bibliography *Nicole C.

It was founded at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) on April 29, 1864. Of all the social fraternities today, Theta Xi was the only one founded during the Civil War. Its Grand Lodge is headquartered in suburban St. Louis, Missouri. Since its inception, Theta Xi has grown to include more than 60,000 initiated members. Currently, there are approximately 50 active chapters, and 3 colonies. The Theta Xi Fraternity Chapter House at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Theta Xi was founded on April 29, 1864 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York as an engineering fraternity however, now a social fraternity. Its founders were Peter Henry Fox, Ralph Gooding Packard, Christopher Champlin Waite, George Bradford Brainerd, Samuel Buel Jr., Henry Harrison Farnum, Thomas Cole Raymond, and Nathaniel Henry Starbuck. All of the original founders were members of a local fraternity called Sigma Delta, established in 1859 to rival Theta Delta Chi, which was then a secret society at RPI. Debates were common and encouraged at Sigma Delta meetings. However, on the evening of October 30, 1863, George Brainerd tendered his resignation to the society. This resignation was unanimously declined, but ultimately created a rift. Soon after, talks began circulating of affiliating with a larger organization such as Sigma Phi. However, when Sigma Phi declined to issue a charter, this only increased tensions. On March 12, 1864, voting took place for members of a new organization, and on April 1, a committee consisting of Waite, Buel, Brainerd, and Packard began preparing a new constitution. By April 6, Buel presented monograms for two new names, Theta Xi and Theta Psi. Theta Xi was chosen because of local fraternity called Theta Psi at Yale. Within its first forty years, six chapters were established at Yale, Stevens Institute of Technology, MIT, Columbia University, Cornell University, and Lehigh University. It was not until 1905 that a westward expansion occurred with chapters at Purdue and, a month later, Washington University in St. Louis. The first west coast chapter came in 1910 at UC Berkeley, and in April 1921, the first southern chapter was founded at LSU. In 1962, talks began of folding Kappa Sigma Kappa, a smaller, struggling fraternity into Theta Xi. The merger was completed on August 20, 1962. As a direct result, several of Theta Xi’s traditions were altered. The coat-of-arms' fleur-de-lis was changed to have crescent moons in tradition with Kappa Sigma Kappa and the “pledge” pins were also changed to incorporate Kappa Sigma Kappa’s traditions diagonal white band. The fraternity flower was changed from the white carnation to the blue iris. Finally, the membership manual was changed from The Theta Xi Pledge Manual to The Quest for Theta Xi. In 1964, as a commemoration for the fraternity’s centennial, a new Memorial Headquarters was formally dedicated in St. Louis. This served as the official home of the Grand Lodge until 2001. In 1974, the Beta Alpha chapter at Georgia Tech became a Christian chapter while remaining a full member of Theta Xi and the Georgia Tech IFC. The chapter remains Christian today and is the only Christian chapter of a secular national fraternity in the United States. Their model expanded to the Gamma Phi chapter at Georgia Southern University in 2008, however that chapter has since reverted to the traditional non-religious status.Christian fraternity Beginning in 1999, Theta Xi began offering Leadership academies to its active brothers. That year, the first President’s Academy was held to train new chapter presidents, funded by the Theta Xi Foundation. In 2006, this was expanded to include Rising Stars Academy, which aims to make first-year initiates more active in the fraternity. The Theta Xi Fraternity Chapter House at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. In 2014, Theta Xi celebrated its sesquicentennial. In honor of this occasion, the National Convention was held in Troy, New York to commemorate the founding of Theta Xi.Θ Ξ - 150 Years William S. Mason, considered to be one of the greatest benefactors and supporters of Theta Xi, was the main supporter of the fraternity's adoption of Benjamin Franklin as its patron saint.  National Service Projects  At the 111th Anniversary Convention held on August 12, 1974 Theta Xi announced its adoption of the fight against Multiple Sclerosis as its National Service Project. At the 129th Anniversary Convention held on August 4-6, 1993 the fraternity announced its second alternate NSP as Habitat for Humanity. These charities are a mainstay among all chapters of the fraternity, as well as the numerous other charities supported by individual chapters. On June 20, 1986 Theta Xi was named the Outstanding Volunteer Organization for 1985-86 by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Theta Xi takes exceptional pride in its members' involvement in these and other charities.  Theta Xi Foundation  The Theta Xi Foundation was founded in 1949 in order to promote the education and growth of members of the fraternity. It is set up to aid in developing the members into responsible citizens that will contribute to the well-being of society. Contributions that mostly come from alumni and friends provide the money for the Foundation. The Foundation consists of two Funds, the Chapter Education Fund and the Unicorn Fund. The funds raised are used to sponsor several programs such as President's Academy, Rising Stars Academy, and the District Leadership Academies.

The brand was founded in 1831 by Jonathan Dodgson Carr and is marketed in the United States by Kellogg's. History In 1831, Carr formed a small bakery and biscuit factory in the English city of Carlisle; he received a royal warrant in 1841. Within fifteen years of being founded, it was the largest baking business in Britain. His business was both a mill and a bakery, an early example of vertical integration, and he produced bread by night and biscuits by day. The biscuits were loosely based on dry biscuits used on long voyages by sailors. They could be kept crisp and fresh in tins, and despite their fragility could easily be transported to other parts of the country by canal and railway. Jonathan Carr protested against the Corn Laws, which imposed steep tariffs on imported wheat, keeping the price of British wheat artificially high. This meant that bread was expensive, even in times of famine. Carr died in 1884, but by 1885, the company made 128 varieties of biscuit and employed 1000 workers. In 1894 the company was registered as Carr and Co. Ltd. but reverted to a private company in 1908, and Carrs Flour Mills Limited was incorporated after acquiring the flour milling assets. Jonathan's four sons were less skilled at managing the business, but biscuit production remained in the family until 1931. It later became part of Cavenham Foods until 1971 when it came under the ownership of McVitie's, part of the United Biscuits group. United Biscuits was sold by its private equity owners to the Turkish based multinational Yıldız Holding in 2014, in 2016 all UB brands including Carr’s were combined with Yildiz’s other snack brands to form pladis. Among the members of the Carr family who worked for the business was former Commando Capt Richard Carr MBE, who was decorated for repeated escape attempts from Italian and German PW camps during the Second World War. Business McVities/ Carr factory in Carlisle. Since 1972 the Carr's biscuit factory has been part of United Biscuits, and the Carr's branded products are marketed in the US by Kellogg's. The factory today is known officially as McVitie's but still known locally as Carr's. Carr's Flour Mills and the later established agricultural supplies and feeds businesses became Carr's Milling Industries plc, which is still based in Carlisle and now known as Carr's Group PLC. Its products have since the 1990s appeared in UK supermarkets through their Carr's Breadmaker flour range. Carr's Group also own companies involved in light engineering. In 2016 Carr's Group sold the flour milling division to Whitworths. In 2005 the Caldewgate factory in Carlisle lost two months production due to flooding. In 2016 the local newspaper the News and Star stated that it had been reopened with a £1 million Government grant. In March 2012, it was announced that Carr's Table Water Biscuits had lost their royal warrant due to 'changing tastes' in the Royal Households. Carr's promptly licensed the coat of arms of the City of Carlisle to replace the coat of royal arms on their packaging. In January 2016 United Biscuits announced that the factory in Caldewgate, Carlisle, had experienced 5 feet of floodwater on 6 December which damaged the brick ovens and would result in product shortages on retail shelves.The Independent, 22 January 2016, Carr’s water biscuit shortage looms after factory hit by UK floodsThe Guardian, 21 Jan 2016, Too wet for water biscuits as Carr's pauses production.

Description The red widow, L. bishopi, has a red-orange cephalothorax, its abdomen is black with yellow rings outlining the rows of red spots and its legs are vermillion red. On its underside, it does not have the familiar hourglass marking and instead usually has one or two small red marks. Females are almost double the size of the male. ;Venom L. bishopi has been reported to be venomous like the other Latrodectus members, though no bites by this spider are recorded in the medical literature; unlike cosmopolitan species such as the black and brown widows, it seldom comes into contact with humans. The median lethal dose () of the spider's venom has been measured in mice as 2.20 mg/kg (with a confidence interval of 1.29-3.74), and each spider contains about 0.157 mg. ;Threatened species L. bishopi is a threatened species in the United States. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1938 by B. J. Kaston as the variety bishopi of the species Latrodectus mactans. The name bishopi honors Marshall B. Bishop who collected the specimens on which the description was based. Latrodectus bishopi was raised to a full species in 1964 by John D. McCrone and Herbert W. Levi. It can be distinguished from L. mactans by features of the male and female genitalia: the embolus of the male palpal bulb has one fewer loop as do the connecting ducts leading to the female spermatheca. Distribution and habitat L. bishopi is endemic to central and southern Florida. It is restricted to sand-pine scrub – inland areas of dry sand dunes dominated by sand pine, Pinus clausa. Within these areas, the species makes most of its webs in palmetto bushes (Serenoa repens and Sabal etonia) at heights of 30 cm or more above the ground.

Onset can be sudden or gradual. When of sudden onset, symptoms include an inability to urinate and lower abdominal pain. When of gradual onset, symptoms may include loss of bladder control, mild lower abdominal pain, and a weak urine stream. Those with long-term problems are at risk of urinary tract infections. Causes include blockage of the urethra, nerve problems, certain medications, and weak bladder muscles. Blockage can be caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), urethral strictures, bladder stones, a cystocele, constipation, or tumors. Nerve problems can occur from diabetes, trauma, spinal cord problems, stroke, or heavy metal poisoning. Medications that can cause problems include anticholinergics, antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, decongestants, cyclobenzaprine, diazepam, NSAIDs, amphetamines, and opioids. Diagnosis is typically based on measuring the amount of urine in the bladder after urinating. Treatment is typically with a catheter either through the urethra or lower abdomen. Other treatments may include medication to decrease the size of the prostate, urethral dilation, a urethral stent, or surgery. Males are more often affected than females. In males over the age of 40 about 6 per 1,000 are affected a year. Among males over 80 this increases 30%.  Signs and symptoms  Onset can be sudden or gradual. When of sudden onset, symptoms include an inability to urinate and lower abdominal pain. When of gradual onset, symptoms may include loss of bladder control, mild lower abdominal pain, and a weak urine stream. Those with long-term problems are at risk of urinary tract infections.  Causes  Bladder * Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia *Neurogenic bladder (commonly spinal cord damage, pelvic splanchic nerve damage, cauda equina syndrome, pontine micturition or storage center lesions, demyelinating diseases or Parkinson's disease) * Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment/procedure) scarring of the bladder neck (commonly from removal of indwelling catheters or cystoscopy operations) * Damage to the bladder Prostate * Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) * Prostate cancer and other pelvic malignancies * Prostatitis Penile urethra: * Congenital urethral valves * Phimosis or pinhole meatus * Circumcision * Obstruction in the urethra, for example a stricture (usually caused either by injury or STD), a metastasis or a precipitated pseudogout crystal in the urine * STD lesions (gonorrhoea causes numerous strictures, leading to a \\"rosary bead\\" appearance, whereas chlamydia usually causes a single stricture) Postoperative Risk factors include * Age: Older people may have degeneration of neural pathways involved with bladder function and it can lead to an increased risk of postoperative urinary retention. The risk of postoperative urinary retention increases up to 2.11 fold for people older than 60 years. * Medications: Anticholinergics and medications with anticholinergic properties, alpha- adrenergic agonists, opiates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), calcium-channel blockers and beta-adrenergic agonists, may increase the risk. * Anesthesia: General anesthetics during surgery may cause bladder atony by acting as a smooth muscle relaxant. General anesthetics can directly interfere with autonomic regulation of detrusor tone and predispose people to bladder overdistention and subsequent retention. Spinal anesthesia results in a blockade of the micturition reflex. Spinal anesthesia shows a higher risk of postoperative urinary retention compared to general anesthesia. * Benign prostatic hyperplasia: Men with benign prostatic hyperplasia are at an increased risk of acute urinary retention. * Surgery related: Operative times longer than 2 hours may lead to an increased risk of postoperative urinary retention 3-fold. Chronic Chronic urinary retention that is due to bladder blockage which can either be as a result of muscle damage or neurological damage. If the retention is due to neurological damage, there is a disconnect between the brain to muscle communication, which can make it impossible to completely empty the bladder. If the retention is due to muscle damage, it is likely that the muscles are not able to contract enough to completely empty the bladder. The most common cause of chronic urinary retention is BPH. BPH is a result of the ongoing process of testosterone being converted to dihydrotestosterone which stimulates prostate growth. Over a person's lifetime, the prostate experiences constant growth due to the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This can cause the prostate to push on the urethra and block it, which can lead to urinary retention. Other * Tethered spinal cord syndrome * Psychogenic causes (psychosocial stresses, fear associated with urination, paruresis (\\"shy bladder syndrome\\")- in extreme cases, urinary retention can result) * Consumption of some psychoactive substances, mainly stimulants, such as MDMA and amphetamine. * Use of NSAIDs or drugs with anticholinergic properties. * Stones or metastases can theoretically appear anywhere along the urinary tract, but vary in frequency depending on anatomy * Muscarinic antagonist such as atropine and scopolamine *Malfunctioning artificial urinary sphincter  Diagnosis  As seen on axial CT Ultrasonography showing a trabeculated wall, seen as small irregularities mainly at left (superior part). This is strongly associated with urinary retention.Page 306 in: Analysis of urine flow may aid in establishing the type of micturition (urination) abnormality. Common findings, determined by ultrasound of the bladder, include a slow rate of flow, intermittent flow, and a large amount of urine retained in the bladder after urination. A normal test result should be 20-25 mL/s peak flow rate. A post- void residual urine greater than 50 ml is a significant amount of urine and increases the potential for recurring urinary tract infections. In adults older than 60 years, 50-100 ml of residual urine may remain after each voiding because of the decreased contractility of the detrusor muscle. In chronic retention, ultrasound of the bladder may show massive increase in bladder capacity (normal capacity is 400-600 ml). Non-neurogenic chronic urinary retention does not have a standardized definition; however, urine volumes >300mL can be used as an informal indicator. Diagnosis of urinary retention is conducted over a period of 6 months, with 2 separate measurements of urine volume 6 months apart. Measurements should have a PVR (post-void residual) volume of >300mL. Determining the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may help diagnose or rule out prostate cancer, though this is also raised in BPH and prostatitis. A TRUS biopsy of the prostate (trans-rectal ultra-sound guided) can distinguish between these prostate conditions. Serum urea and creatinine determinations may be necessary to rule out backflow kidney damage. Cystoscopy may be needed to explore the urinary passage and rule out blockages. In acute cases of urinary retention where associated symptoms in the lumbar spine are present such as pain, numbness (saddle anesthesia), parasthesias, decreased anal sphincter tone, or altered deep tendon reflexes, an MRI of the lumbar spine should be considered to further assess cauda equina syndrome.  Complications  The urinary bag of a person with post obstructive diuresis Urinary retention often occurs without warning. It is basically the inability to pass urine. In some people, the disorder starts gradually but in others it may appear suddenly. Acute urinary retention is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment. The pain can be excruciating when urine is not able to flow out. Moreover, one can develop severe sweating, chest pain, anxiety and high blood pressure. Other patients may develop a shock-like condition and may require admission to a hospital. Serious complications of untreated urinary retention include bladder damage and chronic kidney failure.General information on urinary retention 2010-02-10 Urinary retention is a disorder treated in a hospital, and the quicker one seeks treatment, the fewer the complications. In the longer term, obstruction of the urinary tract may cause: * Bladder stones * Atrophy of the detrusor muscle (atonic bladder is an extreme form) * Hydronephrosis (congestion of the kidneys) * Hypertrophy of the detrusor muscle (the muscle that squeezes the bladder to empty it during urination) * Diverticula (formation of pouches) in the bladder wall (which can lead to stones and infection)  Treatment  In acute urinary retention, urinary catheterization, placement of a prostatic stent, or suprapubic cystostomy relieves the retention. In the longer term, treatment depends on the cause. BPH may respond to alpha blocker and 5-alpha- reductase inhibitor therapy, or surgically with prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Use of alpha-blockers can provide relief of urinary retention following de-catheterization for both men and women. In case, if catheter can't be negotiated, suprapubic puncture can be done with lumbar puncture needle. Medication Some people with BPH are treated with medications. These include tamsulosin to relax smooth muscles in the bladder neck, and finasteride and dutasteride to decrease prostate enlargement. The drugs only work for mild cases of BPH but also have mild side effects. Some of the medications decrease libido and may cause dizziness, fatigue and lightheadedness.  Catheter  Acute urinary retention is treated by placement of a urinary catheter (small thin flexible tube) into the bladder. This can be either an intermittent catheter or a Foley catheter that is placed with a small inflatable bulb that holds the catheter in place. Intermittent catheterization can be done by a health care professional or by the person themselves (clean intermittent self catheterization). Intermittent catheterization performed at the hospital is a sterile technique. Patients can be taught to use a self catheterization technique in one simple demonstration, and that reduces the rate of infection from long-term Foley catheters. Self catheterization requires doing the procedure periodically during the day, the frequency depending on fluid intake and bladder capacity. If fluid intake/outflow is around 1.5 litres per day, this would typically be performed roughly three times per day, i.e. roughly every six to eight hours during the day, more frequently when fluid intake is higher and/or bladder capacity lower. For acute urinary retention, treatment requires urgent placement of a urinary catheter. A permanent urinary catheter may cause discomfort and pain that can last several days. Older people with ongoing problems may require continued intermittent self catheterization (CISC). CISC has a lower infection risk compared to catheterization techniques that stay within the body. Challenges with CISC include compliance issues as some people may not be able to place the catheter themselves. Surgery The chronic form of urinary retention may require some type of surgical procedure. While both procedures are relatively safe, complications can occur. In most patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), a procedure known as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) may be performed to relieve bladder obstruction.eMedicine Health. \\"Inability to urinate\\" 2010-02-10. Surgical complications from TURP include a bladder infection, bleeding from the prostate, scar formation, inability to hold urine, and inability to have an erection. The majority of these complications are short lived, and most individuals recover fully within 6–12 months.National kidney and urologic diseases information clearinghouse. \\"Urinary retention overview\\" 2010-02-10. Sitting voiding position A meta-analysis on the influence of voiding position on urodynamics in males with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) showed that in the sitting position, the residual urine in the bladder was significantly reduced, the maximum urinary flow was increased, and the voiding time was decreased. For healthy males, no influence was found on these parameters, meaning that they can urinate in either position.  Epidemiology  Urinary retention is a common disorder in elderly males. The most common cause of urinary retention is BPH. This disorder starts around age 50 and symptoms may appear after 10–15 years. BPH is a progressive disorder and narrows the neck of the bladder leading to urinary retention. By the age of 70, almost 10 percent of males have some degree of BPH and 33% have it by the eighth decade of life. While BPH rarely causes sudden urinary retention, the condition can become acute in the presence of certain medications (blood pressure pills, anti histamines, antiparkinson medications), after spinal anaesthesia or stroke. In young males, the most common cause of urinary retention is infection of the prostate (acute prostatitis). The infection is acquired during sexual intercourse and presents with low back pain, penile discharge, low grade fever and an inability to pass urine. The exact numbers of individuals with acute prostatitis is unknown, because many do not seek treatment. In the US, at least 1-3 percent of males under the age of 40 develop urinary difficulty as a result of acute prostatitis. Most physicians and other health care professionals are aware of these disorders. Worldwide, both BPH and acute prostatitis have been found in males of all races and ethnic backgrounds. Cancers of the urinary tract can cause urinary obstruction but the process is more gradual. Cancer of the bladder, prostate or ureters can gradually obstruct urine output. Cancers often present with blood in the urine, weight loss, lower back pain or gradual distension in the flanks.Urologic Emergencies Urology Channel portal. 2010-02-10 Urinary retention in females is uncommon, occurring 1 in 100,000 every year, with a female-to-male incidence rate of 1:13. It is usually transient. The causes of UR in women can be multi- factorial, and can be postoperative and postpartum. Prompt urethral catheterization usually resolves the problem.

The projects, consisting of symbolic grave markers established at beaches, have been implemented at beaches in Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, San Diego, and elsewhere. There is also a similar, but differently named Lafayette Hillside Memorial in the San Francisco Bay Area. Memorial Arlington West refers to the \\"temporary cemetery\\" itself, as well as Veterans for Peace's project of installing the temporary memorial. The name, Arlington West, was given to the memorial by WWII veteran Ted Berlin and reflects the name of the national cemetery of the United States, Arlington National Cemetery, a burial place of honor for fallen war heroes. Arlington National Cemetery is the location of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and is also the final resting place for John F. Kennedy. Arlington West—in a manner similar to \\"real\\" cemeteries—is intended by the project organizers to be a place to mourn, reflect, contemplate, grieve, and meditate, to honor and acknowledge those who have lost their lives, and to reflect upon the costs of war. A Vietnam War veteran placing crosses at Arlington West in Santa Monica The memorial in Santa Barbara, which was first put together on November 2, 2003 by local activist Stephen Sherrill, was soon adopted by the local chapter of Veterans for Peace. It is installed each Sunday by a team of volunteers on the beach immediately west of Stearns Wharf. Visitors walking to the tourist attractions on the wharf have a clear view, from the boardwalk, along the beach with the white crosses in the foreground. From the walkway, visitors can see a flag- draped coffin and more than 3,000 crosses, made of wood, which are intended to resemble and represent traditional military grave markers. In addition to the simulated graveyard, a placard listing all the fallen American military personnel since the U.S. invaded and occupied Iraq is prominently displayed; this list is updated weekly. Due to logistical constraints, the number of new crosses was halted at just over 3000 even though the latest death toll has exceeded 4400. Adjacent to the placards is a sign containing the message: \\"At 3000 crosses, the Arlington West Memorial is 141 feet wide and 310 feet long. A memorial for the Iraqi dead would be 141 feet wide and 12.8 miles long.\\" The second Arlington West was installed in Santa Monica, California on February 15, 2004, a Sunday. It was built on the sand just north of the pier at Santa Monica Beach, \\"as a way to acknowledge the costs and consequences of the addiction to war as an instrument of international policy\\" (quote from Veterans for Peace). Like the initial memorial in Santa Barbara, it has been reinstalled each Sunday and Fourth of July since its inception. Because of the difficulty of finding out the faiths and/or philosophies of the people who died, the cross (a common symbol of Christianity) was selected to be used as a default marker. But both memorials have many markers that are the Star of David or crescents. Arlington West, San Diego Approximately twenty similar memorials have been installed in various locations across the United States and on the West Coast of the U.S.. The San Diego Veterans For Peace, Chapter 91, installs the memorial 6–8 times/year on beaches and parks in San Diego County. On December 14, 2003 Arlington West Santa Barbara was illuminated by 455 candles in red cups for the city's annual Parade of Lights. The cups glowed a blood red while the light projected upward from the cups caused the white crosses to glow in a flickering, living light. Photojournalists on hand commented that the sight of the illuminated memorial \\"upstaged the Parade of Lights\\" (boats in the harbor decked out in Christmas lights). The display drew thousands of spectators during the two hours the candles burned. Veterans For Peace, an official non-governmental organization founded in 1985 includes men and women veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and other conflicts, as well as peacetime veterans. The group has published a 'how-to' for organising, planning and constructing and erecting Arlington West. Several other Memorials have been erected by chapters of Veterans for Peace and other groups. In the spring and summer of 2005, a similar Arlington West display was taken on a U.S. tour, being installed at places such as Ohio's Kent State University (for the 35th commemoration of the shootings of May 4, 1970), as well as at \\"Camp Casey,\\" the site of anti-war protester Cindy Sheehan's vigil outside the ranch of President George W. Bush near Crawford, Texas. In August 2010, the members of the Santa Barbara chapter of Veterans for Peace decided to replace the traditional Arlington West memorial with one which focuses on the War in Afghanistan. The 3000+ crosses for the casualties in Iraq were removed and replaced with 1200+ plastic tombstones representing the fatalities in Afghanistan, ending the memorial dedicated specifically to the Iraq war. Film There was a related film, Arlington West: The Film. Similar memorials In September 2003, a similar display of ninety white crosses laid out in a military configuration and in the shape of a cross was created by American artist Scott Hemeon and included as one of the art installations for Project One's annual Wind/Sea/Sky beach sculpture exhibition on Easton's Beach in Newport, Rhode Island. This installation, entitled CrossCurrents, predated Arlington West by several months. A subsequent article in Art New England magazine (Feb/Mar 2004 issue, p.28) documents this display with a photograph and article. First created in 2003, the Lafayette hillside memorial, which overlooks a busy highway in Lafayette, California (near Oakland), has generated considerable controversy since November 2006, when it was expanded and a large sign was added.

Early life He was the eldest son of Khedive Ismail, and was born on November 15, 1852. His mother was Princess Shafiq-Nur. He was not sent to Europe to be educated like his younger brothers, but grew up in Egypt. In 1866 Ismail succeeded in his endeavor to alter the order of succession to the Khedivate of Egypt. The title, instead of passing to the eldest living male descendant of Muhammad Ali, was now to descend from father to son. Ismail sought this alteration mainly because he disliked his uncle, Halim Pasha, who was his heir-presumptive, and he had imagined that he would be able to select whichever of his sons he pleased for his successor. But he found, after the change had been made, that the Great Powers (Britain, Germany, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire) interpreted the new arrangement as applying strictly to the eldest son. Tewfik therefore became heir-apparent. He was given a palace near Cairo to live in, and for twelve years he passed an uneventful life, farming, and establishing a reputation for good sense and fair dealing with his fellow tenants. Marriage In Cairo on 15 January 1873 he married Princess Emina Ilhamy (Constantinople, 24 May 1858 – Bebek, Bosphorus, 19 June 1931), daughter of Prince Ibrahim al-Hami and Parlanta Qadin. Presidency In 1878 he was appointed president of the council after the dismissal of Nubar Pasha. He held this office only for a few months; but this was long enough to show that, if he was unambitious and not particularly intelligent or energetic, he had the wisdom to refrain from taking a part in the intrigues which then formed the chief part of political life in Egypt and Sudan. He went back to his estate, and settled down once more to a quiet country life. He was undisturbed only for a short time. On 26 June 1879, Ismail, at the insistence of Britain and France, was deposed by the sultan, who sent orders at the same time that Tewfik should be proclaimed Khedive. Reign The new khedive was so displeased by the news of his accession that he soundly boxed the ears of the servant who first brought the tidings to him. Egypt and Sudan at that time was involved in financial and political troubles brought about by the policy of Ismail, and the situation was made worse by the inaction of Britain and France for some months following Tewfik's accession. Tewfik's people were dissatisfied, his army disaffected; his advisers were nearly all of the adventurer class, with their own ends to gain; and he himself had neither the character of a strong ruler nor the experience that would have enabled him to secure an orderly administration of affairs. Tewfik Pasha Disorder prevailed until November 1879, when the dual control was reestablished by the governments of Britain and France. For over two years Major Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer), Mr. (afterwards Sir) Auckland Colvin, and Monsieur de Blignieres practically governed the country, endeavouring to institute reforms while possessing no means of coercion. During all this time the disaffection in the Egyptian army was increasing. Tewfik had been blamed for his failure to take a firm line with the rebels, but his attitude was governed by his relations with Britain and France, and he was unable to control events. The dissatisfaction culminated in the anti-foreign movement headed by Urabi Pasha, who had gained complete command of the army. In July 1882 the attitude of Urabi, who was carrying out defensive works on a large scale, made the British admiral (Sir Beauchamp Seymour, afterwards Lord Alcester) to declare that he would bombard the forts of Alexandria unless they were handed over to him. Before the bombardment began it was suggested to Tewfik that he should leave the city and embark either upon a man-of-war belonging to one of the neutral powers, or in his own yacht, or in a mail steamer which was then in the port. His answer was, \\"I am still Khedive, and I remain with my people in the hour of their danger.\\" At his palace of Qasr el-Raml, three miles (five kilometers) from the town, he was beyond reach of the shells, but his life was nevertheless imperiled. When the rebel soldiers attacked the palace he managed to make his escape and to reach another palace after passing through the burning streets of Alexandria. Here he was obliged to agree that a guard of British bluejackets should protect him from further risk. He showed his courage equally during the cholera epidemic at Alexandria in 1883. He had gone back to Cairo after the Battle of Tel al-Kebir, had consented to the reforms insisted upon by Britain, and had assumed the position of a constitutional ruler under the guidance of Lord Dufferin, the British special commissioner. When cholera broke out, he insisted upon going to Alexandria. His wife accompanied him, and he went round the hospitals, setting an excellent example to the authorities of the city, and encouraging the patients by kind and hopeful words. In 1884, Sir Evelyn Baring (Lord Cromer) went back to Egypt as diplomatic agent and Consul-General of Britain. His first task was to demand that Tewfik should abandon the Sudan. Tewfik gave his consent with natural reluctance, but, having consented, he did everything he could to ensure the success of the policy which Baring had been sent to carry out. He behaved with equal propriety during the negotiations between Sir H. Drummond Wolff and the Turkish envoy, Mukhtar Pasha, in 1886. His position was not a dignified one but that of a titular ruler compelled to stand by while others discussed and managed the affairs of his country. The Sultan was his suzerain; in Britain he recognized his protector: to the representative of each he endeavoured to show friendliness and esteem. As time went on his confidence in Baring increased, until at last he deferred to the British agent in almost everything. On occasion, however, he acted on his own initiative, as when in June 1888 he dismissed Nubar Pasha and summoned Riaz Pasha to form a ministry, an action influenced, nevertheless, by Tewfik's knowledge of the divergence of views between Nubar and the British agent. Baring encouraged Tewfik to show his activity in matters of administration, and he took a great interest in all matters connected with irrigation, education and justice. He was not an imposing man, but he showed a genuine desire to govern his country for its own benefit. He understood the importance to Egypt of British assistance and support; his natural shrewdness made him accept the British conditions; his natural good feeling kept him from any inclination to intrigue. In private life he was courteous and amiable. He had no desire to keep up the unapproachable state of an oriental ruler. Indeed, in many ways his manners and habits were less oriental than European. He married in 1873 his kinswoman, Emina Ilhamy, with whom he lived very happily. She was his only wife and Tewfik was a strong advocate of monogamy. Death He died on 7 January 1892, at the Helwan Palace near Cairo, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Abbas II. Issue By his wife he had the following children: *Abbas Hilmi II Pasha, Khedive of Egypt; *Prince Mohammed Ali Tewfik (Kubba Palace, Cairo, 9 November 1875 – Lausanne, Switzerland, 18 March 1955, and buried in Khedive Tawfik Mausoleum, Kait Bey, Cairo); *Princess Nazli Hanim (11 April 1877 – Cairo, 1879); *Princess Fakhr un-nisa Khadija Hanim (Cairo, 21 May 1880 – Helwan, 22 February 1951); *Princess Nimatullah Hanim (Cairo, 23 October 1882 – Nice, France, 1965, and buried there at the cimetière de Caucade).

Raton (SS-270), an attack submarine, was laid down 29 May 1942 by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisc.; launched 24 January 1943; sponsored by Mrs. C. C. West and commissioned 13 July 1943, Lt. Comdr. J. W. Davis in command. Following training in Lake Michigan and at Coco Solo, C.Z., Raton sailed for the southwest Pacific 19 September 1943, and upon arriving at Brisbane, Australia, on 16 October, joined Submarine Force, 7th Fleet.  First war patrol, November – December 1943  From Brisbane, Raton sailed to Tulagi, Solomon Islands for her first war patrol, from 20 November to 6 December 1943, in the Bismarck Archipelago–Solomons–New Guinea area. On 24 November, while patrolling west of Massau Raton sighted two Japanese cargo- type ships, with two destroyers and a \\"Rufe\\" float plane. The submarine trailed the convoy and that night made a torpedo attack, sinking the Onoe Maru. The excellent countermeasures of the two escorts thwarted four attempts to sink the remaining freighter. On 28 November, she sighted a Rabaul-bound convoy of five cargo ships, accompanied by two escorts. In a submerged attack, Raton sank two ships of the convoy, the Hokko Maru and Yuri Maru. After a severe pounding by the escorts, Raton escaped, but remained in the area for a return bout. In a night attack, she heavily damaged a third freighter, and called for assistance, as her torpedoes were nearly expended. arrived and joined the attack, only to be jumped by the two Japanese destroyers. Raton surfaced and raced at flank speed to draw the escorts away from Gato, and succeeded, allowing Gato to sink Columbia Maru.  Second and third war patrols, December 1943 – April 1944  After returning to Milne Bay, New Guinea, for rest and refit alongside , Raton departed on her second war patrol, from 11 December to 25 January 1944, for the Mindanao–Celebes–Halmahera area. On 24 December, the submarine made an attack on four merchantmen and two destroyers in Morotai Strait, sinking Heiwa Maru and damaging an auxiliary aircraft carrier. On 2 January, she encountered two tankers, escorted by a northwest of Faland Island on the Palau shipping lane. She scored hits on one tanker, but the efficient countermeasures of the Japanese escorts interrupted the attack. Raton departed the patrol area on 19 January and reached Fremantle on 25 January for refit by . Her third patrol, from 18 February to 14 April, was conducted in the Java Sea, the Karimata Strait, and the South China Sea. sank the only two ships she contacted.  Fourth war patrol, May – June 1944  Her fourth patrol, from 19 May to 23 June, in the South China and Java Seas, provided good hunting. On 23 May, Raton intercepted two small intercoastal freighters north of the Tambelan Islands, and sank both with her deck gun. That same evening, she contacted fast convoy Hi-63 of three transports and four destroyers. She sank destroyer , and damaged a transport. On 27 May, the ship's log reported: \\"0615 (H) Ship shaken up considerably by either two underwater explosions or by striking submerged object. People in forward torpedo room thought we had struck something or had been struck by something.\\" This turned out to be 2 torpedoes fired by U.S.S. Lapon. Lapon was looking for a Japanese submarine passing through the area and mistook Raton for that enemy sub. The Commanding officer checked fire on the second set of torpedoes realizing he wasn't shooting at the enemy. Later dry-dock inspection of Raton showed dents where the torpedoes hit. This is the only known friendly fire incident in World War II between two submarines. (http://www.ratonss270.com/ss270-shipmates-stories2.html) On 28 May, Raton tracked a Japanese RO-61-class sub, but missed due to an unfavorable firing angle. On 6 June, a bright moonlit night brought out a large convoy of 11 ships with four destroyer-type escorts. One frigate was blown apart by three hits from a spread of fish fired by Raton, but the submarine received a severe pounding from a prolonged depth charge attack before making her escape. A boarding party from the submarine captured a small sailing vessel on 13 June, taking 11 prisoners and scuttling the craft. Four days later, Raton sighted a small freighter, sinking it with one torpedo, and rescuing nine survivors. SS-270 returned to Fremantle 23 June for upkeep alongside .  Fifth and sixth war patrols, July – December 1944  The fifth patrol, 18 July to 10 September, conducted in the South China Sea off Luzon, gave Raton only one victory, a tanker left beached off Dasol Bay, Philippines, on 4 August. Raton had better luck on her sixth patrol, 6 October to 1 December, in the South China Sea. On the night of 18 October, Raton slipped into the center of a nine-ship convoy for a surface attack. She fired both sets of torpedo tubes, her bow tubes at six overlapping targets while her stern fish were fired at a large freighter. Two ships, Shiranesan Maru and Taikai Maru went down, and another vessel was damaged. A final attack resulted in damage to another cargo ship. With her torpedo supply running low and a typhoon approaching, Raton pulled into Mios Woendi, Schouten Islands, for more fuel and torpedoes with which to finish the patrol. Leaving Mios Woendi 27 October, Raton encountered an enemy task group of two heavy cruisers and five escort vessels on 6 November. In a submerged attack, she scored three hits on a , but did not put the heavy out of action. On 11 November, Raton and attacked a four-ship convoy guarded by three escorts. In a surface action Raton sank Unkai Maru and Kurasaki with four torpedoes. Then, both submarines fired torpedoes at the remaining auxiliaries with unconfirmed results. With only four torpedoes remaining, Raton steamed home, arriving San Francisco 1 December.  Seventh and eighth war patrols, April – July 1945  On 13 March 1945, after an overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Raton headed west for Pearl Harbor for refresher training. She sailed for the Yellow Sea 20 April for her seventh war patrol. On 2 May, she blew up a loaded tanker, Toryu Maru, in a night torpedo attack off Shantung Peninsula despite gunfire from two Japanese escorts. That same day, Raton sank a medium-sized cargo ship, Rezikan Maru, in a submerged torpedo approach. On 16 May, she made a submerged attack on two transports, sinking the larger one Eiju Maru. Raton returned to Guam 25 May for upkeep alongside . The submarine sailed on 22 June for her final patrol of World War II, lifeguard duty off Hong Kong. No Allied planes went down in the area, and she made no enemy contacts. Arriving at Subic Bay 23 July for upkeep, Raton was preparing for her next patrol when the war ended. On 31 August 1945 she sailed for home, arriving at San Francisco in mid- September.  Post-war service, 1946–1948  Following overhaul at Mare Island Shipyard, Raton transited the Panama Canal, and arrived Naval Submarine Base New London on 12 March 1946 where she was assigned to the 2d Fleet. She spent the next 2½ years in training exercises in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean, helping to maintain America and the West's defense posture during the early years of the Cold War.  Radar picket submarine (SSR-270), 1953–1959  Raton (SSR-270) as a Radar Picket submarine, c. 1953–60. After being placed in reserve in the fall of 1948, Raton was decommissioned at New London, Conn., on 11 March 1949. She remained in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at New London until July 1952 when she was towed to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for conversion to a radar picket submarine. Redesignated SSR-270 on 18 July 1952, she was recommissioned 21 September 1953, Cmdr. J. K. Wills in command. Departing Philadelphia on 8 December, she underwent training for several months in the Norfolk area. Ordered to the Pacific, she arrived at San Diego on 7 March 1954 via the Panama Canal. The submarine spent the next year in local operations, before departing from San Diego on 11 May 1955 for a 6-month deployment to WestPac. She returned to San Diego on 6 November 1955. Prior to and following her second 7th Fleet deployment, 13 May 1957 – 8 November 1957, SSR-270 trained in exercises off the Pacific coast. After overhaul at Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard, from 7 July to 24 November 1958, and underway training, the submarine deployed to the 7th Fleet from early March 1959 to mid-November, participating in operations with SEATO and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. Auxiliary research submarine (AGSS-270), 1960–1968  In early 1960 Raton was engaged in local operations, including evaluation of new sonar concepts, and training of UDT personnel in covert reconnaissance. On 1 July 1960, Raton was redesignated an auxiliary submarine AGSS-270. In Mare Island Naval Shipyard from January to April 1961 for a major overhaul, Raton sailed west for her fourth 7th Fleet deployment 3 July 1961, returning to San Diego 19 December. The year 1962 was occupied in fleet training operations off the west coast of the United States, providing services for air, surface, and submarine forces. On April 9, 1962, it was reported that a kite had snagged on the submarine.Submarine Snags a Kite, San Mateo Times, April 9, 1962 This incident was referenced in the Peanuts strip of May 19, 1962 wherein it is implied that the kite had belonged to the long-suffering Charlie Brown whose problems with flying kites was a standard running gag of the strip. Her fifth post-World War II WestPac deployment, from January to June 1963, included participation in two major ASW exercises with U.S. and SEATO forces. Following an overhaul period from November 1963 to early March 1964, Raton deployed again from 6 July to 23 December to the Far East, where she operated with naval forces of Thailand, the Philippines, and the Republic of China, under the Military Assistance Program. Local fleet and type operations filled 1965 and early 1966 when Raton once more followed the setting sun in mid-April for another tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. While deployed, Raton exercised with SEATO naval units in Exercise \\"Sea Imp\\". On 17 October 1966 AGSS-270 returned to San Diego. 1967 was spent in local operations, reserve training, and semiannual overhaul. On 20 May and 21 May 1968, Raton served as a test ship to determine that a small fleet tug could rescue men from a sunken submarine resting on the ocean floor. Raton commenced her final WestPac deployment 15 July 1968, arriving Yokohama 7 August. During her deployment AGSS-270 provided training services to 7th Fleet and SEATO units. The veteran submarine returned to San Diego 20 December 1968. She was decommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard and stricken from the Navy List 28 June 1969. The stripped hull was designated as a target ship for Pacific Fleet gunnery exercise. She was sold for scrapping 10 December 1973. Raton was awarded six battle stars for service in World War II.

Tonometry is the method eye care professionals use to determine this. IOP is an important aspect in the evaluation of patients at risk of glaucoma. Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Physiology Intraocular pressure is determined by the production and drainage of aqueous humour by the ciliary body and its drainage via the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral outflow. The reason for this is because the vitreous humour in the posterior segment has a relatively fixed volume and thus does not affect intraocular pressure regulation. An important quantitative relationship (Goldmann's equation) is as follows: :P_o = \\\\frac{F - U}{C} + P_v Where: * P_o is the IOP in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) * F the rate of aqueous humour formation in microliters per minute (μL/min) * U the resorption of aqueous humour through the uveoscleral route (μL/min) * C is the facility of outflow in microliters per minute per millimeter of mercury (μL/min/mmHg) * P_v the episcleral venous pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The above factors are those that drive IOP. Measurement Diaton transpalpebral tonometer Intraocular pressure is measured with a tonometer as part of a comprehensive eye examination. Measured values of intraocular pressure are influenced by corneal thickness and rigidity. As a result, some forms of refractive surgery (such as photorefractive keratectomy) can cause traditional intraocular pressure measurements to appear normal when in fact the pressure may be abnormally high. A newer transpalpebral and transscleral tonometry method is not influenced by corneal biomechanics and does not need to be adjusted for corneal irregularities as measurement is done over upper eyelid and sclera. Classification Current consensus among ophthalmologists and optometrists define normal intraocular pressure as that between 10 mmHg and 20 mmHg.webMD - TonometryGlaucoma Overview from eMedicine The average value of intraocular pressure is 15.5 mmHg with fluctuations of about 2.75 mmHg. Ocular hypertension (OHT) is defined by intraocular pressure being higher than normal, in the absence of optic nerve damage or visual field loss.Ocular Hypertension, American Optometric Association. Accessed 2015-11-3. Ocular hypotension, hypotony, or ocular hypotony, is typically defined as intraocular pressure equal to or less than 5 mmHg. Such low intraocular pressure could indicate fluid leakage and deflation of the eyeball. Influencing factors  Daily variation  Intraocular pressure varies throughout the night and day. The diurnal variation for normal eyes is between 3 and 6 mmHg and the variation may increase in glaucomatous eyes. During the night, intraocular pressure may not decrease despite the slower production of aqueous humour. In the general population, IOP ranges between 10 and 21 mm Hg with a mean of about 15 or 16 mm Hg (plus or minus 3.5 mm Hg during a 24-hour cycle). Glaucoma patients' 24-hour IOP profiles may differ from those of healthy individuals.  Fitness and exercise  There is some inconclusive research that indicates that exercise could possibly affect IOP (some positively and some negatively).Studies have also been conducted on both healthy and sedentary individuals to determine if intraocular pressure could be reduced with other types of exercise. Some forms of exertion have been found to result in a decrease in intraocular pressure. Exercises studied included; walking, jogging, and running. Acute Dynamic Exercise Reduces Intraocular Pressure , Departments of Ophthalmology, Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Atatürk University, Erzurum- Turkey. July 1999.Qureshi IA. Effects of mild, moderate and severe exercise on intraocular pressure of sedentary subjects. Rawalpindi Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan  Musical instruments  Playing some musical wind instruments has been linked to increases in intraocular pressure. A 2011 study focused on brass and woodwind instruments observed \\"temporary and sometimes dramatic elevations and fluctuations in IOP\\". Another study found that the magnitude of increase in intraocular pressure correlates with the intraoral resistance associated with the instrument, and linked intermittent elevation of intraocular pressure from playing high-resistance wind instruments to incidence of visual field loss. The range of intraoral pressure involved in various classes of ethnic wind instruments, such as Native American flutes, has been shown to be generally lower than Western classical wind instruments.  Drugs  Intraocular pressure also varies with a number of other factors such as heart rate, respiration, fluid intake, systemic medication and topical drugs. Alcohol and marijuana consumption leads to a transient decrease in intraocular pressure and caffeine may increase intraocular pressure.Intraocular pressure measure on normal eyes by Pardianto G et al., in Mimbar Ilmiah Oftalmologi Indonesia.2005;2:78-9. Taken orally, glycerol (often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste) can cause a rapid, temporary decrease in intraocular pressure. This can be a useful initial emergency treatment of severely elevated pressure. The depolarising muscle relaxant succinylcholine, which is used in anaesthesia, transiently increases IOP by around 10 mmHg for a few minutes. This is significant for example if the patient requires anaesthesia for a trauma and has sustained an eye (globe) perforation. The mechanism is not clear but it is thought to involve contraction of tonic myofibrils and transient dilation of choroidal blood vessels. Ketamine also increases IOP. Significance Ocular hypertension is the most important risk factor for glaucoma. Intraocular pressure has been measured as a secondary outcome in a systematic review comparing the effect of neuroprotective agents in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma. Differences in pressure between the two eyes are often clinically significant, and potentially associated with certain types of glaucoma, as well as iritis or retinal detachment. Intraocular pressure may become elevated due to anatomical problems, inflammation of the eye, genetic factors, or as a side-effect from medication. Intraocular pressure laws follow fundamentally from physics. Any kinds of intraocular surgery should be done by considering the intraocular pressure fluctuation. Sudden increase of intraocular pressure can lead to intraocular micro barotrauma and cause ischemic effects and mechanical stress to retinal nerve fiber layer. Sudden intraocular pressure drop can lead to intraocular decompression that generates micro bubbles that potentially cause multiple micro emboli and leading to hypoxia, ischemia and retinal micro structure damage.

He is a scientist in a white coat who tended to \\"invent\\" things which had already been invented and whose experiments invariably failed. He usually invented by penciling the concept in air, with the picture becoming the actual object. The character has also appeared in comics and other Alvin and the Chipmunks works after The Alvin Show.  Creation  Clyde Crashcup was created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr.. He is voiced by Shepard Menken impersonating Richard Haydn.  Fictional character biography  Crashcup is a scientist in a white coat whose experiments invariably failed. His was the only voice heard in many of the episodes because the other main character in the series was his assistant Leonardo, who only whispered into Clyde's ear. Clyde Crashcup was primarily an inventor rather than a researcher, although he tended to \\"invent\\" things that had already been invented. However, in one episode, he built a functioning time machine. He typically would invent something by taking a pencil out of his lab coat's pocket and drawing a picture in midair of his conception: the picture would then become the actual object. Clyde's catchphrase was to break down the name of his invention into its metonymic elements to explain his thought process. For example, when asked to justify the invention of the telephone, he would say \\"That's 'tele-' for tele and '-phone' for phone: telephone.\\"  Appearances  In The Alvin Show, Clyde Crashcup had one of the four segments, and the Chipmunks starred in the other three (two of which were musical segments).

All were written by John Stanley. * In 1981, Crashcup appeared on the TV-special A Chipmunk Christmas, in a dream sequence; he told Alvin that he'd just invented Santa Claus. Charles Berendt provides the voice of Clyde Crashcup. Recent television airings of A Chipmunk Christmas edit out the dream sequence due to time constraints concerning broadcast commercial time. * Crashcup later had a special guest spot in the modern Alvin and the Chipmunks 1990 episode \\"Back to Our Future\\", in which he showed up in the time of the new show with a time machine and brought the modern Chipmunks back to his time, where they temporarily switched places with the Alvin Show Chipmunks.

Plot East German dissident Alex Holbeck (Martin Sheen), living in Paris, hosts a radio program aimed at Iron Curtain countries. Bodley (Michael Lonsdale), a CIA agent, recruits Alex to take on a dangerous assignment. Alex is sent to East Berlin on a mission to steal an Enigma code scrambler. This is part of an attempt to stop the Russian assassination of five Soviet dissidents planned for Christmas Day. Alex does not know is that the CIA already has a code scrambler. By stealing the scrambler in Berlin, they are trying to convince the Russians that they do not have a copy. On arrival in Berlin, Alex finds that the East German police and KGB knows that he is there. Alex must use numerous disguises and escape from a number of capture attempts. He seeks shelter with his former lover, Karen Reinhardt (Brigitte Fossey), before moving on, as it is too dangerous for her. Karen and a number of Alex's other old friends are arrested and tortured by the police in an attempt to gain information about Alex's whereabouts. As he gets more desperate, Alex enlists Karen's help again; she seduces Dimitri Vasilikov (Sam Neill), the KGB man in charge of the hunt for Alex, to obtain information. In the end, Dimitri catches Alex and Karen and finds the scrambler hidden in an exhibition artifact. As he is in love with Karen, he lets them go, but keeps the scrambler, which was in fact not needed. On Christmas Day, the assassination attempt is successfully thwarted.

It also includes other tests and examinations pertaining to the eyes. Eye examinations are primarily performed by an optometrist, ophthalmologist, orthoptist, or an optician. Health care professionals often recommend that all people should have periodic and thorough eye examinations as part of routine primary care, especially since many eye diseases are asymptomatic. Eye examinations may detect potentially treatable blinding eye diseases, ocular manifestations of systemic disease, or signs of tumours or other anomalies of the brain. A full eye examination consists of an external examination, followed by specific tests for visual acuity, pupil function, extraocular muscle motility, visual fields, intraocular pressure and ophthalmoscopy through a dilated pupil. A minimal eye examination consists of tests for visual acuity, pupil function, and extraocular muscle motility, as well as direct ophthalmoscopy through an undilated pupil. Basic examination Visual acuity Visual acuity is the eyes ability to detect fine details and is the quantitative measure of the eye's ability to see an in-focus image at a certain distance. The standard definition of normal visual acuity (20/20 or 6/6 vision) is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc. The terms 20/20 and 6/6 are derived from standardized sized objects that can be seen by a \\"person of normal vision\\" at the specified distance. For example, if one can see at a distance of 20 ft an object that normally can be seen at 20 ft, then one has 20/20 vision. If one can see at 20 ft what a normal person can see at 40 ft, then one has 20/40 vision. Put another way, suppose you have trouble seeing objects at a distance and you can only see out to 20 ft what a person with normal vision can see out to 200 feet, then you have 20/200 vision. The 6/6 terminology is used in countries using the metric system, and that represents the distance in metres. This is often measured with a Snellen chart or LogMAR chart Refraction In physics, \\"refraction\\" is the mechanism that bends the path of light as it passes from one medium to another, as when it passes from the air through the parts of the eye. In an eye exam, the term refraction is the determination of the ideal correction of refractive error. Refractive error is an optical abnormality in which the shape of the eye fails to bring light into sharp focus on the retina, resulting in blurred or distorted vision. Examples of refractive error are myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia and astigmatism. A refraction procedure consists of two parts: objective and subjective. Objective refraction An objective refraction is a refraction obtained without receiving any feedback from the patient, using a retinoscope or auto-refractor. To perform a retinoscopy, the doctor projects a streak of light into a pupil. A series of lenses are flashed in front of the eye. By looking through the retinoscope, the doctor can study the light reflex of the pupil. Based on the movement and orientation of this retinal reflection, the refractive state of the eye is measured. An auto-refractor is a computerized instrument that shines light into an eye. The light travels through the front of the eye, to the back and then forward through the front again. The information bounced back to the instrument gives an objective measurement of refractive error without asking the patients any questions. Subjective refraction A subjective refraction requires responses from the patient. Typically, the patient will sit behind a phoropter or wear a trial frame and look at an eye chart. The eye care professional will change lenses and other settings while asking the patient for feedback on which set of lenses give the best vision. Cycloplegic refraction Sometimes, eye care professionals prefer to obtain a cycloplegic refraction, especially when trying to obtain an accurate refraction in young children who may skew refraction measurements by adjusting their eyes with accommodation. Cycloplegic eye drops are applied to the eye to temporarily paralyze the ciliary muscle of the eye. Pupil function ITESM-Campus Ciudad de México. An examination of pupilary function includes inspecting the pupils for equal size (1 mm or less of difference may be normal), regular shape, reactivity to light, and direct and consensual accommodation. These steps can be easily remembered with the mnemonic PERRLA (D+C): Pupils Equal and Round; Reactive to Light and Accommodation (Direct and Consensual). A swinging-flashlight test may also be desirable if neurologic damage is suspected. The swinging-flashlight test is the most useful clinical test available to a general physician for the assessment of optic nerve anomalies. This test detects the afferent pupil defect, also referred to as the Marcus Gunn pupil. It is conducted in a semidarkened room. In a normal reaction to the swinging-flashlight test, both pupils constrict when one is exposed to light. As the light is being moved from one eye to another, both eyes begin to dilate, but constrict again when light has reached the other eye. If there is an efferent defect in the left eye, the left pupil will remain dilated regardless of where the light is shining, while the right pupil will respond normally. If there is an afferent defect in the left eye, both pupils will dilate when the light is shining on the left eye, but both will constrict when it is shining on the right eye. This is because the left eye will not respond to external stimulus (afferent pathway), but can still receive neural signals from the brain (efferent pathway) to constrict. If there is a unilateral small pupil with normal reactivity to light, it is unlikely that a neuropathy is present. However, if accompanied by ptosis of the upper eyelid, this may indicate Horner's syndrome. If there is a small, irregular pupil that constricts poorly to light, but normally to accommodation, this is an Argyll Robertson pupil. Ocular motility Ocular motility should always be tested, especially when patients complain of double vision or physicians suspect neurologic disease. First, the doctor should visually assess the eyes for deviations that could result from strabismus, extraocular muscle dysfunction, or palsy of the cranial nerves innervating the extraocular muscles. Saccades are assessed by having the patient move his or her eye quickly to a target at the far right, left, top and bottom. This tests for saccadic dysfunction whereupon poor ability of the eyes to \\"jump\\" from one place to another may impinge on reading ability and other skills, whereby the eyes are required to fixate and follow a desired object. The patient is asked to follow a target with both eyes as it is moved in each of the nine cardinal directions of gaze. The examiner notes the speed, smoothness, range and symmetry of movements and observes for unsteadiness of fixation. These nine fields of gaze test the extraocular muscles: inferior, superior, lateral and medial rectus muscles, as well as the superior and inferior oblique muscles. Visual field (confrontation) testing Testing the visual fields consists of confrontation field testing in which each eye is tested separately to assess the extent of the peripheral field. To perform the test, the individual occludes one eye while fixated on the examiner's eye with the non-occluded eye. The patient is then asked to count the number of fingers that are briefly flashed in each of the four quadrants. This method is preferred to the wiggly finger test that was historically used because it represents a rapid and efficient way of answering the same question: is the peripheral visual field affected? Common problems of the visual field include scotoma (area of reduced vision), hemianopia (half of visual field lost), homonymous hemianopsia and bitemporal hemianopia. External examination External examination of eyes consists of inspection of the eyelids, surrounding tissues and palpebral fissure. Palpation of the orbital rim may also be desirable, depending on the presenting signs and symptoms. The conjunctiva and sclera can be inspected by having the individual look up, and shining a light while retracting the upper or lower eyelid. The position of the eyelids are checked for abnormalities such as ptosis which is an asymmetry between eyelid positions. Thursday, April 23, 2020 Slit-lamp Slit lamp examination of the eyes in an ophthalmology clinic Close inspection of the anterior eye structures and ocular adnexa are often done with a slit lamp which is a table mounted microscope with a special adjustable illumination source attached. A small beam of light that can be varied in width, height, incident angle, orientation and colour, is passed over the eye. Often, this light beam is narrowed into a vertical \\"slit\\", during slit-lamp examination. The examiner views the illuminated ocular structures, through an optical system that magnifies the image of the eye and the patient is seated while being examined, and the head stabilized by an adjustable chin rest. This allows inspection of all the ocular media, from cornea to vitreous, plus magnified view of eyelids, and other external ocular related structures. Fluorescein staining before slit lamp examination may reveal corneal abrasions or herpes simplex infection. The binocular slit-lamp examination provides stereoscopic magnified view of the eye structures in striking detail, enabling exact anatomical diagnoses to be made for a variety of eye conditions. Also ophthalmoscopy and gonioscopy examinations can also be performed through the slit lamp when combined with special lenses. These lenses include the Goldmann 3-mirror lens, gonioscopy single-mirror/ Zeiss 4-mirror lens for (ocular) anterior chamber angle structures and +90D lens, +78D lens, +66D lens & Hruby (-56D) lens, the examination of retinal structures is accomplished. Intraocular pressure Intraocular pressure (IOP) can be measured by Tonometry devices. The eye can be thought of as an enclosed compartment through which there is a constant circulation of fluid that maintains its shape and internal pressure. Tonometry is a method of measuring this pressure using various instruments. The normal range is 10-21 mmHg. Retinal examination Fully dilated pupil prior to ophthalmoscopic examination Examination of retina (fundus examination) is an important part of the general eye examination. Dilating the pupil using special eye drops greatly enhances the view and permits an extensive examination of peripheral retina. A limited view can be obtained through an undilated pupil, in which case best results are obtained with the room darkened and the patient looking towards the far corner. The appearance of the optic disc and retinal vasculature are also recorded during fundus examination. A red reflex can be seen when looking at a patient's pupil through a direct ophthalmoscope. This part of the examination is done from a distance of about 50 cm and is usually symmetrical between the two eyes. An opacity may indicate a cataract. Using a phoropter to determine a prescription for eyeglasses Retinal vessel analysis is a non-invasive method to examine the small arteries and veins in the retina which allows to draw conclusions about the morphology and the function of small vessels elsewhere in the human body and is used in particular by cardiologists as well as ophthalmologists.Nägele MR et al.: Retinal microvascular dysfunction in heart failure.

Skiddaw Little Man also called Little Man is a fell in the English Lake District, it is situated four kilometres north of the town of Keswick and reaches a height of 865 m (2,837 ft). Topography Little Man is often overlooked and disregarded as an independent and distinct fell due to its name which makes it sound like a minor top of its parent fell Skiddaw which in fact lies 1.5 kilometres to the north west. With a topographical prominence of 61 metres, Little Man qualifies comfortably as a Hewitt and Nuttall hill and is regarded as a separate fell by renowned mountain writers Alfred Wainwright and Bill Birkett. The fell is actually called Little Man on Ordnance Survey maps and by many guide books. To the north and east Little Man is connected to the Skiddaw massif, Lonscale Fell being the nearest separate fell to the east, 2.5 kilometres away. To the south and the west the fell falls away steeply with fast flowing streams draining the fell into the River Derwent. Half a kilometre to the south east of the main summit lies a lower top called Lesser Man (815 metres), this is adorned with an unusual cairn consisting of rocks and old fence posts. A further half a kilometre to the south east of Lesser Man, on the other side of the bridleway from Keswick to Skiddaw, stands Jenkin Hill (735 metres), this flat-topped height being regarded as an outlier of Little Man. Geology Geologically, Little Man consists of Skiddaw slate and the summit of the fell is made up of grassy patches within large areas of slate. Summit Little Man has one big advantage over Skiddaw in that its convex southern slopes make it a far better viewpoint than its higher neighbour. In fact the panorama from Little Man is regarded as one of the best in the national park taking in the valleys and lakes of northern Lakeland as well as all of the best-known fells of the district. Ascents Many people climb Little Man via the tourist path from Keswick on the way to the summit of Skiddaw. However, there are several better and more interesting but steep ascents from the hamlets of Millbeck and Applethwaite to the south of the fell. One of the routes from Millbeck is a scrambler's route up the steep south west Arête.

Because his parents were not married (and never married), Joseph was born at the house of his maternal grandparents, Anna Maria and Matthias Kentenich, where he spent the first years of his life.\\"Peter Joseph Kentenich's Childhood\\", paterkenternich.de From the end of 1891 until the second half of 1892, Joseph lived with his mother in Strasbourg, where she worked as housekeeper for her elder brother, Peter Joseph, after his wife’s death on 25 December 1891. The boy attended a school there for a few months. After her brother remarried on 25 June 1892, Katharina and her son returned to Gymnich. Katharina had to look for a permanent job in order to support her child. Joseph Kentenich was sent to St. Vincent orphanage in Oberhausen on 12 April 1894. Upon arrival, Katharina gripped the neck of a statue of the Virgin Mary, a gold chain with a cross, one of the few precious objects she owned; she asked the Mother of Jesus to take care of the education of her son; then she put the cross on Joseph's neck.  Entrance into the seminary  In 1897, Kentenich expressed the wish to become a priest for the first time. Two years later, he entered the Pallottines minor seminary in Ehrenbreitstein. In 1904, he entered the novitiate of the Pallottines in Limburg an der Lahn. In his diary, he formulates his spiritual journey, \\"God is my only goal, He must also be the star that guides my life.\\" However, the novice faces great difficulties because of his intellectualist character. He is obsessed by the primary philosophical question: \\"Is there a truth, and how to know it?\\" He has a strong aspiration for perfection, but feels great insensitivity, a sort of incapacity to love God and his neighbor. Marian devotion allows him to overcome this crisis and discover the personal love that God, Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary have for him, a love that is not an abstract idea but a living reality.  Priesthood  Kentenich as a newly ordained priest, 8 July 1910 Admitted to religious profession in 1909, Kentenich was ordained as a priest in Limburg an der Lahn on 8 July 1910. Although he wished to become a missionary in Africa with the Pallottines, his poor health prevented him. He was first a professor at the Minor Seminary of Ehrenbreistein. From 1912 to 1919, he served as spiritual director at the minor seminary of the Pallottine Fathers in Vallendar-Schoenstatt, near Koblenz (Germany) on the Rhine. His charism of education manifested in the first years of his priesthood.  Chaplain  Indeed, a storm stirred the seminarians of Vallendar-Schoenstatt: students protested against the internal regulations that they considered too severe, while some protesters spread graffiti on the walls. Two priests in charge of their spiritual direction resigned. Under this situation, a young Father Kentenich is named as a replacement to try to restore confidence among the seminarians. In his first talk, he says to his students: \\"I am at your disposal with all that I am and all that I have: my knowledge and my ignorance, my competence and my incompetence, but especially my heart... We will learn to educate ourselves under the protection of Mary, to become strong, free and priestly men.\\"  Founding the Schoenstatt Movement   Beginning the \\"Covenant of Love\\" with Mary  Kentenich with the Schoenstatt Marian Congregation, on 18 October 1914 (seated fourth from the right) Kentenich interpreted the ideas of his order's founder, Vincent Pallotti, to be calling for a worldwide effort to involve lay people in apostolic work, and to unite the various factions in the church. With some of his pupils, on 18 October 1914, Kentenich laid the first milestone of the foundation of the work of Schoenstatt. In an old chapel of St. Michael, formerly abandoned and used for the storage of the gardening tools, he gathers about twenty seminarians, where they seal with the Mother of God a covenant that he will call \\"Covenant of Love\\". What makes unique this approach is that this \\"Covenant\\" is conceived not as a pious symbol, but a bilateral contract between the two contracting parties. Moreover, through the voice of the young priest, the Holy Virgin is requested to kindly establish Her throne in the chapel to spread Her treasures. Each group member agrees to give up now entirely to the Mother of God, and to let themselves be guided by Her through their existence. The group founds a Marian Congregation. This was the beginning and the lasting foundation of today’s worldwide development of the Schoenstatt Movement. This movement was named after its place of origin, a word meaning \\"Beautiful Place\\".\\"Our Founder\\", Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary Indeed, deeply convinced about Mary's love for all men, he implored by prayer and sacrifice for that small chapel becomes a privileged place of grace and that it may attract multitudes of men and educate them for the work of God's Kingdom. The speech he delivered on this occasion is considered the Schoenstatt Movement's Foundation Act.The picture of the Mater Ter AdmirabilisThe young seminarians grasped his intentions and testified by their spirit of sacrifice during the difficult years of World War I. Some of them, amid the dangers of the front, sacrificed their lives for the cause of Schoenstatt. Among these, the Servant of God Joseph Engling was particularly distinguished: fervent seminarian, supporter of the peace between nations and an apostle among his fellow soldiers, he offers his life to the Our Lady for the development of Schoenstatt. On 4 October 1918, he is killed by a shell in Northern France, next to Thun-Saint-Martin; Father Kentenich would present him as a model. His process of beatification is underway. In 1915, a teacher gave to Kentenich a picture of the Virgin Mary with her child. Despite the low artistic value of the work, Kentenich was charmed by the tenderness of the gesture of Mary clutching Jesus on her heart; he placed the picture above the altar. Revered as Mater Ter Admirabilis (Mother Thrice Admirable), she was put in all the foundations of Schoenstatt. During the war, a magazine under the same patronage was sent to the youth who fight at the front.  Between WWI and WWII  The project, initially purely local, expanded rapidly after the World War I. It gradually encompassed many categories; young people, priests, women, sisters, and pilgrims. They are structured according to the German practical spirit, with leagues, federations, and later with secular institutes, according to the degree of commitment of each of their members. A retreat for priests preached by Fr. Kentenich in Schoenstatt Father Kentenich traveled through all of Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland, to preach retreats and lead training sessions. From 1928 to 1935, he preached every year for more than 2,000 priests, and many other lay retreatants. In 1926, Kentenich founded the Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary.  Fight against Nazism  Kentenich observed with concern the rise of Nazism, which he ranked among the products of what he calls \\"the idealistic and mechanistic thinking\\" that engulfed Europe since nineteenth century like an oil spill. In 1933, when the Nazis took power in Germany and closed religious houses one after the other, Father Kentenich took little time to send groups of the Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary groups to South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay to allow the movement to survive in case the persecution of the Church in Germany intensified. His opposition to Nazism attracted persecutory reactions towards him. Father Kentenich said about the swastika: \\"We, it is the Cross of the Christ that we follow.\\" About Nazism, he said, \\"I see no place where the water of baptism could run there\\". On 20 September 1941, Kentenich was arrested by the Gestapo in Koblenz and subsequently sent to Dachau concentration camp. He spent over 3 years in the camp, where he became a support for many, especially among the priests, and according to firsthand accounts, he guided many prisoners to show compassion, to be good men even in the midst of certain death. In Dachau, new branches of the Schoenstatt Movement, including its first international and family branches, were founded.  Arrest by the Gestapo  Once in power, the Nazis were quick to classify Schoenstatt among the main opponents to destroy. After endless vexations, on 20 September 1941, Kentenich was summoned by the Gestapo; quoting some of his words spoken in private, but reported by an informer: \\"My mission is to reveal the inner emptiness of National Socialism, and by there to defeat it.\\" The police imprisoned him for a month in a cell without ventilation, in order to break his resistance. This was a small massive concrete cell without any opening than the door. Father Kentenich was kept for four weeks in this dark and airless bunker, which was previously the vault of a branch of the Reichsbank. He left physically debilitated, but calm and peaceful as before. He was then transferred to a prison in Koblenz, a former Carmelite convent. He spent 5 months there, after which he was sent on to Dachau.  Sent to the Dachau concentration camp  Kentenich at the Dachau concentration camp (second from the right) Registration card of Joseph Kentenich as a prisoner at Dachau Nazi Concentration Camp In March 1942, Kentenich was sent to the Dachau concentration camp at a moment when the living conditions there were worsening. Of the 12,000 prisoners, there were 2,600 priests. He was inmate number 29392. The Germans were grouped in a block where they have the right to attend daily Mass celebrated by one of them; it is only on 19 March 1943 that Kentenich would finally celebrate his first Mass at the camp. He gave a nightly spiritual conference to his fellow prisoners thanks to the protection of the \\"capo\\" (inmate block chief) Guttmann, a Communist with a rather violent temper, but fascinated by the behavior of the Father. Guttman saw Kentenich sharing his meager daily bread and soup with a detainee in need. Guttmann will save the priest who is destined to die in the gas chamber because of his poor health. On the day of the selection visit by an S.S. physician, the capo hides Father Kentenich; assigned to the disinfection commando, he can now circulate in the camp.  Foundation of Schoenstatt International at Dachau  On 16 July 1942 two new Schoenstatt branches were created at Dachau under the responsibility of two lay deportees: the Secular Institute of the Families and the Institute of the Brothers of Mary. Transferred into various blocks, Kentenich restarted his apostleship each time despite the personal risk he incurred. Over the last three months of 1944, the tightening of the Nazi regime and epidemics cause the death of 10,000 prisoners in Dachau. It was at this point that, in a surprising act of faith and hope in this hellish place, Father Kentenich formed with a group of disciples the International Movement which extended the foundation of Schoenstatt out into the world. He wrote under unimaginable material conditions treaties of spirituality, prayers, and a didactic poem of over 20,000 verses.Those writings, named \\"Heavenwards\\", can be read at http://schhw.net/en/index.htm . In December, Bishop Gabriel Piguet, a French prisoner, ordained under the highest secrecy a priest Blessed Karl Leisner, a seminarian from Schoenstatt. Suffering from tuberculosis and very weakened, Leisner will celebrate only one Mass before dying; he will be beatified by John Paul II on 23 June 1996. On 6 April 1945, upon the arrival of American troops, the prisoners are released. On 20 May, at the feast of Pentecost, Father Kentenich returned to Schoenstatt. He immediately restarted his work, in order to establish a barrier against those whom he considered the biggest dangers to the world: communism in the East, and practical materialism in the West. The experience of deportation helped him teach his disciples on how to maintain inner freedom. Fathers Albert Eise and Franz Reinisch, two martyrs from Schoenstatt, the first who died from disease in Dachau, the second executed by the Nazis, were invoked as heavenly protectors by all members of the Movement.  International development of Schoenstatt  In March 1947, Father Kentenich was received in private audience by Pope Pius XII. He thanked the Pope for the publication, two days earlier, of the constitution Provida Mater Ecclesia, which created the Secular Institutes.One of the more than 200 Schoenstatt Shrines in the worldIn October 1948, the Holy See erected in a Secular Institute the Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary. At the same time, Kentenich traveled to Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, the United States, and Africa to establish the movement there, with the construction of replicas of the Schoenstatt Shrine, training centers, and religious houses.  Exile  However, opposition continued to grow against the movement whose presence and reach engendered jealousy. These opponents did not focus on points of doctrine, but primarily on terms used in certain prayers and the role of the founder that were deemed too exclusive. The Bishop of Trier, in whose diocese Schoenstatt is located, ordered a canonical visitation. The overall visitor's report praised the movement, but made some minor criticisms to which Father Kentenich was invited to reply. He raised the debate by writing a long document on the work of Schoenstatt which was presented as a cure for the disease of Western thought, idealism. For Kentenich, Schoenstatt was an antidote to this poison, because it is not an abstract theory but a practical application of Christian doctrine. However, his long response upset the Apostolic Visitor, who sent the file to the Holy Office in Rome. In 1951, Father Tromp, a Dutch Jesuit, was appointed Apostolic Inspector with extensive powers. Baffled by the unconventional terminology used by Father Kentenich, he accused him of being an agitator, an innovator, and even a sectarian. After being stripped of all his functions in the movement, Kentenich was assigned residence in the convent of Pallottines in Milwaukee; all further correspondence with the leaders of the work was prohibited. More than three decades later, when witnesses were examined for the cause of Father Kentenich's beatification, a 78-year-old priest still in office declared, \\"Kentenich never received any official act of indictment. There was no official lawyer and he was never brought before a judge, much less faced a complainant or a witness.\\" His exile lasted fourteen years. However, Kentenich accepted the punishment and writes: \\"God does not speak clearly by events? The Church wants to test our obedience, to recognize that if the work and the holder of the work are marked by God.\\" In 1959, Father Kentenich was appointed as parish priest of the German-speaking Catholic community of Milwaukee, with many immigrants from that nation. \\"He spoke about the Heavenly Father, will say some of his parishioners, as we had never heard anyone do it.\\" In 1953, Pope Pius XII, by suggestion, refused to dissolve Schoenstatt. The status of the movement became a matter of whether it should be integrated into the Congregation of the Pallottines, or have its autonomy. The superiors of the Order advocated for the first option, but other Pallottines agreed with Father Kentenich that Schoenstatt should be fully autonomous under penalty of wither. In 1962, under the intervention of several bishops, John XXIII entrusted the case to the Congregation for Religious. Fr. Kentenich at his arrival in Schoenstatt after the exile  Return from exile  In December 1963, Pope Paul VI appointed Bishop Höffner, from Münster, as moderator and protector of Schoenstatt. A new apostolic visitor is appointed, who delivered a favorable report. In 1964, under the unanimous opinion of the German bishops, a papal decree declared the separation of Schoenstatt from the Pallottines. In October 1965, Father Kentenich was reinstated at the direction of the Movement. Now in his eighties, he was received by Paul VI a few days after the closing of the Second Vatican Council. He predicted that the council \\"will bear fruit, but will have first negative effects, because of the uncertainty of large sections of the hierarchy, clergy and laity about the image of the Church... This uncertainty can be overcome by turning our eyes to Mary, the first image and Mother of the Church.  His last actions in Schoenstatt: a father to many  On Christmas of 1965, Father Kentenich, his face now adorned with a long white beard, was enthusiastically welcomed at Schoenstatt. His work now included five secular institutes: the Schoenstatt Fathers, the Diocesan Priests, the Brothers of Mary, the Sisters of Mary, the Ladies of Schoenstatt, and the Families. This also encompassed the several Federations and Leagues gathering priests, lay people, and families. Kentenich now devoted his strength to exert his spiritual fatherhood for all. An influential theology in the years after the council demanded an \\"adult faith\\", the autonomy of the individual, the application of the democratic principle in the Church. In opposition to these ideas in fashion, Father Kentenich stressed the fatherhood of God and that of the priesthood in the Church, especially the episcopate. Originating from charity, the fatherhood is also the principle of authority, and implies obedience. The motherly presence of Mary is another essential point of the movement; the practical way to live it is the covenant of love with the Mother Thrice Admirable. Over the last three years of his life, despite his advanced age, Fr. Kentenich worked zealously to promote the internal development of the Movement. By his several conferences, he took a clear position facing the confusion of certain theological doctrines and the crisis of authority in the Church.View of the Adoration Church, where Fr. Kentenich is buriedIn a speech at the annual conference of German Catholics in 1967, Father Kentenich said: \\"We are living in apocalyptic times... Heavenly and devilish powers clash in this earth... This confrontation is to challenge the domination of the world; today this is clearly visible.\\" The solution is to appeal to the Virgin Mary, \\"favorite weapon in the hands of the living God\\".  Death During his last year on earth, Kentenich constantly returned to this theme: \\"The task of Mary is to bring Christ to the world and the world to Christ ... We are convinced that the great crises of the present times cannot be overcome without Mary\\" (12 September 1968). In 15 September 1968, on the Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows, Kentenich celebrated Mass at the recently inaugurated Church of Adoration, newly consecrated on the heights of Schoenstatt. Six hundred Sisters of Mary attended the ceremony. Back in the sacristy for the thanksgiving prayer just after Mass, he suffered a heart attack; after receiving the last sacraments he died minutes later. Kentenich's tomb in the Adoration Church's sacristy His mortal remains are buried in the place where he took his last breath. On his tomb figure, according to his wish, is the inscription: Dilexit Ecclesiam (\\"He loved the Church\\"; Eph 5:25), influenced by the same inscription engraved on the tomb of Cardinal Gaspard Mermillod, Bishop of Geneva (Switzerland) in the 19th century who was exiled from his own country for 11 years for refusing to adhere to a national church separated from Rome.  Beatification process  The process for his beatification was opened on 10 February 1975 in the Diocese of Trier, Germany. The process is in the final phase of the diocesan stage. Life-size sculptures of Kentenich, created by American artist Gwendolyn Gillen, now stand outside Schoenstatt chapels in Lamar, Texas, Pewaukee, Wisconsin, Rome and Puerto Rico.  Allegations of abuse and responses In July 2020 past allegations of abuse by Kentenich were reported and these were alleged to have been the real cause why the Holy See had decided to exile the founder from Schoenstatt. The allegations, including one of sexual abuse, were reported by Alexandra von Teuffenbach, a former professor at the Pontifical Lateran University and the Regina Apostolorum university, who cited documents of the archives of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith after Pope Francis had allowed the consultation of documents concerning the pontificate of Pius XII.[http://magister.blogautore.espresso.repubblica.it/2020/07/02/father- master-the-founder-of-the-apostolic-movement-of-schonstatt-abused-his-nuns/ Repubblica.it website. The allegations were strongly denied by the general praesidium of the Schoenstatt movement. In a formal statement the movement indicated that the allegations had long been known about and the fact that Kentenich was reinstated from exile by the Vatican in 1965 was evidence that the allegations were not considered true. It was also stated that at the opening of Kentenich's process of beatification in 1975 a nihil obstat (\\"no obstructions\\") was granted by the church and that this would not have been granted if the previously known accusations were found to have any substance. The Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary also released their own formal statement, as the accusations from von Teuffenbach concerned their community in particular. The sisters emphatically rejected the accusations and said that \\"successive generations of our community have experienced the founder as an authentic and credible personality\\". Like the statement from Schoenstatt's general praesidium, the sisters were already aware of the allegations made against Kentenich and emphasised that when he was reinstated as the founder and returned to Schoenstatt from the US in 1965 all accusations had already been refuted by the church. A few days after the reports and responses, the postulator of Kentenich's cause and key representatives of Schoenstatt met with Bishop Stephan Ackermann of the Diocese of Trier. The end result was an announcement of a commission of historians to review the beatification process of Kentenich, a decision that was welcomed by Fr Juan Pablo Catoggio, international president of the Schoenstatt movement. It will also be the task of the commission \\"to reconcile the newly found material with what has already been gathered and evaluated from other archives by the previous commission. At the end of their work, the commission – including the results of the previous commission – will write a report in which a statement will also be made about the personality and spirituality of Fr. Josef Kentenich as depicted in the collected documents.\\" Reacting to the announcement, Fr. Catoggio issued a statement addressed to the “Schoenstatt Family throughout the world” on July 8, saying that “we very much welcome this decision of the bishop, since in this way the clarification of the questions regarding the person and actions of Father Kentenich.” See also * Karl Leisner * John Pozzobon * Franz Reinisch * Francisco Javier Errázuriz Ossa * Schoenstatt Shrine * Pilgrim Mother Campaign  References   External links  * Official Secretariat of Joseph Kentenich's canonization campaign * The founder: Joseph Kentenich * Heavenwards - collection of writings of Fr.

He represented a modern Ottoman era, given his openness to European-style modernization as well as the reforms he helped to enact. Among other posts, he served as Grand Vizier, the equivalent of Prime Minister, on two occasions between 1861 and 1866. He is often regarded, along with Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha, as one of the most influential Ottoman statesmen, who favoured a French-inspired civil code for the newly established civil courts in 1868. Fuad Pasha was a fervent supporter of keeping the empire an absolute monarchy, rejecting the ideas of being legally bounded or restricted by a constitution or legislature. He often clashed with liberal intellectuals like Namık Kemal, Ziya Pasha and İbrahim Şinasi.https://www.academia.edu/13198874/MEHMET_EM%C4%B0N_%C3%82L%C4%B0_PA%C5%9EA_VE_KE%C3%87EC%C4%B0ZADE_MEHMED_FUAD_PA%C5%9EA Early life Fuad Pasha was born in 1814 to a prominent ulema family. His father, Keçecizade Izzet Molla, was a famous poet, and Fuad continued this trend as both a littérateur and a poet. He received a medrese education but had to leave his education when his father was dismissed and banished to the provinces.Shaw, Stanford J., and Ezel Kural Shaw.

Lord Dufferin's Plan for a 'Province of Syria': Beirut, 1860-61.\\" Middle Eastern Studies. no. 3 (2000): 160-176. Career beginnings Fuad Pasha in his middle years. Fuad Pasha was fluent in French, which led him to a job as scribe to the governor of Tunisia, Tahir Pasha, from 1832 to 1836. Upon the governor's death, Fuad Pasha entered the service of the Grand Vizier, Mustafa Reşid Pasha, and began working with Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha. His title, \\"Pasha\\", was given to a high- ranking member of the Ottoman government and could only be given by the Sultan as an honorary title. Mehmed Emin Aali had been in the Grand Vizier's service for a considerable amount of time. While Mustafa Reşid and Mehmed Emin Aali were on a diplomatic trip to London, Fuad secured a position as the First Translator of the Porte, a position which he held from 1838 to 1852. Fuad continued to study history, modern languages, international law, and political economics with the hope of rising to a diplomatic career. His translator position led him to become a prótege of Mustafa Reşid's while he was in power for the first two years after the Edict of Gülhane from 1839 to 1841 and again from 1846 to 1852. The Edict was launched by Sultan Abdülmecid I at the recommendation of Mustafa Reşid and effectively began the Tanzimat reforms. Although Mehmed Emin Aali and Fuad were the same age, Fuad was somewhat slower in rising to position. This changed, however, in 1848 when Fuad demonstrated his skills in his negotiations with Russian officials in Bucharest and St. Petersburg regarding refugees flooding into the Empire as a result of the 1848 revolutions in Europe. Czar Nicholas I of Russia demanded the extradition of the men who had started the revolutions who were now seeking refuge in the Empire. Mustafa Reşid had previously refused the Czar's demands and the threat of war was growing. Fuad, however, traveled to St. Petersburg and, through his negotiations, the Czar relinquished his demands for extradition and settled for Fuad's promise that the revolutionaries would be kept far from the Russian borders. Fuad demonstrated this same talent for negotiations in 1852 when he worked with Muhammad Ali of Egypt's successor, Prince Abbas, in Egypt. Because of these diplomatic successes, Fuad became Mehmed Emin Aali's equal, both in political rank and influence with Mustafa Reşid. Mustafa Reşid was removed as Grand Vizier in 1852 by the sultan and Mehmed Emin Aali was then named as his successor. Mehmed Emin Aali recommended to the Sultan that Fuad succeed him as Foreign Minister, and in 1852, this recommendation was accepted. The beginning of Fuad's term as Foreign Minister and Mehmed Emin Aali's as Grand Vizier marked an important shift in Ottoman foreign policy and sharp division between Mustafa Reşid and his former protégés. While Mustafa Reşid had displayed a preference for Great Britain, Fuad and Mehmed Emin Aali were strong supporters of France. This, however, would ultimately lead to their fall as both men supported France in the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war between the Catholic Maronites (supported by the French), and the Druze Muslims (supported by the British and, subsequently, Mustafa Reşid) over power in Mount Lebanon before the Crimean War. Because of this fall, both Fuad and Mehmed Emin Aali took a step back from their governmental careers and turned to the Council of the Tanzimat, of which Mehmed Emin Aali was chairman and Fuad was a member. Tanzimat period Engraving of Fuad Pasha (1858) from a photograph by Gustave Le Gray Member of the Council of the Tanzimat Fuad Pasha was an important reformer during the Tanzimat period. The goal of the program was to, “promote reform, fend off the powers and forestall rebellion”.Davison, Roderic H. “Turkish Attitudes Concerning Christian-Muslim Equality in the Nineteenth Century.” The American Historical Review, Vol. 59, No. 4 (Jul., 1954), pp. 844–864. The Council of the Tanzimat was established to codify the actions enacted by the Tanzimat reforms. These reforms were designed to centralize power through “modernization [and] centralization” to “increase revenue [and] prevent fragmentation”.Martin, Richard C. Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World Volume II. New York: Macmillan Reference, 2004 It was enacted on November 3, 1839 through an imperial decree given by Mustafa Reşid Pasa called the “Rose Chamber Edict.” This period demonstrated the Empire's increased efforts towards Westernization and acceptance by the Concert of Europe,Hanigolu, M. Sukru. A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2008. as well, as Western schools were opened to train bureaucrats for future governmental positions.Weiker, Walter F. \\"The Ottoman Bureaucracy: Modernization and Reform.\\" Administrative Science Quarterly. no. 3 (1968): 451-470 Councils of State, Justice, and Education were all established, as well as provincial councils to represent all religious and social groups residing in the Empire. Fuad hoped that the Tanzimat reforms would, “find salvation for the empire by creating among its peoples the bond of equal citizenship based on Ottoman nationality”. He realized the importance of change and saw it as a necessary evolution that the Ottoman Empire needed to make. However, in his efforts to create an image of a modern Ottoman Empire, Fuad Pasha believed that by giving non-Muslim subjects of the Empire equal rights via the Millet system would “dull their nationalist and separatist tendencies.” He, along with the other three reformers, believed that in order to save the empire, a sense of “Ottomanism” needed to be created. The goal was to create an “Ottoman” nation and unify the Jews, Christians, and Muslims into an Ottoman nationality. The Council of the Tanzimat took complete charge of preparing legislation, and because both Fuad and Ali wanted immediate progress, the Council was made separate from the ministries and the chairman was “given direct access to the sultan,” which represented increasing efforts towards centralization. The old Supreme Council, however, still remained an influential factor as its existence and functions, though de jure limited to judicial matters, caused much confusion. Chairman of the Council of the Tanzimat In 1856, Fuat was given the task of reforming the financial and provincial problems that plagued the Empire and was thus named chairman of the Council of the Tanzimat. These stemmed from “a shortage of trained bureaucrats and inadequacies in tax collection.” Though reforms had been started by Resid in 1841, their initial success was interrupted by the outbreak of the Crimean War. Two years of study resulted in the Provincial Regulation of 1858. The main idea behind the Regulation was concentrating power back into the offices of the provincial governors and spreading the Tanzimat reforms across the entire Empire. It kept the provincial government structure that was already in place, but ensured that the governors of each province were the main source of authority as well as the chief representative of the central government in Istanbul through whom, all communications with the central government were made. In addition to administration councils’ structures being reformed, a Cadastral Department in each province was responsible for registering every male resident, whether they be Muslim or non-Muslim, Ottoman or foreign resident. Each of these residents was issued a “population tax certificate\\" (vergi nüfus tezkeresi) which stated his tax obligation and also served as an identity card.” A new conscription system was also introduced that better reflected the needs and population makeup of each province. Fuat also worked on reforming the financial system of the Empire. These reforms included the introduction of an annual budget system and the budgets of each ministry subject to the scrutiny of the treasury to keep in check with annual revenues. To increase these revenues, the inefficient tax farming system was ended in 1861 with the establishment of the Excise Tax Administration which was separate from the bureaucracy of the Ministry of Finance and replaced the former Customs Administration. Foreign Minister 1858-1860: The Mount Lebanon Crisis Photograph of Fuad Pasha by the Abdullah Frères studio. In 1860, violence broke out in the Mount Lebanon region of modern-day Lebanon between the Maronite and Druze communities over which group would control the region. Ultimately, the Druzes dominated and pillage nearly every Maronite town nearby. Fuad, as the foreign minister was sent to investigate these massacres and carry out the Empire’s foreign policy initiatives. Due to his success at executing the changes of the Tanzimat program, Fuad was sent to Syria and arrived in Beirut on July 17, 1860, armed with extreme power granted to him by the Sultan. He brought in a nationalistic viewpoint that these conflicts were “local sectarian characteristics that Ottoman reform ultimately would discipline.”Makdisi, Ussama. \\"After 1860: Debating Religion, Reform, and Nationalism in the Ottoman Empire.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies. no. 4 (2002): 601-617 He was sent by Sultan Abdulmecid along with the new Western-style army to work with a newly established International Commission (Britain, France, Austria, Russia, and Prussia) to bring stability to the region. Fuad began what some have called a “reign of terror” in which he executed hundreds of the accused pillagers, arrested Druze leaders, and sentenced them to death after a trial in a military court for “failing to protect the Christians”. His rather strict reaction to the Mount Lebanon crisis reflected a push towards modernity and order throughout the Empire, as well as a growing sentiment of nationalism called Osmanlilik, as demonstrated in a statement he gave to the people of Syria in 1861, announcing his return to Istanbul. He referred to the power of the Sultan as a “father-figure” who must be obeyed lest they suffer his merciless punishment, but who also treated all of his subjects with equality, regardless of their religion. This strictness also reflects the Empire's immense desire to prove to its counterparts in Europe that it was fully capable of acting in accordance with modern law, especially considering the deployment of European troops to Syria in July 1860.Pogany, Istvan. \\"Humanitarian Intervention in International Law: The French Intervention in Syria Re-Examined.\\" The International and Comparative Law Quarterly. no. 1 (1986): 182-190 Fuad chaired the aforementioned International Commission, called the Beirut Committee, which established the reorganization of Mount Lebanon in March 1861. In this, Mount Lebanon would remain a subject of the Sublime Porte and would be “ruled by a non-local Christian governor, independent from the governors of Beirut and Damascus.” Fuad worked closely with Great Britain's representative to the Committee, Lord Dufferin, as they both had similar interests in preventing French domination in the region. Though Dufferin spoke critically of the corruption and lack of communication he believed to exist in the Empire, he proposed the creation of a semi-independent Syria with Fuad as a “governor- general” This was due to Dufferin's great respect towards Fuad, whom he described as “tall, handsom, well-versed in French, and of charming manners.” Fuad, however, signed an agreement General de Beaufort, the commander of the French troops, in order to use the French to their advantage in the region. This smooth diplomatic skill was attributed to his sense of humor, and “subtlety and tact of the polished diplomat.” This agreement resulted in the establishment of the Law of the Provinces, of which Fuad was an architect, which created the province of Syria. Grand Vizier, 1861–1863, 1863–1866 In 1861, Sultan Abdülaziz named Fuad as Grand Vizier, replacing his colleague Mehmed Emin Aali Pasha. Abdülaziz preferred Fuad's quick and decisive manner, though he did not grant Fuad the same sort of independence and autonomy that Mehmed Emin Aali had enjoyed under Sultan Abdülmecid, which Fuad sought. Fuad was appointed to two full terms as Grand Vizier, though he resigned in 1866 because of his opposition to Abdülaziz's plan to marry Isma'il Pasha's (the Khedive of Egypt) daughter. Later career and death Foreign Minister, 1867–1869 Sultan Abdülaziz reappointed Fuad to his final term as foreign minister, due to French and British insistence during revolts in Crete and the threat of Russian intervention. As Foreign Minister, he wrote a political testament with advice to the Sultan regarding an alliance with Great Britain and France based on shared interests and a common enemy of Russia. Fuad demonstrated understanding of Russian expansion and confessed that, “I too would have turned the world upside-down to capture Istanbul.” He called for the modernization of the Empire to gain legitimacy in France's eyes in order to strengthen these alliances against Russia. He considered Great Britain as the Empire's most important ally and stated, “the English people...will always be the first to have our alliance and we will hold fast to that alliance to the last” and that “we should relinquish several of our provinces rather than see England abandon us” Regarding France, the Empire should maintain polite relations in order to prevent conflict, rather than hope for protection. Death, 1869 Mehmed Emin Aali Pasha was also reappointed as Grand Vizier and went to Crete from 1867 to 1868. While Mehmed Emin Aali was successfully ending the revolt, Fuad was acting Grand Vizier and Foreign Minister, and accompanied Sultan Abdülaziz on a trip through Europe in the summer of 1867. The double burden put considerable strain on Fuad, however, and he sought medical attention and rest in France. He died in Nice on February 12, 1869.  Family  His only Son Major Kazim Bey married Gülbiz Ikbal Khanum, a former Circassian Slave and got the son General H.E. Izzat Fuad Pasha. His Grandson General H.E. Izzat Fuad Pasha married with the Egyptian Princess H.H. Princess Aziza Amina Khanum Effendi, a daughter of Prince Mustafa Fazl Pasha and got a son and a daughter. The daughter named Nimat Khanum (b.1879 - d. 28 November 1919). She married Akil Yusri Bey, son of Ismail Yusri Pasha and Asya Khanum a daughter of Ahmed Shukri Yeghen Pasha.

Recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales, and released on the Creation label in May 1996, it was positively received by critics, who felt it was an eclectic if inconsistent mix of psychedelic music and glam rock, and was included in Q Magazine's list of recordings of the year. It has retained a modest respect among some critics; it was listed in Q's \\"Best British Albums Ever\\" in July 2004, and is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. It contains two top 20 hits in \\"If You Don't Want Me to Destroy You\\" and \\"Something 4 the Weekend\\"; it also contains the singles \\"God! Show Me Magic\\" and \\"Hometown Unicorn\\". It reached number 23 in the UK Albums Chart on release. Recording In a 2008 interview with Uncut Gruff Rhys described the process of making the album: Although the album was conceived as a reaction to Britpop which the band felt represented a \\"conservative backwards movement in music\\" they soon realised that they were in an \\"old 70's studio making [a] 70's rock album\\". Former members Rhys Ifans and Dic Ben contributed to the track \\"Long Gone\\" by leaving an answerphone message which plays as the song comes to a close. The album cover is a montage of photos of Welsh-born drug smuggler Howard Marks, the subject of the song \\"Hangin' with Howard Marks\\". Marks visited Rockfield during the making of the album at the band's request. Reception Reviewing Fuzzy Logic in 1996 for NME, Simon Williams commented that debut albums \\"rarely come as multi-layered, as lovingly-manipulated as this\\". A rave review in Alternative Press praised the album as \\"the stuff of which fearless dreams are forged\\". Jon Wiederhorn of Rolling Stone felt it was \\"rich in hallucinogenic spirit and shimmering guitars\\" and invoked the spirit of early 1970s pop music. James Delingpole in a January 1997 review in The Daily Telegraph wrote the band had produced a \\"strange mix of Bowie-esque glam rock, school-of-Syd-Barrett psychedelia and DIY kitsch\\", which resulted in a \\"delightfully skewed\\" album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic later commented that on Fuzzy Logic, the band combined psychedelia and art rock with pop melodies in an \\"intoxicating\\" manner, and that despite not being fully cohesive as an album, \\"the individual pleasures of each song become more apparent with each listen\\". Fuzzy Logic was named the third best album of 1996 by Melody Maker and fourth best by NME. The album was also included in Q magazine's list of recordings of the year. Fuzzy Logic reached number 23 in the UK Albums Chart on release. Legacy In a June 2005 Pitchfork review of the 2005 reissue, Marc Hogan felt the album was a good introduction to the band's \\"candy-factory chameleon act\\" with music styles including \\"synth-laced punk-pop\\", \\"slanted pop\\" and \\"Pipers-era Floyd\\", despite its inconsistency. Rod Stanley in the 2005 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die felt that the band would go on to record better albums, but that the inventiveness of the album's blend of \\"Sixties pop, punk rock, and psychedelia, with an underlying Nineties dance sensibility\\", made it both joyful and exciting. Reviewing the album in 2016, Uncuts John Lewis wrote that its \\"quizzical\\" lyrics and influences from \\"1970s guilty pleasures\\" set Super Furry Animals apart from their contemporaries in the 1990s Britpop scene. In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked Fuzzy Logic at number 74 on his list of \\"The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties\\" for Freaky Trigger. Fuzzy Logic was listed at number 42 in Qs 2004 list of the \\"50 Best British Albums Ever\\". In 2017, Pitchfork ranked the album at number 27 on its list of the 50 best Britpop albums.

It was broadcast in full on the radio program Disengage in 2002, but has never been officially re-released.

The original speech was spoken by Lisa DeLeeuw, while the Music Has the Right to Children version was re-recorded by a voice actor — this may have been due to DeLeeuw's alleged death from AIDS in 1993 (she was, in fact, still alive).

Augustinism Certain theological traditions within the Christian Church can be described as more heavily Christocentric. Notably, the teachings of Augustine of Hippo and Paul of Tarsus, which have been very influential in the West, place a great emphasis on the person of Jesus in the process of salvation. For instance, in Reformation theology, the Lutheran tradition is seen as more theologically Christocentric, as it places its doctrine of justification by grace, which is primarily a Christological doctrine, at the center of its thought. Meanwhile, the Calvinist/Reformed tradition is seen as more theologically theocentric, as it places its doctrine of the sovereignty of God (\\"the Father\\") at the center. John Paul II John Paul II's magisterium has been called Christocentric by Roman Catholic theologians. Christocentrism He further taught that the Marian devotions of the Rosary were in fact Christocentric because they brought the faithful to Jesus through Mary. Rosary and Christ Biblical hermeneutics The christocentric principle is also commonly used for biblical hermeneutics. Interfaith and ecumenism Christocentrism is also a name given to a particular approach in interfaith and ecumenical dialogue. It teaches that Christianity is absolutely true, but the elements of truth in other religions are always in relation to the fullness of truth found in Christianity. The Holy Spirit is thought to allow inter-religious dialogue and to influence non-believers in their journey to Christ.

One is on the western side, with the line running in a northerly direction via Basingstoke, Woking and Clapham Junction, towards the terminal at Waterloo. The other is on the eastern side, with the line running in a southerly direction, towards Eastleigh, where it splits and runs towards Southampton Central, Bournemouth and or . History The station was opened on 10 June 1839 by the London and Southampton Railway (later the London and South Western Railway). It became a temporary terminus for the Winchester to Southampton section. On the same day, another station was opened at Basingstoke, which was a temporary terminus of the London to Basingstoke section. The following year, a line was built joining Winchester and Basingstoke and the line was complete. This line was the trickiest to construct and had four tunnels and a single station called Andover Road (now Micheldever), rather optimistically given that Andover lay west. Winchester became a through station on 30 March 1840. As the line bypassed Kingston upon Thames, Winchester was the only major settlement on the line between London and Southampton. Since the original Southampton line ran via the then small market town of Basingstoke (where lines to the west would be built), it was not very direct. Another line was constructed to run via Guildford, Farnham and Alton, which joined the main line north of Winchester. The present day line runs via Aldershot instead of Guildford, and the line finishes at Alton. British Rail closed the line from Alton to Winchester in 1973 but a section from Alton to Alresford is preserved as the Watercress Line. The final gap from Alresford to Winchester is unlikely ever to be reinstated owing to housing having been built on the trackbed. Unique SR locomotive at the station in 1947 Later, the Great Western Railway built the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway. This passed at a separate station on the eastern side of Winchester, when opened called Winchester Cheesehill, later '. In 1949, it was renamed Winchester Chesil, whilst Winchester's main station was renamed Winchester City. This did not last long: In 1966 Chesil closed and an alternative diversionary route to Oxford, Birmingham and beyond, bypassing Basingstoke and Reading, was consequently lost. The following year British Rail changed the station name from Winchester City to Winchester. Renovations in summer 2004 gave the western side a refurbished entrance and second ticket office; albeit with shorter opening hours than that on the eastern side. In summer 2009, both platforms received ticket barriers with CCTV, with the entrance to platform 2 from the forecourt reorganised as part of South West Trains' plan to fit or refit ticket barriers on the busiest stations on the network. In July 2013, A brand new footbridge was constructed between the platforms and also features lifts. Accidents and incidents *In 1937, a boat train caught fire due to an electrical defect in one of the carriages. Four carriages were destroyed. Goods yard and motive power depot A small engine shed was built by the Southern Railway in 1927. This housed a shunting locomotive which worked in the local goods yard. It was closed, together with the goods yard, in 1963. There were formerly extensive sidings on both sides of the station and a coal yard, all now largely converted to car parks. On the eastern side, in the area now occupied by retail units, there was a cattle dock for livestock arriving by rail for the adjacent Winchester Cattle Market in Andover Road. Services The station at night: a CrossCountry service to York passing a South West Trains service to Weymouth South Western Railway provide regular and frequent services to and from London Waterloo, with the fastest taking 61 minutes. Southbound, there are two trains per hour to Weymouth, one to Portsmouth Harbour and an additional stopping service to Poole each hour (Mon-Sat). CrossCountry services between and Manchester Piccadilly via Reading and Birmingham New Street also call hourly each way, along with a number of Southampton to Newcastle via trains. There was a rail-bus link operated on behalf of South West Trains. This was known as the Romsey Rail-Link service and followed the same route as the X66, linking the station with Romsey via Hursley and Ampfield but with limited stops. Guards were equipped with rail ticket machines and were able to issue tickets for the entire rail network as well as weekly season tickets, thereby saving passengers the necessity of queuing at the station ticket office. The service ceased on 28 July 2008 when South West Trains withdrew its subsidy, citing lack of use, despite a protest group having formed and collecting a petition of over 1,000 signatures to oppose the closure. As part of the superseded X66 timetable, Stagecoach continue to operate two of the early morning peak services which were well used alongside the existing hourly services (now half-hourly on weekdays) but without the facility to purchase rail tickets on the buses. The route (now known simply as Route 66) has been extended with variants through the day, and increased journey times, to serve Romsey's outlying housing estates at Woodley, Cupernham and Abbotswood.Stagecoach timetable 66 Winchester: stagecoachsouth.com.

The party was founded by Lakshmi Parvathi, the widow of the film star and Telugu Desam Party politician N.T. Rama Rao. Parvathi formed the party after the internal coup in which NTR's son-in-law Chandrababu Naidu took control over TDP in 1995. Initially NTRTDP(LP) appeared to be able to challenge the TDP of Naidu. In the 1996 Lok Sabha elections NTRTDP(LP) launched candidates in all 42 constituencies in Andhra Pradesh. It won 3,249,267 votes (10.66% of the votes in the state and 0.97% of the vote in the nation as a whole). However, it could not win a single seat. In 1998, the party had the backing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). NTRTDP (LP) nominated five candidates, who together got 384,211 votes (1.2% of the votes in the state). In the Srikakulam (Assembly Constituency) the party candidate got more than 30% of the votes. After the 1998 elections, NTRTDP(LP) declined rapidly and many leaders left the party. BJP became an ally of the arch-enemy Naidu. In the 1999 Lok Sabha elections NTRTDP(LP) launched 13 candidates, who together mustered 61635 votes (0,18% of the votes in the state). In the state assembly elections the same year NTRTDP(LP) nominated 71 candidate, but who together only got 53,259 votes (0,65% of the votes in total). In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections the party only launched a single candidate, Sivanatha Reddy Chadipiralla in Cuddahpah. Reddy only received 759 votes (0,09% of the votes in that constituency). In the state assembly elections that were held simultaneously NTRTDP(LP) had launched 18 candidates, unsuccessfully. Lakshmi Parvathi herself only got 946 votes in the Atmakur constituency. However, in spite of the fact that the electoral result was a failure for the party, Parvathi was very satisfied with the result since Naidu's TDP had been ousted. Only after Naidu's humiliating defeat she let spread the ashes of her husband at Haridwar, eight years after his death. Lakshmi Parvathi is the NTRTDP(LP) president.

This includes aspects of the outward appearance (shape, structure, colour, pattern, size), i.e. external morphology (or eidonomy), as well as the form and structure of the internal parts like bones and organs, i.e. internal morphology (or anatomy). This is in contrast to physiology, which deals primarily with function. Morphology is a branch of life science dealing with the study of gross structure of an organism or taxon and its component parts.  History  The etymology of the word \\"morphology\\" is from the Ancient Greek (), meaning \\"form\\", and (), meaning \\"word, study, research\\". While the concept of form in biology, opposed to function, dates back to Aristotle (see Aristotle's biology), the field of morphology was developed by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1790) and independently by the German anatomist and physiologist Karl Friedrich Burdach (1800). Among other important theorists of morphology are Lorenz Oken, Georges Cuvier, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Richard Owen, Karl Gegenbaur and Ernst Haeckel.Richards, R. J. (2008).

From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith. Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht. In 1830, Cuvier and E.G.Saint-Hilaire engaged in a famous debate, which is said to exemplify the two major deviations in biological thinking at the time – whether animal structure was due to function or evolution.Appel, Toby (1987). The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate: French Biology in the Decades Before Darwin. New York: Oxford University Press.  Divisions of morphology  * Comparative morphology is analysis of the patterns of the locus of structures within the body plan of an organism, and forms the basis of taxonomical categorization. * Functional morphology is the study of the relationship between the structure and function of morphological features. * Experimental morphology is the study of the effects of external factors upon the morphology of organisms under experimental conditions, such as the effect of genetic mutation. * Anatomy is a \\"branch of morphology that deals with the structure of organisms\\". * Molecular morphology is a rarely used term, usually referring to the superstructure of polymers such as fiber formation or to larger composite assemblies. The term is commonly not applied to the spatial structure of individual molecules. * Gross morphology refers to the collective structures of an organism as a whole as a general description of the form and structure of an organism, taking into account all of its structures without specifying an individual structure.  Morphology and classification  Most taxa differ morphologically from other taxa. Typically, closely related taxa differ much less than more distantly related ones, but there are exceptions to this. Cryptic species are species which look very similar, or perhaps even outwardly identical, but are reproductively isolated. Conversely, sometimes unrelated taxa acquire a similar appearance as a result of convergent evolution or even mimicry. In addition, there can be morphological differences within a species, such as in Apoica flavissima where queens are significantly smaller than workers. A further problem with relying on morphological data is that what may appear, morphologically speaking, to be two distinct species, may in fact be shown by DNA analysis to be a single species. The significance of these differences can be examined through the use of allometric engineering in which one or both species are manipulated to phenocopy the other species. A step relevant to the evaluation of morphology between traits/features within species, includes an assessment of the terms: homology and homoplasy. Homology between features indicate that those features have been derived from a common ancestor. Alternatively, homoplasy between features describes those that can resemble each other, but derive independently via parallel or convergent evolution. 3D cell morphology: classification Invention and development of microscopy enable the observation of 3-D cell morphology with both high spatial and temporal resolution.

Marxist feminism analyzes the ways in which women are exploited through capitalism and the individual ownership of private property. According to Marxist feminists, women's liberation can only be achieved by dismantling the capitalist systems in which they contend much of women's labor is uncompensated. Marxist feminists extend traditional Marxist analysis by applying it to unpaid domestic labor and sex relations. Because of its foundation in historical materialism, Marxist feminism is similar to socialist feminism and, to a greater degree, materialist feminism. The latter two place greater emphasis on what they consider the \\"reductionist limitations\\" of Marxist theory but, as Martha E. Gimenez notes in her exploration of the differences between Marxist and materialist feminism, \\"clear lines of theoretical demarcation between and within these two umbrella terms are somewhat difficult to establish.\\"  Theoretical background in Marxism  Marxism follows the development of oppression and class division in the evolution of human society through the development and organization of wealth and production, and concludes the evolution of oppressive societal structure to be relative to the evolution of oppressive family structures, i.e., the normalization of oppressing the female sex marks or coincides to the birth of oppressive society in general. In The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State (1884), Friedrich Engels writes about the earliest origins of the family structure, social hierarchy, and the concept of wealth, drawing from both ancient and contemporary study. He concludes that women originally had a higher social status and equal consideration in labor, and particularly, only women were sure to share a family name. As the earliest men did not even share the family name, Engels says, they did not know for sure who their children were or benefit from inheritance. When agriculture first became abundant and the abundance was considered male wealth, as it was sourced from the male work environment away from the home, a deeper wish for male lineage and inheritance was founded. To achieve that wish, women were not only granted their long-sought monogamy but forced into it as part of domestic servitude, while males pursued a hushed culture of \\"hetaerism\\". Engels describes this situation as coincidental to the beginnings of forced servitude as a dominant feature of society, leading eventually to a European culture of class oppression, where the children of the poor were expected to be servants of the rich. Engels rewrites a quote in this book, by himself and Marx from 1846, \\"The first division of labor is that between man and woman for the propagation of children\\", to say, \\"The first class opposition that appears in history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamous marriage, and the first class oppression coincides with that of the female sex by the male.\\" Gender oppression is reproduced culturally and maintained through institutionalized inequality. By privileging men at the expense of women and refusing to acknowledge traditional domestic labor as equally valuable, the working-class man is socialized into an oppressive structure which marginalizes the working-class woman.  Productive, unproductive, and reproductive labor  Marx categorized labor into two categories: productive and unproductive. *Productive labor is labor that creates surplus value, e.g. production of raw materials and manufacturing products. *Unproductive labor does not create surplus value and may in fact be subsidized by it. This can include supervisory duties, bookkeeping, marketing, etc. Marxist feminist authors in the 1970s, such as Margaret Benston and Peggy Morton, relied heavily on analysis of productive and unproductive labor in an attempt to shift the perception of the time that consumption was the purpose of a family, presenting arguments for a state-paid wage to homemakers, and a cultural perception of the family as a productive entity. In capitalism, the work of maintaining a family has little material value, as it produces no marketable products. In Marxism, the maintenance of a family is productive, as it has a service value, and is used in the same sense as a commodity.  Wages for Housework  Focusing on exclusion from productive labor as the most important source of female oppression, some Marxist feminists advocated for the inclusion of domestic work within the waged capitalist economy. The idea of compensating reproductive labor was present in the writing of socialists such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1898) who argued that women's oppression stemmed from being forced into the private sphere. Gilman argued that conditions for women would improve when their work was located, recognized, and valued in the public sphere. Perhaps the most influential effort to compensate reproductive labor was the International Wages for Housework Campaign, an organization launched in Italy in 1972 by members of the International Feminist Collective. Many of these women, including Selma James, Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Brigitte Galtier, and Silvia Federici published a range of sources to promote their message in academic and public domains. Despite beginning as a small group of women in Italy, the Wages for Housework Campaign was successful in mobilizing on an international level. A Wages for Housework group was founded in Brooklyn, New York with the help of Federici. As Heidi Hartmann acknowledges (1981), the efforts of these movements, though ultimately unsuccessful, generated important discourse regarding the value of housework and its relation to the economy.  Domestic Slavery  Many Marxist feminist scholars, in the vein of an analyzing modes of oppression at the site of production, note the effect that housework has on women in a capitalist system. In Angela Davis' Women, Race and Class, the concept of housework is to deconstruct the capitalist construct of gendered labor within the home and to show the ways in which women are exploited through \\"domestic slavery.\\" To address this, Davis concludes that the \\"socialisation of housework – including meal preparation and child care – presupposes an end to the profit-motive’s reign over the economy.\\" In this manner, domestic slavery upholds the structural inequities faced by women in all capitalist economies. Other Marxist feminist have noted the concept of domestic work for women internationally and the role it plays in buttressing global patriarchy. In Paresh Chattopadhyay's response to Custer's Capital Accumulation and Women's Labor in Asian Economies, Chattopadhyay notes the ways in which Custer analyzes \\"women's labor in the garments industry in West Bengal and Bangladesh as well as in Bangladesh's agricultural sector, labor management methods of the Japanese industrial bourgeoisie and, finally, the mode of employment of the women laborers in Japanese industry\\" in demonstrating the ways in which the domestic sphere exhibits similar gender-based exploitation of difference. In both works, the gendered division of labor, specifically within the domestic sphere, is shown to illustrate the methods the capitalist system exploits women globally.  Responsibility of reproductive labor  Another solution proposed by Marxist feminists is to liberate women from their forced connection to reproductive labor. In her critique of traditional Marxist feminist movements such as the Wages for Housework Campaign, Heidi Hartmann (1981) argues that these efforts \\"take as their question the relationship of women to the economic system, rather than that of women to men, apparently assuming the latter will be explained in their discussion of the former.\\" Hartmann believes that traditional discourse has ignored the importance of women's oppression as women, and instead focused on women's oppression as members of the capitalist system. Similarly, Gayle Rubin, who has written on a range of subjects including sadomasochism, prostitution, pornography, and lesbian literature, first rose to prominence through her 1975 essay The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex, in which she coins the phrase \\"sex/gender system\\" and criticizes Marxism for what she claims is its incomplete analysis of sexism under capitalism, without dismissing or dismantling Marxist fundamentals in the process. More recently, many Marxist feminists have shifted their focus to the ways in which women are now potentially in worse conditions as a result of gaining access to productive labor. Nancy Folbre proposes that feminist movements begin to focus on women's subordinate status to men both in the reproductive (private) sphere, as well as in the workplace (public sphere). In an interview in 2013, Silvia Federici urges feminist movements to consider the fact that many women are now forced into productive and reproductive labor, resulting in a double day. Federici argues that the emancipation of women cannot occur until they are free from the burden of unwaged labor, which she proposes will involve institutional changes such as closing the wage gap and implementing child care programs in the workplace. Federici's suggestions are echoed in a similar interview with Selma James (2012) and have even been touched on in recent presidential elections.  Affective and emotional labor  Scholars and sociologists such as Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, Arlie Russell Hochschild and Shiloh Whitney discuss a new form of labor that transcends the traditional spheres of labor and which does not create product, or is byproductive. Affective labor focuses on the blurred lines between personal life and economic life. Whitney states, \\"The daily struggle of unemployed persons and the domestic toil of housewives no less than the waged worker are thus part of the production and reproduction of social life, and of the biopolitical growth of capital that valorizes information and subjectivities.\\" The concept of emotional labor, particularly the emotional labor that is present and required in pink collar jobs, was introduced by Arlie Russell Hochschild in her book The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling (1983) in which she considers the affective labor of the profession as flight attendants smile, exchange pleasantries and banter with customers.  Intersectionality and Marxist feminism  With the emergence of intersectionality as a widely popular theory of current feminism, Marxist feminists remain critical of its reliance on bourgeois identity politics. Intersectionality operates in Marxist feminism as a lens to view the interaction of different aspects of identity as a result of structured, systematic oppression.  Accomplishments and activism  The nature of Marxist feminists and their ability to mobilize to promote social change has enabled them to engage in important activism. As activist, Marxist feminists insist \\"on developing politics that put women’s oppression and liberation, class politics, anti-imperialism, antiracism, and issues of gender identity and sexuality together at the heart of the agenda.\\" Though their advocacy often receives criticism, Marxist feminists challenge capitalism in ways that facilitate new discourse and shed light on the status of women. These women throughout history have used a range of approaches in fighting hegemonic capitalism, which reflect their different views on the optimal method of achieving liberation for women.  Marxist feminist critiques of other branches of feminism  Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai were opposed to forms of feminism that reinforce class status. They did not see a true possibility to unite across economic inequality because they argue that it would be extremely difficult for an upper-class woman to truly understand the struggles of the working class. For instance, Kollontai wrote in 1909: > For what reason, then, should the woman worker seek a union with the > bourgeois feminists? Who, in actual fact, would stand to gain in the event > of such an alliance? Certainly not the woman worker. Kollontai avoided associating herself with the term \\"feminism\\" as she deemed the term to be too closely related to that of the buorgeois feminism that shut out the capability of other classes to benefit from the term. Critics like Kollontai believed liberal feminism would undermine the efforts of Marxism to improve conditions for the working class. Marxists supported the more radical political program of liberating women through socialist revolution, with a special emphasis on work among women and in materially changing their conditions after the revolution. Additional liberation methods supported by Marxist feminists include radical \\"Utopian Demands\\", coined by Maria Mies. This indication of the scope of revolution required to promote change states that demanding anything less than complete reform will produce inadequate solutions to long-term issues.

He served as Archbishop of Washington from 1980 to 2000, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1988. Early life and ministry James Hickey was born in Midland, Michigan, to James and Agnes (née Ryan) Hickey; he had an older sister, Marie. His father was a dentist who, during the Great Depression, treated patients who could not pay for their dental care. At age 13, he entered St. Joseph Minor Seminary in Grand Rapids. He graduated as valedictorian from Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit in 1942, also providing pastoral care to migrant workers during his studies. He then attended The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Hickey was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop William Murphy on June 15, 1946. He then served as an associate pastor at St. Joseph's Church in Saginaw until 1947, whence he went to Rome to further his studies. He earned a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Lateran University in 1950, and a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in 1951. Upon returning to the United States, he served as secretary to Bishop Stephen Stanislaus Woznicki from 1951 to 1966. He was also the founding rector of St. Paul Seminary, which was later closed in 1970. From 1962 to 1965, he attended the Second Vatican Council as a peritus for Bishop Woznicki. He was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on October 31, 1963. Episcopal career On February 18, 1967, Hickey was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Saginaw and Titular Bishop of Taraqua by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 14 from Archbishop John Francis Dearden, with Bishops Woznicki and Stephen Aloysius Leven serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. Mary. He selected as his episcopal motto: Veritatem In Caritate, meaning, \\"Truth in Charity\\" (). Hickey served as Chairman of Priestly Formation within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops from 1968 to 1969. In March 1969, he became rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, where he would oversee the formation of American seminarians for the next five years. Bishop of Cleveland Hickey was later named the eighth Bishop of Cleveland, Ohio, on May 31, 1974. Replacing Bishop Clarence George Issenmann, he was formally installed on July 16 of that year. During his tenure in Cleveland, he was a leading advocate of racial unity and became active in justice issues involving El Salvador. In 1980, he traveled to El Salvador to attend the funeral of the slain Archbishop Óscar Romero. Sister Dorothy Kazel and Jean Donovan, two women whom Hickey had commissioned to serve as missionaries in El Salvador were later murdered; he kept their photographs on the wall of his private chapel for the rest of his life. Archbishop of Washington Pope John Paul II promoted Hickey to Archbishop of Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1980. During the 1980s, he lobbied members of the United States Congress to stop sending aid to the Contras in Nicaragua, and pushed his fellow bishops to take strong stands against increased military spending and in favor of nuclear disarmament. He was one of the first American bishops to address the issue of sexual abuse by clergy, which would become a nationwide scandal in 2002. During the Salvadoran Civil War, Hickey opposed the Reagan administration's support for the military government of El Salvador. In 1981, the Archbishop told the House Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs: \\"Our position is to oppose military aid and intervention from all outside powers.\\" He feared a Communist takeover in El Salvador but opposed sending military assistance, believing such weapons would strengthen repressive elements in security forces. In 1983, he was dispatched by John Paul II on an apostolic visitation to investigate liturgical abuses in the Archdiocese of Seattle, then led by Raymond Hunthausen. Commenting on the visitation, Hickey said, \\"It wasn't easy, you know.\\" John Paul II created Hickey Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria Madre del Redentore a Tor Bella Monaca in the consistory of June 28, 1988. Hickey was, at that point, one of thirteen Americans in the College of Cardinals. That same year, he was invited to lead a retreat for the pope and his household. Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, he served as Chairman of the Committee on Doctrine (1979–81), of the Committee on Human Values (1984–1987), and of the Committee on the Pontifical North American College (1989–1991; 1994–1997). His tenure in Washington oversaw a significant expansion of Catholic Charities, which became the region's largest private social service agency, and the establishment of the Archdiocesan Health Care Network; Archdiocesan Legal Network, which provide millions of dollars in pro bono care for the region's low income residents; Birthing and Care, which provides pre-natal, delivery and post- natal medical care to women in financial need; Faith in the City, an initiative designed to revitalize inner-city Catholic schools; Victory Housing, which develops assisted and independent living for senior citizens. In conjunction with Mother Teresa, the Archbishop also founded a Washington convent of the Missionaries of Charity for the care of the homeless and terminally ill. He once declared, \\"We serve the homeless not because they are Catholic, but because we are Catholic. If we don't care for the sick, educate the young, care for the homeless, then we cannot call ourselves the church of Jesus Christ.\\" Hickey resigned as archbishop on November 21, 2000, after twenty years of service. Views In addition to his social activism, Hickey was known for his orthodox views regarding Church doctrine. Gay ministries He ordered New Ways Ministry, an unapproved ministry for gay and lesbian Catholics which rejects the Church's teaching on homosexuality, to cease operations in the Washington archdiocese in the early 1980s, and forced Georgetown University to stop Dignity, another organization for gays and lesbians, from having Masses on the campus in 1987. Liturgical abuses He also complained about liturgical abuses at Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown, even sending auxiliary bishop William E. Lori to investigate the Jesuit-run parish.Hartford Courant: \\"Bishop \`Law And Order' Lori Takes The Point\\" November 13, 2002 Contraception and abortion He halted archdiocesan funding for a crisis pregnancy center in College Park, MD after it declined to stop dispensing contraceptives. Dissident clergy As chancellor of The Catholic University of America, Hickey handled the ouster of Charles Curran from the university's faculty in 1987. In 1989, he excommunicated the schismatic African American priest, George Augustus Stallings, after the latter abandoned the Catholic Church to form his own religious congregation. HIV/AIDS Hickey and Rev. Michael Peterson, a gay psychiatrist dying from AIDS on whom the Cardinal had relied for advice in treating pedophile priests, wrote a joint letter in 1987 to the American bishops acknowledging Peterson's diagnosis; Hickey wrote, \\"Father Peterson's illness reminds us in a personal way of the terrible human tragedy of AIDS in our midst. His suffering challenges us to reach out with renewed conviction and compassion to those with AIDS and their families and friends.\\" Capital punishment In early 2000, following on the Pope's calls for Catholics to oppose capital punishment, Hickey appealed to Maryland Governor Parris Glendening to commute the death sentence of Eugene Colvin-El. Death Hickey died at the Jeanne Jugan Home of the Little Sisters of the Poor in Washington, D.C., at age 84. Following a funeral Mass at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, he was buried in St. Francis Chapel at St. Matthew's Cathedral. When asked by The Washington Post in 1989 what he would like people to say about him after his death, the Cardinal replied, \\"First, I'd like them to say that he was always loyal to his Church. Second, that he was a friend to Catholic education. And third, if they don't want to say the first two, at least I hope they would chisel on the stone, 'He served the poor.'\\" Quotes *\\"In the years remaining for me, I shall strive to be a caring pastor, a faithful teacher, a loving father and brother and a true servant of the people of God in the District of Columbia and the five counties of Maryland. I am truly honored, very humbled and deeply grateful that our Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, has chosen me to serve as a cardinal of the church.\\" (Said upon his conferment as Cardinal in 1988.) \\"We shelter the homeless, educate those hungry for knowledge, and care for the sick not because they are Catholic, but because we are Catholic. They are Jesus in disguise.\\" See also References External links *Hickey's obituary on the CBC's website *Cardinal Hickey of Washington dies at 84 – Capital News 9 (Albany, N.Y.) *Hickey's death at WTOPNews.com Category:1920 births Category:2004 deaths Category:People from Midland, Michigan Category:American cardinals Category:Sacred Heart Major Seminary alumni Category:Catholic University of America alumni Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Cleveland Category:Archbishops of Washington Category:American religious leaders Category:Participants in the Second Vatican Council Category:Cardinals created by Pope John Paul II Category:Pontifical Lateran University alumni Category:Pontifical North American College alumni Category:Pontifical North American College rectors Category:Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas alumni Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Catholics from Michigan ","title":"James Aloysius Hickey"},{"id":"1099382","text":"is a Japanese anime director. Some of his works include being an animator in the Akira film; shorts in Robot Carnival, Short Peace, and The Animatrix; and key animation in anime such as Kiki's Delivery Service, City Hunter, and Fist of the North Star. He is the co-founder of Studio 4°C. Biography Born in Wakayama, Japan, he graduated from the Osaka Designers' college in 1979 and a couple of years later joined the studio Annapuru as an animator for the TV series Tomorrow's Joe. While working there, he saw some animation by Takashi Nakamura in Gold Lightan, an otherwise standard mecha TV series by a rival studio. He was impressed, and it inspired him to quit his job and become a freelance animator. Morimoto often collaborated with Nakamura, most notably in Katsuhiro Otomo’s \\"The Order to Stop Construction\\" segment of the anthology film Neo-Tokyo. This opened many doors for him, from working as animation director on Otomo's landmark feature Akira and a chance to direct a short for the Robot Carnival anthology. Around this time he founded Studio 4°C with producer Eiko Tanaka and fellow animator Yoshiharu Sato. Since then, Morimoto has focused almost exclusively on his directing work. His work became increasingly unusual with time. This is best represented by the concert scenes in Macross Plus and his short film Noiseman Sound Insect. Aside from a small cult following, his films have been ignored outside Japan. This has begun to change in recent years, with his artwork being featured in Takashi Murakami's Superflat exhibitions worldwide, the Anime Proto Cut exhibition, and was invited by The Wachowskis to direct \\"Beyond\\", a segment of The Animatrix. He is currently working on Sachiko, his second feature-length film.

He is best known for having invented the hydraulic press. Along with William George Armstrong, he can be considered one of the two fathers of hydraulic engineering. Early life He was the second son in the family of Joseph Bramma (note the different spelling of the surname), a farmer, and his wife, Mary Denton. He was educated at the local school in Silkstone and on leaving school he was apprenticed to a local carpenter. On completing his apprenticeship he moved to London, where he started work as a cabinet-maker. In 1783 he married Mary Lawton of Mapplewell, near Barnsley, and the couple set up home in London. They subsequently had a daughter and four sons. The couple lived first at 124 Piccadilly, but later moved to Eaton Street, Pimlico. Improved water closet In London, Bramah worked for a Mr Allen, installing water closets (toilets) which were designed to a patent obtained by Alexander Cumming in 1775. He found that the current model being installed in London houses had a tendency to freeze in cold weather. Although it was Allen who improved the design by replacing the usual slide valve with a hinged flap that sealed the bottom of the bowl, Bramah obtained the patent for it in 1778, and began making toilets at a workshop in Denmark Street, St Giles. The design was a success and production continued well into the 19th century. His original water closets are still working in Osborne House, Queen Victoria's home on the Isle of Wight. Bramah Locks company After attending some lectures on technical aspects of locks, Bramah designed a lock of his own, receiving a patent for it in 1784. In the same year he started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, which is today based in Fitzrovia, London and Romford, Essex.http://www.bramah.co.uk/ accessed 2 March 2015 The locks produced by his company were famed for their resistance to lock picking and tampering, and the company famously had a \\"Challenge Lock\\" displayed in the window of their London shop from 1790 mounted on a board containing the inscription: The artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock shall receive 200 guineas the moment it is produced. The Great Exhibition 1851 The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the Great Exhibition of 1851, the American locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs' attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days. The Challenge Lock is in the Science Museum in London. An examination of the lock shows that it has been rebuilt since Hobbs picked it. Originally it had 18 iron slides and 1 central spring; it now has 13 steel slides, each with its own spring. Bramah received a second patent for a lock design in 1798. Machine tools A metalworking lathe from 1911 showing component parts Partly due to the precision requirements of his locks, Bramah spent much time developing machine tools to assist manufacturing processes. He relied heavily on the expertise of Henry Maudslay whom he employed in his workshop from the age of 18. Between them they created a number of innovative machines that made the production of Bramah's locks more efficient, and were applicable to other fields of manufacture. Just before Bramah died, his workshops also employed Joseph Clement who among other things made several contributions in the field of lathe design. Hydraulic press Bramah's most important invention was the hydraulic press. The hydraulic press depends on Pascal's principle, that pressure change throughout a closed system is constant. The press had two cylinders and pistons of different cross-sectional areas. If a force was exerted on the smaller piston, this would be translated into a larger force on the larger piston. The difference in the two forces would be proportional to the difference in area of the two pistons. In effect the cylinders act in a similar way that a lever is used to increase the force exerted. Bramah was granted a patent for his hydraulic press in 1795. Bramah's hydraulic press had many industrial applications and still does today. At the time Bramah was bringing his concepts to fruition, the field of hydraulic engineering was an almost unknown science. Bramah and William George Armstrong were the two pioneers in the field. The hydraulic press is still known as the Bramah Press after its inventor. Other inventions Bramah was a very prolific inventor, though not all of his inventions were as important as his hydraulic press. They included: a beer engine (1797), a planing machine (1802), a paper-making machine (1805), a machine for automatically printing bank notes with sequential serial numbers (1806), and a machine for making quill pen nibs (1809). He also patented the first extrusion process for making lead pipes and also machinery for making gun stocks (Patent No. 2652).Blackmore, H. (1986). \\"A Dictionary of London Gunmakers\\" p59 His greatest contribution to engineering was his insistence on quality control. He realised that for engines to succeed, they would have to be machined to a much better standard than was the practice. He taught Arthur Woolf to machine engines to a close tolerance. This enabled Cornish engines to run with high-pressure steam, vastly increasing their output. Woolf became the leading Cornish steam engineer and his designs were adopted by all the engine designers of the day. The 15-HP engines of Watt and others of circa 1800 gave way to 450-HP engines by 1835. Bramah can be viewed as a founding father in industrial quality control. Death One of Bramah's last inventions was a hydrostatic press capable of uprooting trees. This was put to work at Holt Forest in Hampshire. While superintending this work Bramah caught a cold, which developed into pneumonia. He died at Holt Forest on 9 December 1814. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Paddington. In 2006 a pub in Barnsley town centre was opened named the Joseph Bramah in his memory. Patents Bramah was a prolific inventor, and obtained 18 patents for his designs between 1778 and 1812.Skempton (2002), p.70 ; 1778 : Flushing toilet (Pat.

Polypharmacy is most common in the elderly, affecting about 40% of older adults living in their own homes. About 21% of adults with intellectual disability are also exposed to polypharmacy. Polypharmacy is not necessarily ill-advised, but in many instances can lead to negative outcomes or poor treatment effectiveness, often being more harmful than helpful or presenting too much risk for too little benefit. Therefore, health professionals consider it a situation that requires monitoring and review to validate whether all of the medications are still necessary. Concerns about polypharmacy include increased adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, prescribing cascade, and higher costs. Polypharmacy is often associated with a decreased quality of life, including decreased mobility and cognition. The definition of polypharmacy is still debated. Definitions have ranged from two medications at a time to 18, or to more medications than clinically necessary. Five or more concurrent regular medications appears to be the most common definition. Despite the uncertainty around a definition, experts generally agree on the magnitude, potential for harm and potential for reduction in medication regimens for older people. Whether or not the advantages of polypharmacy (over monotherapy) outweigh the disadvantages or risks depends upon the particular combination and diagnosis involved in any given case. The use of multiple drugs, even in fairly straightforward illnesses, is not an indicator of poor treatment and is not necessarily overmedication. Moreover, it is well accepted in pharmacology that it is impossible to accurately predict the side effects or clinical effects of a combination of drugs without studying that particular combination of drugs in test subjects. Knowledge of the pharmacologic profiles of the individual drugs in question does not assure accurate prediction of the side effects of combinations of those drugs; and effects also vary among individuals because of genome-specific pharmacokinetics. Therefore, deciding whether and how to reduce a list of medications (deprescribe) is often not simple and requires the experience and judgment of a practicing physician. However, such thoughtful and wise review is an ideal that too often does not happen, owing to problems such as poorly handled care transitions (poor continuity of care, usually because of siloed information), overworked physicians, and interventionism. Polypharmacy continues to grow in importance because of aging populations. Many countries are experiencing a fast growth of the older population, 65 years and older. This growth is a result of the baby- boomer generation getting older and an increased life expectancy as a result of ongoing improvement in health care services worldwide. Medical uses While polypharmacy is typically regarded as undesirable, prescription of multiple medications can be appropriate and therapeutically beneficial in some circumstances. “Appropriate polypharmacy” is described as prescribing for complex or multiple conditions in such a way that necessary medicines are used according to best evidence to preserve safety and well-being. Polypharmacy is clinically indicated in some conditions, including diabetes mellitus, but should be discontinued when evidence of benefit from the prescribed drugs no longer outweighs potential for harm (described below in Contraindications). Often certain medications can interact with others in a positive way specifically intended when prescribed together, to achieve a greater effect than any of the single agents alone. This is particularly prominent in the field of anesthesia and pain management – where atypical agents such as antiepileptics, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, NMDA antagonists, and other medications are combined with more typical analgesics such as opioids, prostaglandin inhibitors, NSAIDS and others. This practice of pain management drug synergy is known as an analgesia sparing effect. Examples * A perfectly legitimate treatment regimen in the first year after a myocardial infarction could include: a statin, an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, aspirin, paracetamol and an antidepressant. * In anesthesia (particularly IV anesthesia and general anesthesia) multiple agents are almost always required – including hypnotics or analgesic inducing/maintenance agents such as midazolam or propofol, usually an opioid analgesic such as morphine or fentanyl, a paralytic such as vecuronium, and in inhaled general anesthesia generally a halogenated ether anesthetic such as sevoflurane or desflurane. Contraindications The use of polypharmacy is correlated to the use of potentially inappropriate medications. Potentially inappropriate medications are generally taken to mean those that have been agreed upon by expert consensus, such as by the Beers Criteria. These medications are generally inappropriate for older adults because the risks outweigh the benefits. Examples of these include urinary anticholinergics, which can prevent up to one episode of incontinence every 48 hours on average. However, they can also cause constipation, dry eyes, dry mouth, impaired cognition, and increase the risk of falls. Polypharmacy is associated with an increased risk of falls elderly people. Certain medications are well known to be associated with the risk of falls, including cardiovascular and psychoactive medications. There is some evidence that the risk of falls increases cumulatively with the number of medications. Although often not practical to achieve, withdrawing all medicines associated with falls risk can halve an individual's risk of future falls. Every medication has potential adverse side-effects. With every drug added, there is an additive risk of side-effects. Also, many medications have potential interactions with other substances. 15% of older adults are potentially at risk for a major drug-drug interaction. Older adults are at a higher risk for a drug-drug interaction due to the increased number of medications prescribed and metabolic changes that occur with aging. When a new drug is prescribed, the risk of interactions increases exponentially. Doctors and pharmacists aim to avoid prescribing medications that interact; often, adjustments in the dose of medications need to be made to avoid interactions. For example, warfarin interacts with many medications and supplements that can cause it to lose its effect. Special populations Patients at greatest risk for negative polypharmacy consequences include the elderly, psychiatric patients, patients taking five or more drugs concurrently, those with multiple physicians and pharmacies, recently hospitalized patients, individuals with concurrent comorbidities, low educational level, and those with impaired vision or dexterity. It is not uncommon for those dependent or addicted to substances to enter or remain in a state of polypharmacy misuse. Note, however, that the term polypharmacy and its variants generally refer to legal drug use as-prescribed, even when used in a negative or critical context. Measures can be taken to limit polypharmacy to its truly legitimate and appropriate needs. This is an emerging area of research, frequently called deprescribing. This reduction in medications has been shown to reduce the number of medications and is safe as it does not significantly alter health outcomes. Clinical pharmacists can perform drug therapy reviews and teach physicians and their patients about drug safety and polypharmacy, as well as collaborating with physicians and patients to correct polypharmacy problems. Similar programs are likely to reduce the potentially deleterious consequences of polypharmacy. Such programs hinge upon patients and doctors informing pharmacists of other medications being prescribed, as well as herbal, over- the-counter substances and supplements that occasionally interfere with prescription-only medication. 295px Pill burden Pill burden is the number of pills (tablets or capsules, the most common dosage forms) that a patient takes on a regular basis, along with all associated efforts that increase with that number - like storing, organizing, consuming, and understanding the various medications in one's regimen. The use of individual medications is growing faster than pill burden. High pill burden decreases compliance with drug therapy, resulting from the need to take a large quantity of pills or other forms of medication on a regular basis. It also increases the possibility of adverse medication reactions (side effects) and drug-drug interactions. High pill burden has also been associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, medication errors, and increased costs for both the pharmaceuticals themselves and for the treatment of adverse events. Finally, pill burden is a source of dissatisfaction for many patients. High pill burden was once commonly associated with antiretroviral drug regimens to control HIV, but now is more often seen in other patient populations. For instance, adults with multiple common chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, lymphedema, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, and clinical depression can often be prescribed more than a dozen different medications daily. The adverse reactions of these combinations of drugs are not reliably predictable. Obesity is implicated in many of the aforementioned conditions, and it is not uncommon for a clinically obese patient to receive pharmacologic treatment for all of these. Because chronic conditions tend to accumulate in the elderly, pill burden is a particular issue in geriatrics. Reducing pill burden is recognized as a way to improve medication compliance. This is done through \\"deprescribing\\", where the risks and benefits are weighed when considering whether to continue a medication. This includes drugs such as bisphosphonates (for osteoporosis) where it is often used indefinitely although there is only evidence to use it for five to ten years. The use of memory tricks has also been seen to improve adherence and reduce pill burden in several countries. These include associating medications with mealtimes, recording the dosage on the box, storing the medication in a special place, leaving it in plain sight in the living room, or putting the prescription sheet on the refrigerator. The development of applications has also shown some benefit in this regard. The selection of long-acting active ingredients over short-acting ones may also reduce pill burden. For instance, ACE inhibitors are used in the management of hypertension. Both captopril and lisinopril are examples of ACE inhibitors. However, lisinopril is dosed once a day, whereas captopril may be dosed 2-3 times a day. Assuming that there are no contraindications or potential for drug interactions, using lisinopril instead of captopril may be an appropriate way to limit pill burden.  Interventions  The most common intervention in polypharmacy patients is deprescribing, which includes the identification and discontinuance of medications when the benefit no longer outweighs the harm. In elderly patients, this can commonly be done as a patient becomes more frail and treatment focus needs to shift from preventative to palliative. Deprescribing was also deemed feasible and effective in other settings such as residential care, communities and hospitals. This preventative measure should be considered for anyone who exhibits one of the following: (1) a new symptom or adverse event arises, (2) when the person develops an end-stage disease, (3) if the combination of drugs is risky, or (4) if stopping the drug does not alter the disease trajectory. Several tools exist to help physicians decide when to deprescribe and what medications can be added to a pharmaceutical regimen. The Beers Criteria and the STOPP/START criteria help identify medications that have the highest risk of adverse drug events (ADE) and drug- drug interactions. The Medication appropriateness tool for comorbid health conditions during dementia (MATCH-D) is the only tool available specifically for people with dementia, and also cautions against polypharmacy and complex medication regimens. Barriers faced by both physicians and patients have made it challenging to apply deprescribing strategies in practice. For physicians, these include fear of consequences of deprescribing, the prescriber's own confidence in their skills and knowledge to deprescribe, the feasibility of deprescribing, and the complexity of having multiple providers. For patients, attitudes or beliefs about the medications, fears and uncertainties surrounding deprescribing, and influence of physicians, family, and the media are also reported barriers to deprescribing. A team approach is a relatively new method gaining popularity due to its effectiveness in managing patient care and obtaining the best outcomes. A team can include a primary provider, pharmacist, nurse, counselor, physical therapist, chaplain and others involved in patient care. Combining the ideas and points of view of the different providers allows a more holistic approach to the health of a patient. In 2013, the United States legislature mandated that every Medicare D patient receive an annual Medication Therapy Management (MTM) review by a team of healthcare professionals. It is unclear if specific interventions to improve adequate polypharmacy in older adults have significant clinical results; they seem to reduce inappropriate prescribing and medication-related problems in early research, but more research is needed. High quality evidence is needed to make any conclusions about the effects of such interventions in care homes. Deprescribing rounds has been proposed as a potentially successful methodology in reducing polypharmacy.

In a study published in The Lancet van Lommel and colleagues list ten elements of the NDE: #Awareness of being dead. #Positive emotions. #Out of body experience. #Moving through a tunnel. #Communication with light. #Observation of colours. #Observation of a celestial landscape. #Meeting with deceased persons. #Life review. #Presence of border.

Many of the effects are considered to be positive or beneficial. van Lommel and colleagues conducted a longitudinal follow-up research into transformational processes after NDEs and found a long-lasting transformational effect of the experience. However, not all after-effects are beneficial. The literature describes circumstances where changes in attitudes and behavior can lead to distress, psychosocial, or psychospiritual problems.Orne RM. \\"The meaning of survival: the early aftermath of a near-death experience\\".

The research on NDEs often include variables from all three models. In a study published in 1990, Owens, Cook and Stevenson presented results that lent support to all of these three interpretations. Each model contains a number of variables that are often mentioned, or summarized, by commentators: Psychological theories have suggested that the NDE can be a consequence of mental and emotional reactions to the perceived threat of dying, or a result of expectation. Other psychological variables that are considered by researchers include: imagination; depersonalization; dissociation; proneness to fantasy; and the memory of being born. Physiological theories tend to focus on somatic, biological or pharmacological explanations for the NDE, often with an emphasis on the physiology of the brain. Variables that are considered, and often summarized by researchers, include: anoxia; cerebral hypoxia;Parnia S, Spearpoint K, Fenwick PB. \\"Near death experiences, cognitive function and psychological outcomes of surviving cardiac arrest\\". Resuscitation. 2007 Aug;74(2):215–21. hypercarbia; endorphins; serotonin or various neurotransmitters; temporal lobe dysfunction or seizures;Britton W. B., Bootzin R.

TIME Magazine. Friday, Aug. 31, 2007 A third model, sometimes called the transcendental explanation, considers a number of categories, often summarized by commentators, that usually fall outside the scope of physiological or psychological explanations. This explanatory model considers whether the NDE might be related to the existence of an afterlife; a changing state of consciousness; mystical (peak) experiences; or the concept of a mind-body separation. Several researchers in the field, while investigating variables from all three models, have expressed reservations towards explanations that are purely psychological or physiological.Greyson, Bruce. \\"Incidence and correlates of near-death experiences in a cardiac care unit.\\" General Hospital Psychiatry, 25 (2003) 269–276Greyson, Bruce. \\"Implications of near-death experiences for a postmaterialist psychology\\". Psychology of Religion and Spirituality, Vol 2(1), Feb 2010, 37–45. van Lommel and colleagues have argued for the inclusion of transcendental categories as part of the explanatory framework. Other researchers, such as Parnia, Fenwick, and Greyson, have argued for an expanded discussion about the mind-brain relationship and the possibilities of human consciousness. Research – history and background Individual cases of NDEs in literature have been identified into ancient times. In the 19th century a few efforts moved beyond studying individual cases - one privately done by Mormons and one in Switzerland. Up to 2005, 95% of world cultures have been documented making some mention of NDEs. From 1975 to 2005, some 2500 self reported individuals in the US had been reviewed in retrospective studies of the phenomena with an additional 600 outside the US in the West, and 70 in Asia. Prospective studies, reviewing groups of individuals and then finding who had an NDE after some time and costing more to do, had identified 270 individuals. In all close to 3500 individual cases between 1975 and 2005 had been reviewed in one or another study. And all these studies were carried out by some 55 researchers or teams of researchers. Research on near-death experiences is mainly limited to the disciplines of medicine, psychology and psychiatry. Interest in this field of study was originally spurred by the research of such pioneers as Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (psychiatrist) and Raymond Moody (psychologist and M.D.), but also by autobiographical accounts, such as the books of George Ritchie (psychiatrist).Anderson, Jon. \\"Shedding light on life at death's door\\". Chicago Tribune, published online May 13, 2004Slayton, Jeremy. \\"Death Notice: George Gordon Ritchie Jr dies\\". Richmond Times Dispatch, published online Wednesday, October 31, 2007 Kübler-Ross, who was a researcher in the field of Thanatology and a driving force behind the establishment of the Hospice System in the United States, reported on her interviews for the first time in her book \\"On Death and Dying. What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families\\"(1969).Video: Elisabeth Kübler-Ross über Nahtoderfahrungen (1981) , abgerufen am 14.

März 2014.Noble, Holcomb B. \\"Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, 78, Dies; Psychiatrist Revolutionized Care of the Terminally Ill.\\" New York Times, August 26, 2004 Raymond Moody, on the other hand, got interested in the subject at the start of his career. In the mid-seventies, while doing his medical residency as a psychiatrist at the University of Virginia, he conducted interviews with Near- Death Experiencers. He later published these findings in the book Life After Life (1976).Moody Raymond A. (1976). Life after life : the investigation of a phenomenon – survival of bodily death. Harrisburg, Pa. : Stackpole Books. In the book Moody outlines the different elements of the NDE. Features that were picked up by later researchers. The book brought a lot of attention to the topic of NDEs. The late seventies saw the establishment of the Association for the Scientific Study of Near-Death Phenomena, an initial group of academic researchers, including John Audette, Raymond Moody, Bruce Greyson, Kenneth Ring and Michael Sabom, who laid the foundations for the field of Near-death studies, and carried out some of the first post-Moody NDE research.Ring, Kenneth. Religious Wars in the NDE Movement: Some Personal Reflections on Michael Sabom's Light & Death. Journal of Near-Death Studies, 18(4) Summer 2000 The Association was the immediate predecessor of the International Association for Near-death Studies (IANDS), which was founded in the early eighties and which established its headquarters at the University of Connecticut, Storrs.New York Times staff. Connecticut Guide; Near-death Symposium. New York Times, April 25, 1982 This group of researchers, but especially Ring, was responsible for launching Anabiosis, the first peer- reviewed journal within the field. The journal later became Journal of Near- Death Studies. However, even though the above-mentioned profiles introduced the subject of NDEs to the academic setting, the subject was often met with academic disbelief,Bush, Nancy Evans. \\"Is Ten Years a Life Review?\\" Journal of Near-Death Studies, 10(1) Fall 1991 or regarded as taboo. The medical community has been somewhat reluctant to address the phenomenon of NDEs, and grant money for research has been scarce. However, both Ring and Sabom made contributions that were influential for the newly established field. Ring published a book in 1980 called Life at Death: A Scientific Investigation of the Near-Death Experience.Ring, K. (1980a). Life at death: A scientific investigation of the near-death experience. New York, NY: Coward, McCann and Geoghegan. This early research was followed up by new book in 1984 by the title Heading Toward Omega: In Search of the Meaning of the Near-Death Experience.Ring, K. (1984). Heading toward omega: In search of the meaning of the near-death experience.New York, NY: William Morrow. The early work of Michael Sabom was also bringing attention to the topic within the academic community. Besides contributing material to academic journals,Sabom, M. B. The near-death experience. JAMA 1980 Jul 4;244(1):29–30. he wrote a book called Recollections of Death (1982)Sabom, M. (1982). Recollections of death: A medical investigation. New York, NY: Harper and Row. which is considered to be a significant publication in the launching of the field. As research in the field progressed both Greyson and Ring developed measurement tools that can be used in a clinical setting.Ring, Kenneth. (1980) Life at death. A scientific investigation of the near-death experience. New York: Coward McCann and Geoghenan. Greyson has also addressed different aspects of the NDE, such as the psychodynamics of the experience,Greyson, Bruce. \\"The psychodynamics of near-death experiences.\\" Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 1983 Jun;171(6):376–81. the varieties of NDE, the typology of NDEsGreyson B. \\"A typology of near-death experiences.\\" Am J Psychiatry. 1985 Aug;142(8):967-9. and the biology of NDEs.Greyson B. \\"Biological aspects of near-death experiences\\". Perspect Biol Med. 1998 Autumn;42(1):14–32. In addition to this he has brought attention to the near-death experience as a focus of clinical attention, suggesting that the aftermath of the NDE, in some cases, can lead to psychological problems. The 1980s also introduced the research of Melvin Morse, another profile in the field of near-death studies.Maryles, Daisy. Behind the bestsellers. Publishers Weekly. 240.20 (May 17, 1993): p17. From Literature Resource Center. Morse and colleaguesMorse M, Conner D, Tyler D. \\"Near-death experiences in a pediatric population. A preliminary report\\".

American Journal of Diseases of Children, Nov;140(11):1110-4, 1986 investigated near-death experiences in a pediatric population. They found that children reported NDEs that were similar to those described by adults. Morse later published two books, co-authored with Paul Perry, that were aimed at a general audience: Closer to the light: learning from children's near- death experiences (1990)Morse, Melvin (with Paul Perry) (1990) Closer to the light : learning from children's near-death experiences. New York : Villard Books and Transformed by the light: the powerful effect of near-death experiences on people's lives (1992).Morse, Melvin (with Paul Perry) (1990) Transformed by the light : the powerful effect of near-death experiences on people's lives. New York : Villard Books Another early contribution to the field was the research of British Neuro-psychiatrist Peter Fenwick, who started to collect NDE-stories in the 1980s. In 1987 he presented his findings on a television-program, which resulted in more stories being collected.Mensel, Lars. \\"I'm no longer afraid of death\\". Conversation by Lars Mensel with Peter Fenwick. The European, published online 10.03.2013. The responses from Near-death experiencers later served as the basis for a book published in 1997, \\"The Truth in the light\\", co-authored with his wife Elizabeth Fenwick.Fenwick, Peter and Fenwick, Elizabeth (1997). The truth in the light: an investigation of over 300 near-death experiences. New York : Berkley Books Co-operating with other researchers, among others Sam Parnia, Fenwick has also published research on the potential relationship between cardiac arrest and Near-death Experiences. Early investigations into the topic of near-death experiences were also being conducted at the University of Virginia, where Ian Stevenson founded the Division of Personality Studies in the late sixties. The division went on to produce research on a number of phenomena that were not considered to be mainstream. In addition to near-death experiences this included: reincarnation and past lives, out-of-body experiences, apparitions and after-death communications, and deathbed visions.Fox, Margalit. \\"Ian Stevenson Dies at 88; Studied Claims of Past Lives\\". New York Times, February 18, 2007 Stevenson, whose main academic interest was the topic of reincarnation and past lives,Wallis, David. \\"Conversations/Dr. Ian Stevenson; You May Be Reading This In Some Future Past Life\\". New York Times, September 26, 1999Cadoret, Remi J. \\"Book Forum: European Cases of the Reincarnation Type\\". Am J Psychiatry 162:823–824, April 2005 also made contributions to the field of near-death studies.Stevenson I, Cook EW. Involuntary memories during severe physical illness or injury. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. 1995 Jul;183(7):452–8. In a 1990 study, co-authored with Owens & Cook, the researchers studied the medical records of 58 people who believed they had been near death. The authors judged 28 candidates to actually have been close to dying, while 30 candidates, who merely thought they were about to die, were judged to not have been in any medical danger. Both groups reported similar experiences, but the first group reported more features of the core NDE-experience than the other group. Recently, the work of Jeffrey Long has also attracted attention to the topic of NDEs in both the academic, and the popular field.Beck, Melinda. \\"Seeking Proof in Near-Death Claims\\". The Wall Street Journal (Health Journal), October 25, 2010MacDonald, G. Jeffrey. \\"Scientists probe brief brushes with the afterlife\\". The Christian Century, Jan 12, 2011 In 2010 he released a book, co-authored with Paul Perry, called Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of Near-Death Experiences. In the book Long presented results from research conducted over the last decade.Fitzpatrick, Laura. Is There Such a Thing as Life After Death?. TIME magazine, published online Friday, Jan. 22, 2010 Research has also entered into other fields of interest, such as the mental health of military veterans. Goza studied NDEs among combat veterans. She found, among other things, that combat soldiers reported different, and less intense near-death experiences, compared to NDErs in the civilian population.UNT (University of North Texas) News. \\"UNT research produces new findings on combat soldiers' near-death experiences\\".

Doctoral Dissertation, University of North Texas, August 2011 The first decades of Near-death research were characterized by retrospective studies.Greyson, Bruce. An Overview of Near-Death Experiences. Missouri Medicine, November/December 2013 However, the 2000s marked the beginning of prospective studies in the field, both on the European and the American continent. In a study from 2001, conducted at Southampton General Hospital, Parnia and colleagues found that 11.1% of 63 cardiac-arrest survivors reported memories of their unconscious period. Several of these memories included NDE-features. This study was the first in a series of new prospective studies using cardiac arrest criteria, and it was soon to be followed by the study of van Lommel and colleagues, also published in 2001. Pim van Lommel (cardiologist) was one of the first researchers to bring the study of NDEs into the area of Hospital Medicine. In 1988 he launched a prospective study that spanned 10 Dutch hospitals. 344 survivors of cardiac arrest were included in the study. 62 patients (18%) reported NDE. 41 of these patients (12%) described a core experience. The aim of the study was to investigate the cause of the experience, and assess variables connected to frequency, depth, and content. Prospective studies were also taking place in the U.S. Schwaninger and colleaguesSchwaninger J, Eisenberg PR, Schechtman KB, Weiss AN. A Prospective Analysis of Near-Death Experiences in Cardiac Arrest Patients. Journal of Near-Death Studies, 20(4), Summer 2002 collaborated with Barnes-Jewish Hospital, where they studied cardiac arrest patients over a three-year period (April 1991 – February 1994). Only a minority of the patients survived, and from this group 30 patients were interviewable. Of these 30 patients 23% reported an NDE, while 13% reported an NDE during a prior life-threatening illness. Greyson conducted a 30-month survey of patients admitted to the cardiac inpatient service of the University of Virginia Hospital. He found that NDEs were reported by 10% of patients with cardiac arrest and 1% of other cardiac patients. In 2008 the University of Southampton announced the start of a new research-project named The AWARE (AWAreness during REsuscitation) study. The study was launched by the University of Southampton, but included collaboration with medical centres within the UK, mainland Europe and North America. The object of the study was to study the brain, and consciousness, during cardiac arrest, and to test the validity of out of body experiences and reported claims of lucidity (the ability to see and hear) during cardiac arrest.University of Southampton Press Release. \\"World's largest-ever study of near-death experiences\\". 10 September 2008.

The New Republic, published online October 8, 2014 The study found that 9% of patients who completed stage 2 interviews reported experiences compatible with NDEs. Psychometrics Several psychometric instruments have been adapted to near-death research. Ring developed the Weighted Core Experience Index in order to measure the depth of NDEs, and this instrument has been used by other researchers for this purpose.Lester, David. \\"Depth of Near-Death Experiences and Confounding Factors\\". Perceptual and Motor Skills, 2003,96, 18. The instrument has also been used to measure the impact of near- death experiences on dialysis patients.Lai et al. \\"Impact of near-death experiences on dialysis patients: a multicenter collaborative study\\". Am J Kidney Dis. 2007 Jul;50(1):124–32, 132.e1-2. According to some commentators the index has improved consistency in the field. However, Greyson notes that although the index is a pioneering effort, it is not based on statistical analysis, and has not been tested for internal coherence or reliability. In 1984 Ring developed an instrument called the Life Changes Inventory (LCI) in order to quantify value changes following an NDE. The instrument was later revised and standardized and a new version, the LCI-R, was published in 2004.Greyson, Bruce; Ring, Kenneth. \\"The Life Changes Inventory – Revised.\\" Journal of Near-Death Studies, Vol 23(1), 2004, 41–54. Greyson developed The Near-Death Experience Scale. This 16-item Scale was found to have high internal consistency, split-half reliability, and test-retest reliability and was correlated with Ring's Weighted Core Experience Index. Questions formulated by the scale address such dimensions as: cognition (feelings of accelerated thought, or \\"life-review\\"), affect (feelings of peace and joy), paranormal experience (feelings of being outside of the body, or a perception of future events) and transcendence (experience of encountering deceased relatives, or experiencing an unearthly realm). A score of 7 or higher out of a possible 32 was used as the standard criterion for a near-death experience. The scale is, according to the author, clinically useful in differentiating NDEs from organic brain syndromes and nonspecific stress responses. The NDE- scale was later found to fit the Rasch rating scale model.Lange R, Greyson B, Houran J. \\"A Rasch scaling validation of a 'core' near-death experience\\". British Journal of Psychology.

Journal of Near-Death Studies, Vol. 8, Number 2, 103–110 The questionnaire consists of 23 true/false/undecided response items assessing knowledge, 23 Likert scale items assessing general attitudes toward near-death phenomena, and 20 Likert scale items assessing attitude toward caring for a client who has had an NDE.Barnett, Linda. \\"Hospice Nurses' Knowledge and Attitudes Toward the Near- Death Experience\\".

Near death studies community  Research organizations and academic locations  The field of near-death studies includes several communities that study the phenomenology of NDEs. The largest of these communities is IANDS, an international organization based in Durham, North-Carolina, that encourages scientific research and education on the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual nature and ramifications of near-death experiences. Among its publications we find the peer-reviewed Journal of Near-Death Studies, and the quarterly newsletter Vital Signs.IANDS. Near-Death Experiences: Is this what happens when we die? Durham: International Association for Near-Death Studies. Informational brochure REV 4/11. Available at www.iands.org.IANDS: Vital Signs. Accessed 2011-02-06. The organization also maintains an archive of near-death case histories for research and study.IANDS: NDE Archives. Accessed 2011-02-06. Another research organization, the Louisiana-based Near Death Experience Research Foundation, was established by radiation oncologist Jeffrey Long in 1998.Adler, Jerry. \\"Back From the Dead\\". Newsweek, July 23, 2007 The foundation maintains a web-site, also launched in 1998, and a database of more than 1,600 cases, which is currently the world's largest collection of near-death reports. The reports come directly from sources all across the world. A few academic locations have been associated with the activities of the field of near-death studies. Among these we find the University of Connecticut (US), Southampton University (UK), University Of North Texas (US) and the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia (US). Conferences IANDS holds conferences, at regular intervals, on the topic of near-death experiences. The first meeting was a medical seminar at Yale University, New Haven (CT) in 1982. This was followed by the first clinical conference in Pembroke Pines (FL), and the first research conference in Farmington (CT) in 1984. Since then conferences have been held in major U.S. cities, almost annually.\\"IANDS Fact Sheet, As of December, 2010\\". Accessed 2012-02-09.

The Telegraph, published online 22 Oct 2000O'Connor, Anahad. \\"Following a Bright Light to a Calmer Tomorrow\\". New York Times, published online April 13, 2004 According to commentators in the field the early study of Near-death experiences was met with \\"academic disbelief\\". Acceptance of NDEs as a legitimate topic for scientific study has improved, but the process has been slow. According to literature \\"psychiatrists have played a role in the recognition of the \\"near- death\\" phenomenon as well as popularization of the subject and subsequent research\\". Skeptics have remarked that it is difficult to verify many of the anecdotal reports that are being used as background material in order to outline the features of the NDE. Internet Infidels paper editor, and commentator, Keith Augustine has criticized near-death research for oversimplifying the role of culture in afterlife beliefs. He has also exposed weaknesses in methodology, paucity of data, and gaps in arguments. Instead of a transcendental model of NDEs, which he does not find plausible, he suggests that NDEs are products of individuals' minds rather than windows into a transcendental reality.Augustine, K. \\"Psychophysiological and cultural correlates undermining a survivalist interpretation of near-death experiences\\". Journal of Near Death Studies, 26 (2):89–125 (2007).Greyson, Bruce. \\"Commentary on 'Psychophysiological and Cultural Correlates Undermining a Survivalist Interpretation of Near-Death Experiences'\\". Journal of Near- Death Studies, 26(2), Winter 2007 His criticism has been answered by Greyson who suggests that the materialist model favored by Augustine is supported by even fewer data than the \\"mind-brain separation model\\" favored by many researchers within the field of near-death studies. The findings of NDE- research has been contested by several writers in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. Susan Blackmore has contested the findings of NDE-research, and has instead argued in favour of a neurological explanation. Psychologist Christopher FrenchFrench, Christopher. \\"Commentary.\\" The Lancet 358, pp. 2010–11, 2001 has reviewed several of the theories that have originated from the field of Near-death studies. This includes theories that present a challenge to modern neuroscience by suggesting a new understanding of the mind-brain relationship in the direction of transcendental, or paranormal, elements. In reply to this French argues in favour of the conventional scientific understanding, and introduces several non-paranormal factors, as well as psychological theory, that might explain those near-death experiences that defy conventional scientific explanations. However, he does not rule out a future revision of modern neuroscience, awaiting new and improved research procedures. Jason Braithwaite, a Senior Lecturer in Cognitive Neuroscience in the Behavioural Brain Sciences Centre, University of Birmingham, issued an in- depth analysis and critique of the survivalist's neuroscience of some NDE researchers, concluding, \\"it is difficult to see what one could learn from the paranormal survivalist position which sets out assuming the truth of that which it seeks to establish, makes additional and unnecessary assumptions, misrepresents the current state of knowledge from mainstream science, and appears less than comprehensive in its analysis of the available facts.\\"Braithwaite, J. J. \\"Towards a Cognitive Neuroscience of the Dying Brain\\". The Skeptic, Volume 21, Issue 2 (2008). Martens noted the \\"lack of uniform nomenclature\\", and \\"the failure to control the studied population with an elimination of interfering factors\\", as examples of criticism directed towards near-death research. But criticism of the field has also come from commentators within its own ranks. In an open letter to the NDE-community Ring has pointed to the \\"issue of possible religious bias in near-death studies\\". According to Ring the field of near-death studies, as well as the larger NDE- movement, has attracted a variety of religious and spiritual affiliations, from a number of traditions, which makes ideological claims on behalf of NDE- research. In his view this has compromised the integrity of research and discussion.

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 226-7 The music of Birdsongs of the Mesozoic is almost entirely instrumental, and incorporates many different musical elements; critic Rick Anderson writes, \\"Very few bands have ever managed to straddle the worlds of modern classical music and rock as successfully as this one did.\\" In his liner notes for their Beat of the Mesozoic EP, Boston rock critic Eric Van dubbed them \\"the world's hardest-rocking chamber music quartet.\\" Another memorable description came from Jim Sullivan of the Boston Globe: \\"classical-punk-jazz-car-wreck music.\\" Band history Origins Birdsongs owes its origins to the 1978 breakup of the Boston post-punk band Moving Parts, which included Erik Lindgren (vocals, keyboards) and Roger Miller (vocals, guitar). Miller went on to form the seminal post-punk group Mission of Burma (1979–1983; 2002–present), while Lindgren concentrated on production work in his home recording studio. While the Parts' breakup had been civil, Lindgren felt the need for an act of overt reconciliation, and in late 1980, he offered free studio time to his former bandmate should Miller have any non-Burma material he wanted to record. Miller had just written his first solo piano pieces in years, and jumped at the offer. Lindgren volunteered to provide some keyboard overdubs. Given that musical differences had led to the breakup of their earlier band, both musicians were surprised at the effectiveness of the collaboration. Burma tape loop artist Martin Swope was then enlisted for further overdub work on electric guitar. The recording project might have ended there had not Boston's Modern Method record label approached Miller and asked for a Burma track for a compilation album. Miller instead offered \\"Pulse Piece\\" from the sessions, naming the makeshift group \\"Birdsongs of the Mesozoic,\\" a reference to a Birdsongs of America album that Swope had sampled during the sessions and to then-new theories about the dinosaur ancestry of birds (Miller having been a dinosaur aficionado as a young child). The Mesozoic era covered the period of roughly 66 million years ago to 248 million years ago, and is sometimes called the \\"age of dinosaurs.\\" The band created a Pterosaur silhouette as a logo, which they still use as of 2007, in a slightly modified version. Birdsongs established and performs live Nothing further might have come from the project had not Modern Method also asked Miller if Birdsongs could perform at the album's 1981 record release party. For this performance, a lineup was assembled consisting of Miller on piano, Lindgren on synthesizer, Swope on guitar, and Rick Scott on electronic organ, with all members doubling on percussion instruments. Miller and Scott had both previously lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where they had been bandmates in the short-lived Red Ants. While there had been no intention to play more than the one gig, audience response was so strong that further shows were booked. The ensemble became a significant side project for Miller and Swope, and recorded a six-song eponymous EP (virtually the entire repertoire at the time) for Burma's label Ace of Hearts. Birdsongs opened for Burma at least once, and Burma's drummer Peter Prescott contributed to Birdsongs recordings and performances. When Miller's tinnitus worsened in 1982, the existence of Birdsongs as a quieter alternative was a significant factor in Miller's decision to end Mission of Burma in 1983. In fact, he stopped writing Burma material and began writing more aggressive material for Birdsongs, such as \\"Shiny Golden Snakes\\" (which became the lead track of their first full-length album, Magnetic Flip.) After Burma's breakup, Birdsongs became democratized, and Swope, Scott, and especially Lindgren began composing original material. They toured regularly, mostly in the eastern United States and usually at rock music venues. Birdsonds of the Mesozoic opened for bands like Siouxie and the Banshees, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Fall and Prescott's Volcano Suns.See the notes for the 2008 compilation Dawn of the Cyads. Jon Pareles, music critic of The New York Times, gave a positive review to the group's New York City debut, comparing their basic style to the minimalism of Philip Glass delivered with the energy and brevity of rock music: \\"In fact, most of the music is far more eventful, and less repetitious, than the average pop hit single.\\" They did occasional cover songs, which demonstrated the breadth of their influences: Adaptations of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, the theme songs to two animated television shows (Rocky & Bullwinkle and The Simpsons) and two different versions of Brian Eno's \\"Sombre Reptiles\\". After Miller and Swope leave In 1987 Miller left the group he founded to concentrate on his Maximum Electric Piano project, which he had recently begun as a side project to Birdsongs. Miller was replaced by another Ann Arbor expatriate, saxophonist/keyboardist Steve Adams of Your Neighborhood Saxophone Quartet (who had shared many bills with Birdsongs). With Adams on board, Birdsongs music had a new jazz element to their sound. Within six months, however, Adams was offered a position in the Rova Saxophone Quartet, and was replaced by saxophonist/flautist/keyboardist Ken Field. This lineup recorded two albums for Cuneiform Records (the first featuring Adams as well). Swope left in 1993 and was replaced by guitarist Michael Bierylo. This lineup has remained stable to 2009, and has recorded several further albums for Cuneiform. The music of the current lineup has less punk sound and more modern classical and jazz colorings than the original line-up, but their music is still very eclectic. In 2006, Birdsongs released Extreme Spirituals, a collection of traditional American gospel songs and spirituals, with singer Oral Moses.

He lived in Hull for three years before moving with a friend to Wembley in London in 1990. He also lived in Finsbury Park and Golders Green before settling in Lewisham. His first job in London was \\"in accounts with an advertising firm in Goodge Street\\". He took a degree at Goldsmiths College (part of the University of London) in 1994, eventually gaining a first-class BA (hons.) degree in Politics and Economics. He apparently \\"started to work on his PhD until the London Assembly distracted him\\".Knitting Circle Darren Johnson He was also once a \\"paid consultant to Friends of the Earth\\". Political career Johnson joined the Green Party in 1987 at the age of 20 \\"after the Chernobyl Disaster\\", which \\"had a big impact\\" on him. He was Male Principal Speaker of the party in 2002. According to the Knitting Circle (a website with \\"resources on lesbian and gay issues\\"), his campaigning experience includes infiltrating \\"the military base at Aldershot dressed as Ivan the Terrible during an arms fair. He was saluted by the guards as he drove through the gates in a large limousine with tinted windows. He tried to buy arms with Monopoly money\\". London Assembly member In 2000, Johnson was elected to the inaugural London Assembly as part of a three-strong Green Group, including Jenny Jones AM and Victor Anderson (who resigned in March 2003 and was replaced by Noel Lynch for the remainder of the term). The 2004 elections would see the Greens lose the seat held by Lynch, leaving Johnson and Jones as the two remaining members of the Green Group. Both won re- election in the 2008 election, when the Greens held on to their two seats. He served as Deputy Chair of the Assembly 2008-09 and was elected Chair of the Assembly in May 2009. As a London Assembly Member, Johnson was Chair of the Housing Committee and a member of the Business Management and Administration Committee, Budget and Performance Committee and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA). Johnson issued a report on the sustainability measures involved in planning for London's hosting of the Olympics in 2012,“On the Right Track?” Report , Darren Johnson, 2009. and also chaired an inquiry on nuclear waste trains for the London Assembly.Nuclear Waste Trains Investigative Committee Scrutiny Report 2001. He was previously Chair of the Environment Committee (between 2004/9 and 2010/11). The committee produced a number of reports, including investigations into the loss of street trees,“Chainsaw Massacre: A review of London's street trees” Report, Environment Committee, 2007. and the effects of paving over front gardens in the city.“Crazy Paving: The environmental importance of London’s front gardens” Report , Environment Committee, 2005. Along with his long-standing colleague Jenny Jones, he stood down at the 2016 election. Lewisham councillor In the 2002 local elections, Johnson was elected as a councillor for the Brockley ward in the London Borough of Lewisham, the Greens' first councillor in Lewisham, polling 1026 votes and coming top in the ward. He was re-elected in 2006, when the Greens gained a further five seats in Lewisham. He came top of the ward again, polling 1583 votes.Lewisham Council Election Results 2006 In 2010, he was the only Green councillor in Lewisham to be re- elected and served until 2014 when he did not seek re-election. In his time as a councillor, Johnson was successful in getting the council to adopt a Fair Trade policy. He opposed the closure of Ladywell Leisure Centre and put forward alternative sites for a new school. He also successfully campaigned for a new pedestrian crossing on Brockley Road, secured improvements to the traffic calming scheme and managed to halt evictions at St Norberts Allotments.Darren Johnson's Lewisham Green Party Biography In addition, he served as a member of Lewisham 's Housing Select Committee, Sustainable Development Select Committee, Council Urgency Committee, Elections Committee, Licensing (Supplementary) Committee, Licensing Committee, Overview and Scrutiny Committee and Marsha Phoenix Memorial Trust.

His Gribeauval system superseded the de Vallière system. These guns proved essential to French military victories during the Napoleonic Wars. Gribeauval is credited as the earliest known advocate for the interchangeability of gun parts. He is thus one of the principal influences on the later development (over many decades by many people) of interchangeable manufacture.. Early life Jean-Baptiste was born in Amiens, the son of a magistrate. He entered the French royal artillery in 1732 as a volunteer, and became an officer in 1735.Summerfield (2011) SOJ-2, p18 For nearly twenty years regimental duty and scientific work occupied him, and in 1752 he became captain of a company of miners.Summerfield (2011) SOJ-2, p20 In 1755, he was employed in a military mission in Prussia. In 1757, being then a Lieutenant colonel, he was lent to the Austrian army on the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, and established the Austrian sapper corps.Summerfield (2011) SOJ-2, p24-27 He led the sapping operations at the Siege of Glatz and the defence of Schweidnitz.Summerfield (2011) SOJ-2, p27-29 At Schweidnitz, his 1748 design of fortification gun was tested and significantly improved by Master Carpenter Richter.Summerfield (2011) SOJ-2, p37-41 In 1762, he reported back to the Paris authorities on the Austrian artillery system compared with the existing French de Vallière guns.Summerfield (2011) SOJ-2, p27Smith (2011) SOJ-2, p61-65 While with the Austrian army he also worked on the continued development of mining in siegecraft.

However, he became first inspector of artillery in 1776, in which year also he received the grand cross of the St Louis Order. He was now able to carry out the reforms in the artillery arm which are his chief title to fame. The 'Table des constructions des principaux attirails de l'artillerie ... de M. de Gribeauval' covers all the French artillery equipment in detail. He was also responsible for the règlement for the French artillery issued in 1776. Although much of the work is not directly attributable to Gribeauval, these systems of organization and uniformity in ordnance have been called le système Gribeauval.

During his lengthy career, he created more than 320 sculptures, 590 oil paintings, 5,500 watercolors, 2,600 prints, and thousands of drawings. However, he is primarily recognized for his sculpture. His work includes landscapes, portraits, busts, life-size sculptures, monuments, and engravings. Regardless of his medium of choice, his work is characterized by spontaneity; he often preferred to prepare his work with quick sketches on the scene. He felt this made his work more natural as compared to using a model in the studio. He was fairly commercially successful during his life, though he did not find success until his mid-30s. Large commissions for sculptures from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) were particularly lucrative for him. Born into a family of rich Mormon pioneer heritage, Young was the grandson of the second President of the LDS Church and first Governor of Utah, Brigham Young. Young was introduced to art by his father at an early age. He quit school at seventeen years old and worked engraving and portrait making jobs at various newspapers in Salt Lake City to make money for art lessons and for art school in New York and later, Paris. He lived most of his life in New York City where he became associated with \\"The Eight\\" and the Ashcan School. He ignited his commercial success in New York; however, arguably two of his most famous works, the This Is The Place Monument and the Seagull Monument are featured prominently in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of his other well-known works is a statue of Brigham Young which resides at the Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. At various times during his career, Young taught at the Art Students League. Most of Young's work resides at Brigham Young University. Early years Mahonri Mackintosh Young was born on August 9, 1877 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. He was the oldest child of Mahonri Moriancumer Young, owner of Deseret Woolen Mill which he had inherited from his father Brigham Young, and Agnes Mackintosh. Young enjoyed the time he spent living in rural Utah at the factory; he considered this his \\"golden age\\" in Utah. Young was given the name of his father, named after the character Mahonri Moriancumer from the Book of Mormon, widely known as the \\"Brother of Jared\\". Moriancumer was omitted due to its peculiarity and was, instead, replaced by Mackintosh, his mother's maiden name. His grandfather, Brigham Young, was the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), governor of Utah territory in 1851, and director of the Mormon pioneers to Utah. Mahonri Mackintosh was likely the last grandchild born before the death of Brigham Young on August 29 and the last to receive a blessing from him. Young's mother came from a polygamist marriage in the Midwestern United States. Though she did not meet her father, Daniel Mackintosh until she was older than one, he died when she was three years old and her mother raised her alone. Young's parents had attended the University of Deseret (now University of Utah) together. They married in October 1876 in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City. After their marriage, Agnes's mother Ellen moved into their home. Young's twin brothers, Winfield Scott (Winnie) and Waldemar (Wally) were born on July 1, 1880; they grew to be successful, a newspaperman and a screenwriter respectively. While ill with appendicitis, his father introduced Young to sculpture by carving objects for him out of wood. For his safety, his father gave him clay to model animals, sparking his interest in art at a young age. Young's father died when he was about seven years old. His father's death provided Young with the motivation to become a successful sculptor. His mother never remarried but was forced to sell the factory for less than half its worth due to financial concerns. Despite this, Agnes was able to provide for the living expenses of her family. His family moved into a small house in Salt Lake City where Young began school. At eleven years old, his mother bought him a woodcarving kit from which he carved a four-inch bas relief of Julius Caesar from a fence post. After seeing the piece, a book salesman called him a \\"genius\\", leading his family to call him \\"the genius\\". Due to mediocre grades and always feeling behind his classmates, Young quit school after eighth grade. He spent time reading and studying about art, making friends with other young, aspiring artists. His childhood friends included John Held Jr. and Lee Greene Richards. He created his first sculpture when he was thirteen. At a young age, Young found formal education to be a waste of time. Young said that the only thing he learned that was of any value to him was that he should look at the point where a line would end rather than the point of the pencil. However, despite his disinterest in formal education, he read avidly with favorite authors being Ralph Waldo Emerson and Montaigne. Early influences from the Mormon families around him led him to be disinterested in maintaining LDS Church activity. Examples of these influences included abuse of the law of plural marriage and excessive piety among church members. Young was athletic and participated in baseball and football teams. However, after an injury during a football game, he broke his left arm and after it was incorrectly reset and then rebroken to be properly set, his left arm remained slightly smaller than his right for the entirety of his life.; His early interest in athletics influenced the subject of his art, as he often sculpted and depicted athletes competing in various sports, the most prominent sport being boxing. He also developed his interest in nature and bird watching which further influenced themes and subjects of his art. His uncle introduced Young to ranch life, in which he became extremely interested. His mother was adamant that he pursue a different career. Although Young did not become a rancher, themes of ranching and the American West were frequent in his art. Young learned about the art style of Jean-François Millet from reading magazines, which taught him about form, space, light, and movement in art. An article about Millet convinced Young to quit school, get a job, and take art lessons. Determined to become a sculptor, Young realized that he had not sculpted since he was five years old, so he decided he may have better luck being an illustrator. Salt Lake City and New York education The Heavy Sledge, 1912. Brigham Young University Museum of Art, Provo, Utah Rather than attend ninth grade, Young chose to pursue an artistic education under local artist James Taylor Harwood, John Hafen, and Edwin Evans. He had initially applied to the University of Utah, but his application was denied because he had not graduated high school. Instead, Young worked in a curio shop and a stationary shop to make money for lessons with Harwood. However, he was delayed in attending lessons due to a necessary appendectomy. Harwood was unimpressed by Young, believing that he was a lazy artist and did not work hard. Young's philosophy, however, was that there is no virtue in working hard, but rather thinking hard. Furthermore, Young liked to quickly sketch an observation which he would later turn into a drawing, but being a traditionalist, Harwood viewed this technique as cheating and an \\"artistic crime\\". Although Young had not yet sculpted in class, one day, Young and a classmate sculpted the mask of Laocoön with details from the David and Laughing Faun. Young was not trained in sculpture and had not sculpted since he was five years old. Despite his lack of experience, his instructors praised his sculptures and his natural talent. However, he would not sculpt again until he studied in Paris. Young saved money earned as a Salt Lake Tribune portrait artist, but took his subsequent demotion to an engraver as a blow to his ego. Using the money he saved, he attended the Art Students League of New York between 1899 and 1901. In New York, Young was fascinated by the Industrial Revolution and decided that he would make art to reflect the themes of the Industrial Revolution. At the Art Students League, Young took classes with George Bridgeman and Kenyon Cox. He began using realist techniques; he would look at artistic models quickly and then attempt to draw his or her memorized features. Although Young disliked Bridgeman as an instructor, Young maintained a spot as second in the class. In contrast, Young greatly admired Cox as an instructor. During his time in New York, he suffered from insomnia, which he attempting to remedy by reading Shakespeare and magazines. Young lived on a tight budget and spent most of his time studying or attending art exhibits. After running out of money, Young had to return to Salt Lake City after eight months instead of his intended nine. Paris education In Salt Lake City, Young worked for the Salt Lake Herald as an engraver and did some drawings for Deseret News. Even though he contracted the Spanish flu, Young became manager of the photoengraving shop for the Herald and saved enough money to travel to Paris, France in 1901 to study at the Académie Julian. Young received extra money to study from his mother who had arranged for a settlement of a part of Brigham Young's estate as well as donations from family and members of the LDS Church. He studied until 1905, where he studied with Jean-Paul Laurens and Jean-Antoine Injalbert. Unimpressed by the traditional styles taught in Paris, Young did not believe he learned anything at the Académie in France until 1903, when he was able to work more independently and develop his realistic style. He started studying painting and after achieving personal goals painting and after more artistic education from a trip to Italy, he returned to studying sculpture and etching in 1903. Young indicated that one must learn to be thick skinned in class to be able to withstand the criticism of both professors and other students. Most of his instruction in anatomy came from independent study of books. He found that he could not stomach anatomy classes at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, not because of cadavers, because he had not yet made it to that point in the lectures, but because of the overwhelming stench of unshowered students and sweat which gave him unbearable headaches. Young's most important etching in Paris was The Forge Rue St. Jacque. It was exhibited in 1903, bringing public attention to Young's etchings. His first original sculptures, The Shoveler and The Man Tired were completed in 1903. Young did not agree with the use of models in his sculpting, because he believed it took away from the naturalness of the piece. For his sculptures, he found that sketches and observation over time made for more natural results and a better depiction of motion. He nervously sent Man Tired and The Shoveler to the American Art Association show in 1903 and achieved great success. His sculptures were featured in the Paris Herald in an article about the American Art Association show. His sculptures were sent to the New Salon in Paris for liberal art, were placed in the main gallery, and received critical acclaim. He spent all of his time looking at art in exhibitions or sketching on the street which garnered him criticism from his classmates for being lazy. Young, however, felt that he could learn more by observing rather than by working and studying in the studio. During the summer of 1903, Young returned to Salt Lake City, having run out of money. In Salt Lake City, Young continued to sketch. Fortunately for Young, his mother borrowed enough money for him to spend another two years studying in Paris. In New York, on his way to Paris, Young participated in an amateur boxing match and broke his thumb which prevented him from sculpting for a few months, so he attempted water coloring instead. He had some modeled drawings hung in the Paris Old Salon, which led him to experiment drawing with more models. His model Bovet-Arthur was displayed in the New Salon. Young frequently used this man Bovet-Arthur as a model for his work while he was in Paris. Young did a parody piece called The Toilet, but it was never exhibited, and Young destroyed it in 1905. He destroyed some other work that was not accepted to salons. He later admitted regretting destroying his work and never destroyed another piece. Heber J. Grant, president of the LDS European Church mission at the time, gave Young money to cast some of Young's statues in bronze. During his last two years studying in France, he visited galleries and studios of well-known artists. Continuing to develop his style of realism, Mahonri Young was one of the first young American sculptural realists. Career Seagull Monument, 1913. Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah Mahonri Young returned to Utah in 1905, needing to find a way to make a living. Due to his lack of success and financial troubles, Young considered years 1905 to 1910 his \\"five years of exile\\". His first commission was a butter sculpture for Frost Creamery for the Utah State Fair called The Dairy Maid. Later, Young established a mildly successful art class at the YMCA, but the class was canceled after one of his students started an art club that took away his students in 1906. He managed to maintain some private lessons. Young hoped to make a commission by making and selling a bust of B.H. Roberts, but he did not have money to bronze it until 1908. However, Robert's first wife refused to buy the bust because it did not adequately portray her husband's personality. Young finally received more commission when he and Lee Greene Richards completed a mural for the Isis Movie Theatre, using themselves as models for the characters. This was the first outside mural done in Utah and the only one done by Young. However, news stories about the murals kept being killed, leading Young to believe there was a conspiracy against realist artists. However, there were few career prospects in the United States, as the art scene was dominated by conservative juries who were unwilling to take a chance on unknown artists and were uninterested in unique or groundbreaking styles. Museums and exhibitionists wanted to showcase academic art and did not want to showcase American art. Consequently, Young found it difficult to sell or exhibit his work in the United States. He found little success during his first five years back in the United States. However, a group of realists called \\"The Eight\\" hosted an independent exhibition in 1908 in Philadelphia, igniting the success realist artists could find in the United States. Seagull Monument, 1913. Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah Young improved his reputation by making a bust of Alfred Lambourne. In early 1907, the LDS Church granted Mahonri Young permission to create a life-size sculpture of Joseph Smith, the first president of the LDS Church, using his death mask. After the LDS Church rejected his work, Young offered to redo the piece and make an additional statue of Hyrum Smith, Joseph Smith's brother. These statues were accepted and currently reside on Temple Square. Despite financial troubles, Young married Cecelia Sharp on February 19, 1907. Young had initially seen Sharp while both in Paris where Sharp had been studying piano; they had not yet met and Sharp had to travel back to Utah due to her father's health began to fail. In Utah, they attended the same LDS Church where Sharp's father was a bishop, but they had not yet met because Sharp was five years older than Young. Young and Sharp met in 1906 while Sharp was giving private piano lessons in Salt Lake City and fell in love. Young made a bust of Sharp in 1906. Polished and beautiful, the bust was different than anything he created during his career. Young and Sharp's first child, Cecelia Agnes Young, known as \\"Agnes\\" or \\"Aggie\\", was born on April 25, 1908. Continually aware of the revolt of \\"The Eight\\", Young traveled to New York in 1908 and 1909 to determine whether he could be successful in New York. After he presented an idea to construct a Seagull Monument to the LDS Church, they were excited about the project, but were unable to fund it. He instead sculpted a frieze to go above the LDS Gymnasium. This was the last project he completed in Utah before he moved to New York. Young felt that he could relate to the styles and the goals of \\"The Eight\\", so he and his family moved to New York in 1910. In New York, Young was a founding member of the Society of American Etchers. He did not find success until 1912, which was a turning point in his career. In 1911, Young won the Helen Foster Barnett prize for Bovet-Arthur a Laborer, displayed at the National Academy. His first New York exhibition was held in 1912. Stevedore was shown at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In the same year, Young was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate. Moreover, in 1912, Young proposed the Seagull Monument to the LDS Church a second time, stressing the personal importance of the monument to Presiding Bishop of the LDS Church Charles W. Nibley. The LDS Church offered Young a contract for the completion of the Seagull Monument, offering him a $200 per month advance for his living expenses. Mahonri \\"Bill\\" Sharp Young was born on July 23, 1911, in New York. Following the Seagull contract, Young was offered a contract to create art for a Hopi Indian exhibition for the American Museum of Natural History. He visited Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah to get inspiration and then returned to New York to complete the project with his colleague Howard MacCormick. Young was offered some commission to create dioramas for Navajo and Apache tribes as well. The Seagull Monument was unveiled and dedicated on Temple Square on October 1, 1913. A member of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors and because of the similar artistic goals and interests, Young became friends with some members of the Ashcan School and joined them in arranging the 1913 Armory show, which sought to introduce patrons to new styles and movements in art. The Armory show included realism and introduced more abstract styles such as Cubism. Young disliked abstract art styles. In fact, Young believed the emerging styles of surrealism and abstract expressionism that began to appear later in his life were \\"a greater threat than Communism\\". In 1915, he featured nine pieces at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition where he was awarded the silver medal. Young's Apache sculptures were unveiled at the American Museum of Natural History in 1916. Cecelia Sharp died of cancer in 1917 after which Young returned to Paris to continue studying art. He resided in Paris from 1925 to 1927. In Paris, he taught students, one of whom was Mary Tarleton. Tarleton and Young maintained a romantic relationship for a few years. Tarleton, 27 years his junior, confessed her love to Young but refused his many marriage proposals. Their relationship and consistent correspondence came to an end in 1930. In 1923, Young was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Academician. In 1924, Young unveiled his Navajo statues at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In 1926, E. W. Marland commissioned a statue of a pioneer woman; he invited twelve artists to submit sculptures to be considered for the monument. Young submitted a sculpture but lost to Bryant Baker. Young considered this the greatest disappointment of his career. Young's statues of Prize Ring boxer bronzes were shown at the Rehn Galleries in New York in 1928, their first exhibition. In 1929, Young crafted a bronze of Joe Gans for Winfield Sheehan, a Fox Film executive at the time. Young married Dorothy Weir, daughter of painter J. Alden Weir on February 17, 1931 and promptly moved to the Weir family farm in Connecticut. Young maintained a studio at the Weir estate which has become Weir Farm National Historic Site. Young first met Weir at 1921 at a dinner to discuss plans for the Phillips Memorial Gallery, one of the books for the gallery was intended to be dedicated to Weir's father. When Young returned to Paris to teach and work on his art from 1925 to 1927, they were reacquainted and became friends. After returning to New York, Young proposed marriage to Weir a few times, but she hesitated having never been married and feeling responsibility to care for her aging stepmother. In 1932, Young competed in the Art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics with eight boxing statues. The Knockdown, which he had sculpted in the 1920s in Paris, won the gold medal for sculpture. In 1934, he began teaching at the Art Students League. The same year, his etching Pont Neuf was featured in Fine Prints of the Year, 1933. In 1941 Life magazine called him \\"the George Bellows of American sculpture.\\" \\"Industry\\" and \\"Agriculture\\", a statue of factory worker with tools and a statue of a farmer sharpening his blade, were displayed at the 1939 New York World's Fair. These large sculptures stood at the fair's entrance. This is the Place Monument, 1947. Salt Lake City, Utah This is the Place Monument Mahonri Young had a unique relationship with the LDS Church. Since his teenage years, he did not attend church, follow the Word of Wisdom, or pay tithing to the LDS Church. However, he did admire several LDS Church leaders and was proud of his pioneer heritage. Despite his lack of activity in the LDS Church, he lobbied heavily to work on several projects for the church. Largely considered to be his most important artistic work, Young was especially proud of This Is The Place Monument located at This Is the Place Heritage Park in the foothills of Salt Lake City. The most artistically significant relief on the monument depicts the Donner Party. The monument was intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Brigham Young and the Mormons' arrival in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. As early as 1935, a committee had been chosen to consider artists' proposals of the monument. Young did extensive research and sketching for the project, confident he would be awarded the chance to create the monument. After lobbying the committee for almost five months, he returned to New York, frustrated that he had not yet secured the project. He decided to lobby U.S. Senators from Utah to gained federal funding for the project which offended committee member John D. Giles. Giles told Young that he could not give him a contract because they were waiting on funding from the LDS Church; however, Giles was actually stalling time to find a different artist to complete the project. The committee decided to make the monument proposal a competition, which worried Young because of his experience with the Pioneer Woman Competition. John Fairbanks, a younger artist, had already completed prominent statues and memorials for the LDS Church; he was Young's fiercest competition. LDS President Heber J. Grant chose Young's design in 1939, because it highlighted prominent figures Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Wilford Woodruff rather than a covered wagon, as in the Fairbanks design.Brigham Young, 1949. National Statuary Hall Collection, United States Capitol, Washington D.C. Young was awarded $50,000 to build the monument in 1939 when he was 62 years old. After he was granted the contract, many of the artistic qualities sought by Young were vetoed by representatives from Utah state government, the LDS Church, and descendants of pioneers. For example, Young wanted pioneer leaders in realistic clothing like they would have worn when entering the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. However, Young's vision of leaders like Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball in suspenders and bloomers was deemed undignified. Instead, pioneer leaders were portrayed in heavy formal overcoats. Young worked on the statues at Weir farm, assisted by Spero Anargyros. The monument was dedicated on July 24, 1947, on the one-hundredth anniversary of Brigham Young's party reaching the Great Salt Lake Valley. It is the largest sculpted monument in Utah. Even though Young was paid $50,000 for the monument, he believed that he was owed $11,000 extra according to the terms of the contract. He was angry when he was denied the money and eventually became frustrated enough to write to the president of the LDS Church George A. Smith directly. George Q. Morris of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles severely reprimanded Young for contacting Smith and Young was never paid the extra $11,000. Young resented this alleged contract breach for the rest of his life. In 1947, Young was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Dorothy Weir died on May 28, 1947. Young continued to live there after her death. His last major work was for the State of Utah. He created a six-foot monument of Brigham Young seated for the Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol Building. The work was unveiled in Washington D.C. in 1950. He carved this work at the American Academy in Rome, Italy. During a visit to Utah in the same year, he was made an honorary member of the Sons of Utah Pioneers Club. In 1955, Young participated in the Armory Show Commemorative Exhibition in New York City. In January 1957, Young had a serious stroke and in October 1957, he had an ulcer attack. Young died in Norwalk, Connecticut on November 2, 1957, from the result of bleeding ulcers complicated by pneumonia; he was eighty years old. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery at the Young family plot, next to Cecelia Young.; Style and works Although Mahonri Young was taught the classical style which prevailed in the French art institutes of the time, and was surrounded by colleagues who sought to reject the classical style with impressionistic and post-impressionistic styles, Young was disinterested in depicting idyllic or naturalistic images and was more concerned with depicting the realities of life that surrounded him. Consequently, Young's work is often associated with social realism, as his work depicted laborers, immigrants, minorities, the West, and man's interaction with nature. At the time, Young felt isolated by his traditionalist instructors and colleagues who penned Young's work as \\"dishonest\\". The size of his work ranged from larger monuments to small sculptures which he typically did in the social realist style. His most recurring subject matter included animals, Native Americans, the boxing ring, ranch life, and laborers. Young greatly admired the work of Cyrus Dallin and Young's work often had parallels to that of Dallin's. Mahonri Young was versatile in his subject matter and methods, yet his works were united in \\"powerful elegance\\". He was proficient in various mediums and techniques such as etching, drawing, watercolor, oil, gouache, and sculpture, which included his lesser known work on medals and reliefs. Even though he is known for his sculpture, he always kept a sketchbook with him and would use pen and ink, oil, and watercolor to depict scenes he saw on the farm. However while art critic, Frank Jewett Mather praised Young's drawings, etchings, and sculpture, he qualified Young's painting as average, suggesting that Young may have commenced painting at too old of an age or perhaps did not approach it with the same effort and care with which he approached his other mediums. Additionally, compared Young's work to that of Jean-François Millet, Honoré Daumier, and Constantin Meunier.; Though Young vehemently denied it, some critics accused Young of imitating Millet's work. Young's work, particularly his earlier pieces, was also heavily influenced by Auguste Rodin. Young's sculpture of fighting boxers, Right to the Jaw is characteristic of Rodin's style with its curves and opposing diagonal movements. Young's experience as a sketch artist for the Salt Lake Tribune gave him a spontaneous style that he believed benefited his art. Young excelled in \\"depicting figures in motion\\" and \\"the psychological nuances of gesture\\". Rather than emphasize light, appearance, and technical skill as had prevailed in traditionalist art, Young preferred to emphasize rhythm, balance, movement, form, and design. Legacy Mahonri Young's career lasted more than fifty years with his works displayed in over fifty museums and galleries in the United States and Europe. Upon his death, his estate constituted 320 pieces of sculpture, 590 oil paintings, 5,500 watercolors, 2,600 prints, and thousands of drawings. Young was the first Utah artist to have his work displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Moreover, Young received nearly every award offered to artists in Utah. The Springville Museum of Art called Young \\"Utah's most famous New York- based artist\\". According to the Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Young gained a national reputation for his sculpture and graphic art. Guy Pène du Bois said, \\"Mahonri Young belongs among...those who of the strain of Michelangelo, Titian, Rubens, Goya, Renoir, and Millet...he is a rare sculptor in America\\". Young was a member of the American Watercolor Society. In 1940, the Addison Gallery of American Art hosted a retrospective exhibit of Young's various works. In 1999, the Brigham Young University Museum of Art in Provo, Utah opened a year-long exhibition of Mahonri Young's work called \\"Mahonri: A Song of Joys\\". The Young family donated over 7,000 various works of Young to Brigham Young University. Additionally, the BYU Museum of Art held an exhibition of Young's work during summer 2019.

It is on the Miramar Peninsula, directly east of the isthmus of Rongotai, the site of Wellington International Airport. History 'Miramar' means \\"sea view\\" in Spanish. The name was chosen by the first European to settle in the area, Scotsman Coutts Crawford (1817-1889). Crawford was a former Royal Navy officer turned businessman and colonist, who arrived in Wellington in 1840. Crawford established a farm on the peninsula, which at the time was known as Watt's Peninsula, and drained a large lagoon known as Burnham Water. This lagoon covered much of the low-lying land on the peninsula; now this area is occupied by suburban houses, streets, parks and shops. The original Māori name for the area when it was still an island was Te Motu Kairangi (meaning \\"esteemed\\" or \\"precious\\" island). On 18 November 1904 Miramar Borough was formed.http://www.wcl.govt.nz/wellington/miramarseatoun.html Wellington City Library In April 1921, Miramar was incorporated into the City of Wellington. The records of the Miramar Borough Council were transferred to the City of Wellington at the time of amalgamation and can still be accessed today through Wellington City Council. Film Prior to World War II in 1936 the then government purchased an independent film company called Filmcraft in Darlington Rd, Miramar and set up a full body, government film production operation, to cover New Zealand's contribution in the war (and the 1940 Centennial celebrations). It was called the National Film Unit. In 1979 the NFU moved to Avalon, Lower Hutt, next to the national television entity Avalon Studios. In the late nineties, film director Sir Peter Jackson purchased the Film Unit, as it was then known, to produce his films. He used the NFU's facilities while making Braindead. Since then, Jackson has brought the Film Unit back to Miramar, which would now be seen as a sunset arm of his empire. Jackson and his colleagues Sir Richard Taylor (VFX) and Jamie Selkirk (Editor) have built a series of multimillion-dollar studios, sound stages, and pre- and post-production facilities in Miramar that include Stone Street Studios, Park Road Post, Weta Digital, and Weta Workshop. Jackson filmed the studio scenes of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong in Miramar. Miramar has been hailed by Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro as \\"Hollywood the way God intended it\\".Guillermo del Toro Chats with TORN About ‘The Hobbit’ Films!

Tres Cantos' location is highly desirable because of its location, near Monte del Pardo, in the south, and in Viñuelas. As a \\"satellite city\\" of Madrid conceived by urban planners in the 1970s, it is the youngest incorporated municipality in the Community of Madrid, with a population of 46,046 inhabitants. Biblioteca Municipal Public Library \\"Lope de Vega\\" de Tres Cantos (Madrid).15 The city, as other planned cities, has a distinctive structure. It consists of three phases and a newer development \\"Nuevo Tres Cantos\\". The two first phases are subdivided in sectors. Most sectors, especially in the first phase (North), include internally pedestrian public spaces, being surrounded by streets. The names of urban places are usually related to the sector in which they are located–for example, the Sector Océanos consists of five streets named after the five oceans. The town hosts a number of Spanish headquarters of companies such as Siemens, Danone, Beiersdorf, advanced research at Merck, GSK, and a chapter of the Spanish High Committee of Scientific Research CSIC. Torre del Agua, Tres Cantos  History  In 1969 to 1973, Vicente Mortes, the Minister of Housing (Ministro de la Vivienda), commissioned by the dictator Francisco Franco, was the first to establish and develop the town over a rural area. This was not the Tres Cantos we know today, because it was the old version of it. Later on, they decided to regenerate the city, copying what some English cities did during those times. In 1976, the company “Tres Cantos S.A.” was created and which regenerated the city. It was the youngest municipality in the Community of Madrid and one of the company's projects planned on paper. Residential occupation began from 1982, and in 1991 it was incorporated as a separate municipality, the newest in all of Spain. Infrastructure development has continued apace, with a current (2005) 5-year development plan by local government authorities allowing for expansion of up to 60,000 inhabitants. The first mayor of Tres Cantos was Antonio Osuna with an 80% level of support from the population.  Geography and location  Tres Cantos was built on former rural lands, about halfway from the northern outskirts of suburban Madrid to the Guadarrama mountain range, which are frequently snow-capped in winter. It lies in a slight valley formed with two eastwards-flowing creeks, bounded to the south by a higher plateau leading to Madrid, and to the west and north by more hilly terrain, which separates the area from the watershed of the Manzanares River. General elevation of the township is around 680 m, with a highest elevation within the municipality's borders of 730 m. The terrain rises towards the foothills of the Guadarrama range to the north and northwest, reaching elevations in excess of 800 m across the border in Colmenar Viejo. Within the urban area the terrain is gently undulating. It also an enormous new phase where there has been construction of new houses for new people for a long time. This new part of Tres Cantos is going to be named the Third Phase and is only composed of modern buildings and new houses for the city to expand. The climate of Tres Cantos is typical for continental Spain. Summers are warm, with maximum temperatures of 33 °C which can sometimes reach the 39 °C. Night temperatures are more pleasant, because they decrease till 20 °C. There are cold winters, with minimum temperatures of 0 °C and below, and maximum temperatures of around 9 °C. Due to its geographical location, 22 kilometers from the capital, with its altitude and proximity to the mountains, the annual average precipitation is greater than in Madrid (above 500 mm).  Demographics  In 2004 the residential population of Tres Cantos was 38,882 according to National Institute of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, or INE) figures; however later estimates put the figure at around 45,000. Population growth has been in decline since the peak of the initial influx of residents in the early 1990s, however future plans for expansion are designed to cater for an eventual population of around 60,000. A feature of Tres Cantos' demographic profile is the large proportion of young professionals (aged 45 and under) with children, compared to Madrid and the national average. This population structure reflects the nucleus of those who left the crowded confines of Madrid to settle in the new community of Tres Cantos in the 1980s and 1990s, resulting in a predominance of young, double- income and home-owning families of 2 to 3 children. Some 40% of the town's population are under 20 (almost double the national average), and less than 6% are over the age of 65 (considerably less than half the national average). The birth rate is also double the national average. Some 10% of the population are foreign-born (extranjeros), with those from Latin American countries representing over half of these, and those from other European countries a further 33%. Again, many of the immigrant population are professionals employed by multinational companies in fields such as technology, who have settled in Spain after first arriving on work assignment, many of whom are married to Spanish nationals. Educational accreditation among Tres Cantos inhabitants is also above the national average, with some 60% of prime income earners holding a tertiary qualification or higher. Average income levels reflect these education levels and professional employment opportunities, with over 55% having salaries in the upper-middle or higher income range. Many households have dual-incomes. Approximately 15% of households are classified as lower-middle and low-income households. An overwhelming majority of the employed work in the services sector, either in Madrid or in Tres Cantos itself. A majority of working residents regularly commute to Madrid for work, with only about a quarter of the workforce having employment in Tres Cantos itself. Those who remain behind are joined by a daily influx of approximately 20,000 who commute from Madrid and its environs to Tres Cantos for work. Light and medium industries account for some 20% of employment in Tres Cantos, the construction sector providing a further 7.4%; a bare handful (0.2%) are employed in agriculture.  Economy and industry  Tres Cantos' main economic activity is derived from the existence of various high-tech factories and headquarters in designated zones, including from the pharmaceutical, aerospace and computing industries. A production hub of Netflix is also found here. Approximately 20,000 employees from outside of Tres Cantos (predominantly Madrid) commute daily to work in its industrial zones its \\"Technological Park,\\" home of cutting-edge companies in the aerospace industry, such as GMV Innovating Solutions. Other multinational corporations with offices and/or production in Tres Cantos are: Lucent Technologies, BP Solar, BDF Nivea, Nokia Siemens Networks, Samsonite, Altair, Hella, Siemens, Dannon, GMV, IFS. Most recently, the largest cable provider in Spain, SOGECABLE, relocated here. The headquarters of both the Real Automóvil Club de España and the Spanish Metrology Centre are located in Tres Cantos.  Sister cities  Tres Cantos is a sister city to the planned cities of Columbia, Maryland, United States, Cergy-Pontoise, France and Nejapa, El Salvador.  Transport system  Tres Cantos has variety of transport connections. Train transit connects Tres Cantos with the district of Parla, Alcobendas, San Sebastián de los Reyes and Colmenar viejo via C-4 transit. Buses that connect Tres Cantos to Plaza Castilla in Madrid city are 712, 713, 716. Bus that connects Tres Cantos with Colmenar Viejo is 723. Tres Cantos also connects with Canillejas via Alcobendas and Autónoma university via the 827 bus. Night service between Tres Cantos and Madrid are ran every hour through the 701 bus. Tres Cantos has also local bus routes through the different town districts ran by the L-1, L-2 and L-3 buses.

According to Māori legend, it was formed when the taniwha Whaitaitai beached as he tried to escape the confines of the harbour. Situation From above, the peninsula resembles the shape of a shark. Northwards, it juts into Wellington Harbour (formerly known as Port Nicholson, and in Māori as Te Whanganui-a-Tara, the Great Harbour of Tara). To the south are Cook Strait and the South Pacific Ocean. The suburbs of Kilbirnie, Lyall Bay, Hataitai and Newtown, and the inner city, lie to the west. To the east a narrow stretch of water connects Wellington Harbour with Cook Strait and the open sea; beyond this channel are the scrubby Eastbourne hills, and the high and forested Orongorongo Ranges. From the peninsula's high points, an observer can look north to the Hutt Valley and the Tararua Ranges, or southwest, across Cook Strait, to the high peaks of the Inland and Seaward Kaikoura Ranges, which are often snowbound in winter. Physical description of the peninsula The peninsula has an area of 800 hectares. The coastline is rocky, with many coves, steep cliffs, and small pinnacles and caves, but there are also sweeping and sandy beaches, notably at Breaker Bay, Worser Bay, Scorching Bay, Moa Point and Tarakena Bay. A high ridge, running on an approximate north/south axis, forms the spine of the peninsula, with high points Mount Crawford in the north and Beacon Hill in the south. The peninsula has a large area of low-lying land, the Miramar flats, and a smaller area of flat land at Seatoun, both of which are mainly covered in residential housing. The peninsula is largely urbanized, with large suburbs of Miramar, Maupuia, Strathmore and Seatoun, and narrow strips of houses along the coast at Breaker Bay, Karaka Bay and Moa Point. The urban area is a mix of suburban housing, retail outlets, schools, light and service industries, recreation grounds (such as a golf course and sports fields), and Wellington airport. There are also extensive areas of regenerating native bush, pine forest, and remnant farmland, as well as urban gardens. A narrow two-lane road circles the peninsula, providing a picturesque route around the many bays, coves and headlands. At the entrance to Wellington Harbour, the rocks of Barrett Reef lie close to the shore of the peninsula. On 10 April 1968 , an inter-island ferry, foundered on Barrett Reef, and later capsized near Steeple Rock, a pinnacle just off Seatoun). 53 people were killed. Notable landmarks Notable landmarks include: ; Wellington International Airport: Its runway runs north-south along the western side, separating Miramar from Rongotai, Lyall Bay and Kilbirnie. A tunnel for pedestrians and cyclists runs on a west/east axis beneath the runway, from Miro Street in Miramar to Coutts Street in Rongotai. ; Massey Memorial: The marble mausoleum of Prime Minister William Massey (1856 - 1925), on a headland at Point Halswell, at the northern tip of the peninsula. It can be accessed from Massey Road, along a short walking track. ; Atatürk Memorial: A plinth on a cliff overlooking Tarakena Bay and Cook Strait commemorates Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the Republic of Turkey, statesman and general, who led Turkish troops in action against New Zealand soldiers at Gallipoli in the First World War. ; Rangitatau and Poito: Site of a Māori kainga (village) and pa in bush above Tarakena Bay, near the Atatürk Memorial. In pre-European times, people of the Ngai Tara and Ngati Ira iwi lived here, using the site for fishing in Cook Strait. In 1819-20, Nga Puhi and Ngati Toa raiders attacked and sacked the pa, and killed, enslaved or drove off its inhabitants. ; Eastern Walkway: A walking track that traverses the main ridge from the Pass of Branda to Tarakena Bay. It runs for 2.5 km, passing mainly through regenerating native forest, and provides excellent views of Wellington city, the Miramar Peninsula, Wellington Harbour and Cook Strait. ; The cutting: Through a low ridge on the peninsula's eastern side, providing a thoroughfare from Cobham Drive to Miramar Avenue and central Miramar. It was constructed in 1910. Above the entrance are large letters forming the word 'Wellington', with the last few letters angling up as if being blown away in the fierce wind. Intended to be seen from the air when landing from the North at Wellington Airport. ; Shelly Bay buildings: From 1885 to 1995, Shelly Bay was a naval and air force base, and many barracks, workshops, stores, wharves and slipways were built. Concrete munitions magazines are in pine forest above the bay. The area is now owned by local iwi, through the Port Nicholson Trust. ; Fort Ballance: Fort Ballance was the premier fort in the Wellington area for 26 years (1885-1911). Used by the military over a period of 60 years (1885-1945), the 1880s layout of Fort Ballance is largely unaltered and a good impression of the original nineteenth century fort remains. The fort is a permanent reminder of the technology used in the coastal defence network of the 1880s and it is an early example of the use of concrete as a building material. Weather The peninsula is exposed to Wellington's prevailing northwest wind and the southerly wind. During southerly storms, big waves and swells batter the peninsula's rocky southern shore. The peninsula's topography, with its high ridges and small bays and coves, provides shelter from the wind to many places. On 15 August 2011, during a prolonged southerly storm, snow fell across the peninsula in the late morning, settling in light drifts on trees, streets and fields. Like other parts of Wellington, snowfall at sea level is a very rare occurrence. Historical aspects There are a number of derelict military fortifications on the peninsula. From the late 19th century to the Second World War, the peninsula was an important component of an evolving coastal defence system, designed to protect the capital, harbour and hinterland from naval attack. In an era when naval power was based mainly on battleships, Miramar's strategic position made it ideal for coastal guns to prevent enemy warships approaching, bombarding the city, and entering Wellington Harbour. Large coastal artillery fortifications were built at Fort Ballance in 1885, at Fort Dorset from 1908, and Palmer Head from 1936. In the Second World War, the advent of naval air power made these coastal fortifications largely redundant, because an enemy could carry out aerial attacks, using planes launched from aircraft carriers well beyond the range of even the largest shore-based guns. Some of the fortifications are in reasonable condition, and can be readily accessed on foot. Fort Ballance, overlooking the channel, is a short walk from Scorching Bay or Mahanga Bay. These Victorian fortifications feature concrete gun emplacements, observation posts and underground rooms. At Breaker Bay, a trail runs along the low ridge above between the beach and Seatoun, passing two battery observation posts, a command post, and concrete foundations for artillery guns. At Point Halswell, the concrete emplacements for World War Two anti-aircraft guns and a command post can be reached from the Massey Memorial or a road running down from Mount Crawford. Nearby is a Victorian gun position at Kau Point, overlooking Wellington Harbour. At Palmer Head, a radar station is on the cliffs above Moa Point, looking out across Cook Strait, and is a short walk from Ahuriri Street. Origin of the name 'Miramar' \\"Miramar\\" means \\"sea view\\" in Spanish. The name was chosen by the first European to settle in the area, Scotsman James Coutts Crawford (1817-1889). Crawford was a former Royal Navy officer turned businessman and colonist, who arrived in Wellington in 1840. He established a farm on the peninsula, which at the time was known as Watt's Peninsula, and drained a large lagoon known to early European settlers as Burnham Water. Transport links Cobham Drive is the main road connecting Miramar with the rest of Wellington city. It runs around the north end of Wellington Airport, at Evans Bay. Buses and trolleybuses run frequently between Miramar and the city, and the harbour ferry connects with places around Wellington harbour: Queens Wharf, Days Bay, Petone, and Matiu/Somes Island. A cycle trail runs from Miramar to the central city, starting at Burnham Wharf and continuing along Cobham Drive, Evans Bay Parade and Oriental Parade. Civic associations The peninsula has several sports clubs: Miramar Rangers, a semi-professional football club, founded in 1907; Seatoun AFC, an amateur football club founded in 1909; and Oriental Rongotai Football Club ('Ories'), an amateur rugby club formed in 1888. The Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club, in nearby Kilbirnie, covers junior and senior cricketers on the peninsula. Film industry Film director Sir Peter Jackson has based his film production empire in Miramar, with studios, sound stages, and pre- and post-production facilities. Weta Workshop, involved in many movies directed by Sir Peter, such as The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, King Kong, and The Hobbit, is also in Miramar.

It was released in Japan in December 1995, developed by Heartbeat; whereas the previous Dragon Quest games were developed by Chunsoft. In 2011, a remake of the game, along with Dragon Quest IV and Dragon Quest V, was released worldwide for the Nintendo DS, making this the first time the game was released in English. Another version of the game for Android and iOS devices was released in Japan in June 2015. As the sixth installment to the Dragon Quest series, the graphics and gameplay remain close to the other games, with minor additions and upgrades. The graphics were vastly improved from Dragon Quest V, which was also for the SNES, but had rather unimpressive graphics due to being an early game on the console. Navigation remains largely unchanged from the previous games and the turn-based battles are still in first-person. The class system from Dragon Quest III returns, with minor adjustments. Dragon Quest VI sold over three million copies in Japan, becoming the best selling game of 1995. The DS version sold an additional one million copies by March 2010. The story follows the traditional Dragon Quest \\"Hero\\" on a quest to save the world. In this particular installment, the heroes also have to endure the personal struggle of amnesia, as many of the main characters do not initially remember who they are. After completing a series of quests, the player learns that in addition to a Real World, there is also a Dream World, made up of people's dreams, and that there is a great evil that wants to conquer both. The Hero and his new party work together to save both worlds from the ever-growing threat. Gameplay Dragon Quest VI is a traditional, turn-based role-playing video game (in an overhead perspective) that features random battles and a character class system that the Hero and his party members acquire new skills and spells. The Hero travels around the world gathering a party throughout his adventure. To progress in the story, the party must defeat specific boss monsters or trigger specific flags. In order to defeat the bosses, the player must spend time training the party by gaining experience points from battles to advance in character and class levels. An example of battle, from the original Super Famicom version. Other new features were added to the series, such as the monsters being animated when they attack.Nintendo Power Vol. 81, pp. 64–67. Nintendo of America, 1995. Retrieved 2007-4-6 The Slime Arena and Best Dresser Contest were new mini- games introduced; the casinos return from previous Dragon Quest games.Casino Owner: Welcome to my subterranean casino! I hope you enjoy yourself! Like previous games, mini medals can be found hidden throughout the worlds and can be traded for items.Medal King: I collect small medals which were scattered around the world. There are bonus dungeons and a few extra characters after beating the main storyline. There is a day and night system, as in some previous installments; with certain storyline events happening at night. While the Monster Master class can catch monsters in the original Super Famicom version it is not a major part of the game. Another returning feature from the past two games is the use of the wagon, which allows characters to be swapped out for other ones on the world map. This Dragon Quest, similar to Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest VII, has a class system. Once the party gets to Alltrades Abbey, they have the option of becoming one of several starter classes.Priest: This is the shrine at Alltrades. As you travel, you will learn the skills of your class. Does someone wish to change classes? Each class has eight levels, which are gained by winning a specific number of battles (unlike character levels, which are gained by earning experience points), and advancing in level teaches a character new spells and / or skills, which are retained across class changes. Once a character has mastered a specific set of two or three starter classes, they can change into a hybrid class that builds on their themes; for example, mastering Warrior and Martial Artist unlocks the Gladiator Class, which learns powerful physical attacks,Man: There are higher classes that combine the skills of regular classes...If someone first masters the Warrior and Mage classes...Then he can choose to become an Armamentalist. and mastering certain hybrid classes unlocks the Hero class. Some of the classes give special bonuses beyond their stats and abilities such as the Merchant who gives a small bonus to the party's income after every battle, or the Sage who receives a discount to MP costs. To master a class, the character must fight a set number of battles as that class. Once certain hybrid classes are mastered, a stat relating to that class will permanently go up. There are two secret classes as well, Dragon (Hackasaurus) and Liquid Metal Slime, which are unlockable through consumable books. Dragon Quest VI was the first game in the series to include (special attacks and other techniques that are not spells and usually do not cost MP) for human party members. These special techniques were added to the remakes of III, IV and V later on. Plot Setting Like the other Dragon Quest games in the series, the setting of Dragon Quest VI is very medieval, complete with castles, knights, and magic. The main world is divided into the \\"Real World\\" and \\"Dream World\\", each with a separate, but similar map. To get from one world to the other, the party uses special warps (such as in wells), by ascending/descending stairs on the world map or falling through holes in the \\"Dream World\\" to the \\"Real World\\". If something cannot be found in the \\"Real World\\", it may appear in the \\"Dream World\\", such as with Spiegelspire, at the middle of the game. Story Dragon Quest VI opens as the Hero and his party of a mysterious woman and a bulky man approach Murdaw, the demon king's castle.Hassan: We have to destroy the demon king! After the woman uses an ocarina to summon a dragon, the party enters the castle and comes face to face with Murdaw (Mudo \\"魔王ムドー\\" in Japanese version). Overpowering the trio, the demon king appears to destroy each member of the party, but suddenly, the Hero wakes up in the mountain town Weaver's Peak. Tania, a young woman from Weaver's Peak, insists that he was having a bad dream and introduces herself as his sister.Tania: Wake up, brother! After getting out of bed, the town elder tasks the Hero to get a crown in preparation for the annual Mountain Spirit festival, which takes him to Haggleton. The hero finds out the man who is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The Hero heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds, but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the Hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The Hero receives tip from one of the townspeople: There is a special well to the north from which people who enter never come back; the Hero heads in that direction, enters the well, and returns to his world. After receiving the ceremonial crown from the crown maker for no charge after saving his life, the Hero heads back to Weaver's Peak just in time for the festival to begin. During the festival, the Hero receives a mysterious vision that a great evil will take over the world; the elder asks him to leave the village in preparation for this disaster. The next day, the Hero finds out that the world that he stumbled onto was called the \\"Phantom World\\" and is given a pass by the elder that allows him entry into Somnia, where he can meet the king. At Somnia, the Hero meets Carver, who doesn't seem to remember the Hero. The Hero then meets Captain Blade, leader of Somnia's military, who gives the potential soldier candidates a task to find a special item in a tower. The Hero manages to find this item successfully and formally becomes a soldier of Somnia. After a task, the Hero and Carver work together to obtain a horse for an old man. Carver also becomes a soldier of Somnia. The Hero and Carver speak to the king, who informs them that to defeat Murdaw, they need the Mirror of Ra. The Hero and Carver discover another portal similar to the one near Haggleton, which eventually leads them to Port Haven, another town where they can not be seen. Milly, also appearing to have lost her memory, sees them and helps them become visible via Madame Luca's help. The party discovers a Somnia Castle in the “Phantom World” and learns that the prince—who looks like the Hero—is missing. They also meet Captain Rusty, who bears a striking resemblance to Captain Blade. Gaining entrance to the Moonmirror Tower, the party meets Ashlynn, a woman who was invisible in the “Phantom World” at first, too, and together they find the Mirror of Ra. The party travels to Murdaw's castle in the original world. After defeating Murdaw, the Hero uses the Mirror on him. Murdaw then turns into the King of Somnia, confused and unaware of what happened. The king reveals that the original world is in fact the Dream World and the Phantom World is the Real World. Upon traveling back to the Real World, the King of Somnia thanks the party for defeating Murdaw in his dreams, but the real Murdaw lives and that the party must travel to Ghent to retrieve a boat to get to Murdaw's lair. In Ghent, Nevan, a healer, joins the party and allows them to use the Ghent Clan's ship. During the fight with the real Murdaw, the Hero is again sent back to Weaver's Peak. With the Mirror of Ra, however, the Hero warps back into the battle and defeats Murdaw. The Queen of Somnia tells the Hero to discover who he really is. This quest leads the party to Arkbolt, where a terrible monster is blocking a nearby cave. The reward for defeating the monster is the famed Sunderbolt Blade, but before the party can strike the final blow, a warrior by the name of Terry kills the monster, winning the sword. After traveling both worlds, the party learns that Murdaw was not the only evil in the world, having fought several other monsters that all seem to be connected. In Sorceria, the party learns that this is Ashlynn's home.Mrs. Calbe: But, Ashlynn, you should remain here as the new elder. As a descendant of the sorceress, it is your obligation. The elders tell Ashlynn that the Demon Lord is watching her and give her the powerful spell Magic Burst to fight him. The party also learns that the only way to get to the Demon Lord is through Zenith Tower, but to activate the tower, they need to collect the sword, armor, shield, and helmet of legend. While doing so, the Hero meets his double in Real Weaver's Peak, who gets spooked, and speaks 'Y-You. Y-You're m-m-me!', and says that he must prove himself to be faithful to his family if he is to join powers. Returning to Real Somnia, the King and Queen tell the Hero that he is indeed the prince.Shera: Now you can take your rightful place as prince of Somnia. When he fused with his clone, the Hero gained his memory back, much like Ashlynn and Carver previously. The party reaches Cloudsgate Citadel and meets Dhuran (デュラン), who claims to have taken over the castle. He summons Terry to fight the party and then fights the party himself. Dhuran then reveals that all the enemies the party has faced were just pawns of Mortamor, the Archfiend. Milly reveals that Terry is her brother and Terry decides to join the party and fight against Mortamor. Once Cloudsgate Citadel returns to normal, the party speaks to King Zenith who informs them of Mortamor's doings and how to reach the Dread Realm. Mortamor plans on merging both worlds.Boy: According to the king, Mortamor wants to merge both worlds... The party's horse fuses with Pegasus, allowing the party to fly to the Dread Realm. Several challenges await in the Dread Realm, including the party's strength suddenly and unexpectedly plummeting. With the help of two Supreme Sage brothers, Benjamin and Isaac, the party enters Mortamor's Castle. After solving many puzzles, they come face to face with Mortamor and defeat him. Isaac reveals that the Dread Realm is falling apart and Pegasus helps them escape.Supreme Sage Isaac: Quickly, get out of there! This world is falling apart! Huh? you defeated Mortamor? That must be it! After returning to the Real World, everyone parts ways, with Ashlynn having to return to the Dream World since her Real World self no longer exists. With Mortamor's link between the Real World and the Dream World severed, the Dream World vanishes, with only Cloudgate Castle remaining visible in the Real World. Ashlynn is then shown in the castle, taking care of the newly hatched Zenithian Dragon. Development Production The scenario designer, as in all previous Dragon Quest games, was Yuji Horii. Similarly, the lead artist was Akira Toriyama and the sound was composed by Koichi Sugiyama. This is the last game in the series to feature in the Zenithia (天空の城, Tenkū no Shiro lit. \\"Sky Castle\\") trilogy. A prequel, Dragon Warrior Monsters (Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland in Japan), was released in 1998. This game featured Terry and Milly years before the events of Dragon Quest VI. It was released in North America the next year, even though Dragon Quest VI was never released in North America. Along with Terry and Milly, several of the main enemies, including Mortamor, reappear. Their previous roles have been eliminated, however, making them appear as just normal enemies. Mortamor and Murdaw (DeathMore and Mudou, respectively, in the localization) do appear as very challenging, very late in-game bosses, though. Release The initial release was delayed over a year because of Enix wanting to further develop their game. The game was eventually shown at Shoshinkai in November 1995. Dragon Quest VI was released a few weeks later on December 9, with the very steep price of 11,400 yen (roughly over 100 U.S. dollars). The game went on to sell over 3.2 million copies. In Japan, the game made the news in 2005, when a Japanese student threatened another student over an argument about which Dragon Quest is the best, the student doing the threatening favoring Dragon Quest VI. Like its predecessor, Dragon Quest VI did not receive an English- language localization because of being cost-ineffective. At 4MB, it was one of the largest games made for the SNES as well as the largest the console could support without adding bank-switching circuitry to the cartridge, and translating it would have necessitated even bigger and more expensive ROMs. In addition, the game was a late release for the SNES and by the time an English localization could be finished, Enix had already dropped support for the console in North America and moved to the PlayStation.  Nintendo DS remake  The Dragon Quest VI enhanced remake for the Nintendo DS was announced in late 2007 by Square Enix and was developed by ArtePiazza. The game was released in Japan on January 28, 2010, in North America on February 14, 2011, and in Europe on May 20, 2011. This version has a few differences * The after- battle monster recruitment has been removed. In the original 1995 Super Famicom version of Dragon Quest VI, certain types of monsters can be randomly recruited if they are defeated with a Monster Master in the party. In the 2010 DS remake, this system has been removed, instead, there are certain Slimes that will join you once you accomplish a specific task. Lizzie still remains recruitable. * Since this version comes with a built in map of both worlds on the top of the screen, the World Map and the Magic Map have been removed. * The 'Tag Mode' system from Dragon Quest IX has been implemented, which allows wireless communication and data transfer between two DS systems. * A Slime Curling mini-game was added. * The names of the following characters from this game were changed in Dragon Quest IX as follows: Mireille (Mireyu) as Milly, Hassan as Carver, Barbara (Bābara) as Ashlynn, Redach (Reidakku) as Somnia, and San Marino as Port Haven. On April 28, 2008, it was reported that Square Enix has applied for the trademark \\"The Realms of Reverie\\" at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, leading to speculation that it was the localized title for this game. On May 20, 2008, Square Enix opened up the North American site featuring the three Dragon Quest DS remakes, acknowledging Realms of Reverie as the official subtitle, as well as confirming a release in North America. The title was later changed to \\"Realms of Revelation\\" just prior to release. Listings in some stores, including on price tags and the like, still use the \\"Reverie\\" title. Mark Franklin, director of Public Relations at Nintendo, made the claim that Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation “will give fans unique access to a classic game in the series for the first time” outside Japan. Related media  Soundtracks  As with every Dragon Quest, Koichi Sugiyama composed the music and directed all the associated spinoffs. Three soundtracks were released for the music of Dragon Quest VI. The first was a two-disk soundtrack, which included an orchestral performance and an OST. The second soundtrack was released on August 23, 2000, and just had the orchestral version. This version was released by SPE Visual Works (now Aniplex), and was named Dragon Quest VI ~The Dream World~ Symphonic Suite. This version was featured on Dragon Quest Daizenshu Vol. 2, which is a compilation of Dragon Quest music. A second Symphonic Suite edition of the OST was performed in March 2005 and released on July 19, 2006, also by Aniplex. The Symphonic Suite track list is as follows: Manga A 10-volume manga adaptation of the game was also made, which titled . It was authored by Masaomi Kanzaki and published by Enix in the Monthly Shōnen Gangan between 1997 and 2001. The storyline roughly follows that of the video game from which it was based but with several differences, such as the inclusion of the character Kizu Buchi, a spotted slime. Reception Kurt Kalata of Gamasutra praised the game's storyline, particularly its innovative scenario. While comparable to the light-dark world setting of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Dragon Quest VI featured a unique real world and dream world setting, which he suggests had an influence on the later Square role-playing games Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy X. Kalata also praised the gameplay improvements, including its class system that improves on Dragon Quest III and is now more similar to Final Fantasy V, and the addition of a bag that improves on the inventory management of previous games. He concludes that it is \\"still a fantastic game.\\"Kurt Kalata (February 4, 2008), Dragon Quest VI: Maboroshi no Daichi, Gamasutra Sales Despite the very high price of 11,970 yen (about 100 US dollars), Dragon Quest VI sold 3.2 million copies in Japan, of which 2.5 million were sold in December alone, resulting in it becoming the best selling game of 1995. In 2010, Dragon Quest VI for the Nintendo DS sold almost a million copies in Japan in its first week. The game sold over 1.2 million copies by March 2010.【ゲームソフト販売本数ランキング TOP30】集計期間：2010年3月15日〜3月21日 – ファミ通.com. Famitsu.com (2010-01-04). Retrieved on 2013-01-07. According to Nintendo Power, Dragon Quest VI was originally planned for North American release in the spring of 1996 under the title \\"Dragon Warrior V.\\" The Super Nintendo localization of the game never happened, however, as Enix had already given up on the U.S. market. Square, one of the only companies still willing to bring console role-playing video games to the United States, was also still struggling to get their games to sell in the United States, and therefore, Dragon Quest VI had no companies willing to take a risk for it. In Nintendo Power vol. 81, the staff wrote an article on Dragon Quest VI, hoping the game would find a North American release. They also suggested why the series might not appeal to the American audience: there is too much fighting and not enough adventuring. Other critics have mentioned that class building becomes tedious and that the dual worlds are too overwhelming, both possible reasons against a US release. Dragon Quest VI was listed as #7 among the 10 Best Japanese Games Never Released in the U.S. by GamePro magazine in their May 2005 issue.

He is noted for, among other things, having planned and founded the monumental Corpus Reformatorum. In 1794 he entered the University of Leipzig, where he studied theology for four years. After some years of hesitation he resolved to be ordained, and in 1802 he passed with great distinction the examination for candidatus theologiae, and attracted the regard of Franz Volkmar Reinhard (1753–1812), author of the System der christlichen Moral (1788–1815), then court-preacher at Dresden, who became his warm friend and patron during the remainder of his life. From 1804 to 1806 Bretschneider was Privatdozent at the University of Wittenberg, where he lectured on philosophy and theology. During this time he wrote his work on the development of dogma, Systematische Entwicklung aller in der Dogmatik vorkommenden Begriffe nach den symbolischen Schriften der evangelisch- lutherischen und reformirten Kirche (1805, 4th ed. 1841), which was followed by others, including an edition of Sirach with a Latin commentary. On the advance of the French army under Napoleon into Prussia, he determined to leave Wittenberg and abandon his university career. Through the good offices of Reinhard, he became pastor of Schneeberg in Saxony (1807). In 1808 he was promoted to the office of superintendent of the church of Annaberg, in which capacity he had to decide, in accordance with the Canon law of Saxony, many matters belonging to the department of ecclesiastical law. But the climate did not agree with him, and his official duties interfered with his theological studies. With a view to a change he took the degree of doctor of theology in Wittenberg in August 1812. In 1816 he was appointed general superintendent at Gotha, where he remained until his death. This was the great period of his literary activity. In 1820 was published his treatise on the Gospel of John, entitled Probabilia de evangelii et epistolarum Ioannis Apostoli indole et origine cruditorum, which attracted much attention. In this work, he collected with great fulness and discussed with marked moderation the arguments against Johannine authorship. This called forth a number of replies. To the astonishment of every one, Bretschneider announced in the preface to the second edition of his Dogmatik in 1822, that he had never doubted the authenticity of the gospel, and had published his Probabilia only to draw attention to the subject, and to call forth a more complete defence of its genuineness. Bretschneider remarks in his autobiography that the publication of this work had the effect of preventing his appointment as successor to Karl Christian Tittmann (1744–1820) in Dresden, the minister Detlev von Einsiedel (1773–1861) denouncing him as the slanderer of John (Johannisschander). His greatest contribution to the science of exegesis was his Lexicon Manuale Graeco-Latinum in libros Novi Testamenti (1824, 3rd ed. 1840). This work was valuable for the use which its author made of the Greek of the Septuagint, of the Old and New Testament Apocrypha, of Josephus, and of the apostolic fathers, in illustration of the language of the New Testament. In 1826 he published Apologie der neuern Theologie des evangelischen Deutschlands. Hugh James Rose had published in England (1825) a volume of sermons on the rationalist movement (The State of the Protestant Religion in Germany), in which he classed Bretschneider with the rationalists; and Bretschneider contended that he himself was not a rationalist in the ordinary sense of the term, but a rational supernaturalist. Some of his numerous dogmatic writings passed through several editions. An English translation of his Manual of the Religion and History of the Christian Church appeared in 1857. His dogmatic position seems to be intermediate between the extreme school of naturalists, such as Heinrich Paulus, Johann Friedrich Röhr (1777–1848) and Julius Wegscheider on the one hand, and DF Strauss and FC Baur on the other. Recognizing a supernatural element in the Bible, he nevertheless allowed to the full the critical exercise of reason in the interpretation of its dogmas (cp.

The Carlton was based on the Opel Rekord E (Mk.1) and Omega A (Mk.2). With the exception of the pre-facelift Mk.1 cars, most Carltons were manufactured by Opel in Rüsselsheim, and differed only from their Opel Rekord/Omega sisters in badging and trim. It was replaced by the Omega B in 1994, mirroring the standardisation of model names across both GM Europe brands. Mark I (1978–1986) Main Article: Opel Rekord E The first Vauxhall Carlton was introduced in September 1978 as a replacement for the ageing VX1800/VX2300 saloons, built in Luton from components made at the Opel plant at Russelsheim.Autocar, 1982, page 42 Based on the Opel Rekord, but with Vauxhall's typical \\"droop snoot\\" front end (which had debuted three years earlier with the Chevette and Cavalier) that featured no traditional grille. The other difference was the dashboard, which featured the hooded instrument binnacle going across the whole width of the car with wooden embellishment, compared to the plainer dash of the Rekord. It was a traditional large saloon or estate with rear-wheel drive and a spacious, comfortable interior and was available in \\"L\\" trim only. Power came from a 2.0–litre carburettor petrol engine which gave reasonable performance, refinement and economy. There were some impressive options available, including central door locking, alloy wheels and electric windows, which gave it an advantage of most of its similarly-priced competitors. It was designed to compete directly with the Ford Granada, which was consistently the most popular car of that size in Britain during the 1970s. It also competed with British Leyland's Princess and Rover SD1 model ranges, as well as foreign competitors including the Citroen CX and Renault 20/30. It was launched shortly before the Peugeot 505. Relationship with other models Lengthened, more powerful models, based on the Carlton and Rekord, were also available. Positioned directly above them was the Vauxhall Viceroy which was a Carlton with the larger 2.5 L or 3.0 L six-cylinder Opel cam-in-head engine (CIH) (the corresponding Opel was the Opel Commodore), and differed also in that it featured a chrome grille with the \\"white cross\\" motif (from the VX4/90) in place of the Carlton's painted droop snoot nose. The Viceroy/Commodore however sold poorly and were discontinued after the \\"E2\\" facelift in 1982, and a six-cylinder engine would not appear in the Carlton again until the MK2 GSi 3000 model. The Vauxhall Royale and Vauxhall Royale Coupé were in essence, long wheelbase versions of the Carlton/Viceroy with altered \\"six light\\" styling that were positioned at the top end of the range only featuring six-cylinder engines. These were essentially badge engineered versions of the Opel Senator and Monza, respectively, although a confusing situation resulted in the United Kingdom as a result of General Motors' decision to merge the Vauxhall and Opel dealer networks and marketing - the Royale was dropped in the autumn of 1983, when the Senator was first sold under the Vauxhall brand. Post-facelift Vauxhall Carlton Mark I saloon Post-facelift Vauxhall Carlton Mark I saloon Post- facelift Vauxhall Carlton Mark I estate The Carlton was also sold in left hand drive in continental European markets, including the Netherlands,Vauxhall Carlton Belgium, the Scandinavian countries, Italy and Portugal, alongside its Rekord counterpart.Carlton and Royale - Vauxhall's money spinners for the '80s, Motor, October 14, 1978 Facelift The introduction of the facelifted \\"E2\\" Opel Rekord in 1982, marked the convergence of both the Rekord and Carlton (and in fact the final convergence of the Opel and Vauxhall ranges as a whole), with both cars now differing only in badging, whilst UK production ceased and all Carltons were built alongside their Rekord sisters in Rüsselsheim. The update saw the disappearance of the droop snoot front, in favour of a more traditional (though still angled) grille shared with the Rekord. Both cars also shared the new dashboard moulding and redesigned interior. This also marked the end of UK sale of the Opel Rekord, as the Opel brand was being phased out in the UK, as well as the sale of the Carlton outside the UK, as the Vauxhall brand was withdrawn from the rest of Europe. The 1983 facelift also saw the introduction of a wider engine range with the Family II engine from the Ascona/Cavalier in a 1.8 L carburettor form, whilst the older CIH unit continued in the 2.0 L carburettor and 2.0 L fuel injection form. In 1984, a range topping 2.2 L CIH fuel injected petrol became available in the CD trim. A 2.3 L diesel version was also available . A wider range of trim levels consisting of \\"L\\", \\"GL\\" and \\"CD\\" were also introduced at this time. A 2.0 L fuel injection engine was introduced for the 1984 model year and was replaced by a 2.2 L fuel injection engine for 1985. Mark II (1986–1994) Main Article: Opel Omega A 1993 Mark II Carlton GL 2.0 i sedan 1992 MK II Vauxhall Carlton 2.6i Diplomat sedan 1992 Mark II 1.8 GL estate Opel chose to name its 1986 replacement car in this segment Omega rather than Rekord. Vauxhall stayed with the Carlton name. On its launch in November 1986 the Vauxhall Carlton / Opel Omega saloon and estate range earned itself the accolade of European Car of the Year - the second Vauxhall/Opel product to achieve this distinction, two years after the Astra/Kadett won the accolade. Relationship with other models Again there was a lengthened version of the Carlton (and Omega), this time known in both Opel and Vauxhall forms by the same name: Senator. Vauxhall scrapped the Carlton nameplate in early 1994, but the name of its Opel equivalent, the Omega, lived on, as it was applied to the Carlton's replacement. At which point the Vauxhall equivalent adopted the name change (a drive towards uniformity was taking place throughout the range) and so the Carlton's replacement was sold as the Vauxhall Omega. Mark II engine line-up All of the 4-cylinder engines available in the Carlton Mk II were the GM Family II units in 1.8L and 2.0L capacities. The Opel Omega A was offered with a large 2.4L Opel CIH engine in certain European markets, but this variant was never offered in the Carlton. New to the Carlton's line-up with the Mark II were two straight-6 engines with 2.6 and 3.0–litres. These were both 12-valve engines, again from the Opel CIH family, but later 3.0-litre models were offered with 24-valves, producing much more power and torque. As well, Vauxhall used the \\"Dual-Ram\\" intake manifold, which lets the car breathe as two separate three-cylinder engines below 4,000 rpm, but changes the intake manifold profile at 4000 rpm to increase the runner length, thus increasing total engine output. In addition to the straight-6 engines there was a range of straight-4s. Starting with GMs popular 2-litre family 2 engine, the C20NE, with 115PS and 125lb.ft torque. There was also a 2.3 turbo diesel available with 100PS and 160lb.ft torque. Special Lotus version In 1990, Vauxhall launched a high performance Lotus Carlton in collaboration with Lotus Cars. (An Opel version was also produced as the Lotus Omega.) It was built with a 3615 cc six-cylinder twin-turbo engine (designated C36GET) capable of over , making it officially (for the time) the fastest full four- seater that had ever been made. It cost £48,000 – well over double the price of a standard Carlton. As a result, Vauxhall's original plans to sell about 1,000 in the UK ended in 440 UK cars being sold. For those with less money there was the 3000GSi 24v, with a top speed of . GSi 3000 & Diamond GSi 24v Prior to the Lotus tuned version, the range topper was the GSi 3000 upon which the Lotus Carlton was based. At launch in 1986 it had giving it a top speed of . In 1990, power was increased by going from two valves per cylinder to four, creating a 24-valve engine, resulting in which allowed 0-62 mph to be dispatched in 7.6 seconds and increased the top speed to . It was also available with an Automatic gearbox, which reduced the top speed to and increased the 0–62 mph time to 8.6 seconds. The Carlton Diamond 3.0 24v Estate was also made. Identical to the GSI but with an estate body shell, it sold in much more limited numbers (90) and so is a much rarer sight. Guinness World Record In June 1992 two teams from Horley Round Table, Surrey, UK, set a Guinness World Record time of 77 hours 34 minutes, driving a total 6,700 km across the then 12 EC countries in two Vauxhall Carlton 24V 3000 GSi's (J870 FFM and J751 DYC). The Carltons were provided by Vauxhall Motors and the record attempt was also supported by Mobil Oil and the Royal Automobile Club. Survival rate By February 2016, just 468 examples of the Carlton were still on Britain's roads, with most remaining examples believed to be the high performance 3000 GSi and Lotus versions of the MK2 model.

It chronicles the careers of several underground rock bands who, while finding little or no mainstream success, were hugely influential in establishing American alternative and indie rock, mostly through nearly constant touring and records released on small, regional independent record labels. Azerrad conducted many interviews with band members, and also conducted extensive research of old fanzines, as well as more mainstream newspapers and books. Content The inspiration for the book occurred when Azerrad was watching a miniseries about rock music history. According to Azerrad after exploring the punk era \\"it skipped and went straight from Talking Heads to Nirvana. \\"I thought, This is insane. Did I black out for 10 minutes? I thought that someone should do something about this. And I had, appropriately enough, a DIY moment and I thought, Maybe I should do it.\\" The title comes from the opening line of \\"History Lesson – Part II\\", an autobiographical song written by Mike Watt of Minutemen, one of the bands featured in the book. The song, which is on the album Double Nickels on the Dime, details the band's working class origins and populist sentiments: \\"Punk rock changed our lives.\\" The book is dedicated to the lives of D. Boon (Minutemen) and Bob Stinson (The Replacements). The book focuses on 13 bands: *Black Flag (from Hermosa Beach/Los Angeles, California) *Minutemen (from San Pedro/Los Angeles, California) *Mission of Burma (from Boston, Massachusetts) *Minor Threat (from Washington, D.C.) *Hüsker Dü (from Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota) *The Replacements (from Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota) *Sonic Youth (from New York City, New York) *Butthole Surfers (from San Antonio, Texas) *Big Black (from Evanston/Chicago, Illinois) *Dinosaur Jr. (from Amherst, Massachusetts) *Fugazi (from Washington, D.C.) *Mudhoney (from Seattle, Washington) *Beat Happening (from Olympia, Washington) In honor of this book's tenth anniversary, Azerrad put together a special concert at Bowery Ballroom with contemporary bands and artists to perform the music of bands covered in the text. For example, Ted Leo played Minor Threat and Titus Andronicus played The Replacements. Reviews In 2006, The Observer rated Our Band Could Be Your Life as one of the 50 best music books ever written. In 2009, Paste magazine named the book one of the 12 best music books of the decade. The Los Angeles Times listed it as one of \\"46 Essential Rock Reads.\\" In a review of the book in the Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau wrote, \\"...Let me give Michael Azerrad's Our Band Could Be Your Life its well-earned thumbs-up. Here's my rave: While reading this 500-page history of '80s indie- rock, I only resorted to something lighter to avoid putting my back out. All 13 profiles are page-turners.\\" In the New York Times Book Review, critic Eric Weisbard wrote, \\"In the decade Azerrad covers, indie America proved that world-class rock could be created outside corporate structures....Our Band Could Be Your Life passionately resurrects thirteen indie groups...Azerrad is adept at drawing out musicians' war stories—and this bare-bones movement was full of them.\\" Time's Benjamin Nugent said it was \\"A timely reminder that Cobain and company were merely a key regiment in the motley alt-rock army...Our Band Could Be Your Life narrates, down to the homemade posters and tour van repairs, how these bands gradually built up an audience large enough to make record labels and critics take notice.\\" The book review website Baby Got Books said \\"If you graduated high school (or were at least supposed to graduate) any time between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s and have any interest whatsoever in music, you absolutely must read this book. While it tells the story of bands that truly lived the indie/punk lifestyle, it also sheds a brand new light (not always favorable) on the people in those bands. Fascinating stuff.\\" Another writer states that \\"As music history, this book is important. None of these bands got much coverage in mainstream rock magazines while they were doing their most innovative and vital work, and Azerrad has done a great job of gathering ex-bandmembers up for revealing interviews...However, the book collapses under the weight of its own in-crowd cool.\\" Audiobook On May 21, 2019, the Our Band Could Be Your Life audiobook was released.

Written by Robert Bloch and directed by Joseph Pevney, it was first broadcast on December 22, 1967. In the episode, a series of horrific murders of women, on a world where such things never happen, points to Mr. Scott as the prime suspect. Plot Captain Kirk, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott of the Federation starship USS Enterprise are enjoying therapeutic shore leave at a night club on planet Argelius II. Mr. Scott (\\"Scotty\\") is introduced to Kara, a dancer at the club, and leaves with her. As Kirk and McCoy make their way through an evening fog to another club, they hear a scream, and find the dancer dead on the ground and Scotty standing against a nearby wall, clutching a bloody knife. Scott is detained and interrogated by Mr. Hengist, an administrator from Rigel IV and head of Argelius's police operations. Jaris, the Prefect of the planet, appears and bids his wife, Sybo, employ the Argelian empathic contact to determine the truth. While she prepares for the ritual, Lieutenant Karen Tracy, an Enterprise medical specialist, beams down with a psycho-tricorder, interviews Scott, and is murdered. The evidence again points to Scott. Sybo proceeds with the empathic contact ritual. The participants hold hands as in a seance, and Sybo begins to speak of a \\"monstrous, terrible evil\\", \\"a hunger that never dies\\", which has been named \\"Kesla\\", \\"Beratis\\", \\"Redjac.\\" The altar fire goes out, and Sybo screams. When the lights come on, Scott is holding Sybo's dead body. The Prefect, over Hengist's objections, agrees to continue the investigation aboard the Enterprise. Both Scott and Kara's fiancé Morla are questioned under \\"accuracy scan\\" by the computer, which confirms the testimony of both. Scott also speaks of a cold, evil presence during Sybo's ceremony, and the computer again verifies the accuracy of the statement. Kirk queries the computer on the names spoken by Sybo, including \\"Redjac\\". The computer responds with \\"Red Jack\\", a name given to the serial killer better known as Jack the Ripper. That, and Sybo's mention of a \\"hunger that never dies\\", suggests to Kirk that an immortal, non-corporeal entity might be involved. \\"Beratis\\" is found to be the name of a serial killer on Rigel IV. Suspicion falls on Hengist, not least because the murder weapon was made on Rigel IV. Hengist attempts to flee, but Kirk punches him and apparently kills him. Maniacal laughter is then heard from the computer, apparently the entity, which has jumped from Hengist's body to the computer, from which it can control the ship. The entity begins to threaten the crew to generate the fear it feeds on. Kirk orders Doctor McCoy to administer fast-acting tranquilizers to all hands, and Spock ties up the computer by ordering it to compute the value of to its last decimal place. After attempting to possess Jaris, the entity returns to the body of Hengist, which is immediately tranquilized. Kirk carries Hengist to the Transporter Room, where he is beamed into space at \\"maximum dispersion\\". Spock notes that the entity will survive only as separate bits of energy before perishing. He then suggests that the tranquilized crew resume their shore leave. Reception Decades later, many critics consider the episode offensive because of the sexual objectification of women; Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club commented that \\"women are treated like a completely different species\\". A repeated point for denunciation is Spock's infamous remark that \\"women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species.\\" Writing in 2010, Torie Atkinson found the episode misogynistic and said she \\"knew from the start this was going to be awful from the offensive orientalist set pieces and the references to 'therapeutic shore leave' for men only.\\" She objected to Kirk's demand for a \\"psycho-tricorder,\\" which, McCoy says, \\"will give us a detailed account of everything that's happened to Mister Scott in the last twenty-four hours.\\" Atkinson wrote, \\"Seriously? All this time they've had a piece of technology that reads and records memories, and they've been using these archaic court martials? Why ever investigate anything? This is easily the most ridiculous invention-of- the-week that Star Trek has thrown out there so far.\\" However, she added that \\"it's nice to see Scotty front-and-center, and his abject terror at what's happening to him and crying over feeling powerless and dangerous were moving.\\" She also \\"liked the humor—there are a lot of good one-liners (particularly McCoy's line about having drugs that could tranquilize an active volcano)\\" as well as \\"the idea of a murder mystery in the Star Trek universe.\\" Eugene Myers also \\"liked the idea of a classic murder mystery with Star Trek characters, complete with a locked room murder where the lights go out and someone screams.\\" Myers wrote a negative review, although he admired some details, such as \\"the table lights used to show appreciation for a good performance, an interesting detail of an alien culture that was sadly lacking for the rest of the episode\\" and \\"the brief look at the foggy Argelian streets (purposefully evocative of Whitechapel?).\\" He concluded that \\"this episode feels like someone took some other plot and shoehorned Star Trek characters into it, which is pretty much what happened.\\" Reviewer Jeff Bond was mostly pleased with the episode: Bond adds, Melissa N. Hayes-Gehrke of the University of Maryland pointed out, \\"A conversation between Kirk and Spock informs us for the first time that when Starfleet members are on a planet, they are subject to the laws of that planet. This is a very interesting development, with repercussions throughout all of the Star Trek series.\\" She also wrote, \\"This episode showcases Kirk's loyalty to his crewmen, as well as Kirk and Spock's synergy while engaging in completely random speculation.\\" Zach Handlen dismissed most of the story as not having \\"had enough drafts,\\" saying that it \\"has its own strong idea; but what's so weird is the way that idea doesn't actually surface till the last ten minutes of the episode.\\" He considered the strongest section to be when Redjac invades the computer: \\"Sure, the Enterprise computer's been screwed with before, but hearing a disembodied voice screaming for your death is très spooky; as is the vision of hell (or colored mist) we get in the computer display screens ... There are some clever bits that come out of dealing with a possessed ship.\\" In 2017 this episode was noted as featuring scary Star Trek content, noting that it ties into the story of Jack the Ripper.

In Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is a 17-year-old student at Balamb Garden, a prestigious military academy for elite mercenaries (known as \\"SeeDs\\"). He is 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall. As the story progresses, Squall befriends Quistis Trepe, Zell Dincht, Selphie Tilmitt, and Irvine Kinneas, and falls in love with Rinoa Heartilly. These relationships, combined with the game's plot, gradually change him from being a loner to an open, caring person. Squall has appeared in several other games, including Chocobo Racing, Itadaki Street Special, and the Kingdom Hearts series as . Squall was designed by Tetsuya Nomura with input from game director Yoshinori Kitase. He was modeled after the actor River Phoenix. Squall's weapon, the gunblade, was made so it would be difficult to master. To ensure players understand Squall's silent attitude, Kazushige Nojima made the character's thoughts open to them. Squall's first voiced appearance is in the first Kingdom Hearts game, in which he is voiced by Hideo Ishikawa in Japanese and by David Boreanaz in English; Doug Erholtz has since assumed the role for later English-speaking appearances. Squall had a mixed reaction from critics, some of whom judging him poorly in comparison with other Final Fantasy heroes due to his coldness and angst, and others praised his character development. The character has been popular and his relationship with Rinoa resulted in praise. Creation and design alt= Squall Leonhart was the first character Nomura designed for Final Fantasy VIII; he was inspired by actor River Phoenix, although Nomura said \\"nobody understood it\\". Squall is tall, and initially had long hair and a feminine appearance. After objections from the game's director Yoshinori Kitase, Nomura made the character more masculine and added a scar across Squall's brow and the bridge of his nose to make him more recognizable, leaving its cause up to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. The first illustration of Squall was used to create the world around him. The game's logo that depicted Squall embracing Rinoa was left open for interpretation by players. The scar on Squall's forehead was also left ambiguous although Nomura said it was important for him. Nomura's design of Squall included a fur lining along his jacket collar as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers. In Final Fantasy VIII Nojima wanted to give players insight into Squall's thoughts in contrast to Final Fantasy VII, which encouraged players to speculate on them. According to Nojima, the development staff made Squall \\"cool\\". In the video game it is implied the character Laguna Loire is Squall's father but Square Enix has never confirmed this idea. Nomura designed Squall to contrast with Laguna. Nomura created Squall's gunblade and its silver accessories. The weapon is a sword that has components of a revolver that send vibrations through the blade when they are triggered; this inflicts additional damage as Squall strikes an enemy if the player presses the R1 trigger on the controller. Although the weapon was intended as a novel way for players to control weapons in battle, Nomura said he feels it looks odd in retrospect and that it was very difficult to master. Square's Hiroki Chiba said the scene in which Squall and Rinoa embrace in space is his favorite in the Final Fantasy franchise due to the use of Faye Wong's song \\"Eyes On Me\\" in the background and because he had to adjust every frame to make the scene work. During one of the cutscenes of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is impaled by Edea Kramer in battle, creating the theory Squall dies in battle. When asked about this, Kitase laughed and falsified this theory but he found it interesting; if the game was ever remade, he might think of changing elements of the story. While Final Fantasy VIII does not use voice acting, Squall has a voice in the Square Enix series Kingdom Hearts, in which he is known as Leon. He is voiced by David Boreanaz in the English version of the game and Hideo Ishikawa in the Japanese version. He returns in Kingdom Hearts II and is voiced in the English version by Doug Erholtz, who said he had a \\"fun journey\\" voicing Leon and that it was a \\"really fun role to play\\". For the Kingdom Hearts series, Nomura decided to use Squall as a mentor character to newcomer Sora. Event planner Jun Akiyama persuaded Nomura to change Squall's name to Leon. Meanwhile, some parts of his design were changed to reference Rinoa's, most noticeably the wings in his jacket. Although polygons were used alongside other returning Final Fantasy characters, Leon could not return in Kingdom Hearts III which bothered many of the staff members. Appearances Final Fantasy VIII At the beginning of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is known as a \\"lone wolf\\" because he never shows his feelings and seems unresponsive to his associates. His superiors including his teacher Quistis Trepe consider him challenging to deal with but respect his talents. Squall is stoical and his taciturn nature used for comic relief. He is forced into a heroic role midway through the game when Cid, headmaster of Balamb Garden, appoints him the leader of the academy. During a late battle against Galbadia Garden, Squall has difficulty leading because of his lingering isolation. Although other characters try to become less reserved and Rinoa Heartilly expends considerable energy pursuing him, it takes time for him to accept the others' friendship, and fall in love with Rinoa. Later in the game, Squall becomes more comfortable in a leadership role, especially when he must fight Ultimecia. Throughout the game, Squall has a rivalry with Seifer Almasy; the two characters scar each other at the beginning but later they are supposed to cooperate; they still quarrel, however. Although Seifer later allies with the Sorceress, requiring Squall to fight him several times, Squall still feels a camaraderie with Seifer. According to flashbacks during the game, Squall grew up in an orphanage with the other playable characters, except Rinoa. The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical, and introverted boy whose goal is to go through life without emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms and his detachment from his companions is later revealed to be a defensive mechanism to protect himself from the emotional pain he suffered when he and his older sister were separated. After Ultimecia is defeated, the time and space she had absorbed begin to return to normal, pulling Squall's comrades back into their places in the timeline while Squall returns to the orphanage and meets a younger Edea. Squall plants the ideas for Garden and SeeD in her mind, creating an origin paradox; Squall must become the leader of Balamb Garden so he can pass its version of SeeD tradition to Edea, who teaches them to her husband Cid, who co-founds Balamb Garden, which admits Edea's orphans—including Squall). Other appearances Squall appears as a non-playable character in Kingdom Hearts, in which he wears a short leather jacket with red wings on the back and a Griever necklace. Squall takes the name Leon as an alias because he is ashamed of not protecting those he loved from the Heartless when his home world the Radiant Garden was consumed by darkness. His role in Kingdom Hearts is to help guide the protagonist Sora in his battle against the Heartless. Although Squall's appearance and age differ—he is 25 in Kingdom Hearts— and 17 in Final Fantasy VIII), his personality remains the same. A memory-based version of Squall (as Leon) appears in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories teaching gameplay in a tutorial. In this game, he works with his friends to restore their world. Squall also appears as an opponent in Olympus Coliseum tournaments, where he is often paired with other Final Fantasy characters. His virtual replica appears in Kingdom Hearts coded, in which it meets Sora's virtual replica. Squall is a secret character in Chocobo Racing and Itadaki Street Special, and a sprite version of him occasionally appears on the loading screen of the PlayStation version of Final Fantasy VI. He appears as a playable character in every Dissidia: Final Fantasy title and his Kingdom Hearts design is available as downloadable content (DLC) in Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy. He is a playable character in Itadaki Street Portable and is the main character representing Final Fantasy VIII in the rhythm games Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call, and the arcade-only game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: All Star Carnival. Squall also appears as a premium character in Pictlogica Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy: All The Bravest, both of which are designed for Android and iOS. Reception Critical reaction to Squall was mixed. Jack Patrick Rodgers of PopMatters said Squall's cynicism and frustration with those around him made him a strong character but \\"coldly inhuman\\". GamesRadar called Squall the fifth-best Final Fantasy hero of all time, praising the development of his personality and his improved interactions with other characters. GameZone rated him the fourth-best character in the franchise, saying while fans \\"either love or hate this guy\\" he becomes, despite little dialogue, the \\"ultimate anti-hero\\" of an entertaining journey. The website called Squall and Rinoa the best couple created by Square Enix, noting the differences between them and that their relationship is the first in the series to drive the plot of a game. The couple were on The Inquirers list of most-memorable video-game love teams; comments again focused on the differences between them. GameSpot said while Squall can be viewed as a jerk, he can also be seen as \\"standoffish because of some repressed Wagnerian broodiness, in which case he was kind of interesting\\". Christopher Michael Baker of Allgame said he initially hated Squall but although the character seemed \\"cold and uncaring\\" at first, his romance changes him for the better. RPGamer called Squall \\"everyone's favorite orphan\\" and said although he tries to distance himself from others, \\"he can't help but draw people to him, be it sorceresses or gun-slinging ladies' men\\". GameDaily ranked him sixth on its list of the \\"Top 25 Gaming Hunks\\", stating while critics described the character as a jerk, his character design, especially his scar, make him visually appealing. Den of Geek listed Squall as one of the most sexually appealing video game characters based on the design, especially his scar. Arnold Katayev of PSXextreme praised Squall's redesign in Kingdom Hearts as the game's best character design. In a 2008 Oricon poll, Squall was voted the tenth-most-popular video-game character. He was voted the 29th-best video-game character by Famitsu readers in February 2010. Complex listed him as the one of the greatest Final Fantasy characters. In a NHK poll from 2020, Squall was voted as the 13th best Final Fantasy character. According to IGN, \\"the problem [with Final Fantasy VIII] is that the character at the heart of everything, Squall, is basically a pouty jerk ... When your story is character-centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall ... just doesn't fit the bill\\". 1UP.com ranked Squall second on its list of the \\"Top 5 Most Irritating RPG Protagonists\\" and stated although he was an attempt to \\"cater to the fedora-wearing, trench- coat-clad folks\\", his lack of social skills alienated players. Edge compared Squall unfavorably with Final Fantasy VII protagonist Cloud Strife, saying Squall's angst \\"didn't seem to have any context\\" unlike Cloud's, which developed from one of the pivotal events in Final Fantasy VII. Squall's relationship with Rinoa was criticized by Edge, which said, \\"He [Squall] suddenly falls in 'love' with [Rinoa] at the end [of Final Fantasy VIII]\\". In GamesRadar's \\"RPG Emo-Off\\", Squall was defeated in heartbreak by Cloud. Squall was featured in the 1UP.com article \\"Top 5 Final Fantasy Character Types\\" in the category \\"The Sullen Asshole\\" with Cloud and Cecil from Final Fantasy IV. GameSpy included Squall in its article \\"Videogame Characters Who Would Suck in Real Life\\", saying in reality he would be a terrible soldier. While listing him as one of the most overpowered characters in the franchise, The Gamer said Squall's antisocial personality might divide gamers. GamesRadar Brett Elston said the romance between Squall and Rinoa is \\"the most forced, uninteresting romance this side of Attack of the Clones\\". he stated in a different article, \\"Squall and Rinoa are at the heart of it all\\". AJ Glasser, also of GamesRadar, said Squall \\"has all the emotional depth of a fingernail\\" and that Rinoa's traits make the duo more engaging across the narrative. According to Ryan Woo of Complex, \\"critics/fanboys had a somewhat legitimate point—why the hell was Squall such a sphincter, when he had a dime like Rinoa constantly hitting on him? Ultimately though, the story was appropriately rich enough to keep us going, and all felt right by game’s end.\\" Mike Gorby, writing for Goomba Stomp, said the character lacks realism in comparison to Rinoa, leading to their interactions where Rinoa calls out Squall's antisocial traits interesting. The 2010 film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World includes a dream sequence referencing a similar scene involving Squall and Rinoa at the end of the game.

RSI is sponsored by the Center for Excellence in Education (CEE) and hosted by MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Widely regarded as one of the most prestigious honors for high school students, RSI brings together the top STEM talent from around the world for the opportunity to conduct original scientific research, cost-free, for six weeks during the summer, before their final year of high school. History The Research Science Institute was founded in 1984 by Admiral H.G. Rickover. It was originally called the \\"Rickover Science Institute\\" until the 1986 session, when it was renamed to its current name. The original name is also the source of the nickname of RSI attendees, \\"Rickoids\\". RSI has connections to the Department of Defense, and three RSI positions are reserved for overseas Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) students.  Program  RSI is run by CEE president Joann P. DiGennaro and Vice President Maite P. Ballestero. Approximately 80 students from several countries (generally, around 50 students from the United States and 30 students from other countries) are selected to participate in the six-week summer program. More than 1,600 applications are received each year, making RSI more selective than all U.S. colleges and universities. The first week of RSI is composed of tutorials and seminars on contemporary research of interest by esteemed Professors from top universities, many of whom are alumni. The next four weeks are centered on individual research projects through mentors in the Boston area, the majority being at labs in the MIT and Harvard areas. The last week is devoted to paper and presentation writing, following by the RSI Final Symposium, and encore presentations, which features the top 10 presentations decided by academic staff at RSI. After that, the top 5 presentations are determined by a panel of industry leaders in research and STEM. The RSI Distinguished Lecture Series, which continues throughout the program, brings distinguished professors, scientists, and industry leaders in STEM, including a number of Nobel laureates, many of whom are RSI alumni, to speak to RSI students in evening lecture-style format. In recent years, the RSI Distinguished Lecture Series has included Nobel Prize-winning physicist Wolfgang Ketterle, Nobel Prize-winning chemist Dudley Herschbach, Nobel Prize- winning geneticist Phillip Sharp, evolutionary biologist Pardis Sabeti, mathematician and chess master Noam Elkies, Akamai Technologies co-founder and CEO Tom Leighton, and mathematician Michael Sipser. RSI's staff is generally composed primarily, if not entirely, of alumni, with recent Rickoids (RSI alumni, from the Institute's original name) filling in as counselors and TAs and older alumni taking administrative, lecturing, or tutoring positions. RSI 2018 and 2019 were led by RSI alumni Dr. Amy Sillman (RSI '84) and River Grace (RSI '16). Among tradition at RSI, students in the program also play in an annual Ultimate match against PROMYS, take trips to the White Mountains of New Hampshire, Georges and Spectacle Island in Boston Harbor, and an overnight trip to the Charles River Esplanade to view the Fourth of July fireworks. Location Though it has convened at various locations (including two years, 1990 and 2004, when the program was held concurrently on both coasts of the U.S., - at UC San Diego and The George Washington University in 1989-1991, and Caltech and MIT in 2004), the Institute is most often associated with MIT, where it has been held every summer since 1992, for various reasons including availability of local mentorships (with Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard Medical School all within a few minutes of central campus) and convenience of facilities. The program participants were housed in East Campus through 2003, Simmons Hall from 2004-2013, Fariborz Maseeh Hall from 2014-2017, MacGregor House in 2018, and Baker House in 2019. Similar programs in other countries In 2006, a new program, RSI-Fudan, (Chinese name: 未来科学家夏令营) was held at Fudan University in Shanghai, China for Chinese students. Thirty-five local students were selected from key high schools to participate in the program and the staff was composed with previous Rickoids and CEE/Fudan affiliates from both the U.S. and China. Five years later, in 2011, another new program, the Saudi Research Science Institute, or SRSI, was founded, and held at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. In the first year of SRSI (2011), twenty-five scientifically talented students were selected and attended a six-week session modeled on RSI. The number of students was increased to forty in 2012 and 2013 and to forty-five in 2014. In the summer of 2015, the inaugural RSI Tshinghua was held in Beijing for the very first time. As an official cooperation between the CEE and Tsinghua University, this program held research experiences for 34 outstanding high school students in China. In Sweden, Research Academy for Young Scientists (RAYS) takes place annually for 21 incoming high school seniors who are most qualified in STEM. In 2009, Center for Excellence in Education started the first chapter in India in the city of Chennai, It was called Research Science Intitiative-Chennai. It is an intensive four-week program held at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology Madras. This was in collaboration with the PSBB Group of Schools, IIT Madras, Chennai Mathematical Institute, SASTRA University and other leading institutions in the fields of science and technology. This was with the support of all secondary schools in Chennai from where the students were selected. After a pilot program in 2009, it was expanded the following year with Ms. Joann P. DiGennaro presiding over the valediction. A similar program, Summer Research School in mathematics and informatics, has been running in Bulgaria since 2001. It is intended for high school students with profound interests in mathematics, informatics (computer science) and IT. At first, the program was attended each year by 40 Bulgarian students but now in accepts international students. In 2016 the Summer Research School was attended by 50 students, of which 9 international. The program is organized by the High School Student Institute of Mathematics and Informatics. The Science Research Programme in Singapore was modeled after RSI. Alumni Fields Medalist Terence Tao attended RSI in 1989. ActBlue was founded by two 1994 RSI participants, Benjamin Rahn and Matt DeBergalis.Centerline, Fall 2011 Pinterest co-founder Ben Silbermann and American physicist Jeremy England attended RSI in 1998. Broad Institute and MIT neurobiologist, optogenetics pioneer, developer of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing method, and \\"35 Innovators Under 35\\" laureate Feng Zhang attended RSI in 1999. Two of the four members of musical quartet The Gregory Brothers, Andrew Gregory and Michael Gregory, were 2008 RSI participants. As of 2018, 171 finalists, 608 semifinalists, and twelve 1st-place winners in the Regeneron Science Talent Search have been RSI alumni. In the Siemens Competition, 243 finalists and semifinalists, and three 1st-place winners have been RSI alumni. As of 2013, 11 Rhodes Scholars and 14 Marshall Scholars have been RSI alumni.

Osteocytes are simply osteoblasts trapped in the matrix that they secrete. They are networked to each other via long cytoplasmic extensions that occupy tiny canals called canaliculi, which are used for exchange of nutrients and waste through gap junctions. Although osteocytes have reduced synthetic activity and (like osteoblasts) are not capable of mitotic division, they are actively involved in the routine turnover of bony matrix, through various mechanosensory mechanisms. They destroy bone through a rapid, transient (relative to osteoclasts) mechanism called osteocytic osteolysis. Hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate is deposited around the cell. Structure Osteocytes have a stellate shape, approximately 7 micrometers deep and wide by 15 micrometers in length. The cell body varies in size from 5-20 micrometers in diameter and contain 40-60 cell processes per cell, with a cell to cell distance between 20-30 micrometers. A mature osteocyte contains a single nucleus that is located toward the vascular side and has one or two nucleoli and a membrane. The cell also exhibits a reduced size endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, and cell processes that radiate towards the mineralizing matrix. Osteocytes form an extensive connecting syncitial network via small cytoplasmic/dendritic processes in canaliculi. An osteocyte in rat bone exposed by resin cast etching Development The fossil record shows that osteocytes were present in bones of jawless fish 400 to 250 million years ago. Osteocyte size has been shown to covary with genome size; and this relationship has been used in paleogenomic research. During bone formation, an osteoblast is left behind and buried in the bone matrix as an \\"osteoid osteocyte\\", which maintains contact with other osteoblasts through extended cellular processes. The process of osteocytogenesis is largely unknown, but the following molecules have been shown to play a crucial role in the production of healthy osteocytes, either in correct numbers or specific distributions: matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1), osteoblast/osteocyte factor 45 (OF45), Klotho, TGF-beta inducible factor (TIEG), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), E11 antigen, and oxygen. 10–20% of osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes. Those osteoblasts on the bone surface that are destined for burial as osteocytes slow down matrix production, and are buried by neighboring osteoblasts that continue to produce matrix actively. Osteoblastic osteocyte at the surface of trabecular bone in a sheep's femur Palumbo et al. (1990) distinguish three cell types from osteoblast to mature osteocyte: type I preosteocyte (osteoblastic osteocyte), type II preosteocyte (osteoid osteocyte), and type III preosteocyte (partially surrounded by mineral matrix). The embedded \\"osteoid-osteocyte\\" must do two functions simultaneously: regulate mineralization and form connective dendritic processes, which requires cleavage of collagen and other matrix molecules. The transformation from motile osteoblast to entrapped osteocyte takes about three days, and during this time, the cell produces a volume of extracellular matrix three times its own cellular volume, which results in 70% volume reduction in the mature osteocyte cell body compared to the original osteoblast volume. The cell undergoes a dramatic transformation from a polygonal shape to a cell that extends dendrites toward the mineralizing front, followed by dendrites that extend to either the vascular space or bone surface. As the osteoblast transitions to an osteocyte, alkaline phosphatase is reduced, and casein kinase II is elevated, as is osteocalcin. Osteocytes appear to be enriched in proteins that are resistant to hypoxia, which appears to be due to their embedded location and restricted oxygen supply. Oxygen tension may regulate the differentiation of osteoblasts into osteocytes, and osteocyte hypoxia may play a role in disuse-mediated bone resorption. Function Although osteocytes are relatively inert cells, they are capable of molecular synthesis and modification, as well as transmission of signals over long distances, in a way similar to the nervous system. They are the most common cell type in bone (31,900 per cubic millimeter in bovine bone to 93,200 per cubic millimeter in rat bone). Most of the receptor activities that play an important role in bone function are present in the mature osteocyte. Osteocytes contain glutamate transporters that produce nerve growth factors after bone fracture, which provides evidence of a sensing and information transfer system. When osteocytes were experimentally destroyed, the bones showed a significant increase in bone resorption, decreased bone formation, trabecular bone loss, and loss of response to unloading. Osteocytes are thought to be mechanosensor cells that control the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts within a basic multicellular unit (BMU), a temporary anatomic structure where bone remodeling occurs. Osteocytes generate an inhibitory signal that is passed through their cell processes to osteoblasts for recruitment to enable bone formation. Osteocyte specific proteins such as sclerostin have been shown to function in mineral metabolism, as well as other molecules such as PHEX, DMP-1, MEPE, and FGF-23, which are highly expressed by osteocytes and regulate phosphate and biomineralization. The osteocyte is an important regulator of bone mass and a key endocrine regulator of phosphate metabolism. Sclerostin Osteocytes synthesize sclerostin, a secreted protein that inhibits bone formation by binding to LRP5/LRP6 coreceptors and blunting Wnt signaling. Sclerostin, the product of the SOST gene, is the first mediator of communication between osteocytes, bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts, critical for bone remodeling. Only osteocytes express sclerostin, which acts in a paracrine fashion to inhibit bone formation. Sclerostin is inhibited by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and mechanical loading. Sclerostin antagonizes the activity of BMP (bone morphogenetic protein), a cytokine that induces bone and cartilage formation. Clinical significance Clinically important research of gel based in vitro 3D model for the osteocytic potentiality of human CD34+ stem cells has been described. The results confirm that the human CD34+ stem cells possess unique osteogenic differentiation potential and can be used in the early regeneration of injured bone. Osteocytes die as a consequence of senescence, degeneration/necrosis, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and/or osteoclastic engulfment. The percentage of dead osteocytes in bone increases with age from less than 1% at birth to 75% after age 80. Osteocyte apoptosis is thought to be related to decreased mechanotransduction, which possibly leads to the development of osteoporosis. Apoptotic osteocytes release apoptotic bodies expressing RANKL to recruit osteoclasts. Mechanical loading increases osteocyte viability in vitro, and contributes to solute transport through the lacuno-canalicular system in bone, which enhances oxygen and nutrient exchange and diffusion to osteocytes. Skeletal unloading has been shown to induce osteocyte hypoxia in vivo, this is when osteocytes undergo apoptosis and recruit osteoclasts to resorb bone. Microdamage in bone occurs as the result of repetitive events of cycling loading, and appears to be associated with osteocyte death by apoptosis, which appear to secrete a signal to target osteoclasts to perform remodeling at a damaged site. Under normal conditions, osteocytes express high amounts of TGF-β and thus repress bone resorption, but when bone grows old, the expression levels of TGF-β decrease, and the expression of osteoclast-stimulatory factors, such as RANKL and M-CSF increases, bone resorption is then enhanced, leading to net bone loss. Mechanical stimulation of osteocytes results in opening of hemichannels to release PGE2 and ATP, among other biochemical signaling molecules, which play a crucial role in maintaining the balance between bone formation and resorption. Osteocyte cell death can occur in association with pathologic conditions such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, which leads to increased skeletal fragility, linked to the loss of ability to sense microdamage and/or signal repair. Oxygen deprivation that occurs as the result of immobilization (bed rest), glucocorticoid treatment, and withdrawal of oxygen have all been shown to promote osteocyte apoptosis. It is now recognized that osteocytes respond in a variety of ways to the presence of implant biomaterials.

Wilfred Funk) Why England Slept is the published version of a thesis written by John F. Kennedy in his senior year at Harvard College. Its title is an allusion to Winston Churchill's 1938 book While England Slept, which also examined the buildup of German power. Published in 1940, Kennedy's book examines the failures of the British government to take steps to prevent World War II and its initial lack of response to Adolf Hitler's threats of war. It is notable for its uncommon stance of suggesting instead that an earlier confrontation between the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany could well have been more disastrous in the long run, rather than castigating the popular appeasement policy that the British government then pursued. Publication The book was originally intended to be no more than a college thesis. It was rated magna cum laude by Professor Henry A. Yeomans and cum laude plus by Professor Carl J. Friedrich. However, Kennedy's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., keen to elevate his son's reputation, encouraged Kennedy to convert the thesis into book form and publish it. He then enlisted Henry Luce to write the foreword, and his friend Arthur Krock, former bureau chief of The New York Times, to assist in redrafting the thesis, which had originally been titled \\"Appeasement At Munich.\\" The historian Garry Wills claimed that the assistance amounted to rewriting and retitling the manuscript and finding an agent for its publication. As United States ambassador to the United Kingdom, Kennedy, Sr. supported British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement during the late 1930s. John F. Kennedy then lived with his father in the United Kingdom and so witnessed the Luftwaffe's bombings of Britain firsthand. Reception After it was published in 1940, the book sold 80,000 copies in the United Kingdom and the United States and collected $40,000 in royalties for Kennedy. Those from the British sales were donated to Plymouth, a British city that had recently been bombed by the Luftwaffe, and Kennedy bought a Buick convertible with the income from the book's North American sales. Joseph Kennedy had initially approached Harold Laski to write the book's foreword, but Laski declined since he felt that it was \\"the book of an immature mind; that if it hadn't been written by the son of a very rich man, he wouldn't have found a publisher.\\" References  External links  *Why England Slept New York: W.

The area is known for its large number of historic buildings, structures and notable houses and mansions throughout Los Angeles. It is a youthful, densely populated area with a high percentage of African American and Latino residents. The neighborhood has several public and private schools. West Adams boundaries as outlined by the Los Angeles Times Eugene W. Britt House, now home of the LA84 Foundation House in 20th Street Historic District History West Adams is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city of Los Angeles, with most of its buildings erected between 1880 and 1925, including the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library. West Adams was developed by railroad magnate Henry E. Huntington and wealthy industrialist Hulett C. Merritt of Pasadena. It was once the wealthiest district in the city, with its Victorian mansions and sturdy Craftsman bungalows, and a home to Downtown businessmen and professors and academicians at USC. Several historic areas of West Adams, namely, Harvard Heights, Lafayette Square, Pico-Union, and West Adams Terrace, were designated as Historic Preservation Overlay Zones by the city of Los Angeles, in recognition of their outstanding architectural heritage. Menlo Avenue-West Twenty-ninth Street Historic District, North University Park Historic District, Twentieth Street Historic District, Van Buren Place Historic District and St. James Park Historic District, all with houses of architectural significance, are located in West Adams. The development of the West Side, Beverly Hills and Hollywood, beginning in the 1910s, siphoned away much of West Adams' upper-class white population; upper- class blacks began to move in around this time, although the district was off limits to all but the very wealthiest African-Americans. One symbol of the area's emergence as a center of black wealth at this time is the landmark 1949 headquarters building of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, a late-period Moderne structure at Adams and Western designed by renowned black architect Paul Williams. It housed what was once one of the nation's largest black-owned insurers (currently, along with an adjacent new building, it is now a campus for a large non-profit). West Adams' transformation into an affluent black area was sped by the Supreme Court's 1948 invalidation of segregationist covenants on property ownership.Khouri, Andrew (April 30, 2014) \\"Soaring home prices spur a resurgence near USC \\" Los Angeles Times The area was a favorite among black celebrities in the 1940s and 1950s; notable residents included Hattie McDaniel, Tim Moore, Eddie Anderson, Joe Louis, Sweet Daddy Grace, Little Richard, Lionel Hampton and Ray Charles. Singer Ray Charles's business headquarters, including his RPM studio, is located at 2107 Washington Boulevard. The intersection of Washington Boulevard and Westmoreland Boulevard, at the studio, is named \\"Ray Charles Square\\" in his honor. Starting in 1961, construction of the ten-lane Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10) tore through West Adams' core, with the freeway routed east to west just north of Adams Boulevard. Its construction resulted in the taking by eminent domain, and demolition, of numerous West Adams homes, including a number of mansions owned by African Americans . The construction resulted in substantial displacement of West Adams residents, including the relocation of much of the area's affluent Black families[https://la.curbed.com/2018/2/22/16979700/west-adams-history- segregation-housing-covenants. As the Los Angeles Sentinel reported: \\"The road could have been built without cutting through the so-called Sugar Hill section. However, in order to miss Sugar Hill, it was ‘said’ that the route would have to cut through fraternity and sorority row area around USC. Sorority and fraternity row still stands and Sugar Hill doesn’t, so you know who won out!”Ibid. As in many other American cities during the heyday of Interstate Highway Act construction, interstate highway rights of way were disproportionately routed through predominantly African American communities, causing substantial displacement of residents and steep declines in neighborhood viability. In the past, many African-American gays had moved into the neighborhood, and it became the center of black gay life in Los Angeles, even earning the nickname of \\"the black West Hollywood\\" or \\"the black Silver Lake\\"West Adams on the Down Low : Curbed LA Many of the neighborhoods, including West Adams, are experiencing a renaissance of sorts with their historic houses being restored to their previous elegance. The area is undergoing gentrification, with young professionals, restaurants, new businesses moving into the area. Many professionals are being attracted to the area, due to the proximity of job hubs in Silicon Beach, Culver City, and El Segundo.Madams, Hannah (June 14, 2019) \\"Businesses Flock to West Adams\\" Los Angeles Business Journal Demographics According to the Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, a total of 21,764 people lived in West Adams's 1.48 square miles, according to the 2000 U.S. census—averaging 14,686 people per square mile, among the highest population densities in the city as a whole. Population was estimated at 22,857 in 2008. The median age was 28, considered young when compared to the city as a whole. The percentages of residents aged birth to 18 were among the county's highest. \\"West Adams,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times Latinos made up 56.2% of the population, with black people at 37.6%, white people 2.4%, Asian 1.7%, and other 2%. Mexico and El Salvador were the most common places of birth for the 36.9% of the residents who were born abroad, an average percentage of foreign-born when compared with the city or county as a whole. The $38,209 median household income in 2008 dollars was considered low for the city and county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less was high, compared to the county at large. The average household size of 3.1 people was about average for the city. Renters occupied 62.8% of the housing units, and homeowners occupied the rest. In 2000, there were 1,078 families headed by single parents, or 21.8%, a rate that was high for the county and the city. The percentages of never-married women (39.5) and divorced women (5.7) were among the county's highest. Geography Description According to the \\"Mapping L.A.\\" project of the Los Angeles Times, West Adams is flanked by Mid- City to the north—across the Santa Monica Freeway—Jefferson Park to the east, Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw to the south and Palms to the west. \\"South L.A.,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times The neighborhood's street boundaries are the Santa Monica Freeway on the north, Crenshaw Boulevard on the east, Exposition and Jefferson Boulevards on the south and the Culver City line on the west (Ballona Creek and Fairfax Avenue). Project leader Doug Smith reported that, in response by the public to advance posting of the proposed maps, \\"Among the bitter rifts we encountered were the competing claims to the name West Adams.\\"Doug Smith, \\"MappingL.A.

West Adams boasts the only existing Greene and Greene house left in the entire city of Los Angeles. More than 70 sites in West Adams have received recognition as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, a California Historical Landmark, or listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Kinney Heights Kinney Heights was developed around 1900 by developer Abbot Kinney, for whom it is named. It was a suburban tract of large wealthy Craftsman style houses at what was then the western edge of Los Angeles. The houses featured amenities like \\"beveled-glass china cabinets, marble fireplaces and mahogany floors\\". It was accessible to downtown via streetcar and attracted upper-class families. Many of the hundred-year-old structures are still standing and have been renovated and upgraded. The neighborhood is part of the West Adams Terrace Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ). Twentieth Street Historic District The Twentieth Street Historic District consists of a row of bungalows and Craftsman-style houses in the 900 block on the south side of 20th Street.

Their name means \\"to shed tears\\" in Latin. Their stylistic aesthetic has changed over time; originally a death doom rooted gothic metal band, they have simplified their style to a more mainstream gothic rock style with the later albums. Biography Lacrimas Profundere was founded in 1993 by guitarist Oliver Nikolas Schmid. At the time, the band was influenced by doom metal, and also made use of feminine vocals and classical elements. With the entrance of vocalist Anja Hötzendorfer, they drew enough attention to themselves to be able to record their debut, entitled ... and the Wings Embraced Us, which was released in 1995 and was followed by La Naissance d’un Rêve (French for \\"The Birth of a Dream\\"), from 1997. After the said releases, the band was granted a deal with Napalm Records, which included five albums. A harpist was added to the band's line-up and they proceeded to record Memorandum (1999). Burning: A Wish from 2001 was Lacrimas Profundere's first album to receive attention from the international specialized press. This album featured the removal of the band's classical elements to some degree, and was also the first time they employed baritone vocals, supplied by Oliver's brother, Christopher Schmid. Their first international tour then began, including countries of Europe and Latin America. Lacrimas Profundere's subsequent albums were Fall, I Will Follow from 2002 and Ave End from 2004. Filthy Notes For Frozen Hearts received considerable attention from Jackass star Bam Margera and the songs \\"My Velvet Little Darkness\\", \\"Short Glance\\", \\"Should\\" and \\"Sweet Caroline\\" along with a vocal excerpt from \\"Sad Theme for a Marriage\\" were played on his show Bam's Unholy Union. In April 2007, Christopher Schmid, the band's founding member's brother and vocalist left the band; citing prolonged stress from touring. It did not take long to find a new vocalist: Peter Kafka, who also sings for the German band Sonicslave. The former singer Christopher Schmid still takes part of the writing of the new lyrics, however, and has occasionally been seen singing for the band in concerts. A few months later bassist Daniel Lechner left the band and vocalist Peter Kafka became the new bassist. Rob Vitacca employed as the new vocalist, who also sings for the German Rock band Lost. Long time keyboardist Christian Steiner also left the band, but supplied some parts for the new album. Songs For The Last View was released in the summer of 2008. This was the first album featuring their new singer, Rob Vitacca. Lacrimas Profundere's, The Grandiose Nowhere was released on 30 April 2010. The album spawned two singles \\"The Letter\\" and \\"Lips\\". Videos for each song were made; they also toured in places across Asia and South America. Antiadore was released on May 24, 2013, with two music videos for \\"My Release in Pain\\" and \\"Antiadore\\", as their last album for the contract with Napalm Records. In June 2016, Lacrimas Profundere signed with a new label, Oblivion/SPV, whom they collaborated with for the production and distribution of their eleventh studio album, Hope is Here, which was released on August 12, 2016. With the release of said album, the band moved slightly away from their classic gothic tendencies, in lieu of a sound resembling more closely that of alternative rock. Following the release of Hope is Here, the band toured across Germany and Austria. In May 2018, Oliver Schmid announced through the bands' social media and on their website, that Rob Vitacca had decided to leave the band in pursuit of other musical projects, \\"LACRIMAS just cannot work without complete and constant dedication. And giving such a full- time commitment simply isn't possible for Rob anymore.\\" The band took very little time to find a new vocalist, Julian Larre, who is also a founding member of the Finnish band Lessdmv. In celebration of 25 years as a band, their future album, which is set to be released later 2018, will be going back to the band's roots with a more gothic sound and guttural voices. This will be the first album featuring their new vocalist, Julian Larre.

He is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, and is the only person to win the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing twice. Weingarten is known for both his serious and humorous work. Weingarten's column, \\"Below the Beltway,\\" is published weekly in The Washington Post magazine and syndicated nationally by The Washington Post Writers Group, which also syndicates Barney & Clyde, a comic strip he co-authors with his son, Dan Weingarten, with illustrations by David Clark.  Early life and education  Gene Norman Weingarten was born on October 2, 1951, in New York City. He grew up in the southwest Bronx, the son of an accountant who worked as an Internal Revenue Service agent and a schoolteacher. In 1968, Weingarten graduated from The Bronx High School of Science and attended New York University, where he started as a pre-med student but ended up majoring in psychology. He was editor of the NYU daily student newspaper, The Heights Daily News. Weingarten left college three credits short of a degree.  Career  In 1972, while still in college, Weingarten's story about gangs in the South Bronx was published as a cover story in New York Magazine. Weingarten's first newspaper job was with the Albany, New York, Knickerbocker News, an afternoon daily. In 1977, he went to work at the Detroit Free Press. Weingarten then moved back to New York City to work at The National Law Journal. From 1981 to 1990, Weingarten was editor of the Miami Herald Sunday magazine, Tropic. In 1984, he hired Dave Barry, giving one of America's best-known humor columnists his big break. Tropic won two Pulitzer Prizes, including Barry's, during Weingarten's tenure. In 1984 he created the Herald Hunt, along with Barry and his current editor at the Washington Post, Tom Shroder, whom he refers to frequently in his online chats as \\"Tom the Butcher\\".  The Washington Post  In 1990, Weingarten was hired by The Washington Post. Weingarten writes \\"Below the Beltway,\\" a weekly humor column for The Washington Post that is nationally syndicated. Illustrator Eric Shansby contributes drawings to the column, which has been a long-term collaboration over 10 years. Weingarten created and, until 2003, edited The Style Invitational humor contest for The Washington Post. As part of the contest, he often hid his connection to the Invitational, using the pseudonym \\"The Czar.\\" However, Weingarten admitted responsibility in 1999, writing, \\"I run a reader-participation contest every Sunday in The Post. It is called The Style Invitational.\\" He claimed credit again in 2001, acknowledging that he was editor of The Style Invitational. In 2005, one of Weingarten's in-house critiques was leaked online, where he said The Post was suffering a failure of imagination. Selected passages were later re-posted on his column. Weingarten hosts a popular Washington Post online chat called \\"Chatological Humor,\\" formerly known as \\"Tuesdays with Moron.\\" Common topics in his online chat include the art of comic strips, analysis of humor, politics, philosophy, medicine, and gender differences. Many of his columns addressing gender differences have been written in a he-said, she-said style in collaboration with humorist Gina Barreca, his co-author for I'm with Stupid. It was during one of these chats he coined the phrase \\"Marrying Irving.\\" Weingarten writes that humor quality is objective, not subjective, and claims to be the final arbiter on the subject. Since beginning publication of the Barney & Clyde strip on June 10, 2010, he has significantly reduced comic strip discussion in the chat, believing it to be a conflict of interest. However, he will still answer questions posed by other contributors to the chat. In 2007, for one of his \\"Below the Beltway\\" columns, he humorously enhanced his Wikipedia entry until he was caught and the edits reverted. In his live online chat on June 22, 2009, Weingarten disclosed that he had accepted a buyout offer from The Washington Post, which meant he was retiring as a longer-form feature writer. The frequency of his online chat was reduced from weekly to monthly, although he provides weekly updates. His column will continue under a contract with The Post but he will no longer contribute feature-length articles. As of 2011, he was semi-retired from the paper, working on other projects.  The Hypochondriac's Guide To Life. And Death  Weingarten is a self-acknowledged hypochondriac. He was diagnosed with what was then a near-fatal infection of Hepatitis C, which led to the publication his first book, 1998's The Hypochondriac's Guide To Life. And Death.  I'm with Stupid: One Man, One Woman  Weingarten cowrote a series of humor columns in The Washington Post with feminist writer Gina Barreca about the differences between men and women. These became the basis of the 2004 book she and Weingarten collaborated on called I'm with Stupid: One Man. One Woman. 10,000 Years Of Misunderstandings Between The Sexes Cleared Right Up. The two wrote for over two years via email and on the phone without having met in person. They eventually met for the first time while doing publicity for the book. The book is illustrated by cartoonist Richard Thompson.  Old Dogs: Are the Best Dogs  In fall of 2008, Weingarten published Old Dogs: Are the Best Dogs in collaboration with photographer Michael S. Williamson. Together they profiled and photographed 63 dogs between the ages of 10 and 17 years old over the course of two and a half years. In response to the inevitable question of which dogs remained alive, Weingarten has asserted that the answer will always be \\"all of them.\\" Weingarten's inspiration for Old Dogs came shortly after the death of his dog, Harry S Truman, who is also featured in the book.  Barney & Clyde  In June 2010, Weingarten and his son Dan began publishing the syndicated comic strip Barney & Clyde, illustrated by David Clark. The comic is about the friendship between billionaire, J. Barnard Pillsbury, and a homeless man named Clyde Finster. The comic took over five years to develop, with the Miami Herald, The Washington Post, and the Chicago Tribune early supporters.  Me & Dog  In September 2014, Weingarten published Me & Dog, a picture book, in collaboration with illustrator Eric Shansby. The book is about a young boy Sid and his dog, Murphy. It is said to be the first atheist-themed children's book. Weingarten said he wrote the book in response to the lack of literature geared towards children and atheism − and a counterbalance to the prevalence of books like Heaven Is for Real.  One Day  In October 2019 Weingarten published One Day, an exhaustive look into a random day in American history. The date was chosen by children picking numbers out of a hat: It was December 28, 1986. The premise was that if you dig deeply enough, there is no such thing as an ordinary day. In a review, Slate said One Day was one of the 50 best nonfiction books published in the last 25 years.  Other work  Weingarten has written three screenplays, one in collaboration with humorist Dave Barry and two in collaboration with David Simon, including B Major, about a piano marathon conducted in Scranton in 1970. None of the screenplays has yet been produced.  Awards  From 1987 to 1988, Weingarten was a fellow at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. In 2006, Weingarten won the Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Award for Multicultural Journalism for his Washington Post Magazine feature article Snowbound. In 2008, Weingarten was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his Washington Post story, \\"Pearls Before Breakfast,\\" \\"his chronicling of a world-class violinist (Joshua Bell) who, as an experiment, played beautiful music in a subway station filled with unheeding commuters.\\" The night Weingarten returned from accepting his Pulitzer Prize, he received an email from a librarian named Paul Musgrave from the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, who told him that he had recently seen an article about a similar experiment that the Chicago Evening Post did in May 1930 where they had the virtuoso Jacques Gordon play his Stradivarius violin outside a subway station to see if commuters would notice the music. The article, entitled \\"Famous Fiddler in Disguise Gets $5.61 in Curb Concerts,\\" showed commuters displaying the same disinterest as Weingarten described in his article. It turns out Joshua Bell had owned that same Stradivarius violin for over 10 years. In 2010, Weingarten was awarded a second Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his Washington Post story, \\"Fatal Distraction,\\" \\"his haunting story about parents, from varying walks of life, who accidentally kill their children by forgetting them in cars.\\" Weingarten said he had a lucky break when his daughter was younger when he almost left her behind in the car when they lived in Florida. In 2014, Weingarten was awarded the National Society of Newspaper Columnists' Ernie Pyle Lifetime Achievement Award.  Personal life  Weingarten has lived in many places on the East Coast, but as he and his family settled in the Washington, D.C., area, they lived for a time in Bethesda, Maryland. Since 2001 he has lived in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C., with his wife, Arlene Reidy, an attorney, but in a column published August 10, 2017, announced that the marriage had collapsed. He has since made several references to a girlfriend in online chats, and at least one column, and in his chat of June 2, 2019, revealed that his girlfriend was Rachel Manteuffel, a 35-year-old editor and fellow writer for the Washington Post. He has two children, Molly Weingarten, a veterinarian, and Dan Weingarten, a cartoonist. Weingarten has stated he is an atheist. He is an amateur horologist.

The first Ray (SS-271), an attack submarine, was laid down 20 July 1942; launched 28 February 1943 by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisconsin; sponsored by Mrs. S. C. Loomis; and commissioned 27 July 1943, Lt. Comdr. B. J. Harral in command. After training in Lake Michigan until 15 August, Ray arrived Coco Solo, C.Z., via New Orleans on 31 August for intensive training. Departing Panama on 5 October, she reached Brisbane on 30 October.  First war patrol, November – December 1943  Departing Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 13 November for her first war patrol, Ray searched the area north of the Bismarck Archipelago. On the New Hanover-Truk shipping lane, she made radar contact with a three-ship convoy, escorted by three patrol craft. Attacking just before dawn she scored three hits on one of the freighters. Then, after evading the escorts' countermeasures, she followed the convoy and sank the converted gunboat Nikkai Maru with a spread of torpedoes. Before ending her patrol in December, Ray twice unsuccessfully attacked another convoy.  Second war patrol, December 1943 – January 1944  Ray's second patrol, 11 December 1943 to 12 January 1944 was in the Celebes-Ambon-Timor area. Near midnight on 26 December she sighted an unescorted tanker standing out from Tioro Strait. When the enemy ship reached open water, Ray fired a spread of torpedoes which stopped Kyoko Maru dead in the water and sent a huge mushroom of flame into the night sky as the target disintegrated. On 1 January 1944, SS-271 intercepted two ships with escorts in the mouth of Ambon Bay, Java, and sank converted gunboat Okuyo Maru with three hits. The accompanying cargo ship tried to ram the submarine, and a combined aerial attack by patrol bombers and a sustained depth charge attack forced Ray to run deep. Three days later, following an unsuccessful attack on two cargo ships escorted by a Chidori-class torpedo boat, Ray returned to Fremantle.  Third war patrol, February – March 1944  The third patrol, 6 February to 27 March, in the South China and Java Seas included the laying of a minefield off Saigon, Indochina, on 22 February. On the evening of 2 March, Ray intercepted a nine- ship convoy, and early on the 3rd came within firing range. A spread of four torpedoes damaged a tanker, but crossed Ray's line of fire preventing a coup de grâce. On 18 March Ray intercepted two Chidori-class torpedo boats and a patrol craft, fired six torpedoes, and dived deep. The submarine's crew heard an explosion. An intense depth charge attack followed. Ray escaped after sunset. The submarine ended her patrol at Fremantle.  Fourth war patrol, April – June 1944  SS-271 departed Fremantle on 23 April for her fourth patrol. Her hunting ground was the Davao Gulf-Molucca Passage area. On the afternoon of 21 May, she spotted a nine-ship convoy escorted by surface ships and seaplanes. Ray surfaced that night, pursued the convoy, and attacked early the next morning. She fired six \\"fish\\" at a large transport and an overlapping smaller cargo vessel sinking transport Tempei Maru and causing undetermined damage to the freighter. A spread fired from Ray's stern tubes resulted in hits on a tanker, and possibly a minelayer. During the ensuing confusion, Ray escaped by running at flank speed on the surface. Overtaking the disorganized convoy, during a tropical squall the next day, Ray fired on two radar contacts scoring hits. When the weather cleared, Ray saw one ship whose stack was going under and whose bow was rising from the water. The second was enveloped in a cloud of smoke and her decks awash. Ray dived deep to escape Japanese patrol aircraft, and the sinking was never confirmed by captured records. As no further suitable contacts were found, the submarine returned to Fremantle, arriving on 14 June.  Fifth war patrol, July – August 1944  Her fifth patrol, 9 July to 31 August 1944, in the South China Sea and off the Philippines, drew blood on 18 July when Ray sank the tanker Janbi Maru. During the engagement, the submarine fired 22 torpedoes during six separate runs on the tanker which fired at Ray with her deck gun. Ray returned to Fremantle to reload, before returning to sea on 28 July. At the south entrance to Makassar Strait, SS-271 intercepted a convoy of three ships and sank the cargo ship Kōshū Maru. Nine days later, she scored damaging hits on a transport and sank cargo ship Zuisho Maru. On 18 August, off northern Balabac Strait, Philippines, Ray closed a large convoy protected by surface escorts and planes, fired six \\"tin fish\\" at a tanker, and dived as a destroyer raced in to counterattack. Heavy explosions were heard, and a 2½-hour depth charge pounding followed. During the action, Ray heard another violent explosion and the sounds of a ship breaking up, as the tanker Nansei Maru went down. The submarine surfaced that evening and pursued the convoy into Palawan Bay. Air cover prevented a daylight attack, but the wolfpack of Ray, , and waited for the ships to come out. Ray fired her four remaining torpedoes at a passenger- cargo ship. Three fish missed, but the fourth hit the Taketoyo Maru amidships. The escorts forced Ray to dive, but she heard the 7,000-ton cargo vessel break up. The submarine underwent a sustained depth charge pounding, but escaped serious damage, returning to Fremantle 31 August.  Sixth war patrol, September – December 1944  The submarine's sixth war patrol, 23 September to 8 December, took her to the familiar waters of the South China Sea. On 6 October and 7 October, she twice torpedoed a tanker, inflicting undetermined damage. Five days later, she destroyed the cargo ship Toko Maru with two direct hits and escaped a subsequent depth charge attack. On 14 October, while making a crash dive to escape a Japanese patrol plane, Ray's conning tower was flooded by an improperly secured hatch, but she was brought under control before reaching . However, the damage forced the submarine to put into Mios Woendi for repairs during the last week of October. On the afternoon of 1 November, Ray closed a five-ship convoy, sinking the cargo ship Horai Maru No. 7, and damaging a small tanker. Escaping the escorts, she landed men and supplies on the west coast of Mindoro, Philippines, picking up two downed Navy fliers, two Army POW's escaped from Corregidor, and an escaped Filipino political prisoner. On the night of 4 November, the sub sighted a cargo ship with its superstructure aflame, from an earlier attack by . She launched two torpedoes, scoring a hit amidships and blowing away the bow of the Kagu Maru. On 6 November, SS-271 intercepted a convoy of two heavy cruisers, and several transports, protected by surface and air escorts. Ray fired six rear torpedoes at the , damaged earlier by . One of Ray's torpedoes hit Kumano's forward magazine, destroying its bow. Immediately prior to this, Ray had been forced to dive under Kumano in order to escape aerial and surface attack, and would subsequently ground in shoal water, shearing off her starboard sound head and blowing the sound head cable back into the torpedo room. To prevent further flooding, the submarine came to periscope depth where she saw the bowless cruiser being towed away by a transport. Her own damage and the Japanese escorts kept Ray from following up the attack. Kumano was destroyed off Luzon by Navy carrier planes 25 November. On the night of 14 November, Ray made a surface attack on a three-ship convoy, blowing up an 800-ton frigate with a direct hit in its magazines. Two days later she launched two torpedoes at a grounded transport, but could not complete the attack because of minefields and shoal water. On 19 November, she rescued a downed pilot from . The patrol terminated at Pearl Harbor 8 December 1944. From there the submarine headed east, arriving at Mare Island Naval Shipyard 16 December for a major overhaul. Departing San Francisco 26 March, she proceeded via Pearl Harbor to Guam, arriving at Apra Harbor on 29 April 1945.  Seventh war patrol, April – June 1945  Ray cleared Guam for her seventh war patrol 30 April to 16 June 1945. On 7 May while on lifeguard duty off Kyūshū she rescued 10 men from a downed B-29. On the night of 15 May – 16 May, she picked up the 10 crewmen of a PBM Mariner patrol bomber which was foundering in heavy seas. Ray transferred the rescued crews to and and continued her patrol. On 19 May, she intercepted three small freighters. Her torpedoes ran beneath the targets, and the \\"freighters\\", a disguised hunter-killer group, converged on the area where Ray had dived, laying a depth charge pattern. The submarine surfaced and fired her deck gun at her pursuers as she dashed away at flank speed. The remainder of the patrol was devoted to attacking patrol craft and coastal vessels with gunfire until it ended at Midway on 16 June.  Eighth war patrol, July – August 1945  Her eighth and final wartime patrol, 11 July to 13 August, took Ray to the Gulf of Siam. On the evening of 7 August, she sank 16 small craft by gunfire off Bang Saponnoi, Thailand. That night two boarding parties from the submarine burned seven Junks anchored north of Lem Chong Pra. The submarine arrived at Subic Bay for more ammunition on 13 August, where her patrol was terminated. Departing the next day, she proceeded via Saipan for home via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal, arriving at New London, Conn., on 5 October 1945.  Radar picket submarine (SSR-271), 1952–1958  Ray (SSR-271) She served in a training capacity at New London until 12 February 1947, when she was placed out of commission in reserve. In December 1950, she was towed to Philadelphia Navy Yard for conversion to a radar picket submarine. Redesignated SSR-271 on 3 January 1951, she was recommissioned 13 August 1952, Lt. Comdr. A. C. Burley in command. Ray departed Philadelphia 27 March 1953. The remainder of the year was occupied in fleet training operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean. From 1 March to 26 May 1954, she deployed to the 6th Fleet, serving as a picket ship. Returning to her homeport of Norfolk 26 May, she participated in joint United States- Canadian exercises off Nova Scotia in July and August. The remainder of 1954 and 1955 were spent in fleet exercises, type training, and an overhaul at Charleston Navy Yard from April to November 1955. Deploying again to the Mediterranean as a radar picket submarine from 5 March to 4 June 1956, she operated with NATO and U.S. Navy units. The remaining months of Ray's operating schedule in 1956 and 1957 were involved in type training and fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean, including representing Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, at the International Naval Review at Hampton Roads in June 1957 and participating in the NATO Exercise \\"Strikeback\\" held off Scotland, France, and Portugal in September and October 1957. The early part of 1958 was spent in fleet exercises off the east coast and the Caribbean. She departed Norfolk 30 June 1958 and entered the Charleston Navy Yard for inactivation. She was placed out of commission in reserve on 30 September 1958, and was struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1960. Her hulk was sold for scrap to the Commercial Metals Co., 18 December 1960. Ray was awarded seven battle stars, the US Navy Unit Citation (for patrol 6) and the Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation for action in World War II.

The origins of industrial folk song are in the British industrial revolution of the eighteenth century as workers tended to take the forms of music with which they were familiar, including ballads and agricultural work songs, and adapt them to their new experiences and circumstances. They also developed in France and the US as these countries began to industrialise. The genre declined in the twentieth century, but were popularised as part of the folk revival in the twentieth century, by A. L. Lloyd, George Korson, John Lomax, Pete Seeger, Alan Lomax and Archie Green. Because of their political content they have been adapted by rock musicians. Origins Industrial folk song emerged in Britain, the first nation to industrialise, in the 18th century, as workers and their families moved from a predominately rural and agricultural society to an increasingly urban and industrial one. These workers tended to take the forms of music with which they were familiar, including ballads and agricultural work songs, and adapt them to their new experiences and circumstances.A. L. Lloyd, Folk song in England (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1967), pp. 323-28. Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry.J. Shepherd, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music, vol. 1: Media, Industry and Society (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003), p. 251. As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest protest songs and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in the first industry to fully develop, textile production, which was particularly important in Lancashire, with songs like 'Poverty knock' which described the relentless movement and noise of the loom. The same trends were soon evident in mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries. As other nations industrialised their folk song underwent a similar process of change, as can be seen for example in France, where Saint- Simon noted the rise of 'Chansons Industrielles' among clothworkers in the early 19th century, and in the USA where industrialisation expanded rapidly after the Civil War.E. J. Weber, Peasants into Frenchmen: the modernization of rural France, 1870-1914 (Stanford University Press, 1976), pp. 431-5 and Simon J. Bronner, Folk nation: folklore in the creation of American tradition (Rowman & Littlefield, 2002), p. 142. Definitions and characteristics A. L. Lloyd defined the industrial work song as 'the kind of vernacular songs made by workers themselves directly out of their own experiences, expressing their own interest and aspirations, and incidentally passed on among themselves by oral means...'. His definition did not include songs created by learned writers on behalf of the working class, but he was prepared to accept some popular and musical hall songs that had been adopted by the workers. His definition has been criticised, as it depends on a concept of a pure working class culture unaffected by outside class or media influences, which is at variance with what we know of the spread of ideas and new forms of media from the late 19th century.A. Edgar, Cultural Theory: The Key Concepts (London: Routledge, 2007), p. 128. Lloyd also pointed to various types of song, including chants of labour, love and erotic occupational songs and industrial protest songs, which included narratives of disasters (particularly among miners), laments for conditions, as well as overtly political strike ballads. He also noted the existence of songs about heroic and mythical figures of industrial work, like the coal miners the 'Big Hewer' or 'Big Isaac' Lewis. This tendency was even more marked in early American industrial songs, where representative heroes like Casey Jones and John Henry were eulogised in blues ballads from the 19th century.N. Cohen and D. Cohen, Long Steel Rail: the Railroad in American Folksong (University of Illinois Press, 2000), p. 126. The folk revival The first wave of folk song revival in Britain and America the later 19th century and early 20th century was largely unconcerned with recording industrial songs. It tended to focus on the rural and agricultural and has been criticised as being obsessed with a rural idyll. As a result, industrial songs tended to be seen as a threat to traditional forms of music, rather than a development from them. In the second wave of revival, which was much more influenced by progressive or labour politics and as a result tended to show a much greater interest in the lives of working people and their music.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival 1944-2002 (Ashgate, Aldershot, 2003), p. 64. This movement was evident first in the USA where George Korson followed John Lomax's collection of the work songs of Cowboys with investigations of coal miner's songs, particularly from the Appalachians, from 1927.B. Nettl and P. Vilas Bohlman, Comparative Musicology and Anthropology of Music: Essays on the History of Ethnomusicology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991), p. 117. Despite reservations about these songs, whose authors were often known and so they did not fit into the mould of traditional music, after World War II folklorists largely accepted this music as folk song. Pete Seeger's Folkways LP American Industrial Ballads (1956) was an early survey of this kind of song.M. Halliwell, American culture in the 1950s (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), p. 129. The American song collection of over 200 songs in Hard Hitting Songs For Hard Hit People by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Alan Lomax in the 1940s (not published till 1967), explored worker's song further.A. Lomax, W. Guthrie and P. Seeger, Hard Hitting Songs for Hard-Hit People (1967, University of Nebraska Press, 1999). The work of labour historian Archie Green, which included the production of recordings of labour and work songs, provided a wider context for understanding industrial folk song within a wider field of 'labor lore'.B. L. Cooper and W. S. Haney, Rock Music in American Popular Culture: Rock 'n' Roll Resources (Philadelphia, PA: Haworth Press, 1995), p. 315. Songs written by Seeger and Guthrie, were also important in continuing the tradition and moving it into progressive folk music. Among the most successful of these composed industrial songs was Merle Travis' Sixteen Tons, first recorded in 1946, but made probably the most commercially successful industrial song when it was a major hit for 'Tennessee' Ernie Ford in 1955.W. C. Malone, Don't Get Above Your Raisin': Country Music and the Southern Working Class (University of Illinois Press, 2002), p. 43. In Britain the leading proponent of, and commentator on, industrial folk music was A. L. Lloyd. His Come All Ye Bold Miners: Ballads and Songs from the Coalfields, a collection of mining songs was published in 1952. Of his own recordings the most influential were his arrangement of various industrial songs on the LP The Iron Muse: a Panorama of Industrial Folk Song (1963). A. L. Lloyd wrote in the 1965 Encyclopædia Britannica a paragraph on 'Industrial Song', part his broader entry on 'Folk Music' and his Folk Song in England (1967) concluded with a chapter titled 'Industrial Folk Song', which popularised the term. Subsequently, David Harker criticised Lloyd for his romanticisation of industrial workers.D. Harker, Fake Song: the Manufacture of British Folksong' 1700 to the Present Day (Milton Keynes: Open University Press, 1985), p. 297. The other major figure of the second British folk revival, Ewan MacColl also played a significant part in popularising British Industrial folk song, making Shuttle and Cage a 10\\" LP with Peggy Seeger for Topic Records in 1958 and alone an LP for Stinson in 1963 called British Industrial Folk Songs. From 1957 to 1964 probably the widest audience for British work songs was achieved through the Radio Ballads, of MacColl and Peggy Seeger, many of which focused on work, including rail workers, road building, fishing and coal mining.T. Strangleman and T. Warren, Work and Society: Sociological Approaches, Themes and Methods (London: Routledge, 2008), p. 92. However, many of the songs in the Radio Ballads were written by MacColl himself in the style of the songs that he, Lloyd and others had collected e.g. 'Shoals of Herring'. In the British folk rock movement of the 1970s industrial folk music was less prominent than traditional ballads, but largely accepted as part of folk music, with songs like 'Blackleg Miner' being recorded beside medieval ballads by leading bands of the genre like Steeleye Span.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 59. Decline and survival Industrial folk song overlapped with other forms of music from the late 19th century, such as Music hall and popular music and began to disappear as a genre from the mid-20th century as different forms of song provided alternatives and the decline of major industries began to undermine it.E. Lee, Folksong and Music Hall (London: Routledge, 1982). However, because of its political associations it has been revived, particularly in times of political and social upheaval such as the 1980s, when anarchist punk band Chumbawamba included several industrial work and protest songs on their English Rebel Songs 1381-1914 album (1988) and the tradition was taken up by folk artists like Billy Bragg.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (London: Rough Guides, 2003), p. 195 and M. Willhardt, 'Available rebels and folk authenticities: Michelle Shocked and Billy Bragg' in I. Peddie, ed., The Resisting Muse: Popular Music and Social Protest (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), pp. 30-48. In the United States, arguably the most successful inheritor of the tradition is Bruce Springsteen, often focusing more on industrial decline in songs like \\"Youngstown\\" on his 1995 album The Ghost of Tom Joad.B. K. Garman, A Race of Singers: Whitman's Working-Class Hero from Guthrie to Springsteen (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2000), p. 241. Songs from the tradition continue to be recorded, as in the Grammy nominated Music of Coal: Mining Songs from the Appalachian Coalfields (2007), a two CD compilation and booklet of mining songs.\\"'Music of Coal' earns Grammy Nominations\\", Kingsport Times-News, October 6, 2007.

Rosmer is best remembered as a political associate of Leon Trotsky and a memoirist. Early life Alfred Griot was born in 1877 in Paterson, New Jersey. His father worked as a barber in the United States, returning with the family to France in 1884.Christian Gras, Alfred Rosmer et le mouvement ouvrier international. PhD dissertation. Via French Wikipedia. Having learned English as a child, Rosmer remained fluent in the language for the rest of his life. French syndicalist He took the political pseudonym Rosmer from the hero of a play by Henrik Ibsen.Reiner Tosstorf, The Red International of Labour Unions (RILU) 1930-1937. [2016] Ben Fowkes, trans. Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2018; pg. 858. Rosmer was a syndicalist leader before World War I, active in the Confédération générale du travail (CGT), the French general federation of unions. Together with Pierre Monatte, he issued a journal called La Vie ouvrière (Worker's Life), which was terminated as a result of French entry into World War I.Tosstorff, The Red International of Labour Unions, pg. 94. The antiwar French syndicalists had been represented at the Zimmerwald Conference in 1915 and then organised as the Committee for the Resumption of International Relations in which Rosmer participated. After the end of the war, a strike wave swept France in which the syndicalists played an active role. La Vie ouvrière was resurrected by Rosmer and Monatte in March 1919. In May 1919, Rosmer and Fernand Loriot transformed the former Committee for the Resumption of International Relations into a new organization, known as the Committee for Adhesion to the Third International.G. Walter, Histoire du Parti Communiste Français (1948), pp. 23-24; cited by E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia: The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923. London: Macmillan, 1953, vol. 3, pg. 142. The group remained isolated and without significant influence, however, largely removed from active communication with Moscow.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923, vol. 3, pg. 142. A friendship with Leon Trotsky dated from that period, when the latter was briefly living in France. Communist Party leader After the war, he became a leading figure in the Communist Party of France (PCF). He was sent to Moscow in 1920 as a representative of the French left, being assigned there to positions in the Communist International (Comintern) and the Red International of Labor Unions (RILU). In 1923 and 1924 Rosmer was one of the top leaders of the PCF, until his expulsion in the fall of 1924 along with Boris Souvarine and Monatte for opposing the organised campaign against Trotsky. Trotskyism After his expulsion from the PCF, Rosmer helped found the journal La Révolutuion prolétarienne (The Proletarian Revolution) and participated in political activities in a circle organised around this magazine. He became the only member of the group to establish the first Trotskyist movement in 1929, but he left it in 1931 because of differences over political tactics. Nevertheless, he remained a convinced revolutionary, and his friendship with Trotsky was later repaired. He visited the exiled Trotsky in Mexico in 1939. In Mexico, Rosmer was a member of the Dewey Commission, which cleared Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials.Dewey Commission Report Later life Unable to return to France because of the outbreak of World War II, Rosmer, an American by birth, lived in the United States after his Mexican interlude. He finally obtained permission to return home in 1947. Rosmer published an autobiography detailing his activities in Soviet Russia as well as a two-volume history of the antiwar movement in France during the years of World War I. Rossmer died in 1964.

He was a producer at Columbia Records for twenty years. Macero produced Miles Davis' Bitches Brew, and Dave Brubeck's Time Out, which are two of the best-selling and most influential jazz albums of all time. Although the extent of his role has been disputed, he also has been associated with the production of Davis' 1959 album Kind of Blue, jazz's best-selling record. Biography Early work Teo Macero was born and raised in Glens Falls, New York. After serving in the United States Navy, he moved to New York City in 1948 to attend the Juilliard School of Music. He studied composition, and graduated from Juilliard in 1953 with Bachelor's and Master's degrees. In 1953, Macero co-founded Charles Mingus' Jazz Composers Workshop, and became a major contributor to the New York City avant-garde jazz scene. As a composer, Macero wrote in an atonal style, as well as in third stream, a synthesis of jazz and classical music. He performed live, and recorded several albums with Mingus and the other Workshop members over the next three years, including Jazzical Moods (in 1954) and Jazz Composers Workshop (in 1955). During this time, Macero also recorded Explorations (DLP-6). While he had contributed compositions to other albums, this was the first full album of his own compositions, and Macero's first album as a leader. Macero plays tenor and alto saxophones on the album, and is joined by Orlando DiGirolamo on accordion, both Mingus and Lou Labella on basses, and Ed Shaughnessy on drums. Explorations was originally released in 1954 on Mingus' Debut Records, and was reissued on CD in 2006 on Fresh Sounds Records, with additional tracks. The 1958 short experimental film Bridges-Go- Round by filmmaker Shirley Clarke featured two alternative soundtracks, one by Louis and Bebe Barron and one by Macero. Composer and arranger Macero's first projects for Columbia included one side of What's New?, an album of original music in the emerging Third Stream genre that was shared with Bob Prince as well as arrangements for the first Johnny Mathis album. Macero continued to compose and arrange for a variety of artists during his time as a producer at Columbia, contributing tracks to (and still producing) several albums including Monk's Monk's Blues, and Something New, Something Blue, a collection of blues compositions and arrangements by Macero, Teddy Charles, Manny Albam, and Bill Russo. He contributed a track to (and produced) John Lewis and Gunther Schuller's Orchestra U.S.A. album, Sonorities, an album of third stream compositions, and he arranged music for easy listening pioneer, André Kostelanetz. He composed, conducted, and produced numerous television and film soundtracks and scores. He scored the 1970 Muhammad Ali documentary, a.k.a. Cassius Clay, and produced soundtrack music for True Romance, Finding Forrester, and Martin Scorsese's The Blues. Macero also composed for, conducted, and performed with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Salt Lake Symphony, the Kansas City Symphony, and the Juilliard School; and was commissioned by, and composed ballets for, the Joffrey Ballet Company, the Anna Sokolow Ballet Company, the London Ballet Company, the Juilliard Ballet Company, and the American Ballet Theatre. Columbia Records producer Macero found greater fame as a producer for Columbia Records. He joined in 1957, and produced hundreds of records while at the label, working with dozens of artists including Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Thelonious Monk, Johnny Mathis, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Tony Bennett, Charlie Byrd, Maynard Ferguson and Stan Getz. He was also responsible for signing Mingus, Monk, and Byrd to Columbia. Additionally, Macero produced over 100 albums of classical orchestral music for Columbia, including less conventional, contemporary pieces such as And God Created Great Whales by Alan Hovhaness, which required him to overlay recordings of humpbacked whale songs on to the orchestral track. Macero produced the seminal Dave Brubeck Quartet album Time Out, and Thelonious Monk's first Columbia recording, Monk's Dream, as well as his Underground. He also produced Mingus' first Columbia album, Mingus Ah Um. Macero is also acknowledged on the 1973 Mingus album Let My Children Hear Music, for \\"his untiring efforts in producing the best album I have ever made.\\" Beyond jazz, he was an associate producer on a number of Broadway original cast recordings including A Chorus Line and Bye Bye Birdie. And he produced the soundtrack to The Graduate, by Simon and Garfunkel. In another deviation from his standard focus on jazz, Macero produced Irish folk albums with the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem in the late 1960s. While Macero produced many artists' albums, he had an especially long and prolific relationship with Miles Davis. He produced or co-produced most of Davis' Columbia catalog including the classics Sketches of Spain and Someday My Prince Will Come. Macero's role of producer was further expanded on Davis' later forays into electric fusion, such as In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, and A Tribute to Jack Johnson, which were highlighted by Macero's innovative mixing and editing techniques. In 2001, Miles Davis biographer Paul Tingen likened Macero's role in the electric music of Davis to that of George Martin with the Beatles.Tingen, Paul: , Miles Beyond, Billboard Books, New York, 2001. Taking his cue from Tingen, Nick Southall described the impact of Macero's work on In a Silent Way in a 2003 Stylus Magazine article: > Behind the scenes, Miles and Teo took the tapes of the In a Silent Way > sessions and transformed some beautiful, folk-tinged, melody-driven sets > into two exquisite, beguiling and otherworldly pieces of music. Using > techniques that pre-dated the proliferation of tape loops, cut-ups, edits > and sequencing in rock, pop, hip hop and dance music, Miles and Teo took > apart the original recording and reassembled them outside of any traditional > or accepted jazz structure or melodic framework.

Some listeners and critics have complained that Macero overproduced Davis' recordings, and cut too much. But after hearing the unedited tapes from the In a Silent Way sessions, jazz critic John Ballon wrote that the original editing and production \\"attests to the producing genius of Teo Macero.\\" Ballon continues: > It took a force like Teo to splice together a cohesive album out of so many > inspired pieces. Not only did Teo have the balls to stand up to Miles on > creative decisions, he had the right. And Miles knew it.

On Davis' 1970 release Bitches Brew, Macero continued to expand his innovative practices, and \\"Bitches Brew not only became a controversial classic of musical innovation, it also became renowned for its pioneering use of studio technology.\\"Tingen, Paul: \\"The Making Of The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions.\\" Some of the controversy at the time also stemmed from the use of the word bitches in the title. Macero recalls that when Davis told him that he wanted to call it Bitches Brew, \\"I thought he was kidding.\\"Interview with Macero by Bobby Jackson. The album became the best-selling jazz album of its time, selling 500,000 copies by 1976, when most successful jazz albums sold less than 30,000 copies. Macero produced M.F. Horn 3 for Maynard Ferguson in 1973 as well as Ferguson's next album in 1974, M.F. Horn 4&5: Live At Jimmy's. On that album, Ferguson can be heard thanking Macero, noting that Macero \\"is sitting out in the street in the mobile thing\\" monitoring the recording. The album includes the piece Teonova in Macero's honor. Macero's innovative techniques were inspired partially by his association with avant-garde composer Edgard Varèse, and they continue to impact the way musicians, producers, and remixers work in the studio today. Brian Eno, a producer who has worked extensively with U2 and Talking Heads, among others, talked about Macero's influence on him in a 1996 interview with jazzthetik magazine. Eno describes being \\"fascinated\\" by Macero's editing techniques and the \\"spatial\\" quality he added to the music. \\"He did something that was extremely modern.\\"Engelbrecht, Michael: \\"Interview with Brian Eno\\", Jazzthetik, November 1996. In 1975, Macero left Columbia and formed his own production company. However, he continued to work with Davis until 1983, and continued to produce records for Columbia throughout his career. Other work After his tenure at Columbia, Macero continued as a player and producer on other projects, working with Brubeck, Tony Bennett, Herbie Hancock, Asha Puthli, Michel Legrand, Wallace Roney, Shirley MacLaine, Vernon Reid, Robert Palmer, and DJ Logic. In the 1970s and 1980s, Macero released a handful of his own albums, including Time Plus Seven, Impressions of Charles Mingus, and Acoustical Suspension, before founding his own label, Teorecords, in 1999. Subsequently, he released over a dozen albums of original compositions, and continued to produce reissues of Miles Davis and other artists for various record companies. However, Macero was outspoken in his opposition to the practice of adding back alternate takes that didn't appear on the original albums, or otherwise altering the original music, on the grounds that it corrupts the intentions of the musicians and the producer at the time the recording was made. \\"They put all the mistakes back in,\\" said Macero. \\"Don't destroy the original record.\\" Films A Teo Macero documentary film, Play That, Teo, was produced by Olana DiGirolamo, daughter of Macero's friend and collaborator, Orlando DiGirolamo. Shot by cinematographer Fortunato Procopio, the film features a behind-the-scenes look at the person behind the persona, and includes photos, archival footage, and recordings from Macero's personal collection.Play That, Teo film information at official website. Another documentary, Teo, was filmed by producer/director Daragh McCarthy and features Teo Macero's last recording session and extensive interviews. Death On the evening of February 19, 2008, Macero died in his sleep, having long suffered from pneumonia. He was 82.

It was adopted in 1975. Made by the Tula Arms Plant (Тульский Оружейный Завод, Tul'skiy Oruzheynyy Zavod) in Russia, it is exported by Rosoboronexport. Under water, ordinary bullets are inaccurate and have a very short range. The APS fires a 120 mm (4.75 in) long 5.66 mm calibre steel bolt specially designed for this weapon. Its magazine holds 26 rounds. The APS's barrel is not rifled; the fired projectile is kept in line by hydrodynamic effects; as a result, the APS is somewhat inaccurate when fired out of water. The APS has a longer range and more penetrating power than spearguns. This is useful in such situations such as shooting an opposing diver through a reinforced dry suit, a protective helmet (whether air-holding or not), thick tough parts of breathing sets and their harnesses, and the plastic casings and transparent covers of some small underwater vehicles. The APS is more powerful than a pistol, but is bulkier and takes longer to aim, particularly swinging its long barrel and large flat magazine sideways through water. History The rising threat of attacks by frogmen in naval bases caused various anti-frogman techniques to be developed, and in the USSR one of these was guard frogmen sent to stop the attackers. At first these guard frogmen were armed only with knives and AK-type rifles. The rifle was carried in a waterproof case and could be used only on the surface, so the only effective underwater weapon against enemy frogmen was the knife. The SPP-1 underwater pistol was accepted in 1971, but soon proved to be useful for close-up self-defence rather than in attacking more distant targets. Vladimir Simonov undertook the job of developing an underwater assault rifle. To allow the rifle's mechanism to work under water, there had to be room for the flow of the water pushed aside by moving parts and by the gas produced by the propellant explosive in the cartridge. The APS rifle was accepted for use in the mid-1970s. One special improvement was a perforated gas tube, and in the sighting. Its design engineer received a state award in 1983. As with the SPP-1 the first stage of the work was to develop a cartridge. A by cartridge was lengthened by about to fit the sharp-fronted steel bolt. Another cartridge version was designed that contained a miniature rocket, which when fired makes a visible streak in the water. Next, Vladimir Simonov designed the rifle. The objective was ambitious; nobody had ever before tried to build a functioning automatic underwater firearm. The most important problem was designing a receiver that could work under water. Compared to air, water is relatively incompressible, so the structure had to let water move around easily; as a result, its receiver is open at the rear. Since it operates on the principle of gas discharge, it has a gas controller to let it work both underwater and on land. The APS was adopted in the mid-1970s. Afterwards, there was lengthy improvement work on the APS. One improvement was fitting a perforated gas pipe with a special shield to break up the emitted gas bubbles, making targeting easier and reducing the visibility of the bubbles, allowing stealthier firing of the weapon. The APS was the primary weapon of Soviet frogmen and Serbian river flotilla frogmen. However, since the conception of this new weapon there were objections. It was the perfect weapon for the Soviet frogmen's underwater operations, but it was less useful for Spetsnaz soldiers fighting both on land and under water. Out of water the APS can shoot, but its effective range does not exceed 50 metres, and the rifle's lifetime drops to 180 shots in air from 2,000 shots underwater. Therefore, they mostly carried a SPP-1 pistol for self-defence under water and an AK-74 to fight on land. At the end of the 1980s the ASM-DT amphibious rifle was developed.

It was most predominantly practiced in Southeast Asian and Oceanic cultures, particularly among Austronesian, Austroasiatic, and Kra-Dai-speaking peoples. It was also practiced in Japan prior to the Meiji era, as well as in India. It was also performed among some groups in the Americas, most notably among the Shuar people of northern Peru and Ecuador. Also in Russia at least since XVII. Teeth blackening is usually done during puberty. It was primarily done to preserve the teeth into old age, as it prevents tooth decay similar to the mechanism of modern dental sealants. It was seen as a sign of maturity, beauty, and of civilization. A common belief is that blackened teeth differentiated humans from animals. Teeth blackening is often done in conjunction with traditions of teeth filing and evulsion, as well as other body modification customs like tattoos. Teeth blackening and filing were regarded with fascination and disapproval by early European explorers and colonists. The practice survives in some isolated ethnic groups in Southeast Asia and Oceania but has mostly disappeared after the introduction of Western beauty standards during the colonial era. Teeth blackening is commonly confused with the red-stained teeth from betel chewing. However, betel chewing damages the teeth and gums while teeth blackening does not. By country Japan Ohaguro Ukiyo-e of yama- uba with blackened teeth and Kintarō In Japan, teeth blackening is known as . Ohaguro existed in one form or another for hundreds of years and was seen amongst the population as beautiful until the end of the Meiji period. Objects that were pitch black, such as glaze-like lacquer, were seen as beautiful. Name The word \\"ohaguro\\" was a Japanese aristocratic term. There is an alternate reading for ohaguro, 鉄漿 kane (literally 'iron drink'). At the old Imperial palace in Kyoto, it was called . Among the civilians, such words as , and were used.  History  *Traces of blackened teeth can be seen in the buried bones and haniwa (250 to 538 CE) from the Kofun period. *Shōsōin, a treasure house connected to Tōdai-ji in Nara, holds the teachings brought to Japan by Jianzhen in 753. References to ohaguro exist in The Tale of GenjiMurasaki Shikibu, The Tale of Genji, translated by Royall Tyler. Chapter 6, page 130. Penguin Classics. Reprint 2003. First published 2001. - see also note 57 by Royall Tyler and Tsutsumi Chūnagon Monogatari. At the end of the Heian period, at the time when aristocratic men and woman reached puberty and celebrated their genpuku or mogi, the Taira clan and other samurai, and pages working at large temples, dyed their teeth. In particular, the imperial family and other high-ranking aristocrats who had finished their hakamaza (ceremony where a child is fitted with a hakama) blackened their teeth and painted their eyebrows (). This was done in the imperial household until the end of the Edo era. In the Muromachi period, ohaguro was generally seen among adults, though when the Sengoku period arrived, so as to prepare for political marriages of convenience, when the daughters of military commanders were around 8 to 10 years old, they would blacken their teeth as a marking of their coming of age. Relatives and guardians of the bride who blackened their teeth were called kaneoya (鉄漿親). It is said that military commanders who were struck in the head on the battlefield and who did not want to be ugly would wear average women's makeup and would blacken their teeth. These faces imitated the Noh masks of women and young boys. After the Edo period, only men of the Imperial House of Japan and the aristocracy blackened their teeth. Due to the odor and labor required for the process, as well as a feeling among young women that they were aging, ohaguro was done only by married women, unmarried women who were older than 18, sex workers and geisha. For rural people, ohaguro was done only at times of special celebrations, such as Japanese festivals, wedding ceremonies, and funerals. There were also depictions of ohaguro in fairy tales, such as \\"Gon, the Little Fox\\". On February 5, 1870, the government banned ohaguro and the process gradually became obsolete. After the Meiji period, it temporarily spread, but it almost entirely died out in the Taishō period (ending in 1927). In contemporary times, the only places where ohaguro can be seen is in plays, hanamachi (geisha districts), some festivals, and movies. Social function Many Westerners, including Engelbert Kaempfer, Philipp Franz von Siebold, and Rutherford Alcock, who visited Edo-era Japan, described ohaguro as an abhorrent custom which disfigured women.Kyouji Watanabe, \\"Yukishi Yono Omokage\\", Kindle location 5778, , Published by Heibonsha. Alcock conjectured that the purpose of it is chastity by making the women intentionally unattractive to prevent extramarital relationships. Japanese social scientist Kyouji Watanabe disagrees with this theory. Based on the fact that Japanese girls were allowed a large degree of both social and sexual liberty until the time of Ohaguro, when they assumed the responsibility of wife and mother, Watanabe thinks that it was a social ritual by which both society and girls confirmed the determination of matured women.Kyouji Watanabe, \\"Yukishi Yono Omokage\\", Kindle location 5778, , Published by Heibonsha. Dyes The main ingredient was a dark-brown solution of ferric acetate called kanemizu (かねみず), made by dissolving iron filings in vinegar. When the solution was combined with vegetable tannins from such sources as gallnut powder or tea powder, it would turn black and become non- water-soluble, in the same manner that iron gall ink is produced. Coating the teeth with this liquid helped to prevent tooth decay and enamel decay. The dye had to be applied once a day or once every few days. As a convenient prescription, a fine powder of gallnut powder, sulfuric acid, and oyster shell could also be applied to the teeth, though this never really caught on. In theatrical plays, ink mixed with turpentine was used, though these days, ink mixed with tooth wax is used. Superstitions and urban legends *In the Meiji period, a rumor spread about an area where a virgin's blood was painted on an electric line. As a result of not wanting to have their blood taken as well, many of the young women in this area changed their appearances to match those of married women by blackening their teeth, painting their eyebrows and wearing simple kimono. *In Yamada Norio's 2010 book , a story about Fukushima Prefecture is described . Elsewhere A Vietnamese woman with blackened teeth The practice of blackening teeth continues among many minority groups in China, Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia. It is mainly prevalent in older women, though the practice is still carried on by some younger women. Sometimes artificial teeth are used to achieve blackened teeth. In Vietnam, tooth painting was practiced by the majority Vietnamese people as well as by minority ethnic groups. Si La men paint their teeth red and the women paint theirs black. This practice has slowly declined with each new generation. The Baiyue in southern China and northern Vietnam practiced teeth blackening. When Han Chinese ruled the Vietnamese in the Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam due to the Ming dynasty's conquest during the Ming–Hồ War, they imposed the Han Chinese style of men wearing long hair on short haired Vietnamese men. Vietnamese were ordered to stop cutting and instead grow their hair long and switch to Han Chinese clothing in only a month by a Ming official. Ming administrators said their mission was to civilize the unorthodox Vietnamese barbarians. The Ming dynasty only wanted the Vietnamese to wear long hair and to stop teeth blackening so they could have white teeth and long hair like Chinese. A royal edict was issued by Vietnam in 1474 forbidding Vietnamese from adopting foreign languages, hairstyles and clothes like that of the Lao, Champa or the \\"Northerners\\" which referred to the Ming. The edict was recorded in the 1479 Complete Chronicle of Dai Viet of Ngô Sĩ Liên. In the Philippines, Spanish colonial official and historian, Antonio de Morga, recorded in his book, Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas (1609), on how local men and women of the Philippines cared and presented themselves at the time. It was noted by Morga: \\"All are very careful of their teeth, which from a very early age they file and render even, with stones and iron. They dye them a black color, which is lasting, and which preserves their teeth until they are very old, although it is ugly to look at.\\" The late 19th century Filipino nationalist, writer, and polymath, José Rizal, commented in his annotations to Morga's account that: \\"This custom still exists... This custom exists also among the married women of Japan, as a Sign of their chastity. It is now falling into disuse.\\" * Yunnan, China ** Blang people ** Dai ** Hmoob ** Jino ** Gin (Vietnamese descent in China) ** Lahu ** Yao * Laos ** Hani ** Katu ** Phunoi * Philippines ** Luzon * Pacific Islands ** Palau ** Yap ** Mariana Islands * Thailand ** Akha ** Lisu * Vietnam ** Kinh ** Yao ** Lu ** Hmoob Dub ** Nùng ** Si La * India Further west, teeth blackening has been documented as far as Madagascar.

In its most basic form, it states that if L/K is a cyclic extension of fields with Galois group G = Gal(L/K) generated by an element \\\\sigma, and if a is an element of L of relative norm 1, then there exists b in L such that :a=\\\\sigma(b)/b. The theorem takes its name from the fact that it is the 90th theorem in David Hilbert's famous Zahlbericht , although it is originally due to . Often a more general theorem due to is given the name, stating that if L/K is a finite Galois extension of fields with Galois group G = Gal(L/K), then the first cohomology group is trivial: :H^1(G,L^\\\\times)=\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}.  Examples  Let L/K be the quadratic extension \\\\Q(i)/\\\\Q. The Galois group is cyclic of order 2, its generator s acting via conjugation: : s: c + di\\\\mapsto c - di. An element x=a+bi in L has norm xx^s=a^2 +b^2. An element of norm one corresponds to a rational solution of the equation a^2+b^2=1 or in other words, a point with rational coordinates on the unit circle. Hilbert's Theorem 90 then states that every such element y of norm one can be parametrized (with integral c, d) as : y=\\\\frac{c+di}{c-di}=\\\\frac{c^2-d^2}{c^2+d^2} + \\\\frac{2cd}{c^2+d^2} i which may be viewed as a rational parametrization of the rational points on the unit circle. Rational points (x,y)=(a/c,b/c) on the unit circle x^2+y^2=1 correspond to Pythagorean triples, i.e. triples (a,b,c) of integers satisfying a^2+b^2=c^2. Cohomology The theorem can be stated in terms of group cohomology: if L× is the multiplicative group of any (not necessarily finite) Galois extension L of a field K with corresponding Galois group G, then :H^1(G,L^\\\\times)=\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}. A further generalization using non-abelian group cohomology states that if H is either the general or special linear group over L, then :H^1(G,H)=\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}. This is a generalization since L^\\\\times=\\\\operatorname{GL}_1(L). Another generalization is :H^1_{\\\\acute{e}t}(X,\\\\mathbb{G}_m) = H^1(X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X^\\\\times) = \\\\operatorname{Pic}(X) for X a scheme, and another one to Milnor K-theory plays a role in Voevodsky's proof of the Milnor conjecture. Proof Elementary Let L/K be cyclic of degree n, and \\\\sigma generate \\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K). Pick any a\\\\in L of norm :N(a):=a \\\\sigma(a) \\\\sigma^2(a)\\\\cdots \\\\sigma^{n-1}(a)=1. By clearing denominators, solving a=x/\\\\sigma(x) \\\\in L is the same as showing that a\\\\sigma(\\\\cdot) : L \\\\to L has eigenvalue 1. Extend this to a map of L-vector spaces :\\\\begin{cases} 1_L\\\\otimes a\\\\sigma(\\\\cdot): L\\\\otimes_KL \\\\to L\\\\otimes_K L \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ell \\\\otimes\\\\ell'\\\\mapsto \\\\ell\\\\otimes a\\\\sigma(\\\\ell')\\\\end{cases} The primitive element theorem gives L=K(\\\\alpha) for some \\\\alpha. Since \\\\alpha has minimal polynomial :f(t)=(t-\\\\alpha)(t-\\\\sigma(\\\\alpha))\\\\cdots \\\\left (t-\\\\sigma^{n-1}(\\\\alpha) \\\\right ) \\\\in K[t], we identify :L\\\\otimes_KL\\\\stackrel{\\\\sim}{\\\\to} L\\\\otimes_K K[t] /f(t) \\\\stackrel{\\\\sim}{\\\\to} L[t]/f(t) \\\\stackrel{\\\\sim}{\\\\to} L^{n} via :\\\\ell\\\\otimes p(\\\\alpha) \\\\mapsto \\\\ell \\\\left (p(\\\\alpha), p(\\\\sigma \\\\alpha ),\\\\ldots , p(\\\\sigma^{n-1} \\\\alpha ) \\\\right ). Here we wrote the second factor as a K-polynomial in \\\\alpha. Under this identification, our map :\\\\begin{cases} a\\\\sigma(\\\\cdot): L^n\\\\to L^n \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ell \\\\left(p(\\\\alpha),\\\\ldots, p(\\\\sigma^{n-1}\\\\alpha)) \\\\mapsto \\\\ell(ap(\\\\sigma\\\\alpha), \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma^{n-1} a p(\\\\sigma^n\\\\alpha) \\\\right ) \\\\end{cases} That is to say under this map :(\\\\ell_1, \\\\ldots ,\\\\ell_n)\\\\mapsto (a \\\\ell_n, \\\\sigma a \\\\ell_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma^{n-1} a \\\\ell_{n-1}).

Lancer Publishers LLC. ″In an entirely different version, there is reference to a selfcreated daughter of Brahma called Shatarupa (literally meaning hundred forms).\\" (śata-rūpā = \\"she of a hundred beautiful forms/one who can acquire hundred forms\\"). According to the Matsya Purana, Shatarupa was known by different names, including Satarupa, Sandhya and Brahmi. According to Brahma Purana, Shatarupa is regarded as the first woman to be created by Brahma along with Manu.The Brahma Purana declares: \\"To continue with Creation, Brahma gave form to a Man and a Woman. The man was Swayambhu Manu and the Woman was named Shatrupa. Humans are descended from Manu, that is the reason they are known as Manusya.\\" Hindu mythology uses a story to explain Brahma’s four heads. When Brahma created Shatarupa, he was immediately infatuated and pursued her wherever she went. Shatarupā moved in various directions to avoid his gaze but wherever she went, Brahmā developed another head until he had four, one for each direction of the compass. Desperate, Shatarupa leaped over him to stay out of his gaze even for a moment. A fifth head, however, appeared above the others. Thus, Brahmā developed five heads. At this moment Shiva appeared, determined that since Shatarupā was Brahma's daughter (being created by him), it was wrong and merged into devi Mookambika and formed the Ardhanarishvara, translated as \\"half-man and half-woman god.\\" Shiva told Brahma that males and females are both the same as their souls are exactly the same, and the soul doesn’t have a gender only material. The outer body is different only because of different body parts. Shatarupa married Svayambhuva Manu and had five children — two sons, Priyavrata and Uttānapāda, and three daughters, Ākūti, Devahūti and Prasuti.Dipavali Debroy, Bibek Debroy (1992).

Ecclesiastical ritual would also be parodied and higher and lower level clergy would change places.https://books.google.com/books?id=xxCwTYubvDkC&pg;=PT77&lpg;=PT77&dq;=feast+of+fools+false+bishop&source;=bl&ots;=zJI0wO_ygR&sig;=ACfU3U2vlvrGXJmCcwz- oRCbZwmCPEam9g&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjy386WhpPnAhXHbc0KHUW1DOgQ6AEwB3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q;=feast%20of%20fools%20false%20bishop&f;=falsehttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Feast- of-Fools The passage of time has considerably obscured modern understandings of the nature and meaning of this celebration, which originated in proper liturgical observance, and has more to do with other examples of medieval liturgical drama than with either the earlier pagan (Roman) feasts of Saturnalia and Kalends or the later bourgeois lay sotie.See Harris, Max, 2011. Sacred Folly: A New History of the Feast of Fools. (Ithaca, N.Y. and London: Cornell University Press). , 239-284. Context The central idea appears to have been a brief social revolution, in which power, dignity and impunity is briefly conferred on those in a subordinate position. In the views of later commentators, this makes the medieval festival a successor to the Roman Kalends of January, although there is no continuity between the two celebrations.Harris, Max, 2011. Sacred Folly: A New History of the Feast of Fools. (Ithaca, N.Y. and London: Cornell University Press). , 11-63. Lower level clergy would participate in the festival and hold masses which would mock usual church traditions. Many of the most colourful descriptions of the medieval festival are a result of centuries of misunderstandings and unscholarly conflations of events widely dispersed in time and place; many rely on the condemnations of later writers, which either exaggerate or deliberately misreport what was effectively an orderly, if not always fully scripted, liturgical celebration with some dramatic elements.Harris, Max, 2011. Sacred Folly: A New History of the Feast of Fools. (Ithaca, N.Y. and London: Cornell University Press). , 65-127. The involvement of inversion (subdeacons occupying the roles normally fulfilled by higher clergy) and the 'fools' symbolised orthodox biblical ideas of humility (e.g. the last being first) and becoming a 'fool for Christ' (1 Corinthians 4:10).Harris, Max, 2011. Sacred Folly: A New History of the Feast of Fools. (Ithaca, N.Y. and London: Cornell University Press). , 67. In the Middle Ages, particularly in France, the Feast of Fools was staged on or about the Feast of the Circumcision, 1 January. It is related to certain other liturgical dramas, such, for example, as the Feast of the Ass, the Play of Daniel, and the Office of the Star. So far as the Feast of Fools had an independent existence, it seems to have grown out of a special \\"festival of the subdeacons\\", which John Beleth, a liturgical writer of the twelfth century sometimes thought to have been an Englishman by birth, assigns to the day of the Circumcision. He is the earliest to draw attention to the fact that, as the deacons had a special celebration on St Stephen's day 26 December, the priests on St John the Evangelist's day 27 December, and again the choristers and mass-servers on the Feast of the Holy Innocents on 28 December, so the subdeacons were accustomed to hold their feast about the same time of year, but more particularly on the festival of the Circumcision. Official condemnation Feast of Fools, Misericord carving in Beverley Minster, East Yorkshire The Feast of Fools and the almost blasphemous extravagances in some instances associated with it were constantly the object of sweeping condemnations of the medieval Church. On the other hand, some Catholic writers have thought it necessary to try to deny the existence of such abuses. One interpretation that reconciles this contradiction is that, while there can be no question that Church authorities of the calibre of Robert Grosseteste repeatedly condemned the licence of the Feast of Fools in the strongest terms, such firmly rooted customs took centuries to eradicate. It is certain that the practice lent itself to serious abuses, whose nature and gravity varied at different epochs. It should be said that among the thousands of European liturgical manuscripts the occurrence of anything which has to do with the Feast of Fools is extraordinarily rare. It never occurs in the principal liturgical books, the missals and breviaries. There are traces occasionally in a prose or a trope found in a gradual or an antiphonary. It would therefore seem there was little official approval for such extravagances, which were rarely committed to writing. With a view to checking the abuses committed in the celebration of the Feast of Fools on New Year's Day at Notre-Dame de Paris in the twelfth century, the celebration was not entirely banned, but the part of the \\"Lord of Misrule\\" or \\"Precentor Stultorum\\" was restrained, so that he was to be allowed to intone the prose \\"Laetemur gaudiis\\", and to wield the precentor's staff, but this before the first Vespers of the feast, not during it. During the second Vespers, it had been the custom that the precentor of the fools should be deprived of his staff when the verse in the Magnificat, Deposuit potentes de sede (\\"He has put down the mighty from their seat\\") was sung. Hence the feast was often known as the \\"Festum 'Deposuit'\\". Eudes de Sully allowed the staff to be taken at that point from the mock precentor, but laid down that the verse \\"Deposuit\\" not be repeated more than five times. There was a similar case of a legitimised Feast of Fools at Sens about 1220, where the whole text of the office has survived. There are many proses and interpolations (farsurae) added to the ordinary liturgy, but nothing much unseemly. This prose or conductus, was not a part of the office, but only a preliminary to Vespers. In 1245 Cardinal Odo, the papal legate in France, wrote to the Chapter of Sens Cathedral demanding that the feast be celebrated with no un-clerical dress and no wreaths of flowers. The Feast of Fools was forbidden under the severe penalties by the Council of Basel in 1431 and a strongly worded document issued by the theological faculty of the University of Paris in 1444; numerous decrees of provincial councils followed. The Feast of Fools was condemned by early Protestants, and among Catholics it seems that the abuse had largely disappeared by the time of the Council of Trent, though instances of festivals of this kind survived in France as late as the 16th century. In popular culture Victor Hugo recreated a picturesque account of a Feast of Fools in his 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame, in which it is celebrated on January 6, 1482 and Quasimodo serves as Pope of Fools. This is shown in Disney's 1996 animated film version of the novel through the song \\"Topsy Turvy\\".

According to Donlyn Lyndon, \\"if you stand on the corner of Clarendon Street and St. James Avenue and look directly into the mirrored surface of the third Hancock, you will see reflected there the first two, aligned hierarchically in an ethereal family portrait.\\" Originally, the Planned Development Area (PDA) agreement for the building of the 60-story John Hancock Tower called for 197 Clarendon to be demolished to make way for open space or a public square. In 1982, the Boston Redevelopment Authority, responding to a request from the John Hancock company, decided that it would be better to keep the building on the tax rolls. It was also thought that open space near the base of the tower might not be desirable, due to the tower's \\"wind tunnel\\" effect. 200 Berkeley Street, Old John Hancock (1947) The Berkeley Building (also known as the Old John Hancock Building) is a 26-story, 495-foot (151 m) structure located at 200 Berkeley Street, the second of the three John Hancock buildings built in Boston.

It has 15,000 employees as of 2018. IAI is completely state- owned by the government of Israel. IAI designs, develops, produces and maintains civil aircraft, drones, fighter aircraft, missile, avionics, and space-based systems. Although IAI's main focus is engineering, aviation and high-tech electronics, it also manufactures military systems for ground and naval forces. Many of these products are specially suited for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) needs, while others are also marketed to foreign militaries. History Israel Aerospace Industries was founded in 1953 as Bedek Aviation Company under the initiative of Shimon Peres, then director general of the Ministry of Defense, in order to maintain Israel Defense Forces aircraft.Shimon Peres – Profile, Defense News The company originally had 70 employees and recruited American born aviation expert Al Schwimmer as the company's founder and first president.Al Schwimmer, founder of Israel Aircraft Industries, dies at 94 Haaretz, 11.06.11 First aircraft manufacturing IAI Tzukit of the IAF Aerobatic Team (2007) In 1959 Bedek began manufacturing its first aircraft, a V-tailed twinjet trainer of French design, the Fouga CM.170 Magister, locally called Tzukit (Monticola). The Tzukit became the Israeli Air Force principal trainer for 50 years. The IAI Tzukit was also used in the 1967 Six-Day War by 147 Squadron as a close support aircraft, attacking targets on the Egyptian front during the first day of the war, when Israel's more capable combat aircraft were deployed against Arab air bases and aircraft.Aloni 2001, p.44. They were then deployed against Jordanian forces, including armour, on the West Bank. The Magister proved effective at the close-support mission albeit with heavy casualties, with six being lost.Aloni 2001, pp. 49–51, 54–55. The first aircraft to be fully designed and built by IAI, the IAI Arava short take-off and landing transport aircraft, first flew in 1969 after three years of development. The French embargo impact IAI Kfir In response to the French embargo, IAI began developing its own fighter aircraft, a derivative of the Mirage 5 called the IAI Nesher (\\"hawk\\"), in 1968. The Nesher entered service in 1971, in time for the Yom Kippur War. The Nesher was followed by the IAI Kfir (\\"lion cub\\"), which was developed as a result of Israel's need for adapting the Dassault Mirage III to the specific requirements of the Israeli Air Force. The Kfir entered service with the IAF in 1975, the first units being assigned to the 101st \\"First Fighter\\" Squadron. Over the following years, several other squadrons were also equipped with the new aircraft. The Kfir's first recorded combat action took place on 9 November 1977, during an Israeli air strike on a training camp at Tel Azia, in Lebanon. The only air victory claimed by a Kfir during its service with the IAF occurred on 27 June 1979 when a Kfir C.2 shot down a Syrian MiG-21. The IAI Kfir has been exported to Colombia, Ecuador, Sri Lanka and was leased to the US Navy and the US Marine Corps from 1985 to 1989, to act as adversary aircraft in dissimilar air combat training.IAI will lease Kfir aircraft to US Air Force, Navy – Globes; 18 June 2003 Diversification IAI Gabriel In 1969 IAI acquired North American Rockwell's Jet Commander series of business aircraft. This became the basis for the IAI Westwind line. Work on an improved Westwind the Astra, by stretching the fuselage and designing a new swept wing, began in the late 1970s,Relman 1993, p. 314. with the first prototype flight on 19 March 1984.Relman 1993, p. 316. The first production Astra flew on 20 March 1985, FAA certification came on 29 August 1985 and customer deliveries started in 1986. In the 1960s, IAI developed the Gabriel anti-ship missile and the Elta Electronics Industries subsidiary developed an inexpensive aircraft radar which would become a successful export item. In the 1970s IAI developed the Dabur class patrol boat. In the 1970s IAI also entered the Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market with the development of the IAI Scout. In 1984, IAI formed a joint venture with rival Israeli company Tadiran to market both companies' UAV's, the Tadiran Mastiff and the IAI Scout.\\"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\\" by Greg Goebel Developing the maintenance, repair and overhaul business By 1980s the original Bedek maintenance business was conducting extensive overhauls on dozens of different aircraft types, working on engines as well as airframes and interiors, IAI could provide more comprehensive refurbishments than even the aircraft manufacturers themselves. The unit had 4,000 employees by the mid-1980s and overhauled a huge range of aircraft, from propeller-driven trainers to airliners; including big civil aviation programs, such as conversion of Boeing 747s to freighters. The Lavi program IAI Lavi In 1980 the Government of Israel decided to use the experience IAI had accumulated to develop and manufacture a modern fighter plane to be the mainstay of the Israel Air Force. The aircraft, called the IAI Lavi, was to be a superior attack aircraft with advanced weapons systems. It had its rollout in July 1986 and successful maiden flight in December 1986. In August 1987, after extensive government deliberations, the decision was made (by one vote) to cancel the Lavi program, due to the questioning of Israel's economic ability to support the cost of such an extensive program. This led to a serious crisis at IAI which necessitated a major reorganization of the company's structure and business strategy; the company's work force of more than 22,000 people was cut by 5,500 in 1988. However, the Lavi program was credited with developing a number of advanced technologies that IAI was able to market. 1990s onwardsexport led growth An Ofeq surveillance satellite launch utilising the Shavit space vehicle Model of an Amos-5 satellite during \\"Semana de Espacio\\", in IFEMA, Madrid Arrow 3 missile The Avocet ProJet with IAI Logo The IAI Harop loitering anti-radiation drone LAHAT laser-guided anti- tank missile system LORA tactical ballistic missile system The Guardium unmanned ground vehicle By 1989 IAI posted a profit of $11.8 million on sales of $1.28 billion. The company had four divisions—Aircraft, Aviation, Electronics, and Technologies—and 17 factories. IAI was established as a world leader in upgrading aircraft. Planes such as the Vietnam-era McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II were modernized with advanced avionics and weaponry. In the 1990s IAI entered the space race with the AMOS communications satellites, Ofeq observation satellites and the Shavit space launcher. In December 1997, the IAI Galaxy, a business jet with an intercontinental range developed as a joint venture Galaxy Aerospace with the Hyatt Corporation, made its first flight and entered service in 2000. In May 2001, General Dynamics' Gulfstream Aerospace bought IAI's Galaxy Aerospace Co. L.P. unit for $330 million, although IAI continues to perform the most of the assembly and development of the jets which are marketed by Gulfstream.Israel IAI-1126 Galaxy/Gulfstream G200. Airliners.net. In 2003, Israel Aircraft Industries attempted to enter the VLJ (very light jet) Market by launching the Avocet ProJet, a 6–8 seat high utilization air taxi with a list price almost half the cost of the least expensive business jet available at that time. In early 2006, ProJet development stalled after a major undisclosed US OEM pulled out of the program due to unspecified reasons.Aviation International News, September 2003 The company was working with the Aviation Technology Group on a military trainer version of the ATG Javelin, a fighter style personal jet. The version being developed would have competed against a large field of jet trainers at a much lower cost of acquisition and maintenance. ATG halted development of the Javelin in 2008 due to a lack of funds. In March 2004 IAI signed a $1.1 billion contract with India to install three EL/W-2090 AWACS systems on Russian-made Ilyushin Il-76 transports, which are based in part on IAI's earlier EL/M-2075 Phalcon platform which was developed in the 1990s.Indian AWACS Moving Forward on 2 Fronts Defense Industry Daily, 8 June 2011 In the late 2000s IAI developed the follow-on EL/W-2085 system which is installed on heavily modified Gulfstream G550 aircraft and which besides serving in the IAF were also sold to Singapore and Italy. On 6 November 2006, IAI changed its corporate name from \\"Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd.\\" to \\"Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd.\\"; to more accurately reflect the current scope of the firm's business activities, which includes not just aircraft, but also systems, satellites and launchers, as well as maritime and ground systems. On 13 April 2009, the Moscow Times reported that the Russian Defense Ministry had signed an agreement with Israel Aerospace to purchase $50 million in pilotless drone aircraft. The contract reportedly includes three types of UAVs manufactured by the company.Combined Dispatches, \\"Red-Faced Military Buys Israeli Drones\\", Moscow Times, 13 April 2009. In January 2012, IAI announced a sale of $1.1 billion of defense systems to an Asian country. The deal has been signed but the company did not name the buyer. It was reported that the sale will include IAI aircraft, missiles and intelligence technologies. On 4 September 2012, the Gulfstream G280, a new twin-engine business jet built by IAI, received full certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).Sarsfield, Kate \\"Israel and USA grant full certification for Gulfstream G280\\". Flight International, 4 September 2012. IAI is a member of the prestigious Trace International and Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics (SCCE) organizations and recognized in the Transparency International April 2015 report to be in the top third of worldwide defense companies for its ethics and anti-corruption programs. In April 2018, IAI systems were observed in a film made by the Azerbaijan Army, specifically the IAI Harop loitering munition system, resulting in criticism from the Armenian government concerning the supply of Israeli arms to the Azeri army. In 2019, IAI sells drone defense systems to governments to be placed in sensitive areas such as borders, army bases, or power plans, and provides equipment to shoot down military drones as well. It also sells to clients such as airports looking to protect against consumer drones. IAI in 2019 is Israel’s major aerospace and defense manufacturer. It released its Popstar system in September 2019, which \\"can detect and track drones up to 4 km away in day or night\\". IAI advised customers in December 2019 not to fly some Boeing 737 freighters it had converted, after IAI said it detected an \\"apparent irregularity\\" in the production process. IAI's converted 737s had come into service in 2003.

Its primary focus is to teach swimmers to move through the water efficiently. By conserving energy and focusing on balance and streamlining in the water, any energy used for propulsion becomes much more effective. Basic principles of teaching include sustainability of effort, drag reduction, vessel shaping and full body swimming. Principles Total Immersion is distinct as a swimming method due to the combination of principles including the body's physical movement through the water, teaching methods focused on how the brain acquires new information about motor skills, and an approach to the practice of movement which many find similar to the practice of yoga or Tai Chi. Balance Total Immersion focuses on a handful of core principles that apply to any body moving through a fluid medium whether it be a boat, a submarine, an aquatic mammal, or a fish. It emphasizes greater efficiency and lowered resistance by teaching drills and focal points that keep the swimmer's hips near the surface, reducing the drag profile of the body. Balance in the water refers to having hips, shoulders, and head all level with the surface of the water. The body acts like a see–saw with the lungs as the fulcrum. Because the legs typically weigh more than the head and upper body, swimmers must focus on getting weight forward of the lungs in order to bring the hips to the surface. Adjusting head position, usually by lowering it, and having the arms in front of the lungs by almost overlapping the timing of the stroke helps to balance the body in the same way a see–saw balances by adding weight to one side. This stroke timing is frequently called \\"front quadrant swimming\\".Total Immersion T. Laughlin & J. Delves pp. 37–41 & 90-91 Streamlining After learning how to balance in the water, the next main focus in total immersion is streamlining the body. Streamlining is another element of drag reduction that allows the swimmer to be more efficient. Static streamlining refers to positions such as \\"skating\\" in which one arm is extended forward creating a leading point and a tapered body following the arm, much like a torpedo or bullet is shaped. Active streamlining refers to maintaining the streamlined body position while the body rotates from right-side streamline to left-side streamline. Several drills in the method allow the swimmer to practice shifting from streamline to streamline until these movements feel natural. An additional benefit of the streamlined body position is to help maintain a long bodyline in the water, which may help to reduce wave drag and allow the swimmer to slip forward through the water more easily. Propulsion Propulsion allows the swimmer to move forward through the water by overcoming drag. Total Immersion teaches propulsive methods after balance and streamlining. A swimmer's forward speed is the difference between the force produced in propelling actions and the force generated by drag. Movements and body positions that minimize drag require coordination and practice but very little strength and thus improve efficiency. Creating propulsive force requires the use of muscular strength, which uses far more energy. Rather than dividing the propulsive techniques into a front half that \\"pulls\\" the body forward and a back half that \\"pushes\\" via kicking, Total Immersion drills & swimming always emphasize full body integration, dividing the body into a streamlined left side alternating with a streamlined right side. Rather than increasing the power of the swimmer's leg kick or arm pull, Total Immersion emphasizes coordinated spearing movements with a well-timed two-beat kick. Target audience Total Immersion is a popular swimming technique with adult learners and triathletes because of its systematic progression of skills. This approach can be beneficial to entry- level adult swimmers, triathletes, distance swimmers, and those who swim for exercise and health. The focus on efficiency and stroke length can be applied to swimming in competition as well. Terry Laughlin, founder of Total Immersion, coached the West Point Sprinters from 1996 to 1999. Joe Novak, one of his athletes, remains one of West Point's most notable sprinters, under Terry's coaching. Joe won nine gold medals in Patriot League Championships, having won the 50m Freestyle, 100m Freestyle and 100m Butterfly in 1996, 1997, and 1998.Patriot League Learning approach TI treats swimming with a similar approach to many martial arts, with an emphasis on mindful practice in the spirit of yoga or t'ai chi. Whether the swimmer's primary goal is exercise, relaxation, endurance, or competition, the aim is to develop awareness of your body's movements within and interactions with the water. For both swimmers who have learned a different style of swimming as well as novice learners, the drill sequence builds the stroke up from small movements and balance drills towards a whole stroke. Progression is built on successful previous movements in a system that the founder describes as \\"Trial and Success\\". Short repetitions of proper movement allow the body to incorporate new motor sequences as the learner develops an efficient stroke. As the new motor skill is learned, it can be executed with increased speed and less conscious control over the movement.Muscle Memory When the movements become automated, the swimmer can then focus on increasing stroke rate while maintaining efficiency. In this way speed as well as efficiency can be developed.

The company was purchased by Sleeman Breweries Ltd. in 2004, which was itself taken over by Sapporo in 2006. The company was incorporated in 1993 and is the first of three microbrewing companies in Greater Montreal area (followed by \\"Brasseurs RJ\\" and \\"McAuslan\\"), both chronologically and in terms of sale benefits. History One product in the Unibroue line is Don de Dieu Unibroue was founded by business partners André Dion and Serge Racine who had acquired 75% of La Brasserie Massawippi Inc. of Lennoxville in 1990. The two purchased the remainder of the shares at the end of 1991 when they transferred their interest in La Brasserie Massawippi Inc. to Unibroue. By 1992, La Brasserie Massawippi Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Unibroue. Afterward, it changed its corporate name to Brasserie Broubec Inc. and in July 1993 merged with Unibroue. It was bought by Canadian brewer, Sleeman Breweries Ltd., in 2004. Sleeman, in turn, was purchased in 2006 by Sapporo. Beers Unibroue makes a wide range of beers; although, there is a focus on Belgian-style brews, such as their Maudite ('Damned'), La Fin du Monde ('The End of the World'), and Don de Dieu ('Gift from God'). Most of Unibroue's beers are bottled \\"on the lees\\", or containing yeast sediment (or lees). This practice provides additional fermentation, also called bottle-conditioned, after bottling. The result is a beer which ages well if kept in the dark and unrefrigerated, and allows it to be shipped relatively cheaply to international markets. The yeast gives Unibroue beers a cloudy appearance and provides a characteristic element to the taste. On many of their labels, suggested serving temperatures (for example, \\"better at 12°–14°C\\") are included. Standard line La Fin du Monde La Fin du Monde (literally French for \\"The End of the World\\") is a Belgian-style tripel and bottle conditioned golden ale introduced in July 1994. The name is claimed to derive from the European explorers' belief that they had reached the end of the world when they arrived in the Americas. The colour is a cloudy blonde with a golden hue. Though similar to Belgian tripels in appearance, La Fin du Monde is less bitter and more spicy (featuring coriander and orange peel), more similar to Tripel Karmeliet than standard tripels like Chimay and Westmalle. The beer contains a very high (9% ABV) alcohol content. As of 2016, this beer has earned more medals and awards, including some of the world's highest honors, than any other Canadian beer. Don de Dieu Don de Dieu is a wheat ale which is re-fermented in the bottle, brewed in the Belgian strong pale ale style. The beer and label were inspired by the explorer Samuel de Champlain de Brouage and his ship, the Don de Dieu ('Gift from God'). Maudite Translated into \\"Damned\\", this is an 8% ABV Strong amber-red ale. (The label denotes the style as \\"Belgian Style Double Ale\\"). Blanche de Chambly Blanche de Chambly is a Belgian-style witbier. The first refermented white beer brewed according to Belgian tradition in North America. 5.0% ABV. À Tout Le Monde Added in 2016, À Tout Le Monde is a Saison style beer. Added in 2016, at 4.5% ABV, it is the brewery's lowest alcohol beer. It was brewed at the request of guitarist Dave Mustaine of Megadeth. Special brew- lines Unibroue brews and bottles the Trader Joe's Vintage Ale. Awards La Fin du Monde has been the winner of many medals of excellence: 5 platinum, 6 gold, and 1 silver from the Beverage Testing Institute since its introduction in 1994. In 2004 it won the gold medal at the Los Angeles County Fair for Belgian-Style Abbey Ale. Don de Dieu has won four gold medals from the Beverage Testing Institute since its introduction in 1998.BTI Graphs Our Beers; Unibroue web pages. Grande Reserve 17 received the \\"World's best dark ale\\" award at the World Beer Awards in London, England in 2011. Also, it received a Platinum medal from the Beverage Testing Institute in 2009, 2010, and 2011. Unibroue has won several awards in subsequent years too, at the World Beer Awards. In 2015, for example, the company's products received many accolades. La Fin du Monde was declared World's Best Belgian Style Tripel, La Résolution and Éphémère Poire (pear), La Résolution won The Americas' Best Belgian Style Strong and Éphémère Poire was named The Americas' Best Fruit Flavored Beer. The Unibroue 17 Grande Réserve was declared The Americas’ Best Vintage Dark Beer and the company won three gold medals for Terrible, Maudite, Éphémère Pomme, three silver medals for Blanche de Chambly, Trois Pistoles, Noire de Chambly, and a bronze medal for Blonde de Chambly. At the 2016 Awards, the company won the following World's Best awards: Belgian Style Strong Dark, Unibroue Trois Pistoles and Belgian Style Tripel, Unibroue La Fin Du Monde.

Steve Penk is a British radio and television presenter. He was born in Rusholme, Manchester and is renowned for his \\"wind- up\\" calls. Penk has worked for various national and local UK radio stations. Aged just 16 he started his radio career at Piccadilly Radio in 1978 (subsequently rebranded Key 103), where his breakfast show delivered record ratings, the highest in the station's history to this day. In 1997 Penk moved on to work at Capital Radio London presenting the mid-morning show. On his programme he regularly did his famous radio wind-ups. It was during one of these wind-up calls that Penk had the idea to call the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He was able to get through the No. 10 switchboard and managed to get Blair on the air for a few minutes. Blair later mentioned during Prime Minister's Questions that Penk had prank-called him that morning, and at that point it became a global media story. In 2001, Penk moved to Virgin Radio where he replaced Chris Evans on the breakfast show and increased the audience by 300,000 listeners in the first three months. Penk then returned to Capital FM in 2002 to present a networked late show. After a year presenting the late show on Capital Radio networked to a number of other stations, Penk returned to Manchester's Key 103, however, he left at the end of 2006. Penk returned to the airwaves on Fox FM in Oxfordshire in March 2007 as its new breakfast show presenter. However, he announced on 15 January 2008 he would be leaving the station by March 2008 due to 'internal politics'. He also presented/Hosted a number of Primetime TV Shows for ITV. TV Nightmares, The Way They Were, When Athletes Attack and made guest appearances on Blankety Blank and a few series of TV's Naughtiest Blunders on ITV1. On Thursday 4 September 2008, it was announced that Penk had bought the entire share capital in the radio station 96.2 the Revolution. Almost immediately after the purchase, Penk made major changes both to the schedule and to the playlist. The changes led to outrage from some listeners to the station and departure of some of the station's DJs. However, after changing the station's format Penk managed to quadruple the audience.Steve Penk buys The Revolution - Digital Spy - 04/09/08. In January 2014, he sold 96.2 the Revolution. In 2015 Penk launched the Steve Penk Wind-Up Channel on DAB+ in Manchester (England), featuring wind-up/prank calls 24/7. In 2016 Penk created and launched \\"Radio Dead\\", a Globally unique radio station that only plays artistes who are deceased. If they are dead, they are on the playlist.

Alexander Murray Murray (DD-576) was laid down on 16 March 1942 by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Orange, Texas and launched on 16 August 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Frank T. Leighton. The ship was commissioned on 20 April 1943, Comdr. Richard F. Stout in command. Service history  World War II  After shakedown in the Caribbean, Murray served on escort duty in the Atlantic Ocean, then sailed to join Destroyer Squadron 25 at Pearl Harbor in September 1943. Sailing with a carrier task force, Murray took part in strikes on Wake Island 5–6 October, then voyaged to the South Pacific to support the landings on Bougainville 8–9 November, splashing three enemy aircraft. Two days later, while covering US 3rd Fleet aircraft carriers in a strike against Rabaul, Murray shot down two of a force of about 150 enemy aircraft attacking her formation. Hewing to a demanding pace of operations, Murray was on antisubmarine patrol in the Gilbert Islands from 20 November to 8 December during the occupation of Tarawa and Abemama, then for the next month guarded shipping into the newly acquired islands. In January 1944 Murray performed outstandingly in fire support missions for the capture of Kwajalein, then screened transports carrying invasion forces to Eniwetok. Two months of escort duty in the western ocean routes followed, until she joined in the bombardment of Kavieng, New Ireland, 20 March. Joining the 7th Fleet Murray took part in the assault on Aitape, New Guinea, 23 to 28 April, downing another enemy aircraft during an aerial torpedo attack. Rejoining the 6th Fleet in June, she screened amphibious craft during the assault on Saipan, then sailed to Guam for close-in fire support and transport screening duty 20 July to 26th. After patrol and escort duties for the consolidation of the Mariana Islands until late in August, Murray returned to the continuing operations around New Guinea. She bombarded Wewak 30 August to cover British minelaying operations, and in September covered the landings on Morotai. Returning to Hollandia, she prepared for the invasion of the Philippines, sortieing in escort of the transports for Leyte. On 20–21 October, she conducted shore bombardment, moving in as close as reefs would allow to fire over the landing force into enemy installations and at the same time aiding in repelling enemy air attacks. Departing the Philippines immediately after the landings Murray overhauled at San Francisco, California, then in January 1945 escorted a battleship division to Pearl Harbor while en route to join Task Force 58. She screened the aircraft carriers and acted as picket during the first carrier raid on Tokyo 16 February and attacks on Iwo Jima and the Ryukyu Islands 26 February to 1 March, sinking a Japanese picket ship about 200 miles off the coast of Japan on 26 February. Murray next prepared for the Okinawa operation, during which she screened battleships from submarine attack during the initial preinvasion bombardment. Hit by a Japanese bomb 27 March, she retired to Pearl Harbor for repairs. While returning to the forward areas by way of Eniwetok, Murray was ordered 2 July to locate, board, and search Japanese hospital ship Takasago Maru, bound for Wake Island and suspected of carrying arms or supplies, contraband for a hospital ship. She located the ship the next day, but search revealed nothing in violation of international law, so the hospital ship was allowed to proceed to Wake to embark sick and wounded Japanese. Rejoining her force, now Task Force 38, Murray guarded the fast carriers in the raids against Honshū, Hokkaidō, and Kyūshū through the last 2 months of the war. In one of the most daring raids of the war, Murray and others of her squadron penetrated Suruga Bay, Honshū, 30 July to bombard the city of Shimizu, perhaps the deepest penetration of Japanese waters by any surface craft during the war.  After World War II  One of the initial occupation force, Murray became the first ship in empire waters to bring in a Japanese submarine when the enemy undersea fleet began to surrender. On 27 August, aircraft of TF 38, patrolling off Honshū, located a submarine flying the black flag designated as the surrender signal, and Murray was ordered to intercept and take the craft into Tokyo Bay for internment. Her boarding party received the swords of s officers that same day, and the submarine was escorted to the mouth of Sagami Bay. Murray was present in Tokyo Bay for the formal Japanese surrender 2 September, then 3 days later sailed for the United States. Inactivated at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Murray decommissioned 27 March 1946, and went into reserve at Charleston, South Carolina.  Korean War years  In June 1951, Murray began conversion to an escort destroyer, for which she had been designated DDE-576 on 2 January 1951. She recommissioned at Charleston 16 October 1951, Comdr. Frank L. Fullaway in command. Murray underway after her recomissioning. Early in 1952, Murray began East Coast and Caribbean training operations from her home port, Norfolk. She also served periodically as plane guard during carrier qualification of naval aviation cadets off Pensacola, Florida. In June 1953, she sailed for her first deployment to the Mediterranean, serving in the hunter killer force of the 6th Fleet. Her 1954 tour was marked by an extension to northern European ports. In 1956, Murray operated with and participated in a NATO convoy escort exercise in European waters. During much of 1956 she underwent yard overhaul, then in 1957 sailed round Cape of Good Hope for patrol duty in the Persian Gulf, the usual access to which was blocked by the closing of the Suez Canal the previous autumn. With the canal free later in the spring, she joined the 6th Fleet in Mediterranean operations through August. Between March 1958 and May 1961 Murray formed part of Task Group Alfa, an experimental development group working in antisubmarine warfare. The group usually operated off the Virginia Capes, but in the summers of 1959 and 1960 participated in the annual summer NROTC midshipmen training cruises, voyaging to Canadian ports and Bermuda.  1960s  In late May 1961, Murray was one of the rescue ships stationed along the route of President John F. Kennedy's flight to Paris, then participated in that summer's midshipmen cruise. Redesignated DD-576 on 30 June 1962, Murray rejoined TG Alfa for its development operations, which were interrupted for participation in the Cuban Quarantine in October and November 1962 that forced Russian missiles out of Cuba and averted grave international complications. At 1633 on 27 October 1962, the Murray Deck Log contains the following entry: \\"Sonar contact bearing 212 2,000 yards.\\" The Murray sonar gang classified the contact as a possible submarine After several hours of \\"ping time\\" at 2050 hours the same date the Murray Deck Log contains the following additional entry: \\"Submarine surfaced bearing 080, 3,900 yards. 4 hours and 17 minutes after initial contact by this ship at LAT 27-36N, LONG 65-56.5W.\\" Thus Murray was the first U.S. Navy destroyer to gain and hold contact with the first of three Soviet submarines forced to surface during the Cuban Missile Crisis. After training off New England early in 1963, Murray returned to Caribbean patrols then came north for the midshipmen cruise. Murray sailed 29 November 1963 for her first 6th Fleet deployment in six years, visiting French, Spanish, and Italian ports before returning to Norfolk 23 May 1964. She cleared Norfolk again 8 September for NATO Arctic operations, crossing the Arctic Circle 21 September, and visiting Amsterdam before returning to Norfolk 23 October. Decommissioned in May 1966 at Norfolk, Murray was struck from the Navy list 1 June 1966, and sold for scrapping to Boston Metals Co., Baltimore, Maryland, in 1966. Murray received 11 battle stars for World War II service.

Biography Born to Edward Lambert Burgin, a solicitor, Burgin studied law at the University of London, graduating with a first-class LL.B. in 1908 and a LL.D. in 1913. Burgin trained as a solicitor specialising in international law and served as principal and director of legal studies to the Law Society. He contested Hornsey four times and East Ham North once, without success. In the 1929 general election Burgin was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Luton. Along with other Liberal MPs he joined the Liberal Nationals in 1931 and was made a Charity Commissioner. In 1932 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1937 Coronation Honours. In 1937 Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appointed Burgin as Minister of Transport. Two years later he was appointed as the first Minister of Supply in April 1939. As the post had not yet been established in law, he formally served as Minister without Portfolio for the first three months. His appointment was aimed to appeal to liberal minded opinion but was criticised as being inappropriate - A.J.P. Taylor described Burgin as being \\"another horse from Caligula's well-stocked stables\\" (a follow-up to contemporary remarks about the earlier appointment of Sir Thomas Inskip as Minister for Coordination of Defence). When Chamberlain was replaced by Winston Churchill, Burgin was not included in the new wartime ministry. Burgin was referred to in the book Guilty Men (1949) by Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard (writing under the pseudonym 'Cato'), an attack on public figures for their failure to re-arm and their appeasement of Nazi Germany. He retired at the 1945 general election before dying in August 1945, aged 58.

While prostratin was originally isolated and identified as a new phorbol ester from species of the genus Pimelea (Thymelaceae) in Australia, the antiviral activity of prostratin was discovered during research on the traditional knowledge of Samoan healers in Falealupo village by ethnobotanist Paul Alan Cox and a team at the U.S. National Cancer Institute. Samoan healers use the mamala tree to treat hepatitis. Research indicated that prostratin has potential to be useful in the treatment of HIV as it could flush viral reservoirs in latently infected CD4+ T-cells.Prostratin and the AIDS Research Alliance, AIDS Research Alliance, 2006 As a modulator of protein kinase C, it has been shown to exhibit promising therapeutic potential against other diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In 2015, study showed that orally administrated prostratin repressed human pancreatic tumor.  Overview  Prostratin is of interest because of its unique ability to activate latent viral reservoirs, while preventing healthy cells from infection, as well as its discovery through ethnobotany. Pioneering agreements to protect indigenous intellectual property rights of the Samoan people were established between the Samoan government and the AIDS Research Alliance, with 20% of ARA's profits to be returned to the Samoan people,Prostratin Press Release , AIDS Research Alliance, 2001-12-13 and between the Samoan Government and the University of California, Berkeley where a team led by Jay Keasling is trying to isolate the gene sequence responsible for prostratin biosynthesis. Samoa and UC Berkeley agreed to share equally in any commercial proceeds from the gene product. In 2008, a team at Stanford University led by chemist Paul Wender has published an elegant four-step chemical synthesis of prostratin from phorbol. This practical synthesis produces gram quantities of prostratin, and is a major step forward in pharmaceutical development of prostratin. In 2010, AIDS Research Alliance in Los Angeles, California announced that it signed a new licensing agreement with Stanford University, transferring exclusive rights of the technology developed by the Stanford research team. Phase I human clinical trials of prostratin will be carried out by the AIDS ReSearch Alliance in Los Angeles, California.

Munro was the fifth child of Sir Campbell Munro, 3rd Baronet, and also a grandson of Major-General Sir Thomas Munro, 1st Baronet of Lindertis.Burke's Peerage cited by Biography The grave of Sir Hugh Munro, Lindertis, Kirriemuir. Munro was born on 16 October 1856 in London, but was brought up in Scotland on the family estate of Lindertis near Kirriemuir in Angus.\\"Failed by 11ft: the mountain that couldn't measure up to the name of Munro\\" , The Independent, 9 June 2007, returived 9 June 2007. He was an avid hillwalker, and was a founder member of the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 1889. His list of 3,000-foot mountains 1891 was published in the 6th issue of the Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal in 1891.\\"Making mountains, producing narratives, or: 'One day some poor sod will write their Ph.D. on this'\\" , Anthropology Matters Journal 2006, vol. 8 (2), retrieved 9 June 2007. This list caused much surprise in mountaineering circles, as until his list was produced many thought that the number of mountains exceeding this height was around 30, rather than the nearly 300 that he listed. These mountains are now known as Munros and it is a popular hobby to attempt to climb them all. Hugh Munro never completed his own list. Of his original list he failed to climb one mountain in the Cairngorms (Carn Cloich-Mhuillin),\\"The spirit of Sir Hugh Munro walks with us still\\", The Scotsman, 11 November 2006, retrieved 9 June 2007. which he was saving to be his last. At the time of his death he had produced a revised version of the list, adding Carn an Fhidhleir, which he had also yet to climb. Sir Hugh is often said to have missed out the Inaccessible Pinnacle of Sgurr Dearg, on the Isle of Skye, a peak which there is no record of his having climbed. However, the \\"In Pinn\\" was not included in either of the lists produced during his lifetime, despite being several feet higher than Sgurr Dearg, which was included. The first person to achieve the feat of climbing all of the mountains on Munro's list is generally regarded as being the Rev. A. E. Robertson in 1901. However Robertson is known not to have climbed all of the peaks either, as he did not climb The Inaccessible Pinnacle or reach the summit of Ben Wyvis. In addition to his mountaineering interests, Munro was well travelled and made trips to Europe, Asia, North America and Africa. He was too old at 58 for military service during World War I but did volunteer work with the Red Cross and cared for injured soldiers in Malta in 1915. After a spell of illness, he rejoined the Red Cross, running a canteen for Allied forces near the front line in France. He died on 19 March 1919 aged 63, during the post-war influenza pandemic. He is buried on the family estate of Lindertis near Kirriemuir in Angus.

He was the United States Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) from 1989 to 1993 and the Acting Surgeon General of the United States from 1989 to 1990. As the ASH he was also a former four-star admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. He was also a director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Early life and education Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Mason earned B.A. and M.D. degrees from the University of Utah. Mason received an MPH from Harvard in 1963. He also earned a DrPHhttps://www.thechurchnews.com/members/2019-10-11/elder-james-o-mason- emeritus-general-authority-seventy-dies-at-age-89-163981 in public health from Harvard University. He completed this later degree at Harvard in 1967. Mason did residencies at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital. Medical career Mason was the first managing director of the LDS Church's Unified Welfare Services, directing the church's hospital system beginning in 1970 when the church moved general authorities to a position of developing policy and handing over the managing of professional departments to highered professionals. In this position he gave a talk in LDS general conference announcing the health missionary plan in 1971. He continued as head of the church's hospitals until 1975 when the church spun them off as Intermountain Healthcare to allow it to focus health resources more to assist members around the world. From 1978 to 1979, Mason served as chair of the division of community medicine in the University of Utah's college of medicine. Mason served as the executive director of the Utah Department of Health from 1979 until 1983, when he was named director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia; Mason held the directorship of the CDC until 1989. In 1993, he was presented with the Gorgas Medal from the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS). In 1989, the U.S. Senate confirmed Mason as Assistant Secretary for Health, which made him head of the United States Public Health Service, and Acting Surgeon General. He later served as the American delegate to the World Health Organization. LDS Church service In 1994, Mason was appointed as a general authority by the LDS Church, serving in the Second Quorum of the Seventy until 2000. From 2000 to 2003, Mason was president of the church's Bountiful Utah Temple. As a young man, Mason served an LDS Church mission to Denmark. Before his appointment as a general authority, Mason served in the church as a bishop, stake president, and regional representative. In 1974, while serving as Church Commissioner for Health Services, Mason wrote a pamphlet for the church titled, \\"Attitudes of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Toward Certain Medical Problems\\", which expresses the church's views on abortion, birth control, and homosexuality. Family life Mason married Marie Smith in 1952 in the Salt Lake Temple and they were the parents of seven children. Mason died on October 9, 2019. Notes References *\\"Elder James O.

It is called an existence theorem because a main burden of the proof is to show the existence of enough abelian extensions of K. Formulation Here a modulus (or ray divisor) is a formal finite product of the valuations (also called primes or places) of K with positive integer exponents. The archimedean valuations that might appear in a modulus include only those whose completions are the real numbers (not the complex numbers); they may be identified with orderings on K and occur only to exponent one. The modulus m is a product of a non- archimedean (finite) part mf and an archimedean (infinite) part m∞. The non- archimedean part mf is a nonzero ideal in the ring of integers OK of K and the archimedean part m∞ is simply a set of real embeddings of K. Associated to such a modulus m are two groups of fractional ideals. The larger one, Im, is the group of all fractional ideals relatively prime to m (which means these fractional ideals do not involve any prime ideal appearing in mf). The smaller one, Pm, is the group of principal fractional ideals (u/v) where u and v are nonzero elements of OK which are prime to mf, u ≡ v mod mf, and u/v > 0 in each of the orderings of m∞. (It is important here that in Pm, all we require is that some generator of the ideal has the indicated form. If one does, others might not. For instance, taking K to be the rational numbers, the ideal (3) lies in P4 because (3) = (−3) and −3 fits the necessary conditions. But (3) is not in P4∞ since here it is required that the positive generator of the ideal is 1 mod 4, which is not so.) For any group H lying between Im and Pm, the quotient Im/H is called a generalized ideal class group. It is these generalized ideal class groups which correspond to abelian extensions of K by the existence theorem, and in fact are the Galois groups of these extensions. That generalized ideal class groups are finite is proved along the same lines of the proof that the usual ideal class group is finite, well in advance of knowing these are Galois groups of finite abelian extensions of the number field. A well-defined correspondence Strictly speaking, the correspondence between finite abelian extensions of K and generalized ideal class groups is not quite one-to-one. Generalized ideal class groups defined relative to different moduli can give rise to the same abelian extension of K, and this is codified a priori in a somewhat complicated equivalence relation on generalized ideal class groups. In concrete terms, for abelian extensions L of the rational numbers, this corresponds to the fact that an abelian extension of the rationals lying in one cyclotomic field also lies in infinitely many other cyclotomic fields, and for each such cyclotomic overfield one obtains by Galois theory a subgroup of the Galois group corresponding to the same field L. In the idelic formulation of class field theory, one obtains a precise one- to-one correspondence between abelian extensions and appropriate groups of ideles, where equivalent generalized ideal class groups in the ideal-theoretic language correspond to the same group of ideles. Earlier work A special case of the existence theorem is when m = 1 and H = P1. In this case the generalized ideal class group is the ideal class group of K, and the existence theorem says there exists a unique abelian extension L/K with Galois group isomorphic to the ideal class group of K such that L is unramified at all places of K. This extension is called the Hilbert class field. It was conjectured by David Hilbert to exist, and existence in this special case was proved by Furtwängler in 1907, before Takagi's general existence theorem. A further and special property of the Hilbert class field, not true of smaller abelian extensions of a number field, is that all ideals in a number field become principal in the Hilbert class field. It required Artin and Furtwängler to prove that principalization occurs. History The existence theorem is due to Takagi, who proved it in Japan during the isolated years of World War I. He presented it at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1920, leading to the development of the classical theory of class field theory during the 1920s. At Hilbert's request, the paper was published in Mathematische Annalen in 1925.

Alvis are the one who were accepted as the descendants of Caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, through his all wives. This title was later used by the Nusayri Alawites and Qizilbash Bektashi Alevis (who are not the descendants of Ali); they are natively from Syria and Turkey. As a proper noun it is used by individuals, dynasties, places, and religious sects and organizations who identify as being either descendants or followers of Ali; the Sunni Alvis are partially Hanafi and Maliki. The community are known as Alvi, Alwi, Alavi, Alawi, Sayyid Alvi, Shah, Sain, Miya, Fakir, Dewan or Ansari (married with the descendants of AnsarisK. S.

Lines of descent  Sharif Hussein, Sharif, King of Hejaz and Haram El-Sharif' & Father Abdullah I of Jordan, Founder Kings of Jordan; Faisal I of Iraq, Kings of Iraq. Sharif Hussein is the Hashemite and Alids from Hassan Al-Mujtaba. Primarily Sunnis in the Arab world reserve the term sharif or \\"sherif\\" for descendants of Hasan ibn Ali, while sayyid is used for descendants of Husayn ibn Ali. Both Hasan and Husayn are grandchildren of Muhammad, through the marriage of his cousin Ali and his daughter Fatima. However ever since the post-Hashemite era began, the term sayyid has been used to denote descendants from both Hasan and Husayn. Arab Shiites use the terms sayyid and habib to denote descendants from both Hasan and Husayn; see also ashraf. To try to resolve the confusion surrounding the descendants of Muhammad, the Ottoman Caliphs during the 19th Century C.E. attempted to replicate the Almanach de Gotha (the tome listing the noble houses of Europe) to show known and verifiable lines of descent. Although not 100% complete in its scope (some lines might have been excluded due to lack of proof, although no false lines are included) the resulting \\"Kitab al-Ashraf\\" (Book of the Sharifs), kept at the Topkapi Palace Museum in Istanbul is one of the best sources of evidence of descent from Muhammad.

His last active-duty appointment was as President of the Naval War College, in 1942–1946. His awards included the Navy Cross for his distinguished service as a staff officer during World War I. Career through World War I Pye was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 9 June 1880. Entering the United States Naval Academy in 1897, he graduated in 1901 and was commissioned an Ensign in June 1903. From 1901 through 1915, he served in several ships, among them five battleships and an armored cruiser, and was also assigned to the staffs of the Naval Academy and Naval War College. In 1915–1916 he placed the new destroyer into commission. He relinquished command of Jacob Jones before her 1917 deployment to Europe with the US entry into World War I, and joined the staff of the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet. He served in that position through the war, receiving the Navy Cross \\"for exceptionally distinguished and valuable service on the staff of the commander in chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, in addition to excellent performance of his routine staff duties in preparing a series of orders for the conduct of battleship and fleet, based upon the best thought and experience of the United States fleet and British fleet during the late war.\\" Interwar years Pye served in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in 1919–1921, and was executive officer of the battleship in 1922–1923. After briefly commanding a destroyer squadron, he returned to Washington, D.C., for service at the Navy Department, which lasted into 1927. In the next five years, he commanded the minelayer , had more Navy Department service, and was head of the U.S. Naval Mission to Peru. Captain Pye commanded the battleship in 1932–1933. Promoted to the rank of rear admiral, Pye served as chief of staff to Commander Scouting Force, attended the Naval War College, had further Navy Department service, and was Commander Destroyers in both the Scouting Force and Battle Force of the Pacific Fleet. With the temporary rank of Vice Admiral, he was Commander Battleships, Battle Force in 1940 and Commander Battle Force (COMBATFOR) in 1941. World War II and post-war years He is perhaps best known for his 6 December 1941 remark that \\"The Japanese will not go to war with the United States. We are too big, too powerful, and too strong.\\" Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the subsequent relief of Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC)Julius Augustus Furer, Administration of the Navy Department in World War II (Washington, D. C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1959), Chapter IV Fleet Organization Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Vice Admiral Pye became Acting CINCPAC on 17 December. He had reservations about Kimmel's plan to send a relief force including the aircraft carrier to the aid of Wake Island, but continued with the plan until 22 December. Then – after reports of additional landings on Wake – Pye decided the operation was too risky and recalled the relief force. This decision was highly controversial, as it amounted to abandoning the Wake Island garrison, which had defeated a Japanese landing on 11 December. On 31 December, Pye relinquished command of the Pacific Fleet to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Pye became commander of Task Force One (TF 1), comprising the remaining operational battleships in the Pacific Fleet, now based in San Francisco. During the Battle of Midway, Pye received orders for the seven old battleships (, , , , , , and ), the escort carrier , and eight destroyers of TF 1 to sortie to patrol off of the West Coast against possible Japanese attack there should the carrier forces at Midway be defeated. Such fears proved unfounded, and TF 1 then remained on training and patrol duties between Hawaii and the West Coast until Pye was relieved in October 1942. He never commanded operating forces again, and was relegated to administrative positions. On 2 November, Pye became President of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and also commanded the Naval Operating Base there. He officially retired on 1 July 1944, but was recalled to active duty as President of the War College, and promoted to permanent Vice Admiral. He continued at the War College until retiring from active duty on 1 March 1946. Pye died at Bethesda, Maryland, on 4 May 1959. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, United States. Pye's oldest son, LT William Satterlee Pye, Jr., was killed in a plane crash in 1938.

Principally a photographic essay accompanied by text, the work was edited by David Thorne and George Butler, with a section written by John Kerry. The work includes photographs captured by many photographers across five days in April, 1971. The New Soldier documents what VVAW called Operation Dewey Canyon III. This pseudo-operation, \\"a limited incursion into the country of Congress\\", was basically a series of demonstrations, marches and street theatre designed to protest US involvement in the war in Vietnam. In one activity, Vietnam War combat veterans, wearing uniforms and carrying unloaded weapons, enacted for astonished visitors to Washington, DC, the actions common to descending upon and sweeping a Vietnamese village for enemy combatants. This theatre was performed on Constitution Mall, under heavy police supervision. This was only one of several events participated in by hundreds of Vietnam Veterans and not a few Gold Star Mothers from across the country. The New Soldier documents two events of emotional significance. In one, war veterans queue up in a long line to return their medals and decorations to the U.S. government. They hurled them upon the steps of Congress. This was a shocking scene on American television. A second event was a worship service held at the main gate to Arlington National Cemetery. The desire had been to hold the service on the actual hallowed grounds but the Vietnam Veteran demonstrators were locked out of Arlington. Marines guarded the gates with loaded weapons and kept them pointed outward. The worship service had to be conducted with the clergyman's back to those Marines. To some readers, a shortcoming of The New Soldier is that the words spoken by this Vietnam War battlefield chaplain, a United Methodist clergyman, were not included in the volume. That sermonette has not been lost to American history (see link below). The book contains excerpts of testimony by veterans at the Winter Soldier Investigation on war crimes committed during the Vietnam War and a portion of the Fulbright Hearing testimony given by John Kerry to the Senate committee. The New Soldier documents a most unusual event in American history: returned veterans of a foreign war appearing en masse in the nation's capital to demand that the war be stopped. Only 5000 copies of the book were printed, consequently, the book is considered a collector's item. External links *Rev.

It is characterized by its opening demand, \\"The People Shall Govern!\\" History After about a decade of multi-faceted resistance to white minority rule, and in the wake of the Defiance Campaign of 1952, the work to create the Freedom Charter was in part a response to an increasingly repressive government which was bent on stamping out extra-parliamentary dissent. In 1955, the ANC sent out 50,000 volunteers into townships and the countryside to collect \\"freedom demands\\" from the people of South Africa. This system was designed to give all South Africans equal rights. Demands such as \\"Land to be given to all landless people\\", \\"Living wages and shorter hours of work\\", \\"Free and compulsory education, irrespective of colour, race or nationality\\" were synthesized into the final document by ANC leaders including Z.K. Mathews, Lionel \\"Rusty\\" Bernstein, Ethel Drus,Ethel Drus Ruth First and Alan Lipman (whose wife, Beata Lipman, hand-wrote the original Charter). The Charter was officially adopted on Sunday 26 June 1955 at a gathering of about 3,000 people, known as the Congress of the People in Kliptown, Soweto.\\"Father of Freedom Charter dies\\", Johannesburg Star, 28-01-13 The meeting was broken up by police on the second day, although by then the Charter had been read in full. The crowd had shouted its approval of each section with cries of \\"Afrika!\\" and \\"Mayibuye!\\"The Mayibuye Uprising was part of the Defiance Campaign in 1952. Nelson Mandela escaped the police by disguising himself as a milkman, as his movements and interactions were restricted by banning orders at the time. The document signified a major break with the past traditions of the struggle; this was no longer a civil rights movement seeking to be accommodated in the existing structures of society, but called for a fundamental restructuring of all aspects of South African society. The document is notable for its demand for and commitment to a non-racial South Africa, and this has remained the platform of the ANC. As a result, ANC members who held pro-African views left the ANC after it adopted the charter, forming the Pan Africanist Congress. The charter also calls for democracy and human rights, land reform, labour rights, and nationalisation. After the Congress was denounced as treason, the South African government banned the ANC and arrested 156 activists, including Mandela, who were put on trial in the 1956 Treason Trial, in which all were acquitted. The Charter continued to circulate in the revolutionary underground and inspired a new generation of young militants in the 1980s. When the ANC finally came to power after democratic elections in 1994, the new Constitution of South Africa included many of the demands of the Freedom Charter. It addressed directly nearly all of the demands for equality of race and language, but made no reference to nationalisation of industry or redistribution of land which were outlined in the charter. Freedom Charter We, the People of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know: that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of all the people; that our people have been robbed of their birthright to land, liberty and peace by a form of government founded on injustice and inequality; that our country will never be prosperous or free until all our people live in brotherhood, enjoying equal rights and opportunities; that only a democratic state, based on the will of all the people, can secure to all their birthright without distinction of colour, race, sex or belief; And therefore, we, the people of South Africa, black and white together - equals, countrymen and brothers - adopt this Freedom Charter.

It is the largest company of its kind in the United States, with 269 locations.Guitar Center Store Locator Its headquarters is in Westlake Village, California. Guitar Center oversees various subsidiaries including Music & Arts, GuitarCenter.com, LMI, Giardinelli, Musician.com, Private Reserve Guitars, Woodwind and Brasswind, and Music 123, and used to own Harmony Central until its April 2015 sale to Gibson. History Founded in Hollywood by Wayne Mitchell in 1959 as The Organ Center, a retailer of electronic organs for home and church use, it became a major seller of Vox electric guitars and guitar amplifiers, changing its name to The Vox Center in 1964. Toward the end of the 1960s, Vox—whose sales derived largely from its association with The Beatles, who made extensive use of its amplifiers—fell in popularity as Marshall amplifier users Eric Clapton and others captured musicians' imaginations. Accordingly, Mitchell once again changed the name, this time to Guitar Center. Guitar Center West LA, Pico & Westwood, Los Angeles The popularity of rock and roll in the 1970s allowed Mitchell to open stores in San Francisco and San Diego, as well as several suburbs of Los Angeles. Ray Scherr, previously the general manager of the San Francisco store, purchased the company from Mitchell in the late 1970s. Scherr owned and operated it until 1996 from its Westlake Village headquarters. Although synthesizer-driven disco and new wave pop sapped rock's audience in the late 1970s, the 1980s \\"guitar rock\\" revival led by Van Halen and a concurrent influx of Japanese-produced instruments brought guitar sales to unprecedented levels. Guitar Center took full advantage of this sales bonanza, and by the end of the decade began an ambitious program of expansion across the entire United States. Using its size as leverage over the musical instrument business, it developed into the largest musical instrument retailer in the country, and made an initial public offering of stock in 1997. In 2005, Guitar Center, Inc., started The Fender Music Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports music education.Guitar Center Music Foundation Activision partnered with Guitar Center in 2006; all purchases made during game play of Guitar Hero, beginning with the second installment, are made in a virtual Guitar Center store. On June 27, 2007, Guitar Center agreed to a $1.9 billion buyout from Bain Capital, totaling $2.1 billion including debt. The deal was led by Goldman Sachs and amounted to a per-share price of $63, or a 26% premium on the June 26 closing price. The deal was approved by shareholders on September 18, 2007, and closed October 9, 2007. In mid-2009 Guitar Center opened the first of its rehearsal and lessons studio facility in Woodland Hills, California. The eight studios with full backline range in size from . Guitar Center also hosts annual events such as the Drum Off, King of the Blues, contests, and artist appearances throughout the nation. In 2011, Guitar Center added equipment rentals to the store in San Diego, California. Since, Guitar Center has opened rental departments in ten other existing locations and plans to offer rental services in various other stores across the country. In May 2013, Standard & Poor's cut its debt rating on Bain Capital-owned Guitar Center Holdings Inc to \\"junk bond\\" status, citing struggles with \\"weak operating trends.\\" The corporate credit rating on the company dropped from 'B-' to 'CCC+'. In April 2014, Ares Management took a controlling stake in Guitar Center. Bain Capital, Guitar Center's former owner, retained partial ownership of the company, along with representation on the board. According to Mike Pratt, the retailer's previous chief executive, the deal will reduce Guitar Center's total debt and provide it with the resources to expand its footprint and invest in its business. In August 2014, Guitar Center opened a new 28,000 square foot flagship location in the heart of Times Square in New York City. The grand opening included a celebratory concert featuring the band The Roots. The Guitar Center Times Square location is now the permanent home of Eric Clapton's Blackie Fender Stratocaster, which Guitar Center purchased at a Christie's Crossroads Centre auction in 2004 for $959,000. In April, 2017, Moody's Investors Services revised the outlook on Guitar Center's B2 rating to negative, meaning it could downgrade the rating further into junk territory in the medium tern. The concern is that Guitar Center may be overwhelmed by its $1 billion debt in the face of flat sales in the musical instrument industry as a whole.

Guitar Center Legends Collection The “Guitar Center Legends Collection”Guitar Center Legends Collection consists of four classic guitars made famous by music legends Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and U2’s The Edge. Guitar Center purchased Clapton’s “Blackie” Fender Stratocaster, his vintage Gibson “ES-335,” and Vaughan’s “Lenny” Stratocaster for over $2.4 million from the Clapton Crossroads Centre charity auction at Christie's New York in 2004. They added The Edge’s cream white Gibson Les Paul Custom after purchasing it for $240,000 at the Music Rising Charity Auction in 2007. Over the years, the collection has been exhibited in one-of-a-kind, “Legends’ Collection” display cases, which provide high level protection and climate control as the instruments tour prestigious musical events and key Guitar Center locations, such as “Guitar Center Road to Crossroads” held at Madison Square Garden in conjunction with Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festival in April 2013. In August 2014, Clapton’s Blackie and ES-335 were moved to their new permanent location at Guitar Center’s Times Square flagship location. Clapton's “Blackie” was purchased by Guitar Center for $959,500. Clapton’s Cherry Red Gibson “335,” purchased for $847,500, was used to record Cream’s versions of “Badge” and “Crossroads (from their final live performance in November 1968),” as well as many other historical performances, during his 40 years of ownership. Steve Ray Vaughan’s “Lenny,” which was purchased for $623,500, was used to record his classic love songs including “Lenny” and “Riviera Paradise.” All of the proceeds from these three guitars purchased by Guitar Center were for the benefit of Clapton’s Crossroads Centre charity. The Edge's cream colored 1975 Les Paul Custom (faded from its original white) found fame as a go-to guitar for stage and studio on many of U2’s most famous recordings and performances. In 2005, The Edge partnered with producer Bob Ezrin, Gibson and the Guitar Center Music Foundation (now known as the Fender Music Foundation) to establish Music Rising, a charity founded to benefit musicians whose lives were torn apart by Hurricane Katrina. In 2007, he donated this prized guitar to be auctioned for the cause. The winning bid was $240,000 from Guitar Center ($288,000 including Buyers Premium). Guitar Center's Drum-Off Since 1988, Guitar Center has held an annual search for the next great undiscovered drummer. Developed to spotlight the drumming community, Guitar Center’s Drum-Off is the music retailer’s longest running artist-discovery program, providing an outlet for drummers to be recognized for their skill and attain success in their field. For over a quarter of a century, the program has unearthed some of the day’s top undiscovered drummers and provided a platform for established drummers to be acknowledged. Guitar Center’s Drum-Off breaks down into three rounds of store preliminary competitions at 250+ Guitar Center locations nationwide. Every contestant is allowed five minutes of set up time and three minutes to perform. One winner from each store finals competition is chosen to move up to the quarterfinals, (hosted at 30 Guitar Center locations nationwide), followed by semi-finals at five store locations at which point performance time is increased to allow five minutes to each contestant. The winners from these five semifinal locations convene in Los Angeles, CA to compete in Guitar Center’s Drum Off finals in front of a live audience and a panel of celebrity judges. Each contestant is required to perform on a 5-piece acoustic drum kit complete with hardware, cymbals, cowbell, throne and the option to incorporate the Roland SPD-30 Octapad into the competition kit. As of 2016 however, the SPD-30 Octapad will no longer be part of the competition kit. All contestants are evaluated by a panel of independent and credible judges on the following criteria: skills & technique, groove, originality, stage presence, and overall performance. In years past, some of the world’s most renowned drummers have participated in and supported Guitar Center’s Drum-Off, including: Terry Bozzio (Frank Zappa), Dennis Chambers (Parliament/Funkadelic), Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers), Steve Gadd, Questlove (The Roots), Travis Barker (Blink-182), Tommy Lee (Mötley Crüe), Dave Lombardo (Slayer), Carmine Appice, John Tempesta (The Cult), Taylor Hawkins (Foo Fighters), Steve Smith, Gavin Harrison, Jojo Mayer, Thomas Lang, Josh Freese (Nine Inch Nails, A Perfect Circle), José Pasillas (Incubus), Billy Cobham, Nicko McBrain (Iron Maiden), Stephen Perkins (Jane’s Addiction), Danny Carey (Tool), Brann Dailor (Mastodon), John Blackwell, and more. According to their website, and as of 2017, Guitar Center will no longer sponsor the annual drumoff. Instead, Guitar Center announced it will create a community outreach program specifically geared toward drummers.

Acquisitions A Guitar Center retail store in Houston In 2000, Guitar Center purchased mail order and Internet retail house Musician's Friend for $50 million, asserting that the merged company was the world's largest seller of musical instruments. Musician's Friend became a wholly owned subsidiary that was headquartered in Medford, Oregon until 2011, when Musician's Friend's headquarters operations were gradually consolidated into Guitar Center's facilities in Westlake Village, California. In 2005, Guitar Center Inc. acquired Music & Arts, the largest school music dealer in the United States, and merged their subsidiary band and orchestral chain American Music Group into Music & Arts (as the company was renamed). Music & Arts was founded in 1952 in Bethesda, Maryland and sells band and orchestra instruments, guitars, keyboards, drum sets, printed sheet music, and related supplies. In the summer of 2006, Guitar Center purchased four stores in Texas from the popular South Texas and Central/South American company, Hermes. In February 2007, the direct response division of Guitar Center, Musician's Friend, purchased assets of the Indiana- based company Dennis Bamber, Inc., which included leading band and orchestra retailer, Woodwind and Brasswind, plus Music 123 and Lyons Music.

He was a four-star admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and served as the 10th Assistant Secretary for Health, and the 16th Surgeon General of the United States. Biography  Early years Satcher was born in Anniston, Alabama. At the age of two, he contracted whooping cough. A black doctor, Jackson, came to his parents' farm, and told his parents he didn't expect David to live, but nonetheless spent the day with him, and told his parents how to give him the best chance he could. Satcher said that he grew up hearing that story, and that inspired him to be a doctor. While in college, Satcher was active in the Civil Rights Movement and was arrested on multiple occasions. Satcher graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta in 1963 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He received his M.D. and Ph.D. in Cell Biology from Case Western Reserve University in 1970 with election to Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society. He completed residency/fellowship training at the Strong Memorial Hospital, University of Rochester, UCLA School of Medicine, and Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Preventive Medicine, and the American College of Physicians, and is Board Certified in Preventive Medicine. Satcher pledged Omega Psi Phi fraternity and is an initiate at the Psi chapter of Morehouse College. Career Satcher served as professor and Chairman of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice at Morehouse School of Medicine from 1979 to 1982. He is a former faculty member of the UCLA School of Medicine, the UCLA School of Public Health, and the King-Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he developed and chaired the King-Drew Department of Family Medicine. From 1975 to 1979, he served as the interim Dean of the Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School, during which time, he negotiated the agreement with UCLA School of Medicine and the Board of Regents that led to a medical education program at King-Drew. He also directed the King-Drew Sickle Cell Research Center for six years. Satcher served as President of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1982 to 1993. He also held the posts of Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry from 1993 to 1998. Surgeon General  Vice Admiral David Satcher, USPHS Satcher served simultaneously in the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health from February 1998 through January 2001 at the US Department of Health and Human Services. As such, he is the first Surgeon General to be appointed as a four-star admiral in the PHSCC, to reflect his dual offices. In his first year as Surgeon General, Satcher released the 1998 Surgeon General's report \\"Tobacco Use Among U.S. Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups.\\" In it he reported that tobacco use was on the rise among youth in each of the country's major racial and ethnic groups, threatening their long-term health prospects. Satcher was appointed by Bill Clinton, and remained Surgeon General until 2002, contemporaneously with the first half of the first term of President George W. Bush's administration. Eve Slater would later replace him as Assistant Secretary for Health in 2001. Because he no longer held his dual office, Satcher was reverted and downgraded to the grade of vice admiral in the regular corps for the remainder of his term as Surgeon General. In 2001, his office released the report, The Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior. The report was hailed by the chairman of the American Academy of Family Physicians as an overdue paradigm shift—\\"The only way we're going to change approaches to sexual behavior and sexual activity is through school. In school, not only at the doctor's office.\\" However, conservative political groups denounced the report as being too permissive towards homosexuality and condom distribution in schools. When Satcher left office, he retired with the rank of vice admiral.  Post–Surgeon General  Upon his departure from the post, Satcher became a fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the fall of 2002, he assumed the post of Director of the National Center for Primary Care at the Morehouse School of Medicine. On December 20, 2004, Satcher was named interim president at Morehouse School of Medicine until John E. Maupin, Jr., former president of Meharry Medical College assumed the current position on February 26, 2006. In June 2006, Satcher established the Satcher Health Leadership Institute (SHLI) at Morehouse School of Medicine as a natural extension of his experiences improving public health policy for all Americans and his commitment to eliminating health disparities for minorities, the poor, and other disadvantaged groups. In 2013, he co-founded the advocacy group African American Network Against Alzheimer's. As of 2002, he sits on the boards of Johnson & Johnson and, as of 2007, MetLife.Former U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher Elected to Johnson & Johnson Board.

Retrieved 28 August 2020“Former Surgeon General Joins MetLife Board.” Global Reinsurance, 17 Jan. 2007, Former Surgeon General Joins MetLife Board. Retrieved 28 August 2020  Criticisms of health inequality  While acknowledging progress, Satcher has criticized health disparities. He asked the question, “What if we had eliminated disparities in health in the last century?” and calculated that there would have been 83,500 fewer black deaths in the year 2000. That would have included 24,000 fewer black deaths from cardiovascular disease. If infant mortality had been equal across racial and ethnic groups in 2000, 4,700 fewer black infants would have died in their first year of life. Without disparities, there would have been 22,000 fewer black deaths from diabetes and almost 2,000 fewer black women would have died from breast cancer; 250,000 fewer blacks would have been infected with HIV/AIDS and 7,000 fewer blacks would have died from complications due to AIDS in 2000. As many as 2.5 million additional blacks, including 650,000 children, would have had health insurance in that year. He called on people to work for solutions at the individual, community, and policy level. Satcher supports a Medicare-for-all style single payer health plan, in which insurance companies would be eliminated and the government would pay health care costs directly to doctors, hospitals and other providers through the tax system. In 1990, while President of Meharry Medical College, Satcher founded a quarterly academic journal entitled the Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved. Both the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Medical Library Association rate this journal as one of the nation's important public health journals.  Awards and honors  He is the recipient of many honorary degrees and numerous distinguished honors, including the Public Health Service Distinguished Service Medal, the 2013 UC Berkeley School of Public Health Public Health Heroes Award, an honorary Doctor of Science from Harvard University (2011), an honorary Doctor of Public Health from Dickinson College (2016), and top awards from the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and Ebony magazine. In 1995, he received the Breslow Award in Public Health and in 1997 the New York Academy of Medicine Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004, he received the Benjamin E.

In 1940, however, Brazilian legislators withdrew the penalty of this crime when it is practiced if there is no other way to save mother's life or if the pregnancy is the result of a rape.Brazilian Criminal Code (in Portuguese), art. 128. This does not mean that the law regards abortion in these cases as a \\"right\\", but only that women who commit this crime will not be punished. The punishment for a woman who performs an abortion on herself or consents to an abortion performed by another outside these legal exceptions is one to three years of detention.Brazilian Criminal Code (in Portuguese), art. 124. The base penalty for a third party that performs an illegal abortion with the consent of the patient, ranges from one to four years of detention, with the possibility of increase by a third if the woman comes to any physical harm, and can be doubled if she dies.Brazilian Criminal Code (in Portuguese), arts. 125 and 127. Criminal penalties fixed at four years or less can be converted to non- incarceration punishments, such as community service and compulsory donation to charity.Brazilian Criminal Code (in Portuguese), arts. 43 and 44. Brazil is a signatory of the American Human Rights Convention, also called the Pact of San José. The Convention grants the right to life to human embryos, \\"in general, from the moment of conception\\", and has a legal status on a par with the Constitution in Brazilian Law. The Civil Code of Brazil also safeguards the rights of the unborn. In a 2008 case, however, the Supreme Federal Court ruled, by a 6-5 vote, that the right to life applies only to intrauterine embryos, and that frozen embryos not eligible to a uterus transfer do not hold fundamental rights and may be manipulated for research purposes. In 2012, the Supreme Court also authorized the practice of abortion on fetuses with anencephaly. On November 29, 2016 the Supreme Court in Brazil ruled that \\"abortion should not be a crime when performed in the first three months of pregnancy\\". This ruling is very controversial, due to the fact that the Brazilian government just passed a bill, earlier in 2016, which aimed to make Brazilian law on abortion even stricter.  Statistics  The number of clandestine abortions taking place in Brazil is a very controversial subject which divides pro-life and pro-choice activists. A study published by the International Journal of Women's Health in 2014, estimated that in Brazil about 48 thousand clandestine abortions occurs annually. Pro-choice institutes like Anis - Bioethics Institute, however, estimate a much higher number. More recent studies suggest that, despite Brazil's severe legislation, 500,000 illegal abortions are estimated to occur every year among women aged 18–39 years - or one in five Brazilian women.  Impact to women's health  In 2010, it was reported that 200,000 women a year were hospitalized for complications due to abortion (which includes both miscarriages and clandestine abortions). More recent figures estimate that around 250,000 women are hospitalized every year due to illegal abortion complications, or 50% of all illegal abortions estimated per year. Those figures contrast with 2–5% of women requiring medical care after an abortion in countries where abortion is legal. The majority of women admitted at hospital after an illegal abortion are uninsured, representing a government cost of more than US$10 million every year. More than 200 women die every year in Brazil, as a direct consequence of unsafe abortions. The prevalence of reproductive complications and other negative health consequences associated with illegal abortion is unknown. Methods In a 2005 survey, one third of the Brazilian doctors who reported having performed abortions, used dilation and curettage. They have little experience with vacuum aspiration but they are aware of it as a method. They have a general awareness of medical abortion using misoprostol (Cytotec) or other prostaglandins to induce abortion but less experience with it. Few know of newer and more effective regimens using mifepristone or methotrexate. The 2005 survey also found considerable ignorance of Brazil's law on abortion, with only 48% of the physicians knowing that it is legal to save a woman's life and widespread confusion about fetal age limits. An earlier survey found that two-thirds of Brazilian OB-GYNs incorrectly believed that a judicial order is required to obtain a legal abortion and only 27% knew that the woman needed to make a written request to obtain a legal abortion. Those doctors cannot give accurate information to their patients. In non-hospital settings, women's folk medicine allegedly brings on the menstrual flow rather than causing an abortion. \\"Two folk medical conditions, \\"delayed\\" (atrasada) and \\"suspended\\" (suspendida) menstruation, are described as perceived by poor Brazilian women in Northeast Brazil. Culturally prescribed methods to \\"regulate\\" these conditions and induce menstrual bleeding are also described, including ingesting herbal remedies, patent drugs, and modern pharmaceuticals.\\" Some women, if financially able, will travel abroad to have abortions, with Cuba, Mexico, Guyana, Aruba, Curacao, French Guiana, and the United States being some of the countries women travel to. Public opinion Brazilian culture is greatly influenced by the Catholic Church. In a survey made in Ribeirão Preto (SP) in 2004, 70% of the Brazilian doctors responded that they didn't support the decriminalization of abortion in the country. The survey also suggested that 77% of the doctors of this region rejected the idea that abortion should be carried out simply because of the woman's desire. Furthermore it suggested that 82.5% of these doctors also reject the legalization of abortion due to socioeconomic difficulties. Finally, in the case of a possible legalization, only 17.5% of them would agree to carry it out professionally. A March 2007 Datafolha/Folha de S.Paulo poll found that 65% of Brazilians believe that their country's current law \\"should not be modified\\", 16% that it should be expanded \\"to allow abortion in other cases\\", 10% that abortion should be \\"decriminalized\\", and 5% were \\"not sure\\".\\"Brazilians Want to Keep Abortion as Crime .\\" (April 12, 2007). Angus Reid Global Monitor. Retrieved June 20, 2007. Another poll on this issue was made in December 2010, by the polling institute Vox Populi. This study revealed that 82% of Brazilians consider that the current law on abortion should not be modified, while 14% consider that abortion should be decriminalized, and 4% declare to have no position on the matter.População rejeita mudanças na lei sobre aborto, gays e drogas, Último Segundo, 5 de dezembro de 2010 (in Portuguese) Following the impeachment of former leftist President Dilma Rousseff, new opinion polls indicated an increase in the rejection to the legalization of abortion in Brasil. According to the Ipsos Research Institute, in 2017, 87% of Brazilians opposed the idea of legalizing abortion. The opinion polls carried out by the Paraná Research Institute also concluded that 86.5% of Brazilians are against the decriminalization. According to the IBOPE (largest research institute in Brazil), in 2018, eight out of ten Brazilians oppose legalization. This view is also followed by the majority of federal deputies, which makes it virtually impossible to attempt to legalize abortion through the Legislative Branch. All of this has led the small group of abortion supporters (led by the anthropologist Débora Diniz) to appeal to the Supreme Court, claiming that criminalization of this kind of act, \\"violates fundamental human precepts\\". In 2020, a survey conducted by Instituto Locomotiva, found that, in cases of rape, 66% of Brazilians are favorable, 34% are against, are not for or against or do not know or did not answer, among the interviewees, 17% of people of other religions, 18% of Catholics, 23% of people without religion and 31% of evangelicals are against abortion in this case . In case of fetuses with microcephaly, 58% of the population expressed opposition. Excommunication controversy In March 2009, after an abortion on a nine-year-old girl raped by her stepfather and pregnant with twins had been performed to save her life, Archbishop José Cardoso Sobrinho of Olinda and Recife stated that automatic excommunication had been incurred by the girl's mother and the medical team. President Lula da Silva and Health Minister José Gomes Temporão decried his statement, and the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil disowned it, saying that the mother was certainly not excommunicated and there was insufficient evidence to show that any member of the medical team was. The statement was criticized also on the Vatican newspaper by the President of the Pontifical Academy for Life. One of the doctors concerned said the controversy had drawn needed attention to Brazil's restrictive abortion laws.Brazil attacks church opposition to girl's abortion Stuart Grudgings, Reuters. Retrieved 2010-4-13. Anencephaly exception In July 2004, a Brazilian federal judge issued a preliminary ruling that waived the requirement for court authorization for abortions in cases of fetuses with anencephaly. The Brazilian Council of Bishops lobbied against the ruling and the National Confederation of Healthcare Workers wanted to make the exception permanent. In October 2004, the full Brazilian Supreme Court convened and voted 7-4 to suspend the judge's ruling until the full tribunal had the opportunity to deliberate and rule on the matter. A 2005 study found that 53% of doctors had performed an abortion in the case of a severely deformed fetus, even though that was not allowed by Brazilian law without a court order. Doctors who thought that the law should be more liberal were more likely to have correct knowledge of abortion law and to be familiar with the abortion law regarding severe fetal malformations. On April 12, 2012, the Supreme Federal Court ruled by an 8–2 vote to legalize abortion in cases of fetuses with anencephaly, saying that it was not about a potential life because an anencephalic fetus would certainly die and never become a person. The Catholic Church and Brazilian Pro-Life movements criticized the decision of the court, saying that even with a terminal illness, children with anencephaly also had the right to life.

Zurek for a process which is claimed to explain the appearance of wavefunction collapse and the emergence of classical descriptions of reality from quantum descriptions. In this approach, classicality is described as an emergent property induced in open quantum systems by their environments. Due to the interaction with the environment, the vast majority of states in the Hilbert space of a quantum open system become highly unstable due to entangling interaction with the environment, which in effect monitors selected observables of the system. After a decoherence time, which for macroscopic objects is typically many orders of magnitude shorter than any other dynamical timescale, a generic quantum state decays into an uncertain state which can be decomposed into a mixture of simple pointer states. In this way the environment induces effective superselection rules. Thus, einselection precludes stable existence of pure superpositions of pointer states. These 'pointer states' are stable despite environmental interaction. The einselected states lack coherence, and therefore do not exhibit the quantum behaviours of entanglement and superposition. Advocates of this approach argue that since only quasi-local, essentially classical states survive the decoherence process, einselection can in many ways explain the emergence of a (seemingly) classical reality in a fundamentally quantum universe (at least to local observers). However, the basic program has been criticized as relying on a circular argument (e.g. R. E. Kastner). So the question of whether the 'einselection' account can really explain the phenomenon of wave function collapse remains unsettled. Definition Zurek has defined einselection as follows \\"Decoherence leads to einselection when the states of the environment |\\\\epsilon_i \\\\rangle corresponding to different pointer states become orthogonal: \\\\langle \\\\epsilon_i|\\\\epsilon_j \\\\rangle = \\\\delta_{ij}\\", Details Einselected pointer states are distinguished by their ability to persist in spite of the environmental monitoring and therefore are the ones in which quantum open systems are observed. Understanding the nature of these states and the process of their dynamical selection is of fundamental importance. This process has been studied first in a measurement situation: When the system is an apparatus whose intrinsic dynamics can be neglected, pointer states turn out to be eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian between the apparatus and its environment.  In more general situations, when the system's dynamics is relevant, einselection is more complicated. Pointer states result from the interplay between self-evolution and environmental monitoring. To study einselection, an operational definition of pointer states has been introduced. This is the \\"predictability sieve\\" criterion, based on an intuitive idea: Pointer states can be defined as the ones which become minimally entangled with the environment in the course of their evolution. The predictability sieve criterion is a way to quantify this idea by using the following algorithmic procedure: For every initial pure state |\\\\psi\\\\rangle, one measures the entanglement generated dynamically between the system and the environment by computing the entropy: :: \\\\mathcal {H}_\\\\Psi (t)= -\\\\operatorname{Tr} \\\\left ( \\\\rho_\\\\Psi(t) \\\\log \\\\rho_\\\\Psi(t) \\\\right ) or some other measure of predictability   * from the reduced density matrix of the system \\\\rho_\\\\Psi \\\\left ( t \\\\right ) (which is initially \\\\rho_\\\\Psi(0)=|\\\\Psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\Psi|). The entropy is a function of time and a functional of the initial state \\\\left \\\\Psi \\\\right \\\\rangle. Pointer states are obtained by minimizing \\\\mathcal {H}_\\\\Psi\\\\, over \\\\left \\\\Psi \\\\right \\\\rangle and demanding that the answer be robust when varying the time t\\\\ . The nature of pointer states has been investigated using the predictability sieve criterion only for a limited number of examples. Apart from the already mentioned case of the measurement situation (where pointer states are simply eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian) the most notable example is that of a quantum Brownian particle coupled through its position with a bath of independent harmonic oscillators. In such case pointer states are localized in phase space, even though the interaction Hamiltonian involves the position of the particle. Pointer states are the result of the interplay between self- evolution and interaction with the environment and turn out to be coherent states. There is also a quantum limit of decoherence: When the spacing between energy levels of the system is large compared to the frequencies present in the environment, energy eigenstates are einselected nearly independently of the nature of the system-environment coupling.  Collisional decoherence  There has been significant work on correctly identifying the pointer states in the case of a massive particle decohered by collisions with a fluid environment, often known as collisional decoherence. In particular, Busse and Hornberger have identified certain solitonic wavepackets as being unusually stable in the presence of such decoherence.

The company was founded in 1989 by former Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Jim Shooter along with lawyer and businessman Steven Massarsky. In 1994, the company was sold to Acclaim Entertainment. After Acclaim declared bankruptcy in 2004, the company was restarted as part of Valiant Entertainment by entrepreneurs Dinesh Shamdasani and Jason Kothari in 2005. Valiant Entertainment launched its publishing division in 2012 as part of an initiative dubbed the \\"Summer of Valiant\\", winning Publisher of the Year and being nominated for Book of the Year at the Diamond Gem Awards. Valiant has set sales records, and was the most nominated publisher in comics at the 2014, 2015 and 2016 Harvey Awards, releasing the biggest-selling independent crossover event of the decade with \\"Book of Death\\" in 2015. Valiant was acquired by DMG Entertainment in 2018. In 2015, Valiant announced that they had partnered with Sony Pictures to produce five films based on the Bloodshot and Harbinger comic books. The rights for Harbinger would later be acquired from Sony by Paramount Pictures in 2019. Publication history Voyager Communications In 1988, former editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics Jim Shooter, Steven J. Massarsky and a group of investors attempted to purchase Marvel Entertainment. They submitted the second-highest bid, with financier Ronald Perelman submitting the highest bid and acquiring Marvel. Shooter and Massarsky instead formed Voyager Communications in 1989 with significant venture capital financing from Triumph Capital. Valiant (an imprint of Voyager Communications) recruited numerous writers and artists from Marvel, including Barry Windsor-Smith and Bob Layton, and launched an interconnected line of superhero comics featuring a mixture of characters licensed from Western Publishing and original creations. In 1991, Valiant released its first title, Magnus, Robot Fighter, cover-dated May 1991. Solar, Man of the Atom, cover- dated September 1991 followed as the next release. Rai became the third title published by Valiant and was distributed as a special insert in Magnus, Robot Fighter beginning with issue No. 5. Harbinger No. 1 was listed on the top ten list of Wizard Magazine for a record eight consecutive months and was eventually named \\"Collectible of the Decade\\" while Rai No. 0 appeared on Wizard's top ten list for a new record nine consecutive months. In 1992, Valiant won the Best Publisher under 5% Market Share from comic distributor Diamond. The next year, Valiant won Best Publisher over 5% Market Share, becoming the first publisher outside of Marvel and DC to do so. In 1992, Valiant's Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for co-creating the Valiant Universe in a ceremony that also honored Stan Lee for co-creating the Marvel Universe. However, Shooter left Valiant by the end of 1992. According to Massarsky, \\"Jim had a different idea as to the direction of the company, and he was asked to leave.\\" Valiant also engaged in several comic book-marketing innovations common in the 1990s, such as issue zero \\"origin\\" issues, the gold logo program, coupons redeemable for original comic books, and chromium covers. Following the conclusion of the \\"Unity\\" crossover in September 1992, Valiant released Bloodshot, Ninjak, H.A.R.D. Corps, The Second Life of Dr. Mirage, and Timewalker, among other titles. Acclaim Comics In 1994, Voyager Communications was purchased by video game developer and publisher Acclaim Entertainment. Acclaim created a number of video games based on Valiant properties, such as Shadow Man, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M., and Iron Man and X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal, which featured Valiant's X-O Manowar alongside Marvel's Iron Man. In 2004, after losing a major sports video game license, Acclaim became financially insolvent and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In 2005, the rights to Valiant/Acclaim's original characters such as Archer and Armstrong, Rai, and Quantum and Woody were auctioned off and bought by Valiant Entertainment, while the rights to the three licensed characters (Solar, Magnus and Turok) reverted to Classic Media (then-owner of the Gold Key Comics properties), which was acquired by DreamWorks Animation SKG in July 2012. DreamWorks itself was bought by Universal Studios in August 22, 2016. Valiant Entertainment From left to right: Valiant Chief Creative Officer Dinesh Shamdasani, Sales Manager Atom! Freeman, Marketing and Communications Manager Hunter Gorinson and Publisher Fred Pierce at Midtown Comics in Manhattan In 2005, a group of entrepreneurs led by Dinesh Shamdasani and Jason Kothari raised financing and acquired the rights to the Valiant Comics library from Acclaim Entertainment's estate, forming Valiant Entertainment. In 2007, Valiant hired former Valiant Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter to write new short stories that would accompany hardcover reprints of classic Valiant Universe stories. Two of the three collections were named among \\"The Ten Best Collected Editions\\" of their respective years of publications. In August 2011, after hiring several executives from Marvel Comics and Wizard Entertainment, including Valiant publisher Fred Pierce and Valiant editor-in-chief Warren Simons, former Marvel Comics CEO and vice chairman Peter Cuneo was brought on board as Valiant's chairman and an investor in Valiant Entertainment, with Gavin Cuneo serving as CFO and COO. In May 2012, Valiant Entertainment began publishing new monthly comic books based on the Valiant Comics universe of characters. In an event dubbed The Summer of Valiant in March 2012, Valiant Entertainment launched the Valiant Comics universe with four ongoing titles, X-O Manowar, Harbinger, Bloodshot and Archer & Armstrong, one launching each month for four months. X-O Manowar premiered May 2, 2012, with the creative team of writer Robert Venditti and artist Cary Nord. The first issue of X-O Manowar received over 42,000 preorders, making Valiant the largest new publisher launch in over a decade, and eventually sold through 4 full-priced printings and 3 additional reduced-priced printings. The release of X-O Manowar was followed by Harbinger, launched in June 2012 by writer Joshua Dysart and artist Khari Evans; Bloodshot, launched in July 2012 by writer Duane Swierczynski and artist Manuel Garcia; and Archer & Armstrong, launched in August 2012 by writer Fred Van Lente and artist Clayton Henry. To coincide with the launch of publishing in 2012, Valiant introduced the Pullbox Program, which encourages readers to start a pull box subscription for the title being launched with their comics store to obtain an exclusive alternate cover version of the comic, and the QR Voice Variant, where the reader's smartphone, after scanning a QR code on the cover of the comic, plays a video of the figure's mouth, giving the impression that the figure has come to life and is talking to the reader. Valiant Entertainment extended The Summer of Valiant 2012 event and added a fifth ongoing title with Shadowman in November 2012 by writer Justin Jordan and artist Patrick Zircher. The comic debuted as the number 1, non-Marvel and/or DC comic of the month. At the end of 2012, Valiant won a number of Publisher of the Year awards, winning Publisher of the Year under 5% Market Share and was nominated for Book of the Year for X-O Manowar No. 1 at the Diamond Gem Awards. In January 2013, Valiant announced that Chief Creative Officer and co-founder Dinesh Shamdasani had been promoted to CEO & Chief Creative Officer. Artist Clayton Crain signing copies of Valiant titles whose covers he has illustrated during an appearance at Midtown Comics in Manhattan In May 2013, Shamdasani announced The Summer of Valiant 2013, during which the company would launch two new ongoing titles, Quantum & Woody and Eternal Warrior, and publish a special Bloodshot zero issue. Quantum & Woody, written by James Asmus and drawn by Tom Fowler, launched in July 2013, and became the most-nominated title at the 2014 Harvey Awards. Several of Valiant's launch titles reached their planned conclusions in 2014, with Harbinger, Bloodshot, and Archer & Armstrong all concluding. Valiant celebrated the milestones by publishing a 48-page anniversary issue for each series' twenty-fifth issue, and hinting at new directions for the characters. Ongoing series such as X-O Manowar, Unity, and Rai continued, and were coupled with limited series such as Harbinger: Omegas, Eternal Warrior: Days of Steel, The Death-Defying Dr. Mirage and The Delinquents. In December 2013, Valiant announced the 2014 \\"Armor Hunters\\" crossover storyline, consisting of a four- issue Armor Hunter mini-series and issues of XO-Manowar and Unity. In 2014, Valiant announced several new partnerships with digital distributors, including Visionbooks, to distribute a form of animated Valiant comic books for digital devices. Following the conclusion of Armor Hunters, Valiant announced its \\"Valiant Next\\" initiative. Launching in December 2014 with the miniseries The Valiant, it continued through 2015 with the ongoing titles Ninjak, Imperium, Ivar, Timewalker and Bloodshot Reborn and the miniseries Divinity. For the Summer of 2015, Valiant announced the event miniseries Book of Death, accompanied by one-shots Book of Death: The Fall of Bloodshot, Book of Death: The Fall of Ninjak, Book of Death: The Fall of Harbinger and Book of Death: The Fall of X-O Manowar and the miniseries Book of Death: Legends of the Geomancer. Book of Death was one of the best-reviewed comics of the year and the biggest selling independent crossover event of the decade. Spinning out from Book of Death, the ongoing series Wrath of the Eternal Warrior launched in November 2015. Valiant's CEO Dinesh Shamdasani announced at Valiant Summit 2016 that Valiant would spend 2016 focusing on expanding its universe of characters beyond its core titles, launching brand new characters in the Britannia and Savage miniseries; expanding Divinity in two sequels — Divinity II and Divinity III: Stalinverse; and elevating supporting characters from the Harbinger title in two new miniseries — Generation Zero and Faith. The four-issue Faith miniseries launched in January 2016, garnering significant media interest, and was one of only a handful of series in the past decade to reach a fifth printing. In 2016, Valiant was nominated for 50 Harvey Awards, the most nominations for any publisher that year, including 8 for Bloodshot Reborn. DMG Entertainment On January 29, 2018, it was announced that DMG Entertainment had acquired full ownership of Valiant Entertainment after already owning 57% of the company. As part of the acquisition, it was announced that Valiant's CEO Dinesh Shamdasani would be leaving the company along with chairman Peter Cuneo and CFO Gavin Cueno, with Dinesh and Gavin serving as consultants, while Valiant's publishing team, overseen by publisher Fred Pierce and editor-in-chief Warren Simons, would remain.

Little Creatures Pty Ltd is owned by Little World Beverages, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lion Nathan (which is itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Kirin). History Little Creatures Brewery was founded by Howard Cearns (marketing specialist), Nic Trimboli (restaurateur) and Phil Sexton (master brewer), all of whom previously worked with the Matilda Bay Brewing Company. In 1997 Cearns, Trimboli and Sexton discussed the possibility of brewing an American style India Pale Ale. Sexton having worked in the United States and was involved in the development of the BridgePort IPA. Cearns came up with the name after reading about little creatures wandering from ale house to ale house in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and at the time thinking that it sounded like yeast fermentation. The brewery released its first beer, Little Creatures Pale Ale, in 2000.

The first USS Thatcher (DD–162) was a in the United States Navy, later transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS Niagara. Construction and career  United States Navy Named for Admiral Henry K. Thatcher, she was laid down on 8 June 1918 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Fore River Plant of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation. The ship was launched on 31 August 1918; sponsored by Miss Doris Bentley, the grandniece of Rear Admiral Thatcher. Thatcher was commissioned on 14 January 1919, Lieutenant Commander Henry M. Kieffer in temporary command. On 25 January, Lieutenant Commander Francis W. Rockwell—who later commanded the 16th Naval District in the Philippines at the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific—assumed command. Following shakedown, Thatcher operated with the Atlantic Fleet into the autumn of 1919. During the transatlantic NC-boat flights in May 1919, the destroyer operated on picket station number 9—one of 21 stations strung out from Newfoundland to the Azores—between her sister ships and . Underway at sea, she provided visual and radio bearings for the flying boats as they passed overhead on their way toward Lisbon, Portugal. Upon completion of this duty, the destroyer—reclassified as DD-162 on 17 July 1920—resumed her routine training operations off the eastern seaboard before heading west in the autumn of 1921 to join the Pacific Fleet. She operated out of San Diego, conducting exercises and training cruises off the west coast until decommissioned at San Diego on 7 June 1922. Thatcher remained laid-up at San Diego through the summer of 1939. War broke out in Europe on 1 September 1939, when German troops invaded Poland. Thatcher was recommissioned at San Diego on 18 December 1939, Lt. Comdr. Henry E. Richter in command, and conducted shakedown and training evolutions off the west coast until transferred to the Atlantic the following spring. Transiting the Panama Canal on 1 April 1940, a month before the situation in Europe became critical when Germany began her blitzkrieg against France and the Low Countries, Thatcher subsequently conducted neutrality patrols and training cruises off the east coast and in the Gulf of Mexico through the summer of 1940. The European situation took a drastic turn with the fall of France in June 1940. British destroyer forces in the wake of the Norwegian campaign and the evacuation of Dunkirk found themselves thinly spread—especially after Italy entered the war on Germany's side. Prime Minister Winston Churchill appealed to the United States for help. In response, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order authorizing the transfer of 50 over-aged destroyers to the British in return for 99-year leases on strategic base sites in the Western Hemisphere. Thatcher was accordingly withdrawn from the Atlantic Squadron and her operations with Destroyer Division 69 for transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy, which had been allocated six of the \\"50 ships that saved the world,\\" as these vessels came to be known. As such, Thatcher and her five sisters arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 20 September—the third group of the \\"flush deckers\\" transferred. Decommissioned on 24 September 1940, Thatcher was struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1941. Royal Canadian Navy Renamed HMCS Niagara following the Canadian practice of naming destroyers after Canadian rivers (but with deference to the U.S. origin), after the Niagara River forming the border between New York and Ontario.Milner 1985 p.23 Niagara departed Halifax on 30 November; proceeded eastward via St. John's, Newfoundland; and arrived in the British Isles on 11 December. Early in 1941, the destroyer was allocated to the 4th Escort Group, Western Approaches Command, and based at Greenock, Scotland. Subsequently transferred to the Newfoundland escort force, Niagara operated on convoy escort duties into the summer of 1941. While she was operating with this force, she took part in the capture of a German U-boat, U-570. A Lockheed Hudson bomber, flying from Kaldaðarnes, southeast of Reykjavík, Iceland, located U-570 running on the surface off the Icelandic coast on 27 August 1941. The Hudson attacked the U-boat with depth charges, damaging the enemy craft so severely that she could not submerge. Soon, some of the German crew appeared on deck displaying a large white cloth — possibly a bed sheet — indicating that they had surrendered. Patently unable to capture the submarine herself, the Hudson radioed for help. Niagara sped to the scene and arrived at 08:20 on 28 August 1941. Rough weather initially hampered the operation but eventually, by 18:00, Niagara had placed a prize crew aboard the submarine and had taken U-570 in tow. During the operation, she also took the 43-man crew of the enemy craft on board. Towed to Þorlákshöfn, Iceland, the U-boat eventually served in the Royal Navy as . In January 1942, Niagara escorted the tempest-battered Danish merchantman Triton into Belfast, Northern Ireland, after the freighter had been severely mauled in a storm at sea. In March the destroyer rescued the survivors from the US merchantman SS Independence Hall, which had run aground off Sable Island, Nova Scotia, and had broken in half. The next month, she picked up two boatloads of survivors from the sunken steamer SS Rio Blanco, which had been torpedoed by on 1 April 1942, east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The destroyer subsequently underwent boiler repairs at Pictou, Nova Scotia from May to August 1942 before resuming coastwise convoy operations between Halifax and New York and escort duty in the western Atlantic. Another refit at Pictou came in June and October 1943, before she continued her coastwise convoy escort missions through 1944. Niagara became a torpedo-firing ship — first at Halifax and later at Saint John, New Brunswick — from the spring of 1945 until the end of World War II in mid-August 1945, training torpedomen. Decommissioned on 15 September 1945, Niagara was turned over to the War Assets Corporation on 27 May 1946 and broken up for scrap soon thereafter.

It consists of blood proteins that play a role in inflammation, blood pressure control, coagulation and pain. Its important mediators bradykinin and kallidin are vasodilators and act on many cell types. History The system was discovered in 1909 when researchers discovered that injection with urine (high in kinins) led to hypotension (low blood pressure). The researchers Emil Karl Frey, Heinrich Kraut and Eugen Werle discovered high-molecular weight kininogen in urine around 1930. Etymology kinin [Gk] kīn(eîn) to move, set in motion. kallikrein [Gk ] kalli~ sweet and krein = kreos, flesh, named for the pancreatic extracts where it was first discovered Members The system consists of a number of large proteins, some small polypeptides and a group of enzymes that activate and deactivate the compounds. Proteins High- molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and low-molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) are precursors of the polypeptides. They have no activity of themselves. * HMWK is produced by the liver together with prekallikrein (see below). It acts mainly as a cofactor on coagulation and inflammation, and has no intrinsic catalytic activity. * LMWK is produced locally by numerous tissues, and secreted together with tissue kallikrein. Polypeptides * Bradykinin (BK), which acts on the B2 receptor and slightly on B1, is produced when kallikrein releases it from HMWK. It is a nonapeptide (9 amino acids) with the amino acid sequence Arg–Pro–Pro–Gly–Phe–Ser–Pro–Phe–Arg. * Kallidin (KD) is released from LMWK by tissue kallikrein. It is a decapeptide. KD has the same amino acid sequence as Bradykinin with the addition of a Lysine at the N-terminus, thus is sometimes referred to as Lys-Bradykinin. HMWK and LMWK are formed by alternative splicing of the same gene.Goodman & Gilman's Pharmacology; Chapter 24. Histamine, Bradykinin, and Their Antagonists Enzymes *thumbKallikreins (tissue and plasma kallikrein) are serine proteases that liberate kinins (BK and KD) from the kininogens, which are plasma proteins that are converted into vasoactive peptides.Kumar, V., Abbas, A., Fausto, N. (Editors) Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease. 7th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier 2005;Page 65. Prekallikrein is the precursor of plasma kallikrein. It can only activate kinins after being activated itself by factor XIIa or other stimuli. * Carboxypeptidases are present in two forms: N circulates and M is membrane-bound. They remove arginine residues at the carboxy-terminus of BK and KD. * Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), also termed kininase II, inactivates a number of peptide mediators, including bradykinin. It is better known for activating angiotensin. * Neutral endopeptidase also deactivates kinins and other mediators. Pharmacology Inhibition of ACE with ACE inhibitors leads to decreased conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor) but also to an increase in bradykinin due to decreased degradation. This explains why some patients taking ACE inhibitors develop a dry cough, and some react with angioedema, a dangerous swelling of the head and neck region. There are hypotheses that many of the ACE-inhibitors' beneficial effects are due to their influence on the kinin-kallikrein system. This includes their effects in arterial hypertension, in ventricular remodeling (after myocardial infarction) and possibly diabetic nephropathy. Role in disease Defects of the kinin-kallikrein system in diseases are not generally recognized. The system is the subject of much research due to its relationship to the inflammation and blood pressure systems. It is known that kinins are inflammatory mediators that cause dilation of blood vessels and increased vascular permeability. Kinins are small peptides produced from kininogen by kallikrein and are broken down by kininases. They act on phospholipase and increase arachidonic acid release and thus prostaglandin (PGE2) production. C1-INH Involvement C1-inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) protein. C1-INH is the most important physiological inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, fXIa and fXIIa. C1-INH also inhibits proteinases of the fibrinolytic, clotting, and kinin pathways. Deficiency of C1-INH permits plasma kallikrein activation, which leads to the production of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin.

Cattle-breeding, grape cultivation and wine making were well-developed. In 298 AD, part of Arzanene was conquered by the Roman Empire, while the 387 Peace of Acilisene gave the rest of the region, except for the Aghdzn district, to the Romans as well. By 591, all of Arzanene had been annexed by the East Roman or Byzantine Empire. In the place of destroyed Tigranakert, the Romans built a new city named Martyropolis or Nprkert. During the Arab conquest of Armenia, many Arab tribes settled in Arzanene. The Armenian population remained in the mountainous parts until the Armenian Genocide in 1915. Arzanene was later a small Arab emirate under the Zurarid dynasty in the 9th century. In the 10th century the area fell under Hamdanid control. Hamdum, an Arab chief, conquered Arzanene and Amid around 962. In 963 a sister of Hamdum whose name is not given in the original sources, governed the region for ten years. After that Arzanene was part of the Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia. After 1045 it fell successively under Byzantine, Seljuk, Mongol and Ottoman Turkish control.

The village lies about east of Westbury and the same distance southwest of Devizes. Erlestoke Prison, the only prison in Wiltshire, is within the parish. History The ancient parish of Erlestoke was a chapelry of Melksham. The Crown was lord of the manor of Erlestoke; the first recorded grant of land was by Henry I in the 12th century. From the 16th until the early 18th the Brouncker family held land at Erlestoke, including Henry Brouncker, a Member of parliament in the 16th and early 17th. Later owners included Peter Delmé, an 18th-century MP; Joshua Smith (1732-1819), MP for Devizes; and George Watson-Taylor (1771-1841), also MP for Devizes. The Watson-Taylors built up large estates at Erlestoke, Coulston (including Baynton House), Great Cheverell and Edington until they were divided and sold between 1907 and 1910, following the death in 1902 of Simon Watson Taylor; Erlestoke Park remained in the family until it was sold in 1919. The current form of the village is largely due to Joshua Smith, who between the 1780s and the 1810s was responsible for replacing the existing Elizabethan house with one higher up the hill east of the village. He landscaped the park which surrounds the village on three sides, adding a lake, and moving the houses of the village to the current High Street. Newly built estate cottages incorporated pieces of sculpture and architectural fragments from the earlier manor house; an example is Tilted Lodge, c. 1800. Tilted Lodge By 1859 there was a school in a building owned by the Watson-Taylors, which formerly served as the laundry for the Erlestoke Park estate. The building was extended in 1893 and came into Church ownership in 1920; children of all ages attended until 1935, when older children were transferred elsewhere. The school closed in 1980 following the building of a new primary school at Great Cheverell. The Church of the Holy Saviour was built next to the gates of Erlestoke Park in 1880 by G.E. Street for Lady Hannah Watson-Taylor (1818-1887), wife of Simon Watson Taylor. The building has fragments of an earlier church dedicated to St James, possibly from the 12th century; the 16th-century pulpit and five 17th- century bells are also from the earlier church. 18th-century tombs remain in the disused churchyard of the former church, some 150 metres to the northeast. St Saviour's Church The Stert and Westbury Railway was built through the parish by the Great Western Railway Company in 1900, providing routes from London to Weymouth or Taunton. There was a station at Lavington, from Erlestoke by road. It was closed in 1967 and no local stations remain; the nearest railway stations are Pewsey and Westbury. In the 1930s, the War Office purchased of land in the parish, for accommodation for personnel undergoing training in the area. The Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 map of 1958 shows many small buildings south of the road, opposite Erlestoke House; although the access tracks remain, the buildings are no longer standing. Erlestoke House was seriously damaged by a fire in 1950. Since 1960 it has been part of HM Prison Erlestoke, with several additional buildings constructed on the same site. Local government Erlestoke has an elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most significant local government functions. Map of the village, 1922  Amenities  The church is now part of the benefice of Bratton, Edington and Imber, Erlestoke, and Coulston. The Wessex Ridgeway long-distance footpath crosses Stoke Hill in the south of the parish. A former walled kitchen garden has been the home of Erlestoke and Coulston Cricket Club since 1991. Erlestoke golf course opened in 1992, west of the village. There was a pub, the George and Dragon, in a 17th-century building; it closed in April 2015.  People  The composer Peter Seabourne lived at Brouncker's Court Farm in Erlestoke from 1961-1989,http://www.peterseabourne.com studying at Clare College, Cambridge (1980–83) with Robin Holloway. The composer Anthony Scott (pupil of Gerald Finzi and Ralph Vaughan Williams)http://www.mvdaily.com/articles/1999/02/musing03.htm also lived in the village in the late 1980s, as did the comedians Lenny Henry and Dawn French.

It is equal to the ratio of the partial decay constant to the overall decay constant. Sometimes a partial half-life is given, but this term is misleading; due to competing modes it is not true that half of the particles will decay through a particular decay mode after its partial half-life. The partial half- life is merely an alternate way to specify the partial decay constant λ, the two being related through: :t_{1/2} = \\\\frac{\\\\ln 2}{\\\\lambda}. For example, for spontaneous decays of 132Cs, 98.1% are ε or β+ decays, and 1.9% are β− decays. The partial decay constants can be calculated from the branching fraction and the half-life of 132Cs (6.479 d), they are: 0.10 d−1 (ε + β+) and 0.0020 d−1 (β−). The partial half-lives are 6.60 d (ε + β+) and 341 d (β−). Here the problem with the term partial half-life is evident: after (341+6.60) days almost all the nuclei will have decayed, not only half as one may initially think. Isotopes with significant branching of decay modes include copper-64, arsenic-74, rhodium-102, indium-112, iodine-126 and holmium-164.

Manley was the first African-American woman appointed as chief resident at Cook County Children's Hospital in Chicago (1962). Manley was the first to achieve the rank of Assistant Surgeon General (Rear Admiral) in 1988 and later served as the eighth president of Spelman College. Early life Audrey Elaine Manley (née Forbes) was born on March 25, 1934, in Jackson, Mississippi. Her parents, Ora Lee Buckhalter and Jesse Lee Forbes, quickly relocated Manley and her two sisters, Barbara and Yvonne, to Tougaloo, Mississippi, near Tougaloo College. She was the eldest of three daughters in a tenant farming family. Manley was inspired to pursue medicine after the death of her maternal grandmother as well as with the encouragement from her seventh-grade science teacher. During World War II, the Forbes family moved to Chicago after her grandmother could no longer care for her and her siblings. Education In 1951, Manley graduated as the class valedictorian from Wendell Phillips High School in Chicago. She then received a full-tuition music scholarship to Spelman College, where she majored in biology, with a double minor in chemistry and mathematics. Manley graduated cum laude from Spelman College in 1955. She then continued her education at Meharry Medical College on a full-tuition scholarship and graduated in 1959. Nearly 30 years later, in 1987, Manley received a master's degree in public health from Johns Hopkins University. Career In 1962, Manley began her medical career and completed her residency in Chicago by being appointed as the first African- American woman to be chief resident as Cook County Children's Hospital. During her residency, Manley taught pediatrics at the Cook County School of Nursing. In 1970, Manley moved back to Atlanta after her marriage and began to work at Grady Memorial Hospital's Emory University Family Planning Clinic as the Chief of Medical Services. She simultaneously began to serve as \\"First Lady\\" for the remainder of her husband's tenure as the fifth president of Spelman College and created initiatives such as the Health Career Program. In 1976, Manley was appointed as a captain in the U.S. Public Health Service. Over the next decade, Manley continued her medical pursuits in pediatrics and medical education at a number of institutions including the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois, Chicago Medical College, Emory University and Howard University. Additionally, Manley studied sickle cell disease and fought for government funding of sickle-cell research. Beginning in 1989, Manley held a host of government jobs with the U.S. Public Health Service including becoming the first black woman to serve as Principal Deputy Assistant for Public Health (1989), Member of the U.S. Delegation to UNICEF and the UNICEF/WHO Joint Committee on Health Policy (1990-1993), Deputy Surgeon General (1994), and Co- Founder Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health. Manley became the first black woman to serve as acting Surgeon General of the United States from 1995 to 1997, between the tenures of Joycelyn Elders and David Satcher. During her tenure, Manley focused on emphasizing the importance of physical activity and the health benefits accompanying exercise. Spelman presidency From 1997 to 2002, Manley served as the 8th President of Spelman College, a historically black college for women in Atlanta, Georgia. She was the first alumna to be elected president of the college, carrying on the legacy of her husband, Dr. Albert E. Manley, who was the first African American and male president of Spelman College from 1953 to 1976. During her tenure, the college continued to achieve high rankings in multiple areas, including the second-highest producer of black medical students. Additionally, Spelman joined Division II of the NCAA and received a chapter in Phi Beta Kappa. Later years Though Manley has been retired since 2002, she continues to be involved in the National Merit Scholarship Corporation and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Personal life During Manley's youth, she was well-connected in the black community, attending social events with the likes of Roy Wood and Don Cornelius. Manley also demonstrated her passion for service with Crossroads Africa where she ran a children's ward in a Nigerian hospital. Additionally, she worked in San Francisco to give medical services to children addicted to drugs. The earliest known encounter between Manley (then Forbes) and her future husband, Albert Manley, occurred while Manley was still a student at Spelman, where she convinced then-President Manley to allow her to take advanced science courses at Morehouse College. The two reconnected when Forbes was chosen as a Board of Trustees member at Spelman. The couple married in 1970. Legacy Manley has received awards from the National Council of Negro Women (1979), the United States Public Health Service (1981, 1992), the Young Women's Christian Association (1999) and the Atlanta City Council (2002). Manley has received honorary degrees from Tougaloo College in 1991, and is an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta, Incorporated.

She was named for Admiral John Grimes Walker. History Walker was laid down on 19 June 1918 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company under contract from Bethlehem Steel Co.. The destroyer was launched on 14 September 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Francis Pickering Thomas. Walker was commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 31 January 1919 with Lieutenant Commander Harold A. Waddington in command. Walker got underway on 20 February to rendezvous with the transport as it returned from France with President Woodrow Wilson. Upon completion of this duty, the new destroyer returned to Boston, where she was soon assigned to Division 18, Destroyer Force. She proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, and loaded her full allotment of torpedoes at the Naval Torpedo Station. She sailed for the West Indies on 6 March and, soon after her arrival in the Caribbean fell into the Fleet's regular schedule of exercises and maneuvers. Walker conducted tactical exercises off San Juan, Puerto Rico, and gunnery exercises out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into the late winter of 1919 and early spring of 1920 before she headed north. After steaming into New York Harbor on 14 April, the destroyer was sent to her base at Newport. Early the next month, she supported the Navy's NC-boat transatlantic flights. Initially stationed at Trepassey Bay from 6 May to 8 May, she later operated at sea from 10 to 17 May, serving as one of the chain of picket ships to provide the NC flying boats with position reports and bearings. When this mission was completed, she returned to Newport on 20 May. Her next port of call was Annapolis, Maryland, in early June for a two-day visit during Naval Academy graduation exercises, after which Walker headed south and transited the Panama Canal on 24 July. She called briefly at Acapulco, Mexico, for two days before steaming for southern California, arriving at Coronado on 8 August. Based at San Diego, Walker conducted local operations off the United States West Coast into late 1920, when she was assigned to the Reserve Destroyer Flotilla. She embarked naval reservists for an indoctrination cruise on 27 October 1920 and remained in \\"rotating reserve\\" duty, conducting periodic target practices, full-power runs, and undergoing overhauls at the Mare Island Navy Yard. Decommissioned on 7 June 1922, as part of an austerity program, Walker was placed in reserve at San Diego, where she remained into the 1930s. After 16 years on \\"Red Lead Row,\\" the ship was struck from the Navy list on 28 March 1938 and slated for disposal by sale. Logistics requirements of U.S. West Coast naval districts, however, resulted in the former destroyer being placed back on the list and earmarked for conversion to a water barge. Redesignated YW-57 on 1 April 1939, the ship was undergoing conversion at the Mare Island Navy Yard when the Navy again decided to change the vessel's role. With the outbreak of war in Europe and the possibility of American involvement in the conflict, the ship was slated for use as a damage control hulk. Fate Designated as the damage control hulk DCH-1 on 11 July 1940, the vessel was based at the Destroyer Base, San Diego, and used for training exercises in formulating and evolving new damage control techniques. In the following year, as the Pacific Fleet's base had been moved from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, plans were made to tow DCH-1 (which had been stripped of propulsion machinery during the initial conversion work to YW-57) to the Hawaiian Islands. She was re-designated as IX-44 on 17 February 1941.

St. Louis won their seventh world championship, while the Yankees, who had appeared in 14 of 16 World Series since 1949, did not play in the Series again until . In an unusual twist, the Yankees fired Yogi Berra after the Series ended, replacing him with Johnny Keane, who had resigned from the Cardinals after the Series. His job had been threatened by Cardinals management, and it was unexpectedly saved by the Cardinals' dramatic pennant drive. This was also the last World Series that matched the Yankees up against the Cardinals; in the previous four meetings, each team had won twice, with the Yankees winning in 1928 and 1943, and the Cardinals in 1926 and 1942. This pennant for the Yankees concluded their remarkable run of 15 World Series appearances over 18 years. In total, they won 29 American League championships in the 44-year span from 1921 through 1964. Background The 1964 World Series, and the season leading up to it, later became the subject for the David Halberstam New York Times bestseller October 1964. The Series is seen as a bellwether point in baseball history as it was the last hurrah for the 1950s Yankee Dynasty of Mantle, Maris, Ford and Berra, among others, and it demonstrated that the National League's growing enthusiasm to sign black and Latino players (such as those of the '64 Cardinals) was a permanent paradigm shift in fielding a championship team. The Series featured the brother-against-brother match-up of Ken Boyer of the Cardinals and Clete Boyer of the Yankees, both of whom started at third base for their respective teams. For the first time in Series history, all six umpires rotated through their positions. In all Series from 1947 through 1963, only the four infield umpires had rotated, with the last two umpires working only in the outfield throughout the Series. Mickey Mantle, playing in his last Series, hit three home runs, raising his total to a record-setting 18, surpassing Babe Ruth's mark of 15. Utility infielder Chet Trail, who had no prior major league experience, appeared on the Yankees' World Series roster to fill the opening created by an injury to Tony Kubek. Trail did not play in the series (Phil Linz played in place of Kubek), and Trail never appeared in a major league game during his career. Both Berra and Keane were St. Louis natives, though neither had ever played for the hometown Cardinals; Berra's entire playing career was spent in New York, while Keane played in the Cardinals' farm system but never reached the major leagues as a player. Yankees After winning the American League pennant in 1963, the Yankees faced strong challenges from the pitching-rich Chicago White Sox and up-and- coming Baltimore Orioles in 1964. On August 22, the Yankees were in third place, games out of first. Led by recently called up pitcher Mel Stottlemyre (who went 9–3), and helped by the post trade deadline acquisition of relief pitcher Pedro Ramos (2–0 with seven saves for New York) from Cleveland, the Yankees went 27–8 to take a game lead with five to play. After losing two games in Detroit, the Yankees clinched the pennant on the next-to-last day of the season with an 8–3 win over the Indians. Cardinals The Cardinals were coming off a second-place finish in 1963, and their road to the World Series was even more dramatic than that of the Yankees. After a season-long four-way race among the Cardinals, San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, and Cincinnati Reds, the Phillies appeared to have the pennant in hand as they built a game lead with 12 games to play. But they proceeded to lose 10 straight games. With two games remaining, four teams still had a mathematical chance to win the pennant. The Giants were the first to be eliminated when they lost on October 3 to the Cubs, 10–7. The Cardinals lost to the lowly Mets, 15–5, while the Phillies ended their 10-game losing streak with a 4–3 win over the Reds. Going into the last day of the season, the Cardinals and Reds were tied for first and the Phillies were one game back; the Phillies hoped to force the first three-way tie in major league history by defeating the Reds and hoping the Mets would beat the Cardinals. The Phillies did their part by defeating the Reds, 10–0, but the Cardinals overcame an early 3–2 deficit and beat the Mets, 11–5, to win the pennant. During the season the Cardinals would be involved in the Lou Brock-for-Ernie Broglio trade, later considered one of the more lopsided trades in baseball history. Summary Matchups Game 1 Mike Shannon The Cardinals' scouting report indicated that injuries had taken their toll on Mickey Mantle's defense and that he could be run on.Halberstam 318 They acted on this intelligence, taking extra bases repeatedly and scoring from second on singles in the second and sixth innings.\\"Speed Won the World Series\\", Sports Illustrated, Oct. 26, 1964 The Cardinals also believed that they should swing early in the count against Whitey Ford, and this strategy also paid off, as Ray Sadecki, Carl Warwick, and Mike Shannon all drove in runs on the first or second pitches of their at-bats.\\"An Even Series—With Some Fresh Faces\\", Sports Illustrated, October 19, 1964 The Cardinals struck first in the bottom of the first off Whitey Ford on Ken Boyer's sacrifice fly after two one-out singles, but Tom Tresh's two-run home run after a single off Ray Sadecki put the Yankees up 2–1 in the second. They made it 3–1 when Clete Boyer singled, stole second, and scored on Ford's single. The Cardinals cut the lead to 3–2 in the bottom of the inning when Mike Shannon hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a groundout, and scored on Sadecki's single. Tresh's RBI double in the fifth after two two-out singles made it 4–2 Yankees, but the Cardinals sent eight men to the plate in the sixth inning. Shannon's home run after a single tied the game, then after Tim McCarver doubled, Al Downing relieved Ford and allowed a two-out RBI single to Carl Warwick and a single to Curt Flood to put the Cardinals up 6–4. The Yankees cut the lead to one in the eighth when Johnny Blanchard doubled and scored on Bobby Richardson's single off Barney Schultz, but the Cardinals padded their lead in the bottom half, loading the bases off Rollie Sheldon on two walks and an error, then Flood's RBI single and Lou Brock's two-run double off Pete Mikkelsen put them up 9–5. Schultz retired the Yankees in order in the ninth for the save. Ford pitched with severe pain and numbness in his arm for much of the 1964 season, and that day he was again in pain and missing with sliders inside. Shannon came up looking for sliders and hit one 500 feet.Halberstam 320 This was the last World Series appearance by Ford, whose shoulder had been injured during the season. Ford had pitched in 22 World Series games with the Yankees, compiling ten victories, going back to the sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1950, and set a record which still stands by pitching consecutive scoreless innings across three different World Series (1960–62). Game 2 Mel Stottlemyre Rookie Mel Stottlemyre, called up from the minors in August, dominated for New York and the Cardinal bullpen wilted in the late innings. The Cardinals struck first in the third on Curt Flood's groundout with runners on second and third, but the Yankees tied the game in the fourth on Clete Boyer's bases-loaded sacrifice fly off Bob Gibson. After a walk and hit-by-pitch in the sixth, Tom Tresh's RBI single put the Yankees up 2–1. Next inning, Phil Linz hit a leadoff single, moved to third on a wild pitch, and scored on Bobby Richardson's single. After moving to third on a single, Richardson scored on Mickey Mantle's groundout. Lou Brock's groundout in the eighth with runners on second and third shaved the lead to 4–2, but the Yankees blew the game open in the ninth. Linz's leadoff home run off Barney Schultz made it 5–2 Yankees. After a one-out single, Gordie Richardson relieved Schultz and allowed an RBI double to Mantle. After an intentional walk, Joe Pepitone's RBI single and Tresh's sacrifice fly made it 8–2 Yankees. The Cardinals got a run in the bottom half when Dick Groat hit a leadoff triple and scored on Tim McCarver's single, but Stottlemyre retired the next two hitters to end the game as the Yankees' 8–3 win tied the series heading to New York. Game 3 Mickey Mantle Curt Simmons and Jim Bouton were both very effective. Simmons got 17 ground-ball outs. The Yankees scored a run in the second on Clete Boyer's RBI double with two on, but Simmons's RBI single tied the game in the fifth. Bouton stranded the go-ahead run four times and held the top five hitters in the Cardinal lineup to a 2 for 21 day. In the bottom of the ninth, Mickey Mantle reached deep for one of the last ounces of Yankees magic. With the game tied at one, Mantle, the leadoff hitter, told on-deck hitter Elston Howard to go back to the clubhouse because he was going to hit a home run.Halberstam 329 Mantle swung at the first pitch from Barney Schultz, a knuckleball that failed to move, and hit it into the right field stands to win the game for the Yankees. Schultz had been a mainstay of the Cardinals' stretch run and Yankee scouting reports had advised that his knuckler was most vulnerable on the first pitch when he threw harder than usual to try for a strike. Mantle's home run (his 16th Series home run) broke Babe Ruth's record for most home runs hit in World Series play. Game 4 Ken Boyer Cardinal starting pitcher Ray Sadecki let the first four Yankees hit safely. After a leadoff double by Phil Linz, Bobby Richardson's RBI double put the Yankees up 1–0. After a single, Mickey Mantle's RBI single made it 2–0 and Sadecki was promptly removed by manager Keane. Roger Craig came in to pitch and gave up an RBI single to Elston Howard but allowed no more damage. After five innings, New York was still up 3–0 and St. Louis had only one hit off Downing. The turning point of the game — and the Series — came in the top of the sixth. Carl Warwick led off with his third pinch-hit base hit, tying a World Series record. Curt Flood singled to put runners on first and second. After Lou Brock flied out, Dick Groat reached base on a slow roller that was bobbled by Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson. Instead of runners on second and third with two out, the bases were loaded with one out. In the first game, Yankee Al Downing struck Cardinal Ken Boyer out with a high changeup. Downing faced Boyer again with the bases loaded, and Boyer guessed that he'd see the high changeup again. He guessed right, and hit a grand-slam. Ron Taylor relieved Craig and gave up one hit over the last four innings. The Cardinals won the game 4–3; instead of trailing three games to one, Boyer's grand slam enabled then to even the Series at two games apiece. Game 5 Tim McCarver The game was scoreless in the top of the fifth inning when the Cardinals plated two. Pitcher Bob Gibson led off the inning with a single. Center fielder Curt Flood hit a grounder to second base that Bobby Richardson fumbled. Instead of a potential double play, the Cardinals had two runners on. Lou Brock, hitless in his previous 14 at bats, singled in Gibson. Flood scored on a Bill White ground out after Phil Linz made another misplay, throwing a ball into the dirt at first on what should have been the back end of a double play.Halberstam 339 The Yankees were still down 2–0 when they rallied in the ninth inning. Mantle reached base on an error by Dick Groat. With one out and one on, Joe Pepitone smashed a bouncer off Bob Gibson's leg, the ball ricocheting towards the third-base line. Gibson recovered quickly and threw to first, and the Cardinals were one out away.Halberstam 340 With two out, though, Tom Tresh crushed a long drive into the right center field bleachers and the game was tied. The game went to extra innings, and it was the Cardinals who seized the initiative. With two on and one out and lefty hitter Tim McCarver up, Berra stuck with right-hander Pete Mikkelsen rather than using lefty specialist Steve Hamilton.Halberstam 340–1 McCarver delivered a three run home run in the tenth inning to send the Cardinals back to St. Louis with a 3–2 lead in the series. Just 22 years old at the time, McCarver would go 11–for–23 (.478) in the series. For his entire career McCarver would hit .271. This was the last postseason game at Yankee Stadium before its renovation following the 1973 season. Game 6 Roger Maris (left) and Mickey Mantle (right) The Cardinals struck first in Game 6 on Bill White's double play with runners on first and third in the first off Jim Bouton, but the Yankees tied the score in the fifth when Tom Tresh hit a leadoff double and scored on Bouton's two-out single off Curt Simmons. Back-to-back home runs by Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle put the Yankees up 3–1 in the sixth before they blew the game open in the eighth. With two on and two outs off Barney Schultz, Elston Howard's RBI single made it 4–1 Yankees. After a walk loaded the bases, Gordie Richardson relieved Schultz and allowed a grand slam to Joe Pepitone to put the Yankees up 8–1. The Cardinals scored a run in the bottom of the inning on Bill White's RBI groundout with runners on second and third and no out, then in the ninth, Bob Skinner hit an RBI single with two on off Steve Hamilton (the run charged to Bouton) before Curt Flood hit into the game-ending double play. The Yankees' 8–3 win forced a deciding Game 7. Game 7 Bob Gibson \\"Something had to give\\" in Game 7, as the Yankees had lost back-to-back World Series only once (to the New York Giants in 1921–22), and were in danger of doing so again, having lost to the Dodgers in 1963; and the Cardinals had never lost a World Series Game 7. Bob Gibson pitched his third start in this Series on two days rest. He was tired but deliberately worked fast to hide his fatigue from the Yankees.Halberstam 345 In the bottom of the fourth the Cardinals scored three times. Again the Yankees botched a double play when Linz's throw to first went wide, and Bill White scored. McCarver then scored from third on a double steal.Halberstam 347 Al Downing came in for the fifth after Stottlemyre developed shoulder stiffness,Halberstam 348 and Lou Brock hit his first pitch for a home run. Two more runs made it 6–0. Mantle cut the gap in half with a three-run homer in the sixth, adding to his own record for total home runs in the World Series. Ken Boyer responded with a home run in the seventh that pushed the lead to 7–3. Bobby Richardson broke a World Series hit record in the seventh with his 13th hit, later tied by Brock in 1968 and Marty Barrett in 1986. Gibson continued to tire, but manager Keane left him in.Halberstam 349 Ken Boyer's brother Clete hit a home run for New York with one out in the ninth, making the score 7–4. Pinch-hitter Johnny Blanchard struck out. Linz hit another home run, pulling New York to within two, 7–5, but the next batter, Richardson, popped up to second baseman Dal Maxvill and the Cardinals won the Series. Bob Gibson won the Series MVP award for his 2–1 record, 3.00 ERA, and 27 IP. Jim Bouton, pitching for the Yankees, started two games and won them both, compiling a 1.56 Series ERA. Six years later, he would write the classic baseball memoir, Ball Four. After the series, the Yankees fired manager Yogi Berra and replaced him with the Cardinal manager, Keane, who quit St. Louis due to his differences with Cardinal owner Gussie Busch. Yogi Berra would go on to join the New York Mets, the following season and be re-united with Casey Stengel as a player/coach. The 1964 Cardinals were the only team between 1962 and 1972 to win the World Series when owning home-field advantage. Game 7 was the last postseason game to be played at the first Busch Stadium, and the last such game to be played in St. Louis until 1967 (at Busch Memorial Stadium, which opened during the previous season), when the Cardinals defeated the Boston Red Sox to win their next world championship. The first non-World Series postseason games to be played in St. Louis occurred in 1982, when the Cardinals defeated the Atlanta Braves in the NLCS and the then- American League Milwaukee Brewers in the World Series. The Cardinals also ended their first season at the current Busch Stadium with a World Series win over the Detroit Tigers in ; the Yankees (then in their first season at the current Yankee Stadium) did the same thing in by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in that year's World Series.

Professionals Australia has approximately 25,000 members from the following professions: engineers, scientists, managers, architects, IT professionals, pharmacists, veterinarians, surveyors, translators and collieries staff in addition to student members. Professionals Australia is an example of a union that is organised along occupational lines. For this reason its coverage areas overlap substantially with industry unions which now represent the majority of union members in Australia. As it also covers managers, it is also in the unusual position that, in negotiations on behalf of employee members, the employer representatives with whom it is negotiating may also be union members. This makes it a trade union for the purposes of worker-employer bargaining; Professionals Australia is affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). Professionals Australia acts to service member needs, primarily in terms of salary and industrial advice. This places Professionals Australia within the services model of trade unionism. It also performs many of the functions of a professional association. Professionals Australia is not affiliated to either major political party. APESMA's journal for members is the Professional Network, published bi-monthly. History Professionals Australia began as The Association of Professional Engineers, Australia (APEA) which formed in 1946 and registered as an industrial association in 1948. APEA was the first organisation to ensure that professionals be recognised and rewarded for the high-value work they do. The Professional Engineers Case finalised in 1961 saw engineers across Australia receive salary increases averaging more than 40 per cent. Even more importantly it set the precedent for work value and benchmark salaries for professionals. Professionals Australia has Government approval as an assessment entity for the only mandatory engineering registration scheme in Australia – the Registered Professional Engineers of Queensland (RPEQ).http://RPEQ Assessment Professionals Australia offer assessment in the areas of Civil, Electrical, Information, Technology and Telecommunications, Management, Mechanical and Structural Engineering.http://www.bpeq.qld.gov.au/BPEQ/Registration/The_Registration_and_Assessment_Process/BPEQ/Navigation/Registration/The_Registration_and_Assessment_Process.aspx?hkey=30592b84-6587-409e-a050-953100f49124 APEA grew by a process of mergers of white collar, professional and managerial employee associations over a long period of years: *1991 : The Association of Professional Scientists, Australia *1991 : The Local Government Engineers Association of New South Wales *1994 : Senior Managers (Telstra & Australia Post) Association *1994 : ABC Senior Executives Association *1995 : Association of Architects of Australia *1997 : Salaried Pharmacists Association *1997 : Association of Railway Professional Officers of Australia *2001 : Australian Collieries Staff Association *2004 : Managers & Professionals Association *2006 : Professional Officers Association of Victoria (POAV) (formed as POA in 1917) APEA became APESA (Association of Professional Engineers and Scientists, Australia) in 1991, and APESMA (Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers Australia) in 1994. In 2013, in recognition of the many new professions represented by the union (including architects, pharmacists, translators and interpreters), APESMA changed its name to Professionals Australia.

It rises in the upper Himalayas in the Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh state, India, and flows through the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir into the plains of Punjab, Pakistan, before flowing into the Indus River near the city of Uch Sharif. The waters of the Chenab were allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty. The river is formed by the confluence of two rivers, Chandra and Bhaga, at Tandi, 8 km southwest of Keylong, in the Lahaul and Spiti district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The Bhaga river originates from Surya taal lake, which is situated a few kilometers west of the Bara-lacha la pass in Himachal Pradesh. The Chandra river originates from glaciers east of the same pass (near Chandra Taal). This pass also acts as a water-divide between these two rivers. The Chandra river transverses before the confluence. The Bhaga river transverses through narrow gorges a distance of before the confluence at Tandi.  Name  The Chenab river was called ' () in the Rigveda (VIII.20.25, X.75.5). The name meant that it was seen to have dark-coloured waters. The term Krishana is also found in the Atharvaveda. A later form of Askikni was ' () and the Greek form was - Akesínes; Latinized to Acesines. In the Mahabharata, the common name of the river was Chandrabhaga () because the river is formed from the confluence of the Chandra and the Bhaga rivers. This name was also known to the Ancient Greeks, who Hellenised it in various forms such as Sandrophagos, Sandabaga and Cantabra. The simplification of Chandrabhaga to 'Chenab', with evident Persianate influence, probably occurred in early medieval times and is witnessed in Alberuni.  History  The river was known to Indians in the Vedic periodEncyclopædia Britannica article on the Chenab In 325 BC, Alexander the Great allegedly founded the town of Alexandria on the Indus (present day Uch Sharif or Mithankot or Chacharan in Pakistan) at the confluence of the Indus and the combined stream of Punjab rivers (currently known as the Panjnad River).Alexandria (Uch) Dams The river has rich power generation potential in India.

The national syndicalists The national syndicalists, also called the \\"Blue Shirts\\" (camisas azuis), following the tradition of uniformed right-wing paramilitary groups, was an organisation advocating syndicalism and unionism, inspired by Benito Mussolini's brand of Italian fascism. As Rolão Preto wrote in July 1922, \\"our organic syndicalism is essentially the basis of current syndicalist thought among Mussolini’s friends\\".Preto, R., ‘Crónica social’, Nação Portuguesa, 2ª série, Nº 1, July 1922, p. 34. MNS was also built on previous allegiances to Integralismo Lusitano, but it was not inspired by the Action Française as alleged by their adversaries.José Hipólito Raposo, Dois Nacionalismos - L'Action française e o Integralismo Lusitano, Lisboa, Férin, 1929. He advocated especially the personalism of Emmanuel Mounier and some of the aspects of unionism. His unionist platform was based on leftist ideas of social justice, such as \\"a minimum family wage\\", \\"paid holidays\\", \\"working class education\\", and a world in which workers are \\"guaranteed the right to happiness\\". Early life Cutting short his lyceum studies, Rolão Preto left for Galicia in Spain, where he joined the monarchist army officer, Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro, in his 1911-1912 failed attempts to topple the Portuguese First Republic. He then left for Belgium and worked for the integralist magazine, Alma Portuguesa, while completing secondary studies at the Liceu português in Louvain and then attending the Université Catholique there. Rolão Preto had to flee Belgium when World War I began, and he took refuge in France; he finished his studies at the University of Toulouse, where he earned a degree in law before returning to Portugal. He replaced the jailed Hipólito Raposo as editor of the journal, A Monarquia. A member of the Junta Central de Integralismo Lusitano from 1922 onward, he began a close collaboration with the President of Portugal, Gomes da Costa, even before the 28th May 1926 coup d'état which established the Ditadura Nacional, and edited the 12 points the coup leaders published in Braga. Against Salazar's regime In 1930, he approached David Neto and other sidonista (conservatives, initially members of the Partido Republicano Nacionalista), with whom he created the Liga Nacional 28 de maio, self-proclaimed defender of the \\"national revolution\\". Rolão Preto gained notoriety as an advocate of national syndicalism and as editor of the Diário Académico Nacionalista da Tarde, first published in 1932, which soon changed its name to the Diário Nacional- Sindicalista da Tarde. He founded the Blue Shirts, which used the Order of Christ Cross, displayed the Roman salute, and became very popular in universities and among the youngest officers of the Portuguese Army. The Preto personality cult grew in 1933 as the movement took to the streets and Preto engaged himself in a national propaganda tour. Preto became a regular presence at Italian Embassy receptions. The movement’s newspapers began to call Preto the Chief (Chefe), and internal party correspondence reveals that he was revered by his followers. Delegation from the Italian National Fascist Party and German Nazi Party became regularly attended at the rallies of Preto´s movement. In the summer of 1933, the Civil Governors were instructed to prohibit public National Syndicalist demonstrations but Preto's followers managed to organize demonstrations, hiring a tugboat to greet the Italian Fascist leader Italo Balbo when he visited Lisbon. Preto also started to organize militias(Shock Brigades). According to Police reports the Lisbon Brigade, known as the Black Brigade (Brigada Negra), composed of about 60 men, became quite active on the streets. After a long meeting with the chief of the political police, Salazar decided to dissolve the National Syndicalist Movement. On 4 July 1934 Preto was briefly detained and later exiled as part of purge of the leadership of the National Syndicalist Movement. Salazar denounced the National Syndicalists as \\"inspired by certain foreign models\\" and their \\"exaltation of youth, and the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organizing masses behind a single leader\\" as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the New State. The British Embassy informed London with some satisfaction stating that the Portuguese National Syndicalist Movement took \\"its inspiration from the Italian Embassy\\" and described Preto as a \\"vain man with a strong sense of intrigue\\". Preto ended up opposing the Salazar's regime for being too moderate and due to Salazar's refusal to turn the emerging corporative state into a truly fascist regime. Preto resided, for a while, in Valencia de Alcántara, near the border with Castelo de Vide, and then in Madrid, as a guest in the house of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, with whom he collaborated in formulating a program for the Falange. Preto returned to Portugal in February 1935, and was once more detained after instigating a September rebellion with the crew of the Bartolomeu Dias and the garrison in the Lisbon-area Penha de França. Again exiled, he fought in the Spanish Civil War on Francisco Franco's side. Preto returned, once more, to Portugal in the eve of the Second World War and published new editions of his work on Italian Fascism originally written in 1922. Preto placed high hopes on the Berlin-Rome axis, and in his introduction to Fascism (O Fascismo), he attacked the Salazar regime and exalted Italian and German Fascism. With the rise of Nazism in Germany and Fascism in Italy, Rolao Preto was optimistic about the future of European fascism, he pinned all of his hopes on an Axis victory, and confronted those who were not \\"real fascists\\" but wished to adopt aspects of fascism. After World War II, Rolão Preto abandoned fascism and joined the left-wing forum Movement of Democratic Unity, and he published a volume entitled A Traição Burguesa (\\"The Bourgeois Betrayal\\"). The book criticised fascist regimes for becoming victims of social and political compromises with the bourgeoisie. In 1945 he thought that \\"neither the glorious clarions of nationalist mysticism nor the powerful social projections of Nazi efforts can make us forget what Nazism represented — the deception of the revolutionary hopes that gave birth to National Socialism\\". In 1949 participated in General Norton de Matos’s 1949 presidential election campaign. He also backed more liberal candidates for the Presidency, such as Quintão Meireles, Francisco Higino Craveiro Lopes, and, ultimately, had a particularly important role (campaign press manager) in the 1958 campaign of another New State dissident, General Humberto Delgado. Later years After the fall of the Estado Novo regime Preto attempted to unite the monarchist movement behind Gonçalo Ribeiro Telles's Movimento Popular Monárquico. Preto was one of the leaders of the Movimento (People's Monarchist Party) in the period between the Carnation Revolution (1974) and his death (1977). In 1994, the Portuguese President Mário Soares granted him, posthumously, the Great Cross of the Order of Prince Henry the Navigator..

The shield above the figures is the coat-of-arms of Empúries. Location of the County of Empúries within the Principality of Catalonia The County of Empúries (, ), also known as the County of Ampurias (),Both derive from the Latin comitatus Emporiarum. was a medieval county centred on the town of Empúries and enclosing the Catalan region of Peralada. It corresponds to the historic comarca of Empordà. After the Franks conquered the regions in 785, Empúries and Peralada came under the authority of the County of Girona. Around 813, Empúries, with Peralada, became a separate county under Ermenguer. He and the other early counts were probably of Visigothic origin. In 817, Empúries was merged with the County of Roussillon, a union which lasted until 989. One of the ninth-century counts of Empúries assembled a fleet powerful enough to conquer the Balearic Islands, but only for a brief time.Lewis and Runyan (1985), 62. From 835 to 844, Sunyer I ruled Empúries and Peralada while Alaric I ruled Roussillon and Vallespir. At the death of Gausfred I in 989, Roussillon and Empúries were separated. Gausfred's elder son Hugh I received Empúries while Giselbert I received Roussillon. Hugh's comital dynasty lasted until 1322, when Empúries passed to a collateral branch of his family. The last count, Hugh VI, sold the county to Peter IV of Ribagorza in 1325 in exchange for the barony of Pego and the towns of Xaló and Laguar, all located within the Kingdom of Valencia. Peter later traded it with Ramon Berenguer d'Aragona for the county of Prades in 1341. From that point on, Empúries was an apanage of the Crown of Aragon. In a letter of December 1002, Pope Sylvester II confirmed the county of Empúries and the \\"county of Pedralbes\\" as a part of the diocese of Girona. The latter is probably to be identified with the Peralada region in the north of Empúries. A portion of the \\"taxes of the port\\", consisting of dues and anchorage, were passed on to the diocese.Letter 260 in Lattin (1961), 356–58.

Marton is within the boundaries of Middlesbrough unitary authority, which is included in North Yorkshire for ceremonial purposes. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, the parish of Marton originally extended down to the River Tees, but with the expansion of Middlesbrough, the parish became progressively smaller. Attractions include Stewart Park, a large public park given to the people of Middlesbrough by councillor Dormund Stewart, in 1928. James Cook The explorer, cartographer and navigator, Captain James Cook was born to James and Grace Cook, in a clay-built cottage in the village of Marton in 1728, and he lived for a short time in the village, until the family moved to Great Ayton.The Captain Cook Encyclopædia, p. 144. John Robson. Random House Australia. . A contemporary drawing of the village by George Cuit has revealed the cottage to have significantly deteriorated by as early as circa 1788, a precursor to it being levelled by new local landowner, Bartholomew Rudd, in the 1790s. It was very close to where the original manor house Marton Lodge eventually stood, to which Rudd made many alterations. Namesakes The tiny community of Marton, Queensland, Australia, upstream from Cooktown on the banks of the Endeavour River, was named after James Cook's birthplace in remembrance of his 7-week stay in the region in 1770. There is also a town in New Zealand named Marton (renamed thus in 1869 in honour of Cook's birthplace). The name of the Yorkshire village derives from a mixture of Old English and Old Norse (marr-tūn) which means Marsh farm/settlement. Stewart Park In 1853, the ruin and the land that is now the park were bought by the Middlesbrough ironmaster H. W. F. Bolckow. He built a new hall, which, after serving for a short period of time as a museum, was destroyed during demolition by fire in 1960, after standing empty for several years. The site is now home to the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum, opened in 1978. In addition to viewing the large collection of Cook-related objects at the museum, visitors can view a grade II listed granite urn erected by Bolckow in 1858 on the site of the demolished Cook cottage. St Cuthbert's Church St Cuthbert's There is no record of the foundation of St Cuthbert's Church, but there is evidence that it dates from the 12th century, in the Norman period. At that time the overlords of Marton were the de Brus family, ancestors of Robert the Bruce of Scotland. They had founded Gisborough Priory in 1119, and succeeding generations of the family bestowed gifts of land and property on this and other religious houses in the area. The church at Marton was one of those gifts to Guisborough, given before 1187. In 1540 when the priory was dissolved by King Henry VIII, all the property belonging to the priory reverted to the Crown. In 1545 the living of Marton was granted to the Diocese of York, where it remains to this day. In 1843 and 1847 a major refurbishment took place, mainly financed by J.B. Rudd of Tollesby Hall, the local squire. A later pen portrait in the Parish magazine tells us that the Church was \\"restored, widened, and lengthened so that it became, from a little whitewashed, flat ceilinged, sash-windowed, dilapidated edifice with only two aisles and one transept, into the present beautiful building\\".History of St. Cuthbert's Church Captain James Cook was baptised at St Cuthbert's Church. The church is now ornamented with a stained-glass window commemorating Cook. The graves of Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan, the founding fathers of Bolckow Vaughan — the company which brought the steel industry to Middlesbrough – are in the churchyard. The graves, like the company, had been largely forgotten in the 20th century, but were refurbished in 2009. Notable people Other notable persons who lived in the parish of Marton include Bolckow's business partner John Vaughan, who lived at Gunnergate Hall until his death in 1868; Sir Raylton Dixon, a Middlesbrough shipbuilder; Henry Cochrane, an ironmaster; Agnes Spencer, the wife of the founder of Marks and Spencer. Marton is also the base for a junior football club, Marton F.C., which was founded in 1982 and for which Jonathan Woodgate, David Wheater and Stewart Downing, subsequent Middlesbrough F.C. professional footballers, once played. Education Marton has three primary schools: Lingfield Primary School, Captain Cook Primary School and Marton Manor Primary School. There are no secondary schools in Marton. Most pupils go to nearby Nunthorpe School, the King's Academy, in Coulby Newham or Trinity Catholic College. Amenities and transport Marton Shops, a parade of local supermarkets, eateries, banks, pharmacy and various other outlets is located on the A172 (Stokesley Road). Marton Library & Community Hub is located on Laurel Road, just behind the shops. Public houses include the Southern Cross and the Rudds Arms (both on the A172); the former is located adjacent to the A172 / Stainton Way crossroads and the latter close to the A172 / A174 interchange. The Marton Hotel and Country Club (closed October 2017) was located almost directly opposite to the Rudds Arms before being severely damaged and subsequently demolished in a large blaze in June 2019. Marton is served by bus routes provided by Arriva North East and Abbott's of Leeming, that mostly connect to other places through Middlesbrough town centre. Marton railway station (on the Esk Valley Line), is located just off the B1380 (Ladgate Lane), close to the entrance to Ormesby Hall. Although Gypsy Lane railway station is in Nunthorpe, it is closer to most Marton residents than Marton railway station. Northern operate all services on the Esk Valley Line and improvements to the timetable in 2014 meant up to 17 trains (each way) calling at both Marton and Gypsy Lane railway stations through the week, with a full hourly service being introduced in 2017 including on Sundays.

In the early 1900s, many wealthy families, including the Mayor of Syracuse, lived in large homes along West Onondaga Street. A beautiful fountain with statues was located at Onondaga Circle, the junction of West Onondaga Street and Delaware Street. Streets like Delaware Street were lined with large elm trees and stately homes. History Industrial Along the western border of the neighborhood, a multitude of factories employed local residents. These included Franklin Automobile Company, which produced luxury air-cooled cars from 1904 to 1934, and Lipe- Rollway Company, a manufacturer of gears. The main hub of industry started at South Geddes Street, not far from where George Fowler High School and City Hardware of Calley's United Appliance stand today. At the turn of the 19th century, typewriter factories, machinery factories and a large railroad yard along West Fayette Street provided jobs to the residents of the neighborhood. Recent years Today, the Near Westside is home to Syracuse's growing Latino community, with high numbers of Puerto Rican and Cuban families. St Lucy's Catholic Church continues to serve the area and its growing Latino population, offering services for immigrants and refugees at the West Side Learning Center,We welcomed 70 new American citizens Thursday - Metro Voices on syracuse.com as well as hosting events such as Latino town hall meetings at the St Lucy's Auditorium.Syracuse.com Latino Town Hall Meeting The area is described as one of America's poorest neighborhoods by United Way of Central New York,United Way of CNY with high levels of child poverty.Howie Hawkins Poverty in Syracuse Fowler High School, located on the western end of the neighborhood, has a high percentage of students eligible for free and reduced lunch, among other topics of concern within the community. The area is served by many non-profit organizations. Several organizations based in this neighborhood provide services for the Latino community, such as the Spanish Action League and Syracuse Area Latinos United against Disparities (SALUD) Inc. A number of economic and residential development projects have also taken place in the neighborhood's SALT District, led by the Near Westside Initiative, a not-for-profit organization that leverages the resources of Syracuse University. Branding itself as a distinct \\"neighborhood within a neighborhood\\", the SALT DistrictSALT District has adopted a colorful logo and brand identity of \\"Syracuse. Arts. Literacy. Technology.\\" The acronym SALT is a reference to the salt production industry that led to Syracuse's nickname, \\"the Salt City\\". The Gifford Foundation, Syracuse University's School of Architecture, Syracuse Center of Excellence, and Home HeadQuarters have also played key roles in the initiative. To the far south of the neighborhood is Syracuse's newly-branded City-Gate Historic Neighborhood (2017). The West Onondaga Street Alliance (WOSA), with the support of Eric Mower & Associates (EMA) and Cowley Advertising, have taken the initiative to reinvent and improve the neighborhood. The lack of interest in this historic neighborhood for several decades, and the increasing high concentration of poverty, have left the West Onondaga Street Corridor as nothing more than a conduit to reach other nearby neighborhoods. In 2015, the WOSA began to organize to change the direction of the corridor. Today, the City-Gate Historic Neighborhood is a beautiful, historic, and diverse neighborhood. Many business and development opportunities are available. In 2015, the Everything Oz Museum, a 501c3 non- profit located in Chittenango, New York, purchased the Neal-Baum Mansion for the purpose of opening the nation's largest International Wizard of Oz Museum. L. Frank Baum, author of The Wizard of Oz, married his wife in this house. Baum was born in Chittenango, New York, a nearby suburb of Syracuse.

The company is the world's second largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork after JBS S.A. and annually exports the largest percentage of beef out of the United States. Together with its subsidiaries, it operates major food brands, including Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, Wright Brand, Aidells, and State Fair. Tyson Foods ranked No. 79 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Tyson Foods has been involved in a number of controversies related to the environment and animal welfare. During the COVID-19 pandemic Tyson Foods did not implement recommended best practices to protect its workforce, including social distancing measures, plexiglass barriers and wearing of face masks. Profile The company was established by John W. Tyson in 1935, and benefited during World War II when chicken was not included in foods that were rationed. As of 2014, the company employs 115,000 people, who work at more than 300 facilities, over 100 of which are in the US. Tyson had about 97,000 employees in 27 states; locations are concentrated in the Midwest, with 16 locations in Arkansas, 11 in Texas, 9 in Iowa, and the remainder of the mostly eastern US with less than 3–4 locations. Tyson also works with 6,729 independent contract chicken growers. Tyson is one of the largest U.S. marketers of chicken, beef and pork to retail grocers, broad line foodservice distributors and national fast food and full-service restaurant chains; fresh beef and pork; frozen and fully cooked chicken, beef and pork products; case- ready beef and pork; supermarket deli chicken products; meat toppings for the pizza industry and retail frozen pizza; club store chicken, beef and pork; ground beef and flour tortillas. It supplies Yum! Brands chains that use chicken, including KFC and Taco Bell, as well as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Wal-Mart, Kroger, IGA, Beef O'Brady's, small restaurant businesses, and prisons. The company makes a wide variety of animal-based and prepared products at its 123 food processing plants. It produces many different products, including Buffalo wings, boneless Buffalo wings, chicken nuggets, and tenders. Every week, its 54 chicken plants, 13 beef plants, and six pork plants slaughter and package 42.5 million chickens, 170,938 cattle, and 347,891 pigs. Their largest meat packing facility is their beef production plant in Dakota City, Nebraska. Other plants include feed mills, hatcheries, farms and tanneries. Acquisitions and investments The Tyson logo, used as a corporate logo from 1978 to 2017. It has been used, with minor changes, since 1972. It continues to be used as a logo on Tyson brand products. In 2001, Tyson Foods acquired IBP, Inc., the largest beef packer and number two pork processor in the United States., for US$3.2 billion in cash and stock. Along with its purchase of IBP, it also acquired the naming rights to an event center in Sioux City, Iowa. Tyson has also acquired such companies as Hudson Foods Company, Garrett poultry, Washington Creamery, Franz Foods, Prospect Farms, Krispy Kitchens, Ocoma Foods, Cassady Broiler, Vantress Pedigree, Wilson Foods, Honeybear Foods, Mexican Original, Valmac Industries, Heritage Valley, Lane Poultry, Cobb-Vantress, Holly Farms, Wright Brand Foods, Inc. and Don Julio Foods. On May 29, 2014, the company announced a $6.13 billion cash offer to acquire all the shares in Hillshire Brands, two days after a $6.4 billion cash and shares bid for Hillshire by Pilgrim's Corp. In June 2014, Tyson won the bidding war against Pilgrim's Pride, agreeing to buy the maker of Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs for $8.5 billion. On July 28, 2014, the company said it would sell its Mexican and Brazilian poultry businesses to JBS S.A. for $575 million and use the proceeds to pay down debt from its pending $7.7 billion purchase of Hillshire Brands Co. In May 2018, Tyson announced the acquisition of American Proteins, Inc. and AMPRO Products, Inc. for approximately $850 million. In early 2018, Tyson, through its venture capital arm Tyson Ventures, invested in Beyond Meat, Memphis Meats, and Future Meat Technologies, companies developing plant-based meat substitutes and cultured clean meat, respectively. Former CEO Tom Hayes said that \\"it might seem counterintuitive\\", but the investments are part of an effort to meet future consumer demand in a sustainable way. On June 1, 2018, Tyson announced that it would sell the Sara Lee, Van's, Chef Pierre and Bistro Collection brands to Kohlberg & Company. The sale was completed on August 1, forming Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, which will be based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. On August 9, 2018, Tyson announced that it would sell its pizza crust business, including TNT Crust, to Austin-based Peak Rock Capital, who completed the acquisition on September 4. On August 20, 2018, Tyson announced its intent to acquire food supplier Keystone Foods from Marfrig. Tyson announced it had completed the acquisition on November 30, 2018. On February 7, 2019, Tyson Foods reached an agreement to acquire the European and Thai businesses of Brazilian food company BRF. The acquisition was completed on June 3, 2019. On January 10, 2020, Tyson Foods announced that it sold its Golden Island jerky business to Jack Link's. Tyson Renewable Energy Tyson's processing plants generate a vast supply of animal fats. In late 2006, the company created a business unit called Tyson Renewable Energy to examine ways of commercializing the use of this leftover material by converting it into biofuels. The unit is also examining the potential use of poultry litter to generate energy and other products. On April 16, 2007, Tyson announced a joint venture with ConocoPhillips to produce roughly 175 million gallons of biodiesel a year—enough to run Tyson Foods' truck fleet for 3.5 years. Corporate charity Since 2000, Tyson Foods has donated millions of dollars in cash to help non-profit organizations across the country. Forbes named Tyson Foods the second most proportionally generous company for its donations in 2007 totaling 1.6 percent ($8 million) of its annual operating income. Tyson initiated the KNOW Hunger campaign in early 2011 to raise awareness of hunger in the United States. After the Joplin tornado of 2011, Tyson sent 77,000 pounds of food to the city. It also sent 100,000 pounds of food to the communities along the Gulf of Mexico after the April 20, 2010, oil spill. Tyson has supported \\"Little Free Pantries,\\" and has partnered with the Chicago Urban League for educational programs on misconceptions about SNAP (food stamp) benefits. Tyson Foods has made political donations to both major parties. Tyson \\"pledged to invest $50 million by 2020 in various efforts to fight food insecurity\\" in 2015. The company exceeded that goal, with contributions of over $60 million to start the year 2020. Religious activities In addition to placing 128 part-time chaplains (including both Protestant and Catholic Christians and Muslim Imams) in 78 Tyson plants, in 2006 the company invited their customers to download a prayer book, containing prayers from many faiths, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and American Indian spirituality, from the company's website to read during mealtime. Cultured meat and over-population Tyson Foods Inc., the world's second largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, was the first major food company to fund cultured meat research in Israel, Netherlands and the United States. With overpopulation as the major motivating forces behind Tyson's decision to pursue artificial meat. Corporate governance Board of Directors *John H. Tyson *Kevin M. McNamara *Les R.

Controversies World headquarters of Tyson Foods at 2200 Don Tyson Pkwy, Springdale, Arkansas Environmental record Tyson Foods has been responsible for numerous instances of environmental damage. Tyson is the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the global food industry. According to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Tyson is among the largest single sources of greenhouse gases in the world when the whole process of rearing animals for slaughter (such as producing feed for the animals and using agriculture chemicals) is considered. Tyson has been involved in several lawsuits related to air and water pollution. In June 2003, the company admitted to illegally dumping untreated wastewater from its poultry processing plant near Sedalia, Missouri, pleading guilty to 20 felony violations of the federal Clean Water Act. As part of the plea agreement, the company agreed to pay $7.5 million in fines, hire an outside consultant to perform an environmental audit, and institute an \\"enhanced environmental management system\\" at the Sedalia plant. At the same time, Tyson also settled a case filed by the Missouri attorney general's office related to the same illegal dumping. The United States Environmental Protection Agency began the investigation into the discharges in 1997, and federal officials served two criminal search warrants at the plant in 1999. According to EPA and U.S. Department of Justice officials, Tyson continued to illegally dump wastewater after the search warrants were executed, prompting an EPA senior trial attorney to remark that: \\"Having done this work for nearly 20 years, I don't recall any case where violations continued after the execution of two search warrants. That's stunning.\\" Under the federal and state plea agreements, Tyson agreed to pay $5.5 million to the federal government, $1 million to the Pettis County School Fund and $1 million to the Missouri Natural Resources Protection Fund to help remedy the damage. \\"Tyson pleads guilty in pollution case, will pay $7.5 million in fines\\". Corporate Ethics and Government, June 25, 2003. Retrieved on June 4, 2007. In 2002, three residents of Western Kentucky, together with the Sierra Club, filed a lawsuit concerning the discharge of dangerous quantities of ammonia from Tyson's Western Kentucky factories. Tyson settled the suit in January 2005, agreeing to spend $500,000 to mitigate and monitor the ammonia levels.\\"Tyson Settles Air Pollution Suit for $500,000\\". The New York Times, January 28, 2005. Retrieved on June 4, 2007. In 2004, Tyson was one of six poultry companies to pay a $7.3 million settlement fee to the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma, to settle charges that the use of chicken waste as fertilizer had created phosphorus pollution in Tulsa's main drinking water sources. In 2005, settled a $500,000 lawsuit related to air pollution in Kentucky. In 2013, Tyson paid nearly $4 million in fines due to eight separate incidents between 2006 and 2010 where it accidentally released anhydrous ammonia, an extremely hazardous substance which causes chemical-type burns. These releases killed at least one worker and injured nearly a dozen other. In 2019, the Environmental Integrity Project identified Tyson as being a major discharger of pollution to waterways in East Texas. The high volumes of blood, urine, feces and feathers discharged into East Texas rivers and lakes contributing to oxygen levels in the water. The Environmental Integrity Project found that the Tyson plant in East Texas violated its Clean Water Act permit a dozen times over 2016–2017. In 2019, a Tyson plant in Alabama polluted rivers with E.coli and killed fishlife. Employment of undocumented immigrants In 2001, Tyson was charged with conspiracy to smuggle and hire undocumented workers to work on its production lines. Tyson plant managers arranged for delivery of undocumented workers with undercover immigration officials. Prosecutors alleged that the conspiracy to import workers dates back to 1994 when plant managers began to find it difficult to fill positions with \\"cheap legal help\\". Of the six managers who were indicted, two accepted plea bargain deals, and one committed suicide one month after being charged. In March 2003, a federal jury acquitted Tyson of having knowingly hired illegal immigrants. In May 2006, Tyson suspended operations at nine plants during a nationwide day of immigration demonstrations citing expected lack of workers. In October 2006, a federal judge granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by Tyson employees who allege that Tyson's practice of hiring illegal immigrants depresses wages 10–30%. The suit further contends that the company violated federal racketeering laws by conspiring with National Council of La Raza and League of United Latin American Countries not to question the employment applications of anyone with a Hispanic surname. Price manipulation In 2016, Maplevale sued Tyson and others for alleged price fixing. In January 2018 Winn-Dixie Stores and its sister grocery, Bi-Lo Holdings, also sued Tyson and others; weeks later, Sysco and US Foods separately sued Tyson and others. Tyson and 16 other companies were accused of working together to restrict the supply of chickens and to manipulate chicken prices; these activities allegedly started in 2008. Expressing the magnitude of the Mapleville allegations, NBC News stated an American family of four spends an average of $1100 per year on chicken, and if industry-wide price fixing allegations are true, \\"about $330 of that should still be in your wallet each year\\". In June 2020, it was announced that Tyson was cooperating with US Department of Justice in relation to price-fixing in the poultry industry. Tyson was cooperating under a leniency program whereby it would avoid criminal prosecution by providing aid to DOJ investigators. Just prior to the announcement, four poultry industry executives were indicted for price- fixing. Undisclosed use of antibiotics In 2007, Tyson began labeling and advertising its chicken products as \\"Raised without Antibiotics.\\" After being advised by the USDA that Tyson's use of protozoa-killing ionophores in unhatched eggs constituted antibiotic use, Tyson and the USDA compromised on rewording Tyson's slogan as \\"raised without antibiotics that impact antibiotic resistance in humans.\\" Tyson competitors Perdue Farms and Sanderson Farms sued claiming that Tyson's claim violated truth-in-advertising/labeling standards. In May 2008, a federal judge ordered Tyson to stop using the label. Ionophores are used to control cocidiosis, a parasite common in all birds and the medication is not used in human medicine. In June 2008, USDA inspectors discovered that Tyson had also been using gentamicin, an antibiotic, in eggs. According to USDA Undersecretary for Food Safety Richard Raymond, Tyson hid the use of this antibiotic from federal inspectors, with Tyson not denying the claim and stating that the use of this chemical is standard industry practice. Tyson agreed to voluntarily remove its \\"raised without antibiotics\\" label in future packaging and advertising. Workers' rights An Oxfam report issued in 2016 cited anonymous employees who stated they were routinely denied bathroom breaks, leading them to wear adult diapers to work. According to Celeste Monforton, professor of occupational health at George Washington University, on average, more than one Tyson Foods employee is injured and amputates a finger or limb per month. In 2017, Tyson Foods announced that they would provide regularly scheduled bathroom breaks for employees, provide workers with training on workers' rights, and establish safety councils that involved workers. Tyson made the announcement in conjunction with Oxfam. Animal abuse Tyson Foods has been embroiled in numerous scandals related to animal abuse and cruelty. In response to undercover revelations of animal abuse, Tyson has responded by arguing that the undercover animal rights activists were at fault for the abuse by not actively preventing it. In 2006, Tyson completed a study to determine whether CAK, which uses gas to render chickens unconscious before slaughter, could be a more humane practice than conventional electrical stunning. According to Bill Lovette, Tyson's senior group vice president of poultry and prepared foods, the study found no difference between the humaneness of the two methods. The company plans to ask scientists at the University of Arkansas to initiate a similar study to test these initial results. The research will be led by the newly created Chair in Food Animal Wellbeing at the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences of the University of Arkansas. Tyson has committed $1.5 million to help establish the Chair, which will be involved in overseeing research and classes focused on the humane management and treatment of food animals. In 2014, after an NBC News reported on abuse of piglets at a Tyson pig farm in Oklahoma, Tyson announced new animal care guidelines, such as keeping sows in larger cages, installing video cameras in cages, use pain mitigation strategies in the castration of piglets, and avoiding killing piglets through blunt force. Animal rights activities called on Tyson to make the guidelines a \\"mandate\\" rather than a \\"recommendation.\\" In 2015, Tyson Foods severed ties with a supplier after Mercy For Animals published videos showing that employees at a Tyson supplier were stabbing, clubbing and stomping on chicken. A 2016 undercover investigation by the animal rights organization Compassion Over Killing showed workers at four separate Tyson processing plants throwing, punching and kicking chickens as well as sticking plastic rods through their beaks. They also wrung birds' necks, ran over them with forklifts and left injured birds in heaping piles to die.'You can't let nobody see': Tyson workers caught on video mistreating chickens. Washington Post. August 11, 2016. A 2017 investigation showed more abuse and cruelty towards chicken. After the 2017 investigation, Tyson responded by saying it would install cameras at its sites and hire off-site auditors. Animal rights activists said the measure did not go far enough. In 2017, Matthew Prescott of the Humane Society of the United States criticized Tyson for failing to implement many of the animal welfare standards that other food suppliers were adopting.  Food recalls  On January 30, 2019, Tyson Foods announced a recall for over 36,000 pounds of chicken nuggets that were at risk of being contaminated with small pieces of rubber. The recall followed allegations by consumers who submitted complaints to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Tyson identified the contaminated nuggets as those received by Arizona, California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Utah club store distribution centers. On March 21, 2019, the company issued a recall for 69,000 pounds of chicken strips potentially contaminated with pieces of metal, following six complaints submitted to the Food Safety and Inspection Service, including three alleged oral injuries. An expanded recall for nearly 12 million pounds of chicken strips was issued on May 4, 2019. On June 7, 2019, Tyson Foods announced a recall for over 190,000 pounds of chicken fritters which potentially contained hard plastic, calling the action \\"voluntary\\" and \\"out of caution\\" following reports from three consumers. The products were not sold in retail stores but supplied to various food service locations, including schools. Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic In April, 2020, a Tyson pork processing plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa closed down after 148 workers tested positive for coronavirus, and two workers died. Officials including the sheriff in Black Hawk County, Iowa were critical of Tyson Foods on April 17, after an outbreak began at a company plant in Waterloo, Iowa. Tyson finally closed the Waterloo plant on April 22. About 180 workers had tested positive for coronavirus out of a workforce of 2,800. According to an Associated Press report, the company said the shutdown \\"would deny a vital market to hog farmers and further disrupt the nation's meat supply\\". On April 20, it was reported that 90 workers had tested positive at a Tyson beef and pork packing plant in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. The plant employs 1,600 workers. On April 17, Tyson announced that four poultry workers died who were associated with a Tyson chicken processing plant in Camilla, Georgia. Three worked inside the plant and another worked outside. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents 2,000 workers at the plant, said that the three plant workers who died were women who had worked for Tyson for 13 to 35 years, and that many plant workers are \\"sick or in quarantine.\\" Steve Stouffer, president of the fresh meats division at Tyson Foods, expressed some resistance to universal testing of their workers. \\"Everybody wants to test meatpacking employees, but nobody is testing the communities around them to show what’s the baseline,\\" Stouffer said, adding \\"And until we know the baselines, my question has always been: Are we the cause or are we just the victim of our surroundings?\\" At least eight workers at a Tyson plant in Madison, Nebraska had tested positive for coronavirus by April 20, according to local public health officials. Workers have also tested positive at other Tyson plants in Lexington, Nebraska and Dakota City, Nebraska. On April 21, Tyson announced the closure of a plant in Center, Texas, which is located in Shelby County, Texas, a rural county with a rate of coronavirus infections about four times higher than the state average. A local physician reported that over half of the county's cases were associated with the Tyson facility. On April 22, Tyson announced the closure of a pork processing plant in Logansport, Indiana that employed more than 2,200 workers after 146 workers tested positive. The president of the Indiana Farm Bureau said that the organization is \\"extremely concerned about the closure of the Tyson pork processing facility. This is a devastating blow to the pork producers who sell hogs to Tyson.\\" By May 1, the count of workers who have tested positive for coronavirus at the Logansport plant stood at 890. On April 23, Tyson announced that a beef processing plant in Wallula, Washington was closing. The plant employed 1,400 workers. Local public health officials announced that over 90 workers had tested positive for coronavirus, and one had died. Tyson executive Steve Stouffer said, \\"Unfortunately, the closure will mean reduced food supplies and presents problems to farmers who have no place to take their livestock. It’s a complicated situation across the supply chain. On April 27, public health officials in Dakota County, Nebraska, which has a population of about 20,000 people, announced that 608 residents had tested positive for coronavirus, a rate about 40 times higher than the Omaha area. The county's biggest employer by far is the Tyson beef packing plant in Dakota City, Nebraska, which employs about 4,300 people. One worker at that plant has died of Covid-19, and local officials believe that the outbreak is centered in the Tyson plant. Eight workers at a Tyson chicken processing plant in Portland, Maine have tested positive for coronavirus, and on April 28, state health officials called for all 400 workers to be tested for the virus. Tyson agreed, and said that it is considering closing the plant. On May 5, local health officials announced that 730 out of 1,250 workers at Tyson's plant in Perry, Iowa had tested positive for coronavirus. The local newspaper called the 58% positive infection rate \\"jaw-dropping\\". On April 26, John Tyson, chairman of the board, wrote in the New York Times that \\"The food supply chain is breaking...There will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed.\\" In June 2020, ProPublica reported that more than 24,000 coronavirus cases were tied to meatpacking plants, with 87 deaths among meatpacking plant workers. Of those 87, more than 25 worked for Tyson. Well after outbreaks had occurred, Tyson did not implement recommended safety measures to protect its workers, such as social distancing, plexiglass barriers and wearing of face masks. On June 21, the government of China announced that it was suspending imports of chicken from a Tyson factory. The company confirmed that the affected facility was its Berry Street plant in Springdale, Arkansas. Earlier in June, 227 workers tested positive for the coronavirus at that plant. Tyson announced that 481 workers had tested positive at its various facilities in northwest Arkansas. That represented 13% of its 3,748 workers in that region. In July 2020, Tyson Foods said it would hire 200 nurses and administrative personnel, and begin administering coronavirus tests at all of its U.S. production facilities, as part of the company's response to the pandemic. In August 2020, at least 10,261 Tyson workers were confirmed to have COVID-19 (out of a workforce of 120,000). See also * Broiler industry * Chicken patty * Cultured meat * Food industry * Food, Inc.

They were discovered in brain extracts in the 1870s and were named after the mythological sphinx because of their enigmatic nature. These compounds play important roles in signal transduction and cell recognition. Sphingolipidoses, or disorders of sphingolipid metabolism, have particular impact on neural tissue. A sphingolipid with an R group consisting of a hydrogen atom only is a ceramide. Other common R groups include phosphocholine, yielding a sphingomyelin, and various sugar monomers or dimers, yielding cerebrosides and globosides, respectively. Cerebrosides and globosides are collectively known as glycosphingolipids. Structure The long-chain bases, sometimes simply known as sphingoid bases, are the first non-transient products of de novo sphingolipid synthesis in both yeast and mammals. These compounds, specifically known as phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (also known as sphinganine,Product page at Sigma Aldrich although this term is less common), are mainly C18 compounds, with somewhat lower levels of C20 bases. Ceramides and glycosphingolipids are N-acyl derivatives of these compounds.A brief, very comprehensible review is given in Gunstone, F. (1996) Fatty Acid and Lipid Chemistry, pp 43-44. Blackie Academic and Professional. The sphingosine backbone is O-linked to a (usually) charged head group such as ethanolamine, serine, or choline. The backbone is also amide-linked to an acyl group, such as a fatty acid. Types Simple sphingolipids, which include the sphingoid bases and ceramides, make up the early products of the sphingolipid synthetic pathways. * Sphingoid bases are the fundamental building blocks of all sphingolipids. The main mammalian sphingoid bases are dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine, while dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine are the principal sphingoid bases in yeast. Sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, and phytosphingosine may be phosphorylated. * Ceramides, as a general class, are N-acylated sphingoid bases lacking additional head groups. **Dihydroceramide is produced by N-acylation of dihydrosphingosine. Dihydroceramide is found in both yeast and mammalian systems. **Ceramide is produced in mammalian systems by desaturation of dihydroceramide by dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1). This highly bioactive molecule may also be phosphorylated to form ceramide-1-phosphate. **Phytoceramide is produced in yeast by hydroxylation of dihydroceramide at C-4. Complex sphingolipids may be formed by addition of head groups to ceramide or phytoceramide: * Sphingomyelins have a phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine molecule with an ester linkage to the 1-hydroxy group of a ceramide. * Glycosphingolipids are ceramides with one or more sugar residues joined in a β-glycosidic linkage at the 1-hydroxyl position (see image). ** Cerebrosides have a single glucose or galactose at the 1-hydroxy position. *** Sulfatides are sulfated cerebrosides. ** Gangliosides have at least three sugars, one of which must be sialic acid. * Inositol-containing ceramides, which are derived from phytoceramide, are produced in yeast. These include inositol phosphorylceramide, mannose inositol phosphorylceramide, and mannose diinositol phosphorylceramide.  Mammalian sphingolipid metabolism  De novo sphingolipid synthesis begins with formation of 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine by serine palmitoyltransferase. The preferred substrates for this reaction are palmitoyl-CoA and serine. However, studies have demonstrated that serine palmitoyltransferase has some activity toward other species of fatty acyl-CoA and alternative amino acids, and the diversity of sphingoid bases has recently been reviewed. Next, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine is reduced to form dihydrosphingosine. Dihydrosphingosine is acylated by one of six (dihydro)-ceramide synthase, CerS - originally termed LASS - to form dihydroceramide. The six CerS enzymes have different specificity for acyl-CoA substrates, resulting in the generation of dihydroceramides with differing chain lengths (ranging from C14-C26). Dihydroceramides are then desaturated to form ceramide. Metabolic pathways of various forms of sphingolipids. Sphingolipidoses are labeled at corresponding stages that are deficient. De novo generated ceramide is the central hub of the sphingolipid network and subsequently has several fates. It may be phosphorylated by ceramide kinase to form ceramide-1-phosphate. Alternatively, it may be glycosylated by glucosylceramide synthase or galactosylceramide synthase. Additionally, it can be converted to sphingomyelin by the addition of a phosphorylcholine headgroup by sphingomyelin synthase. Diacylglycerol is generated by this process. Finally, ceramide may be broken down by a ceramidase to form sphingosine. Sphingosine may be phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate. This may be dephosphorylated to reform sphingosine. Breakdown pathways allow the reversion of these metabolites to ceramide. The complex glycosphingolipids are hydrolyzed to glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide. These lipids are then hydrolyzed by beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases to regenerate ceramide. Similarly, sphingomyelin may be broken down by sphingomyelinase to form ceramide. The only route by which sphingolipids are converted to non- sphingolipids is through sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. This forms ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal.  Functions of mammalian sphingolipids  Sphingolipids are commonly believed to protect the cell surface against harmful environmental factors by forming a mechanically stable and chemically resistant outer leaflet of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer. Certain complex glycosphingolipids were found to be involved in specific functions, such as cell recognition and signaling. Cell recognition depends mainly on the physical properties of the sphingolipids, whereas signaling involves specific interactions of the glycan structures of glycosphingolipids with similar lipids present on neighboring cells or with proteins. Recently, simple sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate, have been shown to be important mediators in the signaling cascades involved in apoptosis, proliferation, stress responses, necrosis, inflammation, autophagy, senescence, and differentiation. Ceramide-based lipids self- aggregate in cell membranes and form separate phases less fluid than the bulk phospholipids. These sphingolipid-based microdomains, or \\"lipid rafts\\" were originally proposed to sort membrane proteins along the cellular pathways of membrane transport. At present, most research focuses on the organizing function during signal transduction. Sphingolipids are synthesized in a pathway that begins in the ER and is completed in the Golgi apparatus, but these lipids are enriched in the plasma membrane and in endosomes, where they perform many of their functions. Transport occurs via vesicles and monomeric transport in the cytosol. Sphingolipids are virtually absent from mitochondria and the ER, but constitute a 20-35 molar fraction of plasma membrane lipids. In experimental animals, feeding sphingolipids inhibits colon carcinogenesis, reduces LDL cholesterol and elevates HDL cholesterol.  Other sphingolipids  Sphingolipids are universal in eukaryotes but are rare in bacteria and archaea. Bacteria that do produce sphingolipids are found in family Sphingomonadaceae, the FCB group (some members), and some parts of Deltaproteobacteria.  Yeast sphingolipids  Because of the incredible complexity of mammalian systems, yeast are often used as a model organism for working out new pathways. These single-celled organisms are often more genetically tractable than mammalian cells, and strain libraries are available to supply strains harboring almost any non-lethal open reading frame single deletion. The two most commonly used yeasts are Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, although research is also done in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. In addition to the important structural functions of complex sphingolipids (inositol phosphorylceramide and its mannosylated derivatives), the sphingoid bases phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine) play vital signaling roles in S. cerevisiae. These effects include regulation of endocytosis, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (and, thus, regulation of nutrient uptake ), cytoskeletal dynamics, the cell cycle, translation, posttranslational protein modification, and the heat stress response. Additionally, modulation of sphingolipid metabolism by phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate signaling via Slm1p and Slm2p and calcineurin has recently been described. Additionally, a substrate-level interaction has been shown between complex sphingolipid synthesis and cycling of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate by the phosphatidylinositol kinase Stt4p and the lipid phosphatase Sac1p. Plant sphingolipids Higher plants contain a wider variety of sphingolipids than animals and fungi. Disorders There are several disorders of sphingolipid metabolism, known as sphingolipidoses. The main members of this group are Niemann-Pick disease, Fabry disease, Krabbe disease, Gaucher disease, Tay–Sachs disease and Metachromatic leukodystrophy. They are generally inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, but notably Fabry disease is X-linked. Taken together, sphingolipidoses have an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000, but substantially more in certain populations such as Ashkenazi Jews. Enzyme replacement therapy is available to treat mainly Fabry disease and Gaucher disease, and people with these types of sphingolipidoses may live well into adulthood. The other types are generally fatal by age 1 to 5 years for infantile forms, but progression may be mild for juvenile- or adult-onset forms. Sphingolipids have also been implicated with the frataxin protein (Fxn), the deficiency of which is associated with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). Loss of Fxn in the nervous system in mice also activates an iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway, indicating that the mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, sphingolipid levels and PDK1 activity are also increased in hearts of FRDA patients, suggesting that a similar pathway is affected in FRDA. Other research has demonstrated that iron accumulation in the nervous systems of flies enhances the synthesis of sphingolipids, which in turn activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) to trigger neurodegeneration of adult photoreceptors.

This is Coupland's most critically acclaimed novel. It was first published by Random House of Canada in 2003. The novel comprises four first-person narratives, each from the perspective of a character directly or indirectly affected by the shooting. The novel intertwines substantial themes, including adolescent love, sex, religion, prayer and grief. Plot synopsis The novel follows the stories of victims of a fictional school shooting in North Vancouver in 1988. Coupland has expressed his concern that the killers of the Columbine High School massacre received more focus than the victims; this is his story about the victims of tragedy.Didcock, Barry. \\"Prophet & Loss\\". \\"The Sunday Herald\\", September 14, 2003. The novel is told in four parts, each with a different narrator and focus. 1988: Cheryl Cheryl Anway, the seventeen year old victim of a shooting massacre at her high school at Delbrook Senior Secondary recounts her life from a liminal state where she is dead but can still hear the prayers and curses of those who are alive. Cheryl was pregnant having recently consummated her relationship with her long term boyfriend after they impulsively went to Las Vegas to be married using fake I.D.s as they are still under the age of consent. Both Cheryl and her boyfriend Jason are members of Youth Alive! a group of young Christians. During the shooting, Cheryl is trapped under a table at the centre of the cafeteria. While the killers are making their way through the crowd, one of them decides that he has had enough with the killing, and wants to stop. The other killers decide that he has become weak, and kill him. They then turn their attention to Cheryl and her friends, and Cheryl becomes the final casualty. Before Cheryl is murdered she witnesses Jason killing one of the gunman with a rock, distracting the other for long enough that the other students are able to subdue and murder the final gunman. 1999: Jason Eleven years after the massacre Jason struggles to cope with life. He pens a letter to his twin nephews, born after his older brother, Kent, dies in a car accident. Jason details his current life circumstances working as a carpenter with no true friends and frequently drinking and occasionally blacking out. He reveals that he killed one of the shooters at Delbrook his father was angry with him for being a murderer causing his alcoholic mother to finally leave his abusive and controlling father, Reg, for good. In part because of his father's reaction Jason spends the two weeks after the shooting being investigated by the police and is devastated when his Youth Alive! friends and Cheryl's family turn against him. He is eventually cleared and his mother takes him to New Brunswick to recuperate. During one of his present day drinking binges Jason blacks out and comes to in an isolated location aware that he is about to be murdered by Yorgos, a friend of his boss. Jason defends himself and is able to escape from Yorgos but rather than kill him, Jason leaves him injured and even sends help to him. At the end of his letter Jason reveals to his nephews that after Kent died his widow Barb asked Jason to impregnate her so that she could pass the child off as Kent's. Jason agreed under the condition that Barb marry him causing he and Barb to go to Las Vegas mimicking the conditions under which he married Cheryl. During their trip to Vegas they are spotted by an acquaintance who Barb later murders to protect her secret. Nine months later the twins are born. 2002: Heather A court reporter named Heather is in distress after her boyfriend, Jason goes missing. Jason and Heather's relationship began in a Toys \\"R\\" Us, with Jason purchasing toys for his nephews and the two bantering over a small toy giraffe and making a world for him. After some time Heather receives a call from a woman named Allison claiming to be a fake psychic who has had a real vision. Allison uses catchphrases and words from the secret toy world that Heather and Jason built together causing Heather to believe that Jason is trying to contact her. Despite claiming to not want money Allison begins to extort money from Heather to pass on her messages. After a conversation with Reg, Heather decides to try to track down Allison and learns she is a woman named Cecilia. She sees Cecilia with a young woman she assumes is her daughter and believes that Jason and the young woman had been having an affair. When Heather confronts the woman she reveals she is Cecilia's daughter but her mother came to know of the language because Jason came to her with detailed notes wanting to pass along the information if he ever went missing. Heather is left wondering about Jason's past, unaware that his decision was prompted by a chance meeting with Yorgos. 2003: Reg Reg writes an open letter to his son, lamenting that he was a harsh and abusive father under the guise of being a Christian for most of Jason's childhood. Reg repents of the way he treated both Jason and Kent and regrets that he destroyed his relationship with a woman named Ruth because he would not divorce Jason's mother. He reveals that though Jason is still missing the RCMP located a shirt of his in the woods and Reg plans to post copies of his letter to trees hoping that somehow Jason will be able to read it. Characters ; Cheryl : Cheryl is the first narrator of the story. She is a young grade 12 student, who is a victim of the infamous Delbrook Secondary School massacre. Cheryl grew up in a non-religious environment but becomes religious, through her pursuit of Jason. Her family follows an agnostic mentality, and dislike Cheryl's newfound faith. Cheryl is the last fatality, before Jason storms in, and kills Mitchell with a blunt round object. Cheryl narrates between her former life, and oblivion. Jason and Cheryl wed in Las Vegas, using fake IDs purchased by Jason. She informs Jason that she is pregnant with his child, just a few hours before the massacre occurs. ; Jason : A quiet and rebellious child from a very religious family. Jason is the narrator of the second section of the novel. His father, Reg, is self-righteous, zealous, and unapologetic, and seems to favour his older brother Kent. ; Reg : Reg is the narrator of the fourth part of the novel. Born to a strict father, Reg turned to belief as his salvation. Creating a very strict religious code for himself, Reg married and became the father to two children, Kent and Jason. Kent was his father's child, following in his father's religious footsteps. Throughout the novel, Reg undergoes a transformation from narrow fundamentalist to a more open and loving human being. ; Jason's mother : Jason's mother married Reg when she thought she had found someone who believed in something. After Reg outcasts Jason, Jason's mother leaves Reg, and takes Jason across Canada. She eventually succumbs to Alcohol-Induced Dementia. ; Kent : Jason's older brother. He is a leader in the Youth Alive! movement, and looms over his brother as his father's chosen son. Kent is married to Barb, and has two twin sons with her. He dies in the beginning of the second part from a car accident. ; Barb : Kent's wife, but she is the mother of Jason's twin sons, therefore Kent's nephews. She and Kent tried to have kids but it didn't work. Since she was desperate to have kids, and Kent dies, she forces Jason to have kids with her. Since, she wanted her kids to look like they're Kent's and her child, so she has sex with Jason so that there are chances of her child looking like Kent. After a fallout with Reg, she remains close to Jason until his disappearance. She is a different person from Kent in many ways, and is very different after the death of Kent. ; Heather : Jason's romantic partner in the latter half of the novel, Heather is the narrator of the third part of the novel. She is a woman who feels distant and is brought back into the world, just as she brings out Jason from his emotional seclusion. She creates characters and stories with Jason, which are later provided back to her by a psychic, who Heather believes will bring her back to the missing Jason. Inspiration Coupland began to write the novel in December 2001, after a \\"nightmarish 40-city tour that began on 10 September\\".Anthony, Andrew. \\"Close to the Edge\\". The Observer, August 24, 2003. This tour took him across the United States and allowed him to experience the \\"collective sorrow\\" of the United States. Coupland began to research the Columbine events after this experience. The quotation from Corinthians that opens the novel was found on a gravestone of one of the children who died in a high school shooting. History of the novel An international best-selling novel, the novel was received well by critics. The novel was released the same week as Gus Van Sant's film Elephant, which also dealt with a Columbine-like situation. Coupland also had an art installation on the same topic, called \\"Tropical Birds\\", which featured 3D versions of the kneeling figure from the front cover of Hey Nostradamus!, and other pieces which features scenes from a school shooting tragedy.Gill, Alexandra. \\"Art goes Underground\\".

The name derived from the approximate length of time from the point at which a Soviet nuclear missile attack against the United Kingdom could be confirmed and the impact of those missiles on their targets. The population was to be notified by means of air raid sirens, television and radio, and urged to seek cover immediately. In practice, the warning would have been more likely three minutes or less.  The warning system   Basic details  The warning would be initiated by the detection of inbound missiles and aircraft targeted at the United Kingdom. Early in the Cold War, Jodrell Bank was used to detect and track incoming missiles, while continuing to be used for astronomical research.Jodrell Bank article Throughout the Cold War, there was a conflict between the Royal Air Force and the Home Office about who was in charge of the warning system. This was not for any practical or technical reason, but more to do with who would be blamed if a false alarm were given or if an attack occurred without warning. By the 1980s, the warning was to be given on the orders of a Warning Officer from the Home Office's Warning and Monitoring Organization stationed at RAF High Wycombe.Conflicts over the political fallout explained, subbrit.org.uk From the early 1960s, initial detection of attack would be provided primarily by the RAF BMEWS station at Fylingdales in North Yorkshire. There, powerful radars would track the inbound missiles and allow confirmation of targets. In later years the first indication of any imminent attack would be expected to come from infrared detectors aboard the United States Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. BMEWS would still play an important role in tracking and confirming the destination of any launches. The British government was not the main beneficiary of BMEWS, given that it would only receive what Solly Zuckerman described in 1960 as \\"no more than 5 minutes warning time\\" of an attack. The United States was the United Kingdom's most important military and technological partner, and its US-based Strategic Air Command would have thirty minutes warning from the Fylingdales station, whilst the RAF's own V bomber force would have about ten minutes.  UKWMO and the ROC  WB1401 warning receiver It was the responsibility of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO) at the United Kingdom Regional Air Operations Centre (UK RAOC) located at Headquarters Bomber Command, renamed Strike Command Operations Centre in 1968, at High Wycombe to alert the nation to an imminent air attack. Once an alert was initiated the national and local television and radio networks would break into transmissions and broadcast a warning (the warning message would originate from an emergency studio in BBC Broadcasting House in London). Simultaneously the national air raid siren system would be brought into service. A system, which used the same frequency on normal telephone lines as the peacetime speaking clock, was employed for this whereby a key switch activation alerted 250 national Carrier Control Points or CCPs present in police stations across the country. In turn the CCPs would, via a signal carried along ordinary phone lines, cause 7,000 powered sirens to start up. In rural areas, around 11,000 hand powered sirens would be operated by postmasters, rural police officers, or Royal Observer Corps personnel (even parish priests, publicans, magistrates, subpostmasters or private citizens could be involved in some remote rural areas). Linked into the system were the twenty-five Royal Observer Corps (ROC) group controls, also with direct links to the carrier control points. In the event of subsequent radioactive fallout, local fallout warnings could be generated from the group controls on a very localised basis over the same carrier wave system. The national warning system saw many changes over the years. During the 1960s and 1970s, much of the local authority civil defence planning in the United Kingdom became outdated, although the WB400/WB600 warning system was maintained and kept serviceable along with updating of ROC instrumentation and communications. The system's main problem was that many of the telephone lines it needed had to be manually switched in times of pre-war tension by Post Office telephone engineers. The links were not hardened against the effects of EMP. In the late 1970s and early 1980s heightened fears and tensions led to a resumption of contingency planning and the upgrading of many systems. The outdated WB400/WB600 systems were replaced with brand new WB1400 equipment, communications links were made permanent and hardened against EMP disruption.  Sirens  The national siren system originating from World War II had a secondary role of \\"general warning\\", particularly for imminent flooding. Following the end of the Cold War, a telephone-based system was thought to be more appropriate for national warnings and less expensive to maintain. Additionally the Government retains an ability to break into television and radio broadcasts for the purpose of alerting the general public and has legal power to take over editorial control of the BBC during a national emergency under the BBC Charter and the Broadcasting Act 1980. The national siren system was largely dismantled during the 1990s. The British Government cited the increasing use of double-glazed windows (which make sirens harder to hear) and the reduced likelihood of air attack as reasons to eliminate the system in most parts of the country. Some coastal and river areas have retained and regularly test the sirens as part of the flood warning defences. Since 1952, Broadmoor Hospital has employed a network of 14 sirens to warn of escaped patients; this is tested every Monday at 10 am. The hospital sirens are scheduled for removal during 2018 except for one located in the hospital grounds. Carstairs Hospital also retains its sirens, which are tested monthly. In some towns sirens were once used to summon part-time firemen until the introduction of radio pagers during the 1970s – these 'stand alone' sirens operated independently of the warning network. Torness nuclear power station In East Lothian Scotland uses a couple of these sirens as a warning of an off site nuclear emergency, this is tested every Tuesday morning at 10:00hrs  Sample script  The following is a script that would have been broadcast in the event of an attack, available from the BBC. It was recorded by Peter Donaldson, chief continuity announcer for BBC Radio 4:  Cultural impact  The Cold War and the fear of nuclear attack permeated pop culture up until the 1990s. Examples include the song \\"Four Minute Warning\\" by the British punk band Chaos UK (EP \\"Burning Britain\\", 1982), the poem \\"Your Attention Please\\" by Peter Porter, a solo song by Take That singer, Mark Owen, and \\"Four Minutes\\" by Roger Waters (of Pink Floyd fame) on his 1987 solo album Radio K.A.O.S.. John Paul Jones has a song entitled \\"4-Minute Warning\\" on the 1988 Brian Eno album Music for Films III. The first single of the UK rap crew Gunshot, from 1990, was entitled \\"Battle Creek Brawl (4 Minute Warning)\\". A Radiohead track from the 2007 Bonus Disc album In Rainbows Disk 2 is titled \\"4 Minute Warning\\". The four-minute warning was a central plot and narrative device in dramas (both on stage and screen) and novels, often being the motor force of plays, films, novels and cartoon strips. The BBC drama Threads, about how society decays after a nuclear holocaust, focuses on an attack on Sheffield. The War Game also portrays the four-minute warning, pointing out the warning period could be even less. The narrator, Michael Aspel, says it could even be two minutes between issuing the warning and impact on a target. The film adaptation of Raymond Briggs's satirical and blackly comic cartoon strip, When the Wind Blows, has the warning message as part of the script, which triggers arguing between Jim and Hilda Bloggs. Although this is not Peter Donaldson's pre-recorded warning (which was not available on grounds of national security and for copyright reasons), this was a fictional announcement written on grounds of artistic licence. It was read by Robin Houston, a voiceover artist who was known in London as a newsreader for Thames Television (who played the role of newsreader in the film). The adult humour comic Viz ran a photo strip in its issue 107 called \\"Four Minutes to Fall in Love\\", where a boyfriend and girlfriend cram a whole relationship into the four minutes before a nuclear attack. The four-minute warning had become the inspiration for many jokes and sketches in comedy programmes in Britain, in the same way that the Emergency Broadcast System had in the United States (see nuclear weapons in popular culture). In one episode of Only Fools and Horses, \\"The Russians Are Coming,\\" Delboy and Rodney Trotter sell fallout shelter kits and have an attack drill. Driving towards their shelter, they are stopped by the police for speeding and asked: \\"You just heard the four-minute warning?\\" After being sent on their way, Rodney points out: \\"We died forty-five seconds ago.\\" Around the same time, a sketch on the BBC Scotland programme Naked Video had a mock announcement warning of an attack with a punchline of \\"...except for viewers in Scotland.\\"  See also  *Protect and Survive *Civil Defence Information Bulletin, a precursor to Protect and Survive *Emergency Broadcast System *Emergency Alert System *CONELRAD *HANDEL *Wartime Broadcasting Service, a broadcasting service run by the BBC that would operate after a nuclear attack or if conventional bombing had destroyed conventional broadcasting systems. *Transition to war  References   External links  *UKWMO Communications chain – message dissemination *Nuclear secrets of 1975 revealed, (Link), BBC News, 29 December 2005. *Peter Donaldson's 1970s recorded warning message (Real Audio). *The details around Peter Donaldson's warning message *The script that would have been broadcast in the event of war *BBC post-attack broadcasting plans in 1955 *Carrier Control Point equipment located at major police stations *The 4 Minute Warning App gives critical updates when a nuclear weapon is launched as well as giving updates on US Defcon, UK Security status and the Doomsday clock.

Outrigger boats are various watercraft featuring one or more lateral support floats known as outriggers, which are fastened to one or both sides of the main hull. They can range from small dugout canoes to large plank-built vessels. Outrigger boats can also vary in their configuration, from the ancestral double-hull configuration (catamarans), to single-outrigger vessels prevalent in the Pacific Islands and Madagascar, to the double-outrigger vessels (trimarans) prevalent in Island Southeast Asia. They are traditionally fitted with Austronesian sails, like the crab claw sails and tanja sails, but in modern times are often fitted with petrol engines. Unlike a single-hulled vessel, an outrigger or double-hull vessel generates stability as a result of the distance between its hulls rather than due to the shape of each individual hull. As such, the hulls of outrigger or double-hull boats are typically longer, narrower and more hydrodynamically efficient than those of single-hull vessels. Compared to other types of canoes, smaller outrigger canoes can be quite fast, yet are also capable of being paddled and sailed in rougher water. This paddling technique, however, differs greatly from kayaking or rowing. The paddle, or blade, used by the paddler is single sided, with either a straight or a double-bend shaft. These vessels were the first true ocean-going ships, and are an important part of the Austronesian heritage. They were the vessels that enabled the Austronesian Expansion from Taiwan into the islands of both the Indian and Pacific Ocean from around 3000 BC. They comprise the bulk of traditional boats in Island Southeast Asia, Island Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar. They have spread to other cultures Austronesians came into contact with, notably in Sri Lanka and southern India as well as in the coast of East Africa. In modern times, outrigger vessels are used in the sport of sailing. Catamaran and trimaran configurations are also widely used for high speed craft. History Map showing the migration and expansion of the Austronesians Outrigger boats were originally developed by the Austronesian-speaking peoples of the islands of Southeast Asia for sea travel. It is believed that the use of outriggers may have been initially caused by the need for stability on small watercraft after the invention of crab claw sails some time around 1500 BCE. Outrigger boats were essential in the transportation of Austronesians both eastward to Polynesia and New Zealand and westward across the Indian Ocean as far as Madagascar during the Austronesian migration period. The Austronesian peoples (Malagasy, Maritime Southeast Asian, Micronesian, Melanesian, Native Taiwanese, and Polynesian peoples) continue to be the primary users of the outrigger boats. Austronesian boat (Mahdi, 1999) The simplest form of all ancestral Austronesian boats had five parts. The bottom part consists of single piece of hollowed-out log. At the sides were two planks, and two horseshoe-shaped wood pieces formed the prow and stern. These were \\"sewn\\" together with dowels and lashings. They had no central rudders but were instead steered using an oar on one side. The ancestral rig was the mastless triangular crab claw sail which had two booms that could be tilted to the wind. These were built in the double-canoe configuration or had a single outrigger on the windward side. In Island Southeast Asia, these developed into double outriggers on each side that provided greater stability. The triangular crab claw sails also later developed into square or rectangular tanja sails, which like crab claw sails, had booms spanning the upper and lower edges. Fixed masts also developed later in both Southeast Asia (usually as bipod or tripod masts) and Oceania. Early researchers like Heine-Geldern (1932) and Hornell (1943) once believed that catamarans evolved from outrigger boats, but modern authors specializing in Austronesian cultures like Doran (1981) and Mahdi (1988) now believe it to be the opposite. Two canoes bound together developed directly from minimal raft technologies of two logs tied together. Over time, the double-hulled canoe form developed into the asymmetric double canoe, where one hull is smaller than the other. Eventually the smaller hull became the prototype outrigger, giving way to the single outrigger canoe, which diverged into the reversible single outrigger canoe in Oceania. Finally, the single outrigger types developed into the double outrigger canoe (or trimarans). 17th-century depiction of a Visayan karakoa, a very large double-outrigger warship This would also explain why older Austronesian populations in Island Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and the Comoros tend to favor double outrigger boats, as it keeps the boats stable when tacking. But they still have small regions where catamarans and single-outrigger boats are still used. In contrast, more distant outlying descendant populations in Micronesia and Polynesia retained the double-hull and the single outrigger boat types, for the technology of double outriggers never reached them (exeptions being western Melanesia). To deal with the problem of the instability of the boat when the outrigger faces leeward when tacking, they instead developed the shunting technique in sailing, in conjunction with reversible single-outriggers. When Magellan's ships first encountered the Chamorros of the Mariana Islands in 1521, Antonio Pigafetta recorded that the Chamorros' sailboats far surpassed Magellan's in speed and maneuverability. Similarly, the Spanish priest Francisco Combés, describing the large karakoa outrigger warships of the Visayan Islands in the Philippines, remarked: The traditional pōpao of Tonga Painting by John LaFarge showing Samoan girls carrying a va'a (1891) lakana from Madagascar Outrigger fishing canoes are also used among certain non-Austronesian groups, such as the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka, where they are known as oruwa, as well as among some groups in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt, Land of a Thousand Atolls: A Study of Marine Life in the Maldive and Nicobar Islands, World Publishing Co., Cleveland and New York, 1964. They can also be found in East Africa (e.g., the ungalawa of Tanzania). The acquisition of the catamaran and outrigger boat technology by the non-Austronesian peoples in Sri Lanka and southern India is the result of very early Austronesian contact with the region, including the Maldives and Laccadive Islands. This is estimated to have occurred around 1000 to 600 BCE and onwards. This may have possibly included limited colonization that have since been assimilated. This is still evident in Sri Lankan and South Indian languages. For example, Tamil paṭavu, Telugu paḍava, and Kannada paḍahu, all meaning \\"ship\\", are all derived from Proto‑Hesperonesian *padaw, \\"sailboat\\", with Austronesian cognates like Javanese perahu, Kadazan padau, Maranao padaw, Cebuano paráw, Samoan folau, Hawaiian halau, and Maori wharau. The technology has persisted into the modern age. Outrigger boats can be quite large fishing or transport vessels. In the Philippines, outrigger boats (called bangka or paraw) are often fitted with petrol engines. The links between seafaring and outrigger boats in the Philippines extend through to political life, in which the smallest political unit in the country is still called \\"barangay\\" after the historical balangay outrigger boats used in the original migrations of the first Austronesian peoples across the archipelago and beyond. The Polynesian Voyaging Society has two double-hull sailing catamarans, Hokulea and Hawaiiloa, and sails them between various islands in the Pacific using traditional Polynesian navigation methods without instruments. The Hikianalia and Alingano Maisu are other extant double-hulled voyaging canoes. Hawaiiloa, a double-hull (catamaran) sailing canoe built as a replica of Polynesian voyaging canoes Terminology and linguistics Visayan paraw The German linguist Otto Dempwolff (1934-1938) originally reconstructed the Proto-Austronesian word for \\"boat\\" as *waŋkaŋ, and included the reflexes for both *baŋkaʔ and *waŋkaʔ as its descendants. However modern linguists like Robert Blust generally reject this. Mahdi (2016) instead reconstructs four words for \\"boat\\" in the Austronesian languages, all ultimately derived from the monosyllabic protoforms *Cu and *baŋ. They are: :a) *qaCu - cognates include Squliq-Atayal qasuʔ, Pazeh ʔasuʔ, and Bunun hatoʔ :b) *qabaŋ - cognates include Kanakanabu abaŋɯ, Oponohu-Rukai havaŋu, Siraya avang, Gaddang ʔabaŋ, Tiruray ʔawaŋ, Iranun awaŋ, Mentawai abak, and Moken kabaŋ :c) *baŋkaʔ - cognates include Kavalan baŋka, Tagalog baŋkaʔ, Tausug baŋkaʔ, Mori and Muna baŋka, and Sumbawa baŋka :d) *waŋkaʔ' - cognates include Manggarai and Rembong waŋka, Tobati wăgě, Yabem waŋ, Suau waga, Fijian waqa, Tongan vaka, and Hawaiian waa; Tahitian and Samoan vaa Instead of being cognates, the protoforms *baŋkaʔ and *waŋkaʔ are believed to be doublets. The protoforms *qabaŋ and *baŋkaʔ are composites with a common precursor, with the *qa- and -*ka positioned differently. Only *qaCu and *qabaŋ can be traced back to Proto-Austronesian, with the rest being later developments. The outrigger float is called the ama in many Polynesian languages (compare Hawaiian ama, Maori ama, and Samoan ama, all meaning 'outrigger float'), realisations of Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *saRman 'outrigger float'. Similar terms also exist in other Malayo-Polynesian languages, such as Pohnpeian dahm, Yapese thaam, Ambonese Malay semang, all meaning 'outrigger float', as well as Chamorro sakman meaning '[a] large canoe.' The outrigger boom—spars connecting the ama to the main hull (or the two hulls in a double- hull canoe)—are called iako in Hawaiian and kiato in Māori (with similar words in other Polynesian languages), ultimately from Proto-Oceanic *kiajo or its doublet *kayajo both meaning 'outrigger boom' (compare Loinu kiec, Kiribati kiaro, and Tongan kiato, as well as Seimat ayas and Gedaged ayad, all meaning 'outrigger boom'). In Philippine languages, the outrigger floats are called katig or kate, from Proto-Philippine *katiR. Types Double-outrigger boats are more prevalent in Southeast Asia, though single-outriggers and catamarans also exist. They have two outrigger floats connected to spars lashed across a single hull. They range in size from small vessels like the jukung, vinta, and the paraw; to medium-sized trading and fishing vessels like the balangay and basnigan; to very large warships like the karakoa and kora kora. In Philippine vessels, additional booms called batangan are usually added across the outrigger spars (tadik), in between the outrigger floats (katig) and the main hull (bangka). In modern terminology, especially in leisure or sport boating, double-outrigger ships are usually termed trimaran or triple-hull ships. Catamarans and single-outrigger canoes are the traditional configurations in Polynesia, Micronesia, and Madagascar. In the Pacific Islands, a single outrigger float is called an ama. It is connected to the main hull by spars called ʻiako (Hawaiian), ʻiato (Tahitian), or kiato (Māori). The ama, which is usually rigged on the left side, provides stability. The paddlers need to be careful to avoid leaning too far on the opposite side of the ama, as that may cause the canoe to capsize (huli or lumaʻi). Double-outrigger configurations, a later innovation from Southeast Asian Austronesians, never reached Oceania. Single-outrigger dugout canoes also survived until recent times in some parts of the Philippines. Examples include a specimen in the University of Southampton from Manila Bay collected in the 1940s, as well as boats from Lake Bulusan and Lake Buhi of the Bicol Region of southern Luzon from as recently as 2015. The single outrigger is used to provide lateral stability, while still allowing fishermen to work with fishing nets. These boats were paddled and were not equipped with sails. They have largely disappeared in modern times, partly due to the scarcity of suitable timber and partly due to the relative cheapness of fiberglass boats. Modern sport A six-person outrigger canoe Outrigger canoe racing has become a popular canoeing sport, with numerous clubs located around the world. Outrigger Canoe Racing is the State sport of Hawaii and an interscholastic high school sport. In Hawaii, entire families participate in summer regattas with age groups from keiki (children as young as 6 with an adult steersperson) and age 12 through age 60+. Major races in Hawaii include the Molokai Hoe men's race from the island of Molokai to Oahu across the Kaiwi Channel, Na Wahine O Ke Kai (same race for women) and the Queen Liliuokalani Race held near Kona on the Island of Hawai. In modern sport outrigger canoeing, ships are classified according to the configuration and number of the hulls and the number of paddlers, including the OC1, OC2, OC3, OC4 and OC6 (with the respective number of paddlers using a single-hull outrigger canoe), and the DC12 or OC12 (with twelve paddlers using a double-hull outrigger canoe, two six-person canoes rigged together like a catamaran). Outriggers without a rudder are referred to as V1, V2, etc. (where V refers to vaʻa). Six-person outrigger canoes (or OC6) are among the most commonly used for sport use; single-person outrigger canoes (or OC1) are also very common. Two and four-person outrigger canoes are also sometimes used, and two six-person outrigger canoes are sometimes rigged together like a catamaran to form a twelve-person double canoe. Racing outrigger canoes. The canoe in the front right, with a narrower hull and smaller body, is a single-person outrigger canoe, or OC1. The other canoes are six-person outrigger canoes or OC6. Modern OC6 hulls and amas are commonly made from glass-reinforced plastic. However, some canoes are made of more traditional materials. In Ancient Hawaii, canoes were carved from the trunks of very old koa trees. These canoes, although rare, are still very much in use today. The iako are usually made of wood; the iako-ama and iako-hull connections are typically done with rope wrapped and tied in an interlocking fashion to reduce the risk of the connection coming completely apart if the rope breaks. Modern OC1 hulls and amas are commonly made from glass-reinforced plastic, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and/or Kevlar to produce a strong but light canoe. OC1 are often made with rudders operated by foot pedals. More traditional designs do not have rudders. OC1 commonly use iako made of aluminium or carbon fiber, with a mechanism for quickly assembling and disassembling the canoe (snap buttons, large wing nuts, etc.). Roles In an outrigger canoe, the paddlers sit in line, facing toward the bow of the canoe (i.e., forward, in the direction of travel, unlike rowing). The seats are numbered from 1 (closest to the bow) to the number of seats in the canoe, usually 6. The steerer (or steersman or steersperson) sits in the last seat of the canoe (seat 6 in the common OC6) and, as the name indicates, is primarily responsible for steering. The paddler sitting in seat 1 is called the stroke (or stroker) and is responsible for setting the pace of the paddle strokes. The stroker should have a high level of endurance to keep the rate (the number of strokes taken in a given amount of time) manageable for whatever the situation may be. The first two positions may also be involved in certain steering manoeuvers. This usually involves the draw stroke. During a tight turn, the one seat might poke to make the canoe turn the opposite way. In the middle of the canoe (seats number 3 and 4) known as the powerhouse are the strong and powerful paddlers. Any of the 2 can be the 'caller' who directs when to switch over their blades, when to pick up or slow down the stroking pace, etc. Whoever is caller must have very good leadership skills and know how to think off the top of their heads in any situation. Every position has an important role to play in the canoe. In an OC1, the single paddler must also steer the canoe. Some OC1s have rudders operated by foot pedals, while OC1s without rudders must be steered by drawing and paddling as needed for steering purposes while paddling to move the canoe forward. Steersman A good steersman is able to maintain the straight attitude of the canoe throughout the course of a race, and also keep the boat and the crew safe in rough sea conditions. They may also take advantage of water conditions to gain extra speed by surfing. The steersman uses a single bladed steering paddle which has a larger blade than a standard outrigger paddle, is built stronger, and has less or no bend in its shaft. They steer by the following methods: * Poking: holding the paddle vertically against the side of the canoe, causing drag on that side to cause the canoe to turn that direction. (left to go left and right to go right) * Drawing: paddling at a 45 to 90-degree angle to pull water under the canoe, causing the canoe to turn the opposite direction. * Posting: holding the paddle in the water out to the side with the forward edge angled opposite to the desired turn direction, usually as a prelude to drawing. * Paddling: by applying power on one side of the canoe, the steersman can influence to a small degree which way the canoe will turn. Paddling also increases the total power moving the canoe forward compared to the other steering methods. The steersman should try and paddle as much as possible so he or she doesn't slow down the canoe by contributing to the amount of weight in the canoe. A steersman also skippers the canoe and instructs all other paddlers as necessary. As an outrigger canoe is a long narrow canoe with the steersman placed at the very end, the steersman must give instructions sufficiently loudly and clearly for the entire crew to hear. From a water safety perspective the steersman should also be among the most experienced crew members, and be knowledgeable with the waterways and weather conditions, relevant maritime rules and other safety considerations such as the use of personal flotation devices, rigging of the canoe, placement of paddlers in the various seating positions, and recovery from a huli by righting the canoe and bailing out the water. The steersman should also be able to keep the ama down during rough water. Paddlers 1907 paddler from New Guinea Paddlers use single-bladed paddles, usually with single or double bent shafts. The paddling stroke is similar to that of most other racing canoe paddling strokes, involving primarily core and lat strength. Generally, each paddler paddles on the opposite side from the paddler in directly front (for example, in an OC6, paddlers in seats 1, 3, and 5 paddle on one side, while paddlers in seats 2 and 4 paddle on the other side). All paddlers switch sides simultaneously on a call from one who is the designated caller. The steerer may paddle either side or switch sides as needed for steering purposes. The steersman will also switch sides to keep the ama from popping up and capsizing the canoe. Stronger paddlers are typically placed in the middle of the canoe, while paddlers with the most endurance tend to be placed at the front, as the lead paddler sets the pace for the crew. All other paddlers synchronize their strokes to the paddler in front of them (whom they can directly see). In rough water, it is often desirable to have a paddler with steering skill in seat 5 (of an OC6), to allow for the steerer to have that paddler also take steering strokes if needed in some situations. In conditions when the boat is surfing, the stern of the canoe will be so far out of the water that seat 5 will have to keep the boat on course. A seat 5 paddler with steering skill can also assist in preventing a huli by staying on the ama side during a particularly rough stretch of water. In water rough enough to splash into the canoe, paddlers also need to pay attention to the water level in the canoe, report the situation to the steerer, and bail out the water as necessary. Paddlers also need to know how to recover from a huli under the steerer's direction. In a quick turn situation, paddlers at the front may also be instructed to une (poke steer, causes the canoe to turn the opposite direction) or kahi (post and draw steer, pulls the canoe to the side where this is done) to help bring the canoe around a turn quickly. Racing Hawaiki Nui Va'a i race in French Polynesia The length of a race ranges from short sprints (e.g., 250–500 metres for the OC1 and the OC12, 500–2000 metres (usually includes turns) for the OC6) to longer events, including marathons (e.g., 42 kilometres). A number of races are raced over distances that far exceed 42 kilometres, including the Molokaʻi Hoe that crosses the Kaiwi Channel between the islands of Molokai and Oahu in Hawaii. However, long-distance races of 20 to 30 kilometres are more common, with shorter 5 to 8 kilometre courses typically being offered to novice paddlers and those under 20 years of age. Longer races involving the OC6 often involve paddler replacements, which involve exit and entry to the canoe directly from the water while the canoe is underway (this is called a water change). Typically, nine paddlers form a crew, with six paddling the OC6 and the other three resting, drinking, and/or eating on an escort boat. Replacement typically occurs at 20 to 30 minute intervals; the escort boat drops the relief paddlers into the water ahead of the OC6, which is steered toward them. The relief paddlers climb in on the ama side as those they are replacing roll out into the water on the opposite side. The escort boat then picks up the paddlers in the water so that they can rest, drink, and/or eat before they, in turn, relieve some of the paddlers in the OC6. Outrigger canoe racing in Hudson River, New York The longer races are typically conducted in the open ocean, e.g., between islands in the South Pacific. The Molokaʻi Hoe in Hawaii, The Hamilton Cup in Australia, The Vaka Eiva in Rarotonga (Cook Islands), The Motu2Motu in Aitutaki (Cook Islands) and the Catalina Channel crossing in California are four examples of races involving water changes. Paddlers and crews are usually classified by gender and age. Gender classification is typically straightforward, with male, female, and coed classifications, with the latter being a crew with equal numbers of male and female paddlers (different rules may apply to nine-person coed crews doing a race with paddler replacements). Age classifications typically include youth divisions like 19-and-under, 16-and-under, etc., master divisions with minimum ages typically starting at 35 or 40 years of age, and an open division which allows paddlers of any age. A novice division for paddlers with less than a specified number of years of race experience (usually one or two) may also exist in a given association. In some races, a particular type of outrigger canoe, usually a more traditional design for the region, may be given its own racing classification. For example, races in Hawaii have a koa division, while southern California has a Bradley OC6 division and northern California OC1 sprint races have a traditional (no rudder) division.  Organisations  The International Va'a Federation (IVF) oversees va'a racing worldwide, including the IVF World Championships and at the Pacific Games. Outrigger racing organizations in the United States include the East Coast Outrigger Racing Association (ECORA), the Hawaiian Canoe Racing Association (HCRA), the Northern California Outrigger Canoe Association (NCOCA), the Southern California Outrigger Canoe Association (SCORA), and several more.

In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Buxton number 90 on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time., Rolling Stone. In 2011, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the original Alice Cooper group.Alice Cooper, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Early life Born in Akron, Ohio, Buxton moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and in 1964, while attending Cortez High School, made his debut in a rock band called The Earwigs. It was composed of fellow high school students Dennis Dunaway, Vincent Furnier, John Tatum and John Speer. At the onset, Buxton was the only member who could play an instrument, and thus taught some of the other members to play after the group decided to take a shot at becoming a real band. They became popular locally, and changed their name to The Spiders in 1965 and later to The Nazz in 1967. In 1966-67, guitarist John Tatum and drummer John Speer left the group, and rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Michael Bruce and drummer Neal Smith joined. In 1968, to avoid legal entanglements with the Todd Rundgren-led Nazz the group changed their name to Alice Cooper, premiering their new name at their performance at the Santa Barbara County Fairgrounds on March 20, 1968. Alice Cooper Buxton was the co-writer of hit songs like \\"School's Out\\", \\"I'm Eighteen\\", \\"Elected,\\" and \\"10 Minutes Before the Worm\\". He is credited as lead guitarist on seven albums by Alice Cooper, including the chart-topping Billion Dollar Babies. However, he was \\"not invited\\" to play on 1973's Muscle of Love and does not appear, although he is credited due to management's concerns about band image with the fans. According to drummer Neal Smith, the absence was due to \\"problems that Glen was having with the demons of rock and roll at that particular time...\\" The band sought out other guitar players to fill in, including Dick Wagner and fellow Cortez High School alum Mick Mashbir. In an interview with Marc Maron, according to Alice Cooper, \\"Glen ended up being one of the great rock guitar players of all time. He created 'School's Out'. He created all that stuff.\\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-840-alice-cooper In a separate interview, Cooper stated, \\"Glen was not a songwriter. He would write riffs, though. They would show up on the album, and even great guitar players would say, 'What is that line? It's so weird, but it's catchy.' Mike (Bruce) was much more into chord structure. So, Glen was always sort of our icing on the cake.\\" Post Alice Cooper years Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Buxton maintained a low profile, playing only occasional club gigs with bands like Shrapnel and Virgin. In the 1990s, Buxton lived in Clarion, Iowa, performing with local artists. In 1994 Buxton founded the band Buxton-Flynn with his long time friend, Michael Flynn. The band played shows throughout southern Minnesota and north Iowa. Death A few weeks before his 50th, Buxton died of complications from pneumonia at a hospital in Mason City, Iowa, on October 19, 1997, age 49. He had recently spent time visiting and playing music with two of his Alice Cooper bandmates and longtime friends, Michael Bruce and Neal Smith. With bassist Richie Scarlet (Frehley's Comet) filling in for Buxton's longtime friend and Alice Cooper bandmate Dennis Dunaway (who was unable to attend due to illness), and John Glenn on keyboards, Buxton, Smith, and Bruce performed on a morning radio show in Houston on October 10, 1997, and performed a concert at nightclub Area 51 in Houston on October 12, 1997. Buxton mentioned having some pain at the nightclub and his friends urged him to see a doctor, but Buxton replied he would wait until he got home. On October 19 his fiancée drove him to the hospital near his home in Clarion, Iowa, where he died of viral pneumonia. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Clarion, Iowa.

Biography Carson Whitsett was born in Jackson, Mississippi. He joined his older brother Tim's band, Tim Whitsett & The Imperials (later known as The Imperial Show Band) and quickly became a stand-out on the B-3 organ. Following the breakup of the band, Whitsett spent time in Canada playing with Eric Mercury before an invitation to Stax Records where Tim Whitsett was now in charge of the label's East Memphis publishing arm. Carson's playing inspired bassist Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson Jr. to reemerge, along with Stax session guitarist Bobby Manuel in place of Steve Cropper, as The MG's, releasing an album in 1973. Whitsett moved to Malaco Records, where he played in the Malaco Rhythm Section with drummer James Stroud, bassist Vernie Robbins and guitarist Jerry Puckett, appearing on Paul Simon's There Goes Rhymin' Simon album, Anita Ward's Ring My Bell, Dorothy Moore's Misty Blue, albums by Connie Francis and fellow Mississippian Paul Davis, one of the highest selling Blues albums of all time in Z. Z. Hill's Down Home Blues, and numerous albums by such legends as Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, Little Milton, and former Stax sensation Johnnie Taylor. Several Malaco acts, including Taylor and Moore, recorded songs written by Whitsett, and he produced Fern Kinney's #1 UK hit \\"Together We Are Beautiful\\" in 1980. Whitsett's first major success as a songwriter also came in 1980 with a number one song on the Adult Contemporary chart (#18 Pop, #30 Country), J. Fred Knobloch's \\"Why Not Me\\". Lorrie Morgan requested on her debut album to record Whitsett's \\"Dear Me\\", which became her first top ten hit. Another Country hit followed with John Anderson's \\"Mississippi Moon\\", co-written with Tony Joe White. With longtime collaborator and friend Dan Penn and Hoy Lindsey, Whitsett penned the title track to Solomon Burke's Grammy winning \\"comeback\\" album Don't Give Up on Me, later covered by Joe Cocker and Susan Boyle. Actor Peter Gallagher performed the song on the hit TV show The O.C.. thumb Other artists who recorded songs written or co-written by Carson Whitsett include Soul icons Etta James, Eddie Floyd, Johnny Adams, James Carr, Ruth Brown, and Wilson Pickett, as well as Country superstars Conway Twitty and Barbara Mandrell and Gospel greats Albertina Walker and The Staple Singers. He also played and wrote material for B.B. King, Jerry Butler, Suzy Bogguss, and Irma Thomas, among others. At least two Carson Whitsett collaborations are considered modern day Blues standards in Joe Louis Walker's \\"Blues of the Month Club\\" and the W.C. Handy Award winning \\"One Foot in the Blues\\" recorded by Johnny Adams. In 2002, Whitsett served as arranger for the highest selling female Pop artist of the 1950s, Patti Page, on her Sweet Sounds of Christmas CD, and in 2006, played on Janis Ian's Folk Is the New Black. He teamed again with producer Dan Penn and Hoy Lindsey, writing a dozen songs, arranging, and playing on the Better to Have It CD by Bobby Purify in 2005. He played on several Tony Joe White albums including The Heroines in 2004 with singers Lucinda Williams, Shelby Lynne, Jessi Colter, and Emmylou Harris and 2006's Uncovered, which featured guest appearances by Eric Clapton, J. J. Cale, Michael McDonald, Mark Knopfler, and also Waylon Jennings in one of his last performances. For several years he served as keyboardist for country music star Kathy Mattea and became very close with Mattea's husband, songwriter Jon Vezner. Vezner's skills inspired Whitsett to new heights as an arranger, composer, and musician. During this time, Whitsett also recorded three solo piano projects. In November 2005, he was interviewed along with fellow famed Southern soul keyboardist Spooner Oldham in Keyboard Player Magazine. Carson Whitsett died in Nashville, Tennessee, on May 8, 2007, after a sixteen-month bout with brain cancer.

He won gold medals in sabre in six Olympics.  Biography  Gerevich is the only athlete to win the same event six times (despite two Games cancelled because of the Second World War). He won gold medals in 1932 and 1960, an unprecedented 28 years apart. This record for the most years between first and last Olympic medals was tied by equestrian Mark Todd of New Zealand in 2012. Gerevich's wife, Erna Bogen (also known as Erna Bogathy), his son, Pál Gerevich, and his father-in-law, Albert Bogen (a silver medalist in team sabre for Austria at the 1912 Summer Olympics), all won Olympic medals in fencing. In the Hungarian Olympic trials for the 1960 Rome Olympics, the fencing committee told Gerevich that he was too old to compete. He silenced them by challenging the entire sabre team to individual matches and winning every match. He missed the finals of the 1960 Olympic individual sabre event, and a possible individual gold medal, by a single touch. After retiring, he coached fencing at the Vasas Sports Club in Budapest, where he died aged 81.

Takeoff was to selectively occur either with the propellers tilted vertically upwards, or on a short runway with the nacelles tilted forward at approximately 45°. Additionally, the X-22 was to provide more insight into the tactical application of vertical takeoff troop transporters such as the preceding Hiller X-18 and the X-22's successor, the Bell XV-15. Another program requirement was a true airspeed in level flight of at least 525 km/h (326 mph; 283 knots). Design and development In 1962, the United States Navy announced their request for two prototype aircraft with V/STOL capability, powered by four ducted fan nacelles. Bell Helicopters already had extensive experience with VTOL aircraft and was able to utilize an already developed test mockup. In 1964 the prototype, internally referred to by Bell as Model D2127, was ordered by the Navy and received the X-22 designation. It was unveiled at an event in Niagara Falls in May 1965. Three-bladed propellers were mounted on four wings and, synchronized through a wave-interconnection system, were connected to four gas turbines which, in turn, were mounted in pairs on the rear wings. Maneuvering was achieved by tilting the propeller blades in combination with control surfaces (elevators and ailerons), which were located in the thrust stream of the propellers. Operational history The maiden flight of the prototype occurred on 17 March 1966. In contrast to other tilt-rotor craft (such as the Bell XV-3), transitions between hovering and horizontal flight succeeded nearly immediately. However, interest increased more towards VTOL and V/STOL properties, not the specific design of the prototype. Due to failure of a propeller control, described by the test pilot, Stanley Kakol, as the only non-redundant component in the power chain, the prototype crashed on 8 August 1966 and technicians stripped it for components in order to make the second prototype flight capable. The fuselage was still used as a simulator for some time afterwards. The second X-22 first flew on 26 August 1967. Early that year, it was equipped with a variable flight control and stabilizer system from Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, which improved flight performance. Although the X-22 was considered to be the best aircraft of its type at the time, the program was canceled. The required maximum speed of 525 km/h was never reached. The second prototype was moved to Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory for further testing; the last flight occurred in 1988. Although the ducted fan propellers were considered usable, they were not used again on a US military aircraft until the F-35B. Surviving aircraft Although not on display, the only currently remaining craft, 151521, is currently stored by the Niagara Aerospace Museum, New York.\\"Bell X-22.\\" aero-web.org. Retrieved: 30 December 2010. According to the employees at the Museum, the craft was held onto after being debated for scrapping by the Navy.

In 1463, Jacob Gaón went to the province of Guipúzcoa and reclaimed a tax called pedido to the inhabitants of the villa of Tolosa. They refused, arguing they had an exemption from paying these tributes, according to fueros and laws passed by the previous kings. Gaón menaced them, and several Tolosans killed him, cut his head off and hung it up on the top of a pillory, as a punishment for having put Tolosa up on the top of his tax collection list. When King Henry IV of Castile knew his collector had been killed, he headed to Tolosa, in order to avenge his death. The king ordered the demolition of the house in which the crime had taken place, but the killers had escaped out of town. The Guipúzcoan local authorities applied to the king, explaining the Tolosans' reasons and begging pardon for them.

Commonly credited to Filippo Brunelleschi, it is considered to be one of the masterpieces of Renaissance architecture.  History  Though funds for the chapel were assembled in 1429 by Andrea Pazzi, head of the Pazzi family, whose wealth was second only to the Medici, construction did not begin until about 1442. The chapel was completed in 1443. The building is considered to be an Early Renaissance masterpiece. Formerly considered a work of Filippo Brunelleschi (d. 1446), it is now thought that he was responsible for the plan, which is based on simple geometrical forms, the square and the circle, but not for the building's execution and detailing. The most common argument for crediting Brunelleschi is the chapel's clear similarity to the Old Sacristy; others argue that his style had developed in the twenty-year interim and that the Pazzi Chapel would represent a retrograde step.Trachtenberg, p. 62 The first written mention of Brunelleschi as the architect was written by an anonymous author in the 1490s. Scholars now consider the chapel as possibly the work of Giuliano da Maiano or Michelozzo.Eugenio Battisti. Filippo Brunelleschi: The Complete Work. (New York: Rizzoli, 1981) *See also: Howard Saalman. Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings. (London: Zwemmer, 1993). A façade thought to have been begun by Brunelleschi, of which only the lower register can be seen, was partially obscured by the addition of a porch. The main inspiration for this piece was the Dominican monastery of Santa Maria Novella, also located in Florence. The main purpose of the building was the cathedral chapter house (meeting room for the governing chapter) and use as a classroom for the teaching of monks and other religious purposes. There was also a chapel behind the altar where the commissioning family had the right to bury its dead. The Pazzi's ulterior motive in building the chapel was probably to make their mark on the city of Florence and to emphasize their wealth and power. The fact that the city was at war with a neighboring city at the time and still acquired the funds to build this chapel showed the importance it had to the Pazzi family and the people of Florence. The size of the chapel was predetermined by existing walls, creating an unusual situation, however, where the space was not square as in the Old Sacristy, which was the model for this building, but rectangular and transept-like and thus in contradistinction to the square, axially placed altar. Despite this, and its complex history, the building gives us insight into the ambitions of Renaissance architects in their struggle to bring coherence to the architectural language of columns, pilasters, arches and vaults. Between the pilasters in the transept there are tall, blank, round headed panels and, above them, roundels, common Renaissance decorative motifs. The architectural elements of the interior are all in pietra serena, a high quality, fine grained sandstone. The load-bearing structure of this building is its masonry, i.e. it is the walls that support the arches and domes, not the pilasters which are decorative rather than structural. Pazzi Chapel ceiling The tondi of the seated Apostles are by Luca della Robbia, who also did the terracotta decorations in the cupola of the porch. It has been suggested that the roundels of the Evangelists may have been the work of Donatello.

The game was launched in 2003 and produced by Wizards of the Coast, a large trading card company that produces a variety of other trading card games. Neopets is aimed at a slightly younger audience than other Wizards of the Coast offerings such as Magic: The Gathering. As with many other trading card games, the cards serve two purposes, collecting and playing a game. The card game was discontinued in 2006. Gameplay overview Neopets TCG is a two-player game, where each player has a play deck of at least 40 cards and a separate deck of at least 10 Basic Neopets. Most deck- building articles suggest a limit of 2-3 species for the Basic Neopets, along with a minimum of 20 Item and/or Equipment cards (essentially half of the deck). Each card may have only 3 copies included. Players start with a single Neopet on the first turn, moving up to three by the third turn. These Neopets compete against opposing Neopets in four different arenas: Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Magic. Winning a competition during a player's own turn allows the player to bank or draw a card; banking enough cards of sufficient value eventually leads to victory. Types of cards The various Neopets cards are divided into categories that affect gameplay in different ways. The different card types are as follows: * Basic Neopet * Experienced Neopet * Item * Equipment * Hero * Villain * Something Has Happened! * Location * Fate (Curse and Quest) * Constellation Basic Neopet (Yellow) The Basic Neopet cards are the foundation of the game, and are based on the creatures from the Neopets website. The cards list four abilities or attributes, which are: strength, agility, intelligence, and magic. Each of these is given a value, with a higher number denoting a greater power or skill in a given category. Basic Neopets never have a printed score higher than 10, or lower than 1. Experienced Neopet (Grey) The Experienced Neopet is much like an evolved Pokémon in the Pokémon Trading Card Game. An Experienced Neopet has higher attributes, and often has helpful special abilities that influence various part of the game. The Experienced Neopet cards consist of both a Neopet species and an occupation, e.g. Jubjub Engineer. Only Neopets of the matching base species can transform into the Experienced Neopet role, so, for example, only a Jubjub could turn into a Jubjub Engineer, while a Mynci could not. Item & Equipment (Red and Blue) Item and Equipment cards increase a Neopet's abilities, by adding points onto the printed base number in one or more categories, and frequently have special abilities that affect gameplay. Whereas Items can only be used once before being discarded, Equipment is attached to the Neopet and remains there until it is removed by another card. The advantage to Items is that they can be sprung upon an opponent unexpectedly. Item and Equipment cards are also the only cards worth points, ranging from 0 to 8. A player must \\"bank\\" 21 points worth of Items and Equipment cards in order to win the game. Hero & Villain (White and Black) Villain cards and Hero cards both have extremely high ability numbers, and are designed to oppose one another. If a villain is played, the arena in which the villain is located is effectively sealed off until the villain is confronted and beaten, until which point the players cannot start contests against their opponent in that arena, only the villain. A Hero card can be used to fight a difficult battle (often against a villain), but can be used only once before being discarded. Something Has Happened! (Purple) Something Has Happened! cards cause a one-time, instantaneous event or effect to occur. These cards often are used to influence the outcome of a battle, and are then discarded. Because one can discover that \\"Something has Happened!\\" at virtually any time, such cards can introduce a heavy element of surprise. Location (Green) Location cards can be played in one area to affect all future battles taking place there (until they get replaced by another Location). The Location can give an advantage to a certain kind of Neopet, or can cause some side effect to any battles occurring there. Location cards are typically based upon the fantasy locations of the Neopets website. Fate (orange) Fate cards are divided into two sub-categories: Curse and Quest. Curses are usually placed on a Neopet belonging to the opponent, and have a negative or detrimental effect on that Neopet. Because Curse cards typically remain in play, they can cripple a given Neopet's ability to perform effectively. Quest cards affect all parts of the game, and are (usually) neutral. Constellation Constellation cards represent constellations in the sky which impact play in some way. For example, a given Constellation might confer an additional power to the Neopets in play, or otherwise might change the game in some fashion. Wizards of the Coast has not given any official rules regarding how constellation cards are to be played in the game, but popular rule sets online (most notably in player-created \\"guilds\\" on the Neopets website) considered them similar to Magic's enchantments and thus keep them in play when they are played. Expansions The Neopets Trading Card Game has seen a series of expansions, with each release including new cards and in many cases, new categories of cards. Only three Neopets species did not make it into the TCG, as produced by Wizards of the Coast: Gnorbu, Ogrin, and Xweetok. Checklists can be accessed if players have a Neopets user account.  Base set  The first Neopets card set was simply an introductory 234-card set, with no prevailing theme whatsoever. This set introduced the card types Basic Neopet, Experienced Neopet, Hero, Villain, Item, Equipment, and \\"Something Has Happened!\\". The Basic Neopet types that were introduced were Aishas, Korbats, Myncis, Scorchios, Shoyrus, Kacheeks, Acaras, Lupes, Wockies, Poogles, Eyries, and Grarrls. Battle For Meridell This expansion's release was coordinated with an online plot/war, which was set in the virtual feudal-themed land of Meridell. Thus, the 140 cards in this set were designed with a Middle Ages-like style. This expansion introduced ten new species of Neopets, (Basic Type: Blumaroo, Draik, Gelert, Ixi, Meerca, Quiggle, Skeith, Uni, Usul, and Zafara) in addition to the Location card type. The Return of Sloth Intending to be tied into an online plot, this set was released in 2004 & the online tie-in was delayed until early 2008 due to workload. This set totaled 100 cards. This expansion's theme was space, providing players with futuristic and robotic items and equipment. Six new Neopet species made their debut in this expansion (Basic Type: Cybunny, Grundo, Jetsam, Jubjub, and Kougra). Mystery Island Based upon a tropical island locale, this 100-card expansion provided no new card types, but did introduce four new Neopet species, including the Pteri and Techo (other Basic Type: Krawk and Peophin). The related plot was the Secret of the Volcano mystery plot in Fall 2003, but the plot and the expansion were not released together. Hannah and the Ice Caves Revolving around a central popular game character known as Hannah the Usul, a substantial plot was released on the Neopets website along with this 150-card set; it was also the first set to have \\"secret\\" cards (5 Jelly cards 151/150-Jelly Poogle, 152/150-Jelly Shoyru, 153/150-Jelly World, 154/150-Jelly Puppyblew, and 155/150-Orange Jelly). The locale for this expansion, released in October 2004, was a wintry, icy environment. A game is also based upon the plot of this expansion of the same name, and is currently online at the Neopets website. This expansion introduced the Basic Neopets known as the Bori, and the Bruce (other Basic Type: Elephante, Flotsam, Kyrii, and Moehog). One new card type was released: Fates. Curse of Maraqua This 120-card expansion revolved around the underwater city of Maraqua, which was rebuilt during the plot of the same name on the Neopets website. Four new Neopet species were released with this set, including the Yurble (other Basic Type: Chomby, Lenny, and Tuskaninny). Lost Desert This 100-card expansion took players to the shifting sands of the Lost Desert. Basic Neopets released in this expansion are the Ruki, the Kau, and the Tonu. Site-wise, there was a plot and war revolving around this expansion.  The Darkest Faerie  This 150-card expansion (with 5 secret cards) featured several cards relating to the PlayStation 2 game, including several familiar characters from previous sets. The most notable of these were the Darkest Faerie, the Dark Faerie Sisters, and the Werelupe King. This expansion also introduced another new type of card, the Constellation (Basic Type: Buzz, Koi, and Nimmo). Oddly, this expansion was absent of any Fates. Secret cards: 151- Amulet of Thilg, 152- Bewitched Ring, 153- Fyora, Tower Guardian, 154- The Hidden Tower, 155- Wand of Ultanova. Travels in Neopia This Neopets card \\"expansion\\" is actually a re-packaging of 200 cards from previous card sets. This includes favorite cards, as well as Neopets from each and every known Neopet species; 3 exceptions from the list of 54- Gnorbu, Ogrin, and Xweetok (introduced Basic Type: Hissi, Kiko, and Lutari). Only one color for each Basic species was included. The general theme of this set is about encouraging fans to re-live past plots, or, for those new to Neopets, catch up to them with some of the more well-known aspects of the series. There was barely any publicity at all related to this expansion. The Haunted Woods The newest expansion, featuring 100 cards with a spooky theme. Cards are related to ghosts, werewolves, and zombies, among others. This deck is associated with the plot, Tale of Woe; where a village has fallen under a curse, and only the Neopets can determine what happened to the townsfolk. There are no new Basic Type cards, although they did fill out the basic 4 colors for the Lenny and Tonu. Special color versions are included for Acara, Aisha, Cybunny, and Korbat. As with previous recent releases, this release appears to be been done with a minimum amount of publicity. This is the last expansion produced by Wizards of the Coast. Hubrid's Hero Heist A game was created to tie in with the TCG, and it was named Hubrid's Hero Heist. It features several Neopian heroes being captured by Hubrid Nox and the player, as the Poogle Apprentice, is tasked to save these heroes. The heroes which the player saves are, in order of saving, Magnus the Torch, Jeran, Master Vex, Illusen, Jerdana, and finally, Fyora the Faerie Queen.

The college enrolls approximately 2,500 students. Covering of hilly, wooded land, Augustana is adjacent to the Mississippi River. History Augustana College was founded as Augustana College and Theological Seminary in 1860 by the Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod. Located first in Chicago, it moved to Paxton, Illinois, in 1863 and to Rock Island, Illinois, its current home, in 1875.Conrad Bergendoff, \\"Augustana...A Profession of Faith, A History of Augustana College, 1860–1935\\" (1969) After 1890, an increasingly large Swedish American community in America promoted a new institutional structure, including a lively Swedish-language press, many new churches, several colleges, and a network of ethnic organizations. The result was to foster a sense of Swedishness with pride in the United States. Thus, there emerged a self-confident Americanized generation. Augustana College put itself in the lead of the movement to affirm Swedish American identity. Early on all the students had been born in Sweden but by 1890 the second generation of American-born students predominated. They typically had white-collar or professional backgrounds; few were the sons and daughters of farmers and laborers. These middle class youth developed an idealized view of Sweden, characterized by romanticism, patriotism, and idealism, just like their counterparts across the Atlantic. The new generation was especially proud of the Swedish contributions to American democracy and of the creation of a republic that promised liberty and destroyed the menace of slavery.Dag Blanck, The Creation of an Ethnic Identity: Being Swedish American in the Augustana Synod, 1860–1917 (2006) The college grew by donation of on the south in 1886 and purchase, enabled by donation of C.J.A. Ericson, of 10–12 acres to the north in 1899. (from sub-chapter section on \\"Augustana College and Theological Seminary\\") In 1947, when Conrad Bergendoff was college president, the Augustana Seminary formally separated from Augustana College and became an independent body. It remained on the Rock Island campus until the 1960s, when the Seminary moved to Chicago.Thomas Tredway, \\"Coming of Age: A History of Augustana College, 1935–1937\\" (2010) It merged with other Lutheran seminaries to form the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago. Academics Augustana ranks among the top 40 U.S. liberal arts colleges in the sciences, based on the number of graduates earning Ph.D.s. Students accepted to Augustana typically rank in the top 20% of their high school classes. The middle 50 percent of enrolled students for the class of 2012 scored 26–30 on the ACT, well above the national averages. Augustana College is considered highly selective. 73% of Augustana students graduate in four years and 78% graduate in six years. The services offered through CORE (Careers, Opportunities, Research and Exploration) afford students an advantage in graduate school placement and the job market. Three distinguishing opportunities are: Augie Choice: $2000 offered to every student to support hands-on learning through research, an internship or international study; The Viking Scorecard: a career and graduate school preparation guide; A wide variety of faculty-led international programs ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months and covering all 7 continents. ;Academic programs Augustana currently has nearly 90 academic programs and fields of study including nine pre-professional and eight interdisciplinary programs: ranging from Accounting to World Literature. Campus Academic buildings Old Main Old Main was constructed between 1884 and 1893. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On August 2, 2010, the New Science Building was officially named the Robert A. and Patricia K. Hanson Hall of Science after Robert Hanson, a former John Deere CEO. Hanson, who donated $8 million to the college, credits his success in life to his time spent at Augustana. The science building, dedicated in 1998, is the largest academic building serving approximately 700 students in 17 majors, minors and concentrations. The Hanson Hall of Science's facilities and resources include seven classrooms, 35 laboratories (including a cadaver lab), a 400 MHz liquid-and solid-state NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectrometer, scanning electron microscope, instrumentation for X-ray powder crystallography and a fully functioning greenhouse. Residential complexes House on the Hill Augustana has five traditional residence halls: Andreen Hall, Erickson Residence Center, Seminary Hall, Swanson Commons, and Westerlin Residence Center. All five of these residence halls are coeducational. The majority of first-year and sophomore-year students typically reside in one of these five residence halls. For upperclassmen, Augustana also offers Transitional Living Areas (TLAs), apartment-like complexes or traditional off-campus houses administered by the college's Office of Residential Life, in which Augustana students live. The school takes care of basic maintenance in these areas, some of which are House on the Hill, Naeseth, and Arbaugh Apartments. These areas usually have 2–6 students who share a bathroom, a kitchen, and other living spaces.Augustana College – Campus Fryxell Geology Museum Th Fryxell Geology Museum, named after Augustana geologist Fritiof Fryxell, features a large collection of dinosaurs and fossils, rocks and mineral specimens. Displays include a complete skeleton of a Platecarpus \\"sea serpent\\", skulls of Parasaurolophus, Ankylosaurus, Apatosaurus, Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex and a 2-billion-year-old fossil. There is also a complete skeleton of Cryolophosaurus, a large, crested carnivorous dinosaur discovered in Antarctica in 1991 by Augustana paleontologist William Hammer. The museum is located in the Swenson Hall of Geosciences and is open during the academic year. Admission is free.  Student life  Organizations Since 1950, Augustana has had a chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. The college also has non-\\"Greek\\" collegiate fraternal organizations, including Epsilon Tau Pi (ΕΤΠ)(Eagle Scouts), Alpha Phi Omega (APO) (service), Sigma Alpha Iota (SAI) (music), Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia (PMA) (music), Epsilon Sigma Alpha (ESA) (Service), Alpha Psi Omega (ΑΨΩ) (theater), and others. The Omicron chapter of Phrateres, a non- exclusive, non-profit social-service club, was installed here in 1941. Between 1924 and 1967, 23 chapters of Phrateres were installed in universities across North America. (The chapter name \\"Omicron\\" was reused for the chapter installed at San José State University.) Augustana has a local Greek system, which includes seven sororities Chi Alpha Pi (CAP), Chi Omega Gamma (COG), Delta Chi Theta (D-Chi), Phi Rho, Sigma Kappa Tau (KT), Sigma Pi Delta (Speed), and Zeta Phi Kappa (Zetas) and eight fraternities Alpha Sigma Xi (Alpha Sig), Beta Omega Sigma (BOS), Delta Omega Nu (DON), Gamma Alpha Beta (GAB), Iota Chi Epsilon (ICE), Omicron Sigma Omicron (OZO), Phi Omega Phi (Poobah), and Rho Nu Delta (Roundels).Augustana College – Greek Life Augustana has many other organizations, including a chapter of MENC: The National Association for Music Education, a National Band Association chapter, American Choral Directors Association (ACDA), Paintball Team (NCPA), American String Teachers Association (ASTA), College Democrats of America, College Republicans, Psychology Club, Business Club, DDR Club, Anime Club, Asian Student Organization (ASO), Latinx Unidos, Investment Club, Ladies of Vital Essence (L.O.V.E.), The Order of the Phoenix, Martial Arts Club, Student Government Association and Viking Pups, a club dedicated to training service dogs on campus. Athletics The Augustana Vikings compete at the NCAA Division III level in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) for almost all of their sports. The only current exception is women's bowling, in which the Vikings are charter members of the single-sport Central Intercollegiate Bowling Conference, newly launched for the 2019–20 season. The Vikings compete in a combined total of 25 male and female team sports, and five out of seven students compete in some form of varsity, club, or intramural sport. Between 1983 and 1986, the Augustana College football team won four consecutive Division III national championships under Coach Bob Reade. Coach Reade's overall winning percentage of 87% is second only to Larry Kehres and Knute Rockne on the all-time list. Augustana College was a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1912–1937. Current varsity sports include: baseball, basketball (m/w), bowling (w), cross country (m/w), football, golf (m/w), lacrosse (m/w), soccer (m/w), softball, swimming (m/w), tennis (m/w), track & field (m/w), volleyball (m/w), and wrestling.

Co. is a cotton trading company with headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1978, Julian Hohenberg sold the company to Cargill Inc and it was renamed Cargill Cotton. History Cargill Cotton’s roots in cotton merchandising trace back to 1818, when John and Eustace Ralli began trading cotton and other commodities in London. Over the next thirty years, the brothers' business interests began to focus predominantly on cotton from the East Indies. In 1851, Ralli Brothers was incorporated with offices in the United Kingdom, Calcutta, and Bombay. In 1865, another cotton trading company, Smith, Coney and Barrat, was founded and soon became very successful. By the middle of the twentieth century, the firms had grown to become two of the United Kingdom's leading cotton merchants and in 1962 the two companies agreed to merge, forming Ralli Brothers and Coney. Shortly after the formation of Smith, Coney, and Barrat, Adolphe and Morris Hohenberg formed their partnership in the United States to trade cotton and dry goods in 1879. Over the next hundred years, Hohenberg Brothers Cotton Company and Ralli Brothers and Coney grew to become two of the largest and most successful in the United States and the world. At the time Cargill acquired Hohenberg Bros. Company in 1976, Ralli Bros. and Coney and Hohenberg each had established themselves as global leaders in the industry. In 1981 Ralli Brothers and Coney was sold to Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Ralli Brothers and Coney's strengths were in the trading of cotton from the Indian sub-continent and Africa, which complemented the fields of expertise, which Cargill Inc. already possessed through their Memphis, Tennessee, USA based cotton-trading company, Hohenberg Brothers Inc. From these two small family ventures evolved one of the largest and most widely respected cotton merchandising concerns in the history of the world. Combining the strengths of these two organizations, Cargill was immediately recognized as one of the most mature, respected, and experienced companies in the world of cotton merchandising. In 2002, after over 20 years of operating under both the Hohenberg and Ralli names, the name of the entire cotton operation was changed to Cargill Cotton. Thus the combination of strengths became complete as the cotton business unit assumed the name of its 100 billion-dollar parent company.

It was well-known for its agricultural produce, which included grapes, wheat, and barley. It was also a major center of Torah scholarship and home of an important yeshiva - the Sura Academy - which, together with the yeshivas in Pumbedita and Nehardea, gave rise to the Babylonian Talmud. Location According to Sherira Gaon, Sura () was identical to the town of Mata Mehasya, which is also mentioned in the Talmud, but Mata Mehasya is cited in the Talmud many times, either as a nearby town or a suburb of Sura,* and the Talmudist academy in Mata Mehasya served as a branch of Sura Academy, which was founded by Abba Arikha in the third century. A contemporary Syriac source describes it as a town completely inhabited by Jews, situated between Māḥōzē and al-Hirah in the Sawad. A responsum of Natronai ben Hilai says that Sura was about from al-Hirah. History Roman and Sasanian rule Sura was under Roman control in the time of Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) and Ptolemy (c. 100-170 CE), but was conquered by the Sasanian emperor Shapur I in 253 CE.“Thapsacus and Zeugma the Crossing of the Euphrates in Antiquity.” Michal Gawlikowski.

Quranic chapter titles are a human fabrication and are not considered by Muslims to be part of the divine revelation of the Quran.Nevin Reda, Introduction to the Quran] in Three Testaments: Torah, Gospel and Quran (Plymouth: Rowman and Littlefield, 2012) The primary literal meaning of the expression \\"al-Fātiḥah\\" is \\"The Opener,\\" which could refer to this Surah being \\"the opener of the Book\\" (Fātiḥat al- kitāb), to its being the first chapter recited in full in every prayer cycle (rakʿah), or to the manner in which it serves as an opening for many functions in everyday Islamic life.

Fātiḥah is that which opens a subject or a book or any other thing. In other words, a sort of preface or essence of the whole book. The word الفاتحة came from the root word فتح which means to open, explain, disclose, keys of treasure etc. That means surah Al-Fatiha is the summary of the whole Quran. That is why it is generally recited with another Ayat or surah during prayers. That is, surah Al-Fatiha is paired with the rest of the whole Quran. It is also called Umm Al-Kitab (\\"the Mother of the Book\\") and Umm Al-Quran (\\"the Mother of the Quran\\"); Sab'a al Mathani (\\"Seven repeated [verses]\\", an appellation taken from verse 15:87 of the Quran); Al-Hamd (\\"praise\\"), because a hadith narrates Muhammad as having said that God says: \\"The prayer [al- Fātiḥah] is divided into two halves between Me and My servants.

Background According to Abdullah ibn Abbas and others, al-Fātiḥah is a Meccan sura; while according to others it is a Medinan sura. The former view is more widely accepted, although some believe that it was revealed in both Mekka and Medina.English Translation and Commentary 5 Volumes In the Quran, the first revelations to Muhammad were only the first few verses (ayats) of Surahs Alaq, Muzzammil, Al-Muddathir, etc. Most narrators recorded that al-Fātiḥah was the first complete Surah revealed to Muhammad. Theme and subject matter Al-Fātiḥah is often believed to be a synthesis of the Quran.Joseph E. B. Lumbard, \\"Introduction to \\"Sūrat al-Fātiḥah,\\" The Study Quran, ed. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Caner Dagli, Maria Dakake, Joseph E. B. Lumbard, and Muhammad Rustom (San Francisco: Harper One, 2015), p. 3. It in itself is a prayer at the very beginning of the Quran, which acts as a preface of the Quran and implies that the book is for a person who is a seeker of truth—a reader who is asking a deity who is the only one worthy of all praise (and is the creator, owner, sustainer of the worlds etc.) to guide him to a straight path. It can be said to \\"encapsulate all of the metaphysical and eschatological realities of which human beings must remain conscious.\\" Joseph E. B. Lumbard, \\"Introduction toSūrat al-Fātiḥah,\\" The Study Quran, ed. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Caner Dagli, Maria Dakake, Joseph Lumbard, Muhammad Rustom (San Francisco: Harper One, 2015), p. 4. Interpretations \\"Al ḥamdu lillāhi rabbi l-’ālamīn\\" All the praises and thanks are for Allah who is the Lord of the universe. \\"Hamd الْحَمْدُ\\" 'the prase' is also the root of the name of the prophet Muhammad مُحَمَّد‎ which means who is praised. \\"Ar raḥmāni r-raḥīm\\" الرحمن 'the Most Merciful' and الرحيم 'the Most Benevolent' all share the same root رحم which means 'the womb'. The womb is the place where nourishment and protection are provided for the fetus with abundance.http://www.qurangarden.com/content.php?content=r&id;=12#.XxKInJMzYWo \\"Māliki yawmi d-dīn\\" مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ‎ \\" The owner of the judgment day or dīn day. dīn الدِّينِ means religion and also carries a meaning of debt لدِّينِ‎. Allah is the only judge that judges the dues of the people. Muslim commentators often believe past generations of Jews and Christians as an example of those evoking God's anger and those who went astray, respectively. Critics of Islam, such as Andrew Bostom, view this as an exclusive condemnation of all Jews and Christians from all times. However, most Islamic scholars have interpreted these verses as referring exclusively not to a specific group of people but instead interpret these in the more general sense as, \\"evil consequences which man brings upon himself by wilfully rejecting God's guidance and acting contrary to His injunctions.\\"  Related hadith  One hadith narrates a story of a companion of Muhammad who recited al-Fātiḥah as a remedy for a tribal chief who was poisoned. According to the hadith, Muhammad later asked the companion, \\"How did you know that it is a Ruqqayah [remedy]?\\" Muhammad al-Bukhari recorded in his collection: Similar versions are found in: Al-Bukhari: 007.071.645—medicine; Al-Bukhari: 007.071.633—medicine; Al-Bukhari: 007.071.632—medicine Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj recorded that Abu Hurairah had told that Muhammad had said: A similar story is found in Al-Bukhari: 001.012.723—characteristics of prayer. Muslim ibn al- Hajjaj recorded: Benefits and virtues attributed to Sura Al-Fatiha Some Suras are assigned special significance by adherents of Islam, because of their virtues and benefits (Arabic: فضائل‎ faḍāʾil) described in the Hadiths. Acceptance of the different hadith stories varies between Sunni and Shia Muslims and there is a variety of terms to classify the different levels of confirmed authenticity of a hadith. Sunni benefits One of the greatest Surahs Ahmad ibn Hanbal recorded in his Musnad (Hadith collection) that Abu Sa\`id bin Al-Mu\`alla had said: \\"I was praying when the Prophet called me, so I did not answer him until I finished the prayer. I then went to him and he said, 'What prevented you from coming?' I said, 'O Messenger of God! I was praying.' He said, 'Didn't God say, \\"O you who believe! Answer God (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life.\\"?' He then said, 'I will teach you the greatest Surah in the Qur'an before you leave the Masjid (Mosque).' He held my hand and when he was about to leave the Masjid, I said, 'O Messenger of God! You said: \\"I will teach you the greatest Surah in the Qur'an.\\"' He said, 'Yes.' \\"Al- Hamdu lillahi Rabbil-\`Alamin,\\" It is the seven repeated (verses) and the Glorious Qur'an that I was given.\\" (Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith.) Al-Fatiha used for cure Al-Bukhari recorded in his collection: Abu Sa 'id Al-Khudri said: \\"While we were on one of our journeys, we dismounted at a place where a slave girl came and said, \\"The chief of this tribe has been stung by a scorpion and our men are not present; is there anybody among you who can treat him (by reciting something)?\\" Then one of our men went along with her though we did not think that he knew any such treatment. But he treated the chief by reciting something, and the sick man recovered whereupon he gave him thirty sheep and gave us milk to drink (as a reward). When he returned, we asked our friend, \\"Did you know how to treat with the recitation of something?\\" He said, \\"No, but I treated him only with the recitation of the Mother of the Book (i.e., Al-Fatiha).\\" We said, \\"Do not say anything (about it) till we reach or ask the Prophet so when we reached Medina, we mentioned that to the Prophet (in order to know whether the sheep which we had taken were lawful to take or not). The Prophet said, \\"How did he come to know that it (Al-Fatiha) could be used for treatment? Distribute your reward and assign for me one share thereof as well.\\" (Al-Bukhari 006.061.529 - Virtues of the Qur'an) (Similar versions found in: Al-Bukhari: 007.071.645 - Medicine; Al-Bukhari: 007.071.633 - Medicine; Al-Bukhari: 007.071.632 - Medicine) Necessity in Salat Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj recorded that Abu Hurayrah had told that the Prophet had said: \\"Whoever performs any prayer in which he did not read Umm Al-Qur'an (i.e., Al-Fatiha), then his prayer is incomplete.\\" (Sahih Muslim) (Similar story found in Al-Bukhari: 001.012.723 - Characteristics of Prayer) 1 of the 2 lights Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj recorded that Ibn ‘Abbas had said: “While Hadrat Jibril (i.e. the angel Gabriel) was sitting with the Holy Prophet, he heard a sound above him and raised his head. He said: ‘This is a door in the heaven which has been opened today and which has never been opened before today.’ An angel descended from it. And he (Hadrat Jibril) said: ‘This is an angel who has descended to earth, who has never descended before today.’ He (that angel) gave the greetings of peace and said: ‘Give the good news of two lights which you have been given; of which no Prophet before you was given: the Faatiha (Opening chapter) of the Book and the end of Surah al- Baqarah. You will not recite a letter of them without being given it.’” (Sahih Muslim) “When you lie your side on your bed [getting ready to sleep] and you recite [The Opening chapter of The Book] and Sura al-Ikhlas, then you have been secured from everything, except death… ” [Weak. Dhaif at-Targheeb w a tarheeb: 34] “The Fatiha and the Ayaat ul Kursi: No slave will ever recite them in a house; except that no evil eye - from a Jinn or human – will ever affect them in that day… ” [Dhaif al Jam i as-Sagheer : 3952 ; weak according to Scholar Albaanee][5] “The Fatiha is equal to a third of the Qur’an… ” [Weak. Dhaif al Jam i as-Sagheer: 3949] Shia benefits One of the companions of Muhammad narrates that he once recited this surah in the presence of Muhammad, who said, ‘By Him in whose hand is my soul, a similar revelation to this has not been included in the Taurat (Torah), Injeel (Gospel), Zabur (Psalms) or even the Qur’an itself.’ Muhammad once asked Jabir ibn Abdallah Ansari, “Should I teach you a surah that has no other comparison to it in the whole Qur’an?” Jabir replied, “Yes, and may my parents be ransom upon you O prophet of Allah.” So Muhammad taught him surah al-Fatihah. Then Muhammad asked, “Jabir, should I tell you something about this surah?” Jabir answered, “Yes, and may my parents be ransom upon you O prophet of Allah.” Muhammad said, “It (surah al-Fatihah) is a cure for every ailment except death.” Imam AbuAbdillah Ja’far as-Sadiq said that whoever cannot be cured by surah al-Fatihah, then there is no cure for that person. In the same narration it is written that if this surah is recited 70 times on any part of the body that is aching, the pain will surely go away. In fact, the power of this surah is so great that it is said that if one were to recite it 70 times over a dead body, you should not become surprised if that body starts moving (i.e. comes back to life). Surah al-Fatihah is a cure for physical and also spiritual ailments. An experienced way of warding off Jinn or Jadu (magic) by Muhammad Zakariyya Muhajir Madani This amal (practise) is known as the amal of Ayatul Kursi. After fajr salaah, maghrib salaah and before retiring to bed, read thrice Surah Fatihah including Bismillah, Aayatul Kursi, Surah Falaq (chapter 113) and Surah Naas (chapter 114). Read any Durood thrice in the beginning as well as at the end. If the affected one recites himself it is better, otherwise someone else should recite and blow in such a manner that some part of his lips touch the affected person. Also keep a bottle of water and whatever you read blow in the water at the end and make the affected one drink from that water each morning before doing anything else. When the bottle is halved, fill it up with fresh water. And if some signs of affect are seen within the house, then a portion of that water should be sprinkled in the four corners of the house in such a manner that the water does not fall on the floor. (Taweez used or approved by Sheikhul Hadith Maulana Muhammad Zakariyya Muhajir Madani). Iblees lamented on 4 occasions Ambari in his ‘Kitaabur-Rad’ through his own chain of narrators has mentioned from Mujahid ibn Jabr that Iblees, the accursed of Allah Ta’ala, lamented on four occasions: first when he was cursed; secondly when he was cast out of Heaven to the Earth; thirdly when Muhammad was given the Prophethood; fourthly when Surah Fatihah was revealed and it was revealed in Madinah.

His early life and career at Notre Dame were the inspiration for the 1993 film Rudy. Early life and family Daniel Eugene Ruettiger (nicknamed \\"Rudy\\") was the third of fourteen children. He was born on August 22, 1948, in Joliet, Illinois, where he grew up with his German American family. He did not excel scholastically, at least in part due to dyslexia. He attended Joliet Catholic High School, where he played for locally famous coach Gordie Gillespie. Ruettiger joined the United States Navy after high school, serving as a yeoman on a communications command ship for two years; then he worked in a power plant for two years. He applied to Notre Dame and was rejected due to his low high school grades. He enrolled and attended nearby Holy Cross College, and after two years was accepted as a student at Notre Dame on his fourth try, in the fall of 1974. It was during his time studying at Holy Cross that Ruettiger discovered he had dyslexia. College Ruettiger harbored a dream to play for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team, despite being undersized at and . Head coach Ara Parseghian encouraged walk-on players from the student body. For example, Notre Dame's 1969 starting center, Mike Oriard, was a walk-on who was eventually nominated for a Rhodes Scholarship and earned an NFL contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. After tremendous hard work which was noticed, Ruettiger earned a place on the Notre Dame scout team, a squad that helps the varsity team practice for games. Merv Johnson was the coach who was instrumental in keeping Rudy on as a scout-team player. After the 1974 season, Notre Dame coach Parseghian stepped down, and former Green Bay Packers coach Dan Devine was named head coach. In Ruettiger's last opportunity to play for Notre Dame at home, Devine put him into a game as defensive end against Georgia Tech on November 8, 1975. In the movie Rudy, Devine is given a somewhat antagonistic role, not wanting Ruettiger to dress for his last game. In the real life scenario, however, it was Devine who came up with the idea to dress Ruettiger. In the final play of Ruettiger's senior season with the Fighting Irish, he recorded a sack, (August 26, 2006). Retrieved on 2012-04-19. which is all his Notre Dame stat line has shown. Ruettiger actually played for three plays: a kickoff, an incomplete pass, and on the third play (the game's final play), he sacked Georgia Tech quarterback Rudy Allen. He was carried off the field by his teammates following the game, the first player at Notre Dame history to do so. Only one other player has received such an honor: Marc Edwards in 1995. Feature film Ruettiger's story was told in the 1993 inspirational feature film Rudy, which starred actor Sean Astin in the title role. The film was written by Angelo Pizzo and directed by David Anspaugh, both of whom were involved in Hoosiers. Ruettiger appeared in a cameo as a fan behind his father, played by Ned Beatty, during the final game scenes. Ruettiger has said that the movie is \\"92% true\\". The players did not lay down their jerseys; rather, the team captain and one other player requested that he be allowed to play. Dan Devine is given a somewhat antagonistic role in the film, but Devine was actually one of Ruettiger's biggest motivators to return to the team. The groundskeeper and former Notre Dame player named \\"Fortune\\" is a combination of three different people. Career Ruettiger is a motivational speaker and author. In his 2011 book, “Rudy: My Story,” Ruettiger writes of his dealings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and settlement for alleged securities fraud, stating, “I fell into the same obvious trap the rest of the country had fallen into in all of those boom years,” and “I shouldn’t have been chasing the money.”  Personal life  In 2017 at the age of 68, Ruettiger was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Highland, Utah. Honors, recognition and awards On October 14, 2005, Ruettiger was the master of ceremonies at a pep rally for Notre Dame Football. The Fighting Irish were about to play rival and then #1-ranked University of Southern California (USC) the following day and Head Coach Charlie Weis asked some Notre Dame legends, including Tim Brown and Joe Montana, to come back and speak at the rally. Ruettiger came out of the tunnel at Notre Dame Stadium to a loud ovation.\\"One for the ages: USC edges Notre Dame: Leinart pulls trickery with 3 seconds left, Bush scores 3 TDs in 34–31 win\\"; msnbc.com.

The winner, Calob Leindecker of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, received a college scholarship totaling $10,000. Two runners-up, Kyle Weafer of Kansas and Justin Ray Duke of Texas each received $5,000 scholarships. In July 2009, Ruettiger was initiated into the Kappa Sigma fraternity at the Grand Conclave in San Antonio, Texas. Ruettiger received an honorary doctorate degree from Our Lady of Holy Cross College and Long Island University. He has been given key to the city at numerous cities across the nation along with special proclamations for his inspiration, commitment, and human spirit; one such proclamation from the Governor of Nevada announced an Official Rudy Award Day. He has been recognized by the Texas House of Representatives and the President of the United States George W. Bush and visited the White House. SEC investigation In 2011, Ruettiger was charged with securities fraud in connection with his role as Chairman of Rudy Beverage, Inc. The government alleged a pump-and-dump scheme.

It separates downtown from the rest of the city. It was named by George Henry Richards during his Hydrographic survey of 1856-63. While traveling along the south side of the Burrard Inlet, he thought he was traversing a creek; upon discovering his error, he gave the waterway its modern name. Science World is located at its eastern end. Proceeding east to west, it is crossed by the Cambie, Granville, and Burrard street bridges. The Canada Line rapid transit tunnel crosses underneath False Creek just west of the Cambie Bridge. It is one of the four major bodies of water bordering Vancouver along with English Bay, Burrard Inlet and the Fraser River. In 1986 it was the location of the Expo 86 World's Fair. False Creek South is a neighbourhood that runs along the inlet starting under the Granville bridge and runs until under the Cambie bridge to the east Southeast False Creek (Olympic Village) starts from Cambie to main street.

Vancouver, BC: Douglas & McIntyre Ltd., 2007. p.103 The False Creek area was the industrial heartland of Vancouver through to the 1950s, and was home to many sawmills and small port operations. As industry shifted to other areas, the vicinity around False Creek started to deteriorate. In 1960, BC Forest Products plant and lumber storage facility on the south side of False Creek caught fire in Vancouver's first-ever five-alarm blaze. Every piece of firefighting equipment and all of Vancouver's firefighters fought the blaze for hours, but the facility was totally destroyed. The future of False Creek south was subsequently shaped by debates on freeways, urban renewal, and the rise of citizen participation in urban planning. Through the 1960s, the ruling NPA city government and senior city bureaucrats had hatched a plan - with little or no public consultation - to run freeways through the city. In the same period, the City razed large portions of Strathcona under the aegis of urban renewal. A group of influential citizens formed The Electors Action Movement (TEAM) to oppose the freeway and to radically change the way decisions were made on land use. A key figure amongst these people was Walter Hardwick, a Geography professor at UBC who envisioned the retrofit of this brownfield industrial site into a vibrant waterfront mixed-use community. First elected to City Council in 1968, Dr. Hardwick led the City's redevelopment team and helped secure the participation of the Federal Government which owned Granville Island. A major public involvement and co- design process followed which established public priorities for an accessible waterfront seawall; mixed-tenure housing including market condominiums, co-op and low-income housing and live-aboard marinas; and a vibrant waterfront market. These plans were formalised in a 1972 Official Development Plan. The form and mix of development were revolutionary for Vancouver at the time. A third of the site was set aside for housing at 40 units/acre with the balance converted to park, waterfront and community uses. The North Shore of False Creek (NFC) was further transformed in the 1980s, as it took centre stage during Expo 86. Following Expo, the Province sold the NFC site to Li Ka-shing who brought ideas of a higher density waterfront community to the downtown peninsula. Vancouver's experience with South False Creek and the public participation that shaped it was key to developing NFC as a liveable high- density community. For example, Ka-shing's company wanted to develop \\"islands\\" of market condos on the waterfront but was soundly rebuffed by the public and by planners who favoured the extension of a 100% publicly accessible waterfront and seawall. The 1991 Official Development Plan enabled significant new density commensurate with the provision of significant public amenities including street front shops and services, parks, school sites, community centres, daycares, co-op and low-income housing. Since then, most of the north shore has become a new neighbourhood of dense housing (about 100 units/acre), adding some 50,000 new residents to Vancouver's downtown peninsula. On December 1, 1998, Vancouver City Council adopted a set of Blue ways policies and guidelinesVancouver Blueways Policies stating the vision of a waterfront city where land and water combine to meet the environmental, cultural and economic needs of the City and its people in a sustainable, equitable, high quality manner. Southeast False Creek (SEFC) is the designation given to the neighbourhood bordered by Cambie, Main, West 2nd Avenue, and False Creek. The 2010 Olympic Village, for athlete housing and logistics of the Winter Olympics, is found in Southeast False Creek. The City of Vancouver has plans to see this neighbourhood developed into a residential area with housing and services for 11,000-13,000 people.Southeast False Creek: About the Neighbourhood. City of Vancouver. Retrieved 2011-11-22. Sports and recreation False Creek is a very popular boating area for many different activities including dragon boating, canoeing, kayaking, public ferries, charter ships, and visiting pleasure boats. It has 10 marinas with berths for 1500 watercraftFalse Creek Policy Broadsheets, section 3 and several paddling clubs or boat rental facilities. Since 1986, the creek has been the venue for the Canadian International Dragon Boat Festival and other paddling events. Transportation Aquabus and False Creek Ferries are two ferry companies that operate scheduled services daily to and from multiple points along False Creek. In addition to three bridges and multiple bus routes, False Creek can also be crossed via the Canada Line in a tunnel between Olympic Village Station on the South shore and Yaletown-Roundhouse Station to the North. Environmental issues Water quality is not suitable for swimming according to Vancouver Coastal Health. Persons exposed to water are advised to wash their hands and/or shower. Heavy rains may cause raw sewage to discharge right into the Burrard Inlet. Impact on wildlife Several decades following the suspension of industrial activity in the area, a number of shore and seabirds such as cormorants, ducks, herons, kingfishers, owls, geese, crows, and gulls have returned, as well as harbour seals. In an unusual sighting, in May 2010 a grey whale entered False Creek and traversed its length before returning to the open waters of the Strait of Georgia. Factors working against the further return of wildlife include residual industrial contaminants, spillage from the sewer overflow system into the creek, and the seawall that constrains much of the shoreline with little habitat value. The city has attempted to recreate the natural shoreline in some areas and is working to phase out the antiquated sewer overflow system. Architecture and urban planning False Creek at blue hour Water taxi on False Creek The False Creek area is an eclectic group of neighbourhoods with very different urban planning and architectural techniques/styles. The discrepancies between the north and south shores of False Creek are apparent from the built landscape but, as David Ley from the Geography department at UBC argues, these discrepancies are representative of the social, economic, and cultural movements from which they sprang.Ley, David (1987). \\"Styles of the times: liberal and neo-conservative landscapes in inner Vancouver, 1968-1986.\\" Journal of Historical Geography. 13(1): 40-56 The Modern and Post-modern aesthetics that helped to shape western culture during the course of the last century were not wasted on architecture and urban planning either. These movements in art and culture had significant effects on the way people thought about and interacted with their environment and False Creek offers a good example of the disparate design elements and goals that characterise these respective approaches, and of the how the sequence of development changed in response to social pressures. False Creek South The south shore of False Creek has had quite a diverse history of land uses since its founding. South False Creek went from being an industrial park, in the late 1800s and mid 1900s, to being the populous residential area that it is today. The development of this area, beginning anew in the 1970s, occurred at a critical time in Vancouver’s history when citizens were organising support for a new picture of the city, one that broke away from the standardised utilitarian cities that were so popular in North America and, instead, pushed for a more liveable and diverse built environment. This neighbourhood, located on municipally and federally owned land, offered an opportunity for project leaders, often led by TEAM members, to create a new kind of space, what Ley calls a post-modern space. Architecture and urban planning that embrace diversity of design, human-scale proportions, open public spaces, historical and vernacular allusions, diverse demography and the trade of local goods reflect the post-modern goals of inclusion and tradition that were important to the project leaders behind South False Creek. The result is a medium-density area with a variety of architectural designs, ownership opportunities, recreational activities, and modes of transportation, which allows for easier mobility within the community and a more picturesque landscape to be enjoyed by residents and visitors alike. Bike paths, parks, unique three-story homes, a public market, and the intentional preservation of mountain-views, and other characteristics, distinguish the area of South False Creek as one of the earliest conscious attempts to create a more \\"liveable\\" environment for Vancouverites rather than focusing on efficiency and profitability as modernists are often criticised for doing. False Creek south is home to False Creek Elementary School. Having a mixed income neighborhood makes for a inclusive neighbourhood where money is not more important than the well being of your neighbour. False Creek South has a strong sense of community. False creek consists of 70% social housing and 30% leasehold apartments and condos 30% Low income below market (subsidised) rent. Including Metro Vancouver Housing, Portland Hotel Society, other organisation and societies. 30% Co-op housing rent geared to income but still quite Subsidised (below market) 10% Housing for people with special needs (Below market rents) 30% standard market rent apartments and leasehold condos. All of False Creek South is on Leasehold land which is owned by The City Of Vancouver. Southeast False Creek (Olympic Village) consists mostly of Market rate apartments and modern condos with a few co-ops and social housing. North False Creek The north shore of False Creek, on the downtown peninsula, has undergone multiple stages of development since its purchase by the province from the Canadian Pacific Railway in the early 1980s.Alexander, Don; Dobson, Charles; Canning, Patricia; Hurley, Brendan. \\"False Creek Urban Heritage Trail Guidebook.\\" New City. Retrieved November 03, 2012. Before the BC Cabinet bought the land of North False Creek to begin development for Expo ’86, the land was used for industrial purposes, however, provincial leaders developed a plan to build a sports stadium (BC Place), commercial outlets, and high- density residences on the newly cleared land.McMordie, M.J. (1994). \\"Modern Architecture in Vancouver.\\" Canadian Architect. 29(3): 22-27. The circumstances surrounding the initial development phase of the northern shore of False Creek – strong provincial government involvement, incorporation of corporate partners, the appointment of Arthur Erickson as a project leader, etc. – worked to set the development of the area on a path to modernism with the primary goal being economic profit. BC Place and the accompanying high- density residences and commercial retailers set North False Creek in stark contrast to its southern neighbor, but the differences are more significant than design alone. Yes, the standardized condominiums and streets of the downtown peninsula may offer a more functional or efficient landscape for the modern worker, but even more, this kind of landscape, with its adherence to rational, large-scale, technological spaces, works to keep residents and visitors within the economic dynamo of the city. Although the early development decisions continue to play a role in the experience of the built environment in North False Creek, however, new strides have been taken by the land’s new owner Li Ka-shing, in response to public concerns, to create a more livable and accessible space, although the high-density and mixed use characteristics of the landscape were maintained in this case. False Creek North is home to Cross town elementary school as well as Elsie Roy elementary school. See also * Bodies of water in Vancouver * Hinge Park References Further reading * Alexander, D.

Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians are a subgroup of the Indo-Caribbeans. Generally, most Indians in Trinidad and Tobago can trace their ancestors back to northern India, especially the Bhojpur and Awadh region of the Hindi Belt, which lies in the Gangetic plains, a plain that is located between the Ganga and Yamuna rivers and faces the mountain ranges of the Himalayas and the Vindhyas in Northern India. However, some Indians may trace their ancestry to other parts of South Asia, notably Southern India. History Early Indian indentured laborers. In his book Perspectives on the Caribbean: A Reader In Culture, History, and Representation, Philip W. Scher cites figures by Steven Vertovec, Professor of Anthropology; Of 94,135 Indian immigrants to Trinidad, between 1874–1917, 50.7 percent were from the NW/United Provinces (an area, which today, is largely encompassed by Uttar Pradesh), 24.4 percent hailed from the historic region of Oudh (Awadh), 13.5 percent were from Bihar and lesser numbers from various other states and regions of the Indian Subcontinent, such as Punjab, Bengal and Madras Presidency (as cited in Vertovec, 1992). Out of 134,118 indentured labourers from India, 5,000 distinguished themselves as \\"Madrasi\\" from the port of Madras and the immigrants from Bengal as \\"Kalkatiyas\\", from the city Kolkata. Indo- Trinidadian and Tobagonians has now become interchangeable with Indians or East Indians. These were people who were escaping poverty in India and seeking employment offered by the British for jobs either as indentured labourers, workers or educated servicemen, primarily, between 1845–1917.Under colonial rule, India's population provided the British Empire with a ready source of cheap and mobile labourers. Many Indians agreed to become indentured labourers to escape the widespread poverty and famine in the 19th century. Some travelled alone; others brought their families to settle in the colonies they worked in. The demand for Indian indentured labourers increased dramatically after the abolition of slavery in 1834. They were sent, sometimes in large numbers, to plantation colonies producing high-value crops such as sugar in Africa and the Caribbean. In his book Finding a Place, author, journalist, editor, and academic Kris Rampersad challenges and rejects the notion of East Indians to describe people in Indian heritage in the Caribbean and traces their migration and adaptation from hyphenated isolation inherent in the description Indo-Trinidadian or Indo-Caribbean for the unhyphenated integration into their societies as IndoTrinidadian and Indocaribbean that embraces both their ancestral and their national identities. In Trinidad some Chinese men had Chindian children with dark skinned Indian women of Madrasee (Tamil) origin and it was reported that \\"A few children are to be met with born of Madras and Creole parents and some also of Madras and Chinese parents - the Madrasee being the mother\\", by the missionary John Morton in 1876, Morton noted that it seemed strange since there were more Indian coolie men than Indian coolie women that Indian coolie women would marry Chinese men, but claimed it was most likely because the Chinese could provide amenities to the women since the Chinese owned shops and they were enticed by these. Alt URL Few Chinese women migrated to Trinidad while the majority of Chinese migrants were men. The migration of Chinese to Trinidad resulted in intermarriage between them and others. Chinese in Trinidad became relatively open to having marital relations with other races and Indian women began having families with Chinese in the 1890s. The situation on Trinidad enabled unprecedented autonomy in the sexual activities of Indian women and freedom. Approval of interracial marriage has slowly increased in Trinidad and Tobago and one Chinese man reported that his Indian wife did not encounter any rejection from his parents when asked in a survey. In Trinidad, Europeans and Chinese are seen as acceptable marriage partners by Indians, while marrying black men would lead to rejection of their daughters by Indian families. According to the Douglas' consciousness, there were twice as many Indian men with black women than black men with Indian women, the statistics for Chinese men are not clear since the majority of Indians were from honour killing prevalent states whereas the Tamil labourer families had more open mentalities. Some Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians can trace their ancestry to indentured labourers who immigrated to Guyana, Jamaica, St. Vincent, Grenada, or other islands in the Caribbean. Many are descendants of later immigrants from India. Religion According to the most recent census (2011) conducted in Trinidad and Tobago, Hinduism is the religion followed by a plurality of Indo-Trinidadians. The breakdown of religious affiliation for Indo-Trinidadians is as follows \\\\- # 15px Hinduism - 49.54% # 18px Islam - 11.64% #18px Pentecostal/Evangelical/Full Gospel - 9.67% # 18px Roman Catholic - 6.48% # Other - 5.87% # 18px Presbyterians - 5.68% # None and Not Stated - 7.34% The remaining 3.78% is made up of adherents of 18px Jainism, 18px Sikhism, 18px the Baháʼí Faith and the 18px Anglican, 18px Lutheranism, 18px Jehovah's Witnesses, 18px Methodist, 18px Moravian, 18px Seventh-day Adventist, 18px Episcopal and 18px Baptist denominations of Protestant Christianity. Hindus in Trinidad and Tobago are represented by several organizations and entities the largest of which is the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha. Other Hindu organizations and sects include SWAHA International, Arya Samaj, Chinmaya Mission, Kabir Panth, ISKCON and the Sathya Sai Baba movement. The major Muslim organisation representing Muslims in Trinidad and Tobago is the Anjuman Sunnat-ul-Jamaat Association (ASJA) led by Yacoob Ali. Other Islamic organizations include Darul Uloom and Tackveeyatul Islamic Association of Trinidad and Tobago Inc. (T.I.A.) Although the Maha Sabha and ASJA were once seen to speak for the vast majority of Hindus and Muslims in Trinidad, their membership has gradually eroded but they still remain the largest organized voice for the respective Indian communities. Politics Indo-Trinidadians have traditionally given their political support to parties opposed to the Peoples National Movement (PNM) which has historically been perceived as an Afro Trinidadian party. Voting patterns amongst Indo Trinidadians have also been dictated by Religion where, for periods of time Muslim Indo-Trinidadians and Presbyterian Indo-Trinidadians supported the PNM, as the prevailing parties for Indo Trinidadians - the DLP and ULF were felt to be Hindu dominated parties. With the advent of the UNC this polarization by Religion has been on the decline however its existence is still felt with the UNC fielding a Muslim candidate in every election for the San Juan/Barataria seat since 1995 owing to the presence of a large Muslim population within this district. Notable Indo-Trinidadian politicians include - *Basdeo Panday - 1st Prime Minister of Indo-Trinidadian Descent *Kamla Persad-Bissesar - 1st Female Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago *Rudranath Capildeo - Leader of the Opposition at the time of Independence *Bhadase Sagan Maraj - Leader of the Parliamentary Wing (1958–1960) *Ashford Sinanan - Opposition Leader, Federal Parliament (1958–1961) *Rudranath Capildeo - party leader (1960–1969) *Stephen Maharaj - Opposition Leader (1963–1965) *Simbhoonath Capildeo - Opposition Leader (1965) *Vernon Jamadar - Opposition leader (1965–1972); party leader (1969–1972) Culture Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians have retained their distinctive heritage and culture, while also function in a multi-racial milieu. The South Asian languages of their ancestors have largely been lost, although a number of these words have entered the Trinidadian vernacular. Indian movies, Indian music, and Indian cuisine have entered the mainstream culture of Trinidad and Tobago. Chutney music and chutney soca rivals calypso and soca music during the Carnival season. Divali, Eid ul-Fitr, and Indian Arrival Day are national holidays, and Phagwah, Maha Shivratri, Hanuman Jayanti, Ram Navami, Navratri, Vijayadashami, Krishna Janmashtami, Radhastami, Saraswati Jayanti, Raksha Bandhan, Vivaha Panchami, Guru Purnima, Ganesh Chaturthi, Kartik Snan, Mesha Sankranti, Makar Sankranti, Tulsi Vivah, Gita Jayanti, Ramadan, Hosay (Ashura), Eid al-Adha, Mawlid, Islamic New Year, and other Hindu and Muslim holidays are widely celebrated. Influence on Trinidad and Tobago The Indian-South Asian influence is very much noticeable in Trinidad and Tobago as they are the largest ethnic groups in the country. Mandirs, masijids, jhandis (Hindu prayer flags), Hindu schools, Muslim schools, roti shops and stalls, puja stores, Indian groceries/markets, clothing stores and expos dot the landscape of the country. Many businesses also bear names of Indian-South Asian origin. Many towns, settlements, villages, avenues, traces, and streets in Trinidad and Tobago are named after Indian cities and people, such as Calcutta Settlement, Madras Settlement, Delhi Settlement, Jai Ramkissoon Housing Settlement, Hindustan Village, Patna Village, Gandhi Village, Kandahar Village, Cawnpore (Kanpur) Village, Nepal Village, Abdul Village, Samaroo Village, Basta Hall, Gopaul Lands, Mohammed Ville, Malabar, Matura (Mathura), Bangladesh, Chandanagore (Chandinagar), Divali Nagar, Golconda, Barrackpore, and Fyzabad. The holidays of Diwali, Eid al-Fitr, and Indian Arrival Day are national holidays in Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidadian Hindustani and other South Asian languages has had a great influence on the Trinidadian English lingua franca. Most people of South Asian descent in Trinidad and Tobago also speak a unique Hinglish macaronic dialect of Trinidadian English and Trinidadian Hindustani and they incorporate more Hindustani vocabulary into their Trinidadian English dialect than other ethnic groups in the country.

Free-to-play can be contrasted with pay to play, in which payment is required before using a service for the first time. There are several kinds of free-to-play business models. The most common is based on the freemium software model, in which users are granted access to a fully functional game but is incentivised to pay microtransactions to access additional content without spending large amounts of time 'unlocking' it. Thus, free-to-play games are usually not entirely free. For freemium Another method of generating revenue is to integrate advertisements into the game. The model was first popularly used in early massively multiplayer online games targeted towards casual gamers, before finding wider adoption among games released by major video game publishers to combat video game piracy and high system requirements. Categories There are several kinds of free-to-play games: *Shareware, a trial of variable functionality intended to convince users to buy a full license of the pay to play game. Also known as game demos, shareware often gives free users severely limited functionality compared to the full game. *Freemium games, such as Star Wars: The Old Republic, Apex Legends, Fortnite Battle Royale, and the majority of the MOBA games, offer the \\"full version\\" of a product free of charge, while users are charged micropayments to access premium features and virtual goods, often in a piecemeal fashion. Game mechanics In-game items can be purely cosmetic, enhance the power of the player, accelerate progression speed, and many more. A common technique used by developers of these games is for the items purchased to have a time limit; after this expires, the item must be repurchased before the user can continue. Another commonly seen mechanic is the use of two in-game currencies: one earned through normal gameplay, and another which can be purchased with real-world money. The second, \\"premium\\" currency is sometimes given out in small amounts to non-paying players at certain times, such as when they first start the game, complete a quest, or refer a friend to the game. Many browser games have an \\"energy bar\\" that depletes when the player takes actions. These games then sell items such as coffee or snacks to refill the bar. Free-to-play games are free to install and play, but once the player enters the game, the player is able to purchase content such as items, maps, and expanded customization options. Some games, such as id Software's Quake Live, also use in-game advertising to provide income for free-to-play games. In addition to making in-game items available for purchase, EA integrates in-game advertising into its games. In August 2007, EA completed a deal with Massive Incorporated, which lets Massive update and change in-game advertising in real-time within EA games. Independent game developer Edmund McMillen has claimed that he makes most of his money from sponsors by placing advertisements into the introduction of a game and the game's title screen. History Matt Mihaly created the first known business model of exchanging virtual goods for money in an online game, in 1997 for the flagship title Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands for his corporation originally Achaea LLC that became Iron Realms Entertainment. The free-to-play business model in online games was later realized by Nexon in South Korea to a degree first catching more major media attention at the time. The first game of Nexon's to use it, QuizQuiz, was released in October 1999. Its creator Lee Seungchan would go on to create MapleStory. The free-to-play model originated in the late 1990s and early 2000s, coming from a series of highly successful MMOs targeted towards children and casual gamers, including Furcadia, Neopets, RuneScape, MapleStory, and text-based dungeons such as Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands. Known for producing innovative titles, small independent developers also continue to release free-to-play games. Free-to-play games are particularly prevalent in countries such as South Korea and the People's Republic of China. Microtransaction-based free-to-play mobile games and browser games such as Puzzle & Dragons, Kantai Collection and The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls also have large player populations in Japan.2013-09-27, ツイート数は「パズドラ」より「艦これ」 【ゲームの課金についてのツイート分析】, MarkeZine In particular, the Nikkei Shimbun reported that Cinderella Girls earns over 1 billion yen in revenue monthly from microtransactions. Electronic Arts first adopted the free-to-play concept in one of its games when it released FIFA Online in Korea. In the late 2000s, many MMOs transitioned to the free-to-play model from subscriptions, including subscription-based games such as The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures, Dungeons & Dragons Online, and Champions Online. This move from a subscription based model to a free-to-play one has proven very beneficial in some cases. Star Wars: The Old Republic is a good example of a game that transitioned from subscription to free-to-play. Turbine as of September 10, 2010 has given an F2P with Cash shop option to The Lord of the Rings Online which resulted in a tripling of profit. Sony Online Entertainment's move to transition EverQuest from a subscription model into a hybrid F2P/subscription game was followed by a 125% spike in item sales, a 150% up-tick in unique log-ins, and over three times as many account registrations. The movement of free-to-play MMOs into the mainstream also coincided with experimentation with other genres as well. The model was picked up by larger developers and more diverse genres, with games such as Battlefield Heroes, Free Realms, Quake Live and Team Fortress 2 appearing in the late 2000s. The experimentation was not successful in every genre, however. Traditional real time strategy franchises such as Age of Empires and Command & Conquer both attempted free-to-play titles. Age of Empires Online was shut down in the midst of a tiny player base and stagnant revenue, and Command & Conquer: Generals 2 was shut down in alpha due to negative reactions from players. In 2011, revenue from free-to-play games overtook revenue from premium games in the top 100 games in Apple's App Store. The percentage of people that spend money on in-game items in these games ranges from 0.5% to 6%, depending on a game's quality and mechanics. Even though this means that a large number of people will never spend money in a game, it also means that the people that do spend money could amount to a sizeable number due to the fact that the game was given away for free. Indeed a report from mobile advertising company firm SWRV stated that only 1.5 percent of players opted to pay for in-game items, and that 50 percent of the revenue for such games often came from just ten percent of players. Nevertheless The Washington Post noted that the developers of two such games, Supercell (Clash of Clans) and Machine Zone (Game of War: Fire Age), were able to afford Super Bowl commercials in 2015 featuring big-name celebrities (respectively Liam Neeson and Kate Upton). The latter, Game of War, was in fact, part of a roughly $40 million campaign starring Upton. As of 2012, free-to-play MOBAs, such as League of Legends, Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm, and Smite have become among the most popular PC games. The success in the genre has helped convince many video game publishers to copy the free-to-play MOBA model. During 2015, Slice Intelligence tracked people that bought products in mobile video games, and these players spent an average of $87 in free-to-play games. The highest spending per player in 2015 was in Game of War: Fire Age, where the players that bought products on average spent $550. Comparison with traditional model The free-to-play model has been described as a shift from the traditional model in the sense that previously, success was measured by multiplying the number of units of a game sold by the unit price, while with free-to-play, the most important factor is the number of players that a game can keep continuously engaged, followed by how many compelling spending opportunities the game offers its players. With free games that include in-game purchases, two particularly important things occur: first, more people will try out the game since there is zero cost to doing so and second, revenue will likely be more than a traditional game since different players can now spend different amounts of money that depend on their engagement with the game and their preferences towards it. It is likely that the vast majority of players are playing for free and few are paying money, such that a very tiny minority (\\"whales\\") pay the bulk of the income. Up to 50% of revenue comes from 0.15% (15 in 10,000) of players (\\"white whales\\") in one report. It is not unlikely for a very few players to spend tens of thousands of dollars in a game that they enjoy. On the PC in particular, two problems are video game piracy and high system requirements. The free-to-play model attempts to solve both these problems by providing a game that requires relatively low system requirements and at no cost, and consequently provides a highly accessible experience funded by advertising and micropayments for extra content or an advantage over other players. Free-to-play is newer than the pay to play model, and the video game industry is still attempting to determine the best ways to maximize revenue from their games. Gamers have cited the fact that purchasing a game for a fixed price is still inherently satisfying because the consumer knows exactly what they will be receiving, compared to free-to-play which requires that the player pay for most new content that they wish to obtain. The term itself, \\"free-to-play\\", has been described as one with a negative connotation. One video game developer noted this, stating, \\"Our hope—and the basket we're putting our eggs in—is that 'free' will soon be disassociated with [sic] 'shallow' and 'cruddy'.\\" However, another noted that developing freeware games gave developers the largest amount of creative freedom, especially when compared to developing console games, which requires that the game follow the criteria as laid out by the game's publisher. Many kinds of revenue are being experimented with. For example, with its Free Realms game targeted to children and casual gamers, Sony makes money from the product with advertisements on loading screens, free virtual goods sponsored by companies such as Best Buy, a subscription option to unlock extra content, a collectible card game, a comic book, and micropayment items that include character customization options. Pay-to-win In some games, players who are willing to pay for special items, downloadable content, or to skip cooldown timers may be able to gain an advantage over those playing for free who might otherwise never be able to access said items. Such games are called \\"pay-to-win\\" by critics. In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over their non-paying peers. Market research indicates that pay-to-win mechanics are considered much more acceptable by players in China than in Western countries, possibly because Chinese players are more habituated to recurring costs associated with gaming, such as gaming café fees. A common suggestion for avoiding pay-to-win is for payments to only be used to broaden the experience without affecting gameplay. For example, some games, such as Dota 2 and StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, only allow the purchase of cosmetic items, meaning that a player who has spent money on the game will still be on the same level as a player who has not. Others suggest finding a balance where a game encourages players to pay for extra content that enhances the game without making the free version feel limited by comparison. This theory is that players who do not pay for items would still increase awareness of it through word of mouth marketing, which ultimately benefits the game indirectly. In response to concerns about players using payments to gain an advantage in the game, titles such as World of Tanks have explicitly committed to not giving paying players any advantages over their non-paying peers, while allowing the users buying the \\"gold\\" or \\"premium\\" ammo and expendables without paying the real money. However, features affecting gameplay and win rate, such as purchasing a 100% crew training level, a premium account, premium vehicles, and converting experience points to free experience points, remain available for the paying customers only. Nagging In single-player games, another concern is the tendency for free games to constantly request that the player buy extra content, in a similar vein to nagware and trialware's frequent demands for the user to 'upgrade'. Payment may be required in order to survive or continue in the game, annoying or distracting the player from the experience. Some psychologists, such as Mark D. Griffiths, have criticized the mechanics of freemium games as exploitative, drawing direct parallels to gambling addiction. Purchases by children The ubiquitous and often intrusive use of microtransactions in free-to-play games has sometimes caused children to either inadvertently or deliberately pay for large amounts of virtual goods, often for drastically high amounts of real money. In February 2013, Eurogamer reported that Apple had agreed to refund a British family £1700.41 after their son had racked up countless microtransactions whilst playing the F2P game Zombies vs. Ninjas. Outlook Pointing to the disruptive effect of free-to-play on current models, IGN editor Charles Onyett has said \\"expensive, one-time purchases are facing extinction\\". He believes that the current method of paying a one-time fee for most games will eventually disappear completely. Greg Zeschuk of BioWare believes there is a good possibility that free-to-play would become the dominant pricing plan for games, but that it was very unlikely that it would ever completely replace subscription-based games. Developers such as Electronic Arts have pointed to the success of freemium, saying that microtransactions will inevitably be part of every game. While noting the success of some developers with the model, companies such as Nintendo have remained skeptical of free-to-play, preferring to stick to more traditional models of game development and sales. In February 2015 Apple began featuring popular non-freemium software on the App Store as \\"Pay Once & Play\\", describing them as \\"Great Games with No In-App Purchases ... hours of uninterrupted fun with complete experiences\\".

Trưởng gained his commission in the Vietnamese National Army in 1954 and moved up the ranks over the next decade, mostly in the Airborne Brigade. In 1966, Trưởng commanded a division for the first time after he was given command of the 1st Division after helping to quell the Buddhist Uprising. He rebuilt the unit after this divisive period and used it to repel the communists and reclaimed the imperial citadel of Huế after weeks of bitter street fighting during the Tết Offensive. In 1970, Trưởng was given command of IV Corps in the Mekong Delta and improved the situation there to such an extent that he allowed some of his forces to be redeployed to other parts of the country that were finding the communist pressure difficult. In 1972, he was made the commander of I Corps after incompetent leadership by General Hoàng Xuân Lãm resulted in a South Vietnamese collapse in the face of the Easter Offensive, a massive conventional invasion by North Vietnam. He stabilized the ARVN forces before turning back the communists. In 1975, the communists attacked again. This time, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu gave contradictory orders to Trưởng as to whether he should stand and fight or give up some territory and consolidate. This led to the demoralization of I Corps and its collapse, allowing the communists to gather momentum and overrun South Vietnam within two months. Trưởng fled South Vietnam during the fall of Saigon and settled in Virginia in the United States. Early years and military beginnings Trưởng was born in 1929 to a wealthy family in the Mekong Delta province of Kiến Hòa (now Bến Tre Province). At the time, Vietnam was part of French Indochina. After graduating from Mỹ Tho College, a French colonial-run school in the Mekong Delta provincial town of Mỹ Tho, Trưởng attended the reserve officer school at Thủ Đức in Saigon, and was commissioned as an infantry officer in the Vietnamese National Army in 1954. Upon graduation from Thủ Đức, Trưởng went immediately on to airborne school at the Command and Staff School of the Vietnamese National Military Academy at Đà Lạt. He served in the elite airborne brigade the next 12 years. His first posting was as commander of 1st Company, 5th Airborne Battalion. After graduating from Đà Lạt, he soon saw action in a 1955 operation to eliminate the Bình Xuyên river pirates who were vying with President Diệm's government for control of Saigon and the surrounding area. In recognition of his performance against the Bình Xuyên, Trưởng was promoted to first lieutenant. When the Republic of Vietnam was created in 1955, the VNA became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Rising through the ranks In 1964, Trưởng was promoted to major and made commander of the 5th Airborne Battalion. He led a heliborne assault into Đỗ Xá Secret Zone in Minh Long District, Quảng Ngãi Province, in central Vietnam. This attack destroyed the base area of the Việt Cộng's (VC) B-1 Front Headquarters. In 1965, Trưởng led the 5th Airborne Battalion on a helicopter assault into the Hát Dịch Secret Zone in the vicinity of the Ong Trinh Mountain in Phước Tuy Province southeast of Saigon, the base area of the VC 7th Division. In two days of fighting, Trưởng's 5th Battalion inflicted heavy casualties on two VC regiments, and he was awarded a battlefield promotion to lieutenant colonel and the National Defense Medal, Fourth Class. After the battle, Trưởng became chief of staff of the Airborne Brigade and then became chief of staff of the division later in the year. His reputation for valour and fairness gained the attention of the senior generals in Saigon. General Cao Văn Viên, chief of the Joint General Staff from 1965 to 1975, later described Trưởng as \\"one of the best commanders at every echelon the Airborne Division ever had.\\"Dale Andrade, Trial by Fire. New York: Hippocrene, 1993. In 1966, the Buddhist Uprising broke out in central Vietnam with Buddhists protested military control of the government.Wiest, pp. 55-65. Trưởng was asked to quell the rebellious 1st Division in Huế, which had decided to stop military operations against the VC in solidarity with the Buddhist protest movement. A Buddhist, Trưởng, was uncomfortable with his mission, but he carried out his orders. On 18 June, he commanded three airborne battalions that entered the city and restored order within two days and he put the 1st Division under government control.Wiest, p. 62. General As a result of his efficient display, Saigon made Trưởng's appointment as 1st Division commander permanent. With his hands-on leadership, Trưởng quickly moulded the unit, which had a poor reputation prior to his arrival, and had been heavily weakened by the infighting of the past year,Wiest, p. 63. into one of the best units in the ARVN. Trưởng handpicked his leading subordinate officers and put his battalions in the hands of majors who had many years of combat experience. Unlike most, he eschewed politics in choosing his officers,Wiest, p. 70. and implemented new training programs to improve the capability of his troops and Regional (RF) and Popular Forces (PF) that augmented them. Trưởng's dedication to his unit and leadership significantly raised the morale of his subordinates. As part of his strategy of better integrating the territorial forces with the regular army, Trưởng had his battalion commanders act as district chiefs, who normally worked only with the territorial forces. As a result, the regulars began to coordinate their pacification campaigns more effectively with the paramilitary forces.Wiest, p. 69. In 1967, Trưởng's 1st Division assaulted and dismantled the VC infrastructure and a large part of their fighters from the Luong Co-Dong Xuyen-My Xa Front in Hương Trà District in Thừa Thiên-Huế Province. Trưởng was rewarded with a promotion to brigadier general. During the Tết Offensive, Trưởng led the 1st Division in the Battle of Huế as the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and VC were expelled from the old imperial city after three weeks of bitter street fighting. Following the famous victory in the citadel, Trưởng was given a second star and made a major general. In August 1970, he was assigned to command IV Corps, which oversaw the Mekong Delta region. He was based at the Corps' headquarters in Cần Thơ. General Creighton Abrams, the head of American forces in Vietnam, recommended Trưởng to President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, saying, \\"I can recommend, without any reservations at all ... Trưởng. I think he's proved over and over and in all facets -- pacification, military operations, whatever it is\\".Sorley, p. 266. He was promoted to lieutenant general in June 1971. Corps commander During his tenure in the Mekong Delta, Trưởng established a system of outposts along the border with Cambodia to block infiltration of PAVN/VC personnel and supplies into the region. He used the three divisions in his Corps in regimental-sized combined arms task forces and staged sweeps to seek and destroy PAVN/VC forces in their strongholds. He increased the capability of the RF/PF, which had a reputation for unreliability in his area, making them a productive part of his anti- PAVN/VC apparatus. Trưởng later said that these forces \\"shed their paramilitary origins and increasingly became full-fledged soldiers\\".Sorley, p. 73. It was estimated that although they provided 50% of the manpower, the RF and PF cost only 5% of total military costs.Sorley, p. 74. During his period in charge of IV Corps, the region's regular forces were depleted because a proportion of them were across the border as part of the Cambodian Campaign,Sorley, p. 269. seeking to destroy PAVN/VC jungle bases, supplies and staging grounds for an invasion into South Vietnam. Trưởng used the RF/PF that he had enhanced to fill the void, and they strengthened the government control in the region despite having nominally less resources. In the forests surrounding U Minh, Trưởng's outpost building programs resulted in a record number of defectors as the populace became more confident in his forces' ability to provide security. When American Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker came to inspect an outlying military base that Trưởng had built, he asked if the general intended to stay there. Trưởng replied \\"Yes, forever\\". Trưởng was so successful in pacifying the Mekong Delta that he allowed some of his forces to be redeployed to other parts of South Vietnam.Tucker, p. 293. Known for his unbending integrity, Trưởng vigorously moved against \\"ghost\\" and \\"ornamental\\" soldiers, deserters and conscription evaders in his region. Abrams said that only Trưởng and Phạm Văn Phú among the division and corps commanders had not begun to psychologically crack under the pressure of the PAVN onslaught.Sorley, p. 330. During the PAVN's Easter Offensive) of 1972, he was given command of I Corps, replacing the disgraced Lieutenant General Hoàng Xuân Lãm. General Trưởng held PAVN forces at bay before Huế and then launched (against the initial resistance of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and MACV) Operation Lam Son 72. During the counteroffensive, he successfully pushed PAVN forces back to the city of Quang Tri (which was retaken in September) and advanced on to the Cửa Việt river. Collapse of South Vietnam Trưởng remained in command of I Corps until the collapse of South Vietnam, when the north of the country lapsed into anarchy amid confused leadership by President Thiệu. I Corps fielded three infantry divisions, the elite Airborne and Marine Divisions,Willbanks, p. 246.Dougan and Fulghum, p. 66. four Ranger Groups and an armored brigade.Dougan and Fulghum, p. 69. Until mid-March, due to Trưởng's highly effective leadership, the PAVN had only tried to cut the highways, despite having five divisions and 27 further regiments far outnumbering Trưởng's men. At a meeting on March 13, Trưởng and the new III Corps commander, Lieutenant General Nguyễn Văn Toàn briefed Thiệu. By this time, South Vietnam was suffering from severe cutbacks in US aid, and the loss of Ban Mê Thuột in the central highlands, which threatened to split the country in two and isolate Trưởng's I Corps from the rest of the country. Thiệu laid out his plan to consolidate a smaller proportion of territory so that the forces could more effectively defend the area. As Trưởng understood it, he was free to redeploy his forces south to hold Đà Nẵng,Willbanks, p. 247. South Vietnam's second largest city, thereby abandoning Huế.Dougan and Fulghum, p. 68. Fearful of and preoccupied with stopping a coup, Thiệu also decided to remove the Airborne and Marines to Saigon, leaving I Corps exposed. Thiệu called Trưởng to Saigon on 19 March to brief him on the withdrawal plan. Trưởng intended to order a retreat to Huế, Đà Nẵng and Chu Lai, and then move all the forces to Đà Nẵng to regroup and dig in. Thiệu then stunned Trưởng by announcing that he had misinterpreted his previous orders:Dougan and Fulghum, pp. 68-69. Huế was not to be abandoned, despite losing two divisions in recent days.Willbanks, p. 248. In the meantime, the withdrawal preparations and the increasing North Vietnamese pressure caused civilians to flee in fear, clogging the highway and hampering the withdrawal.Willbanks, pp. 247-48. Trưởng requested permission to withdraw his forces into the three enclaves as planned; Thiệu ordered him to \\"hold onto any territory he could with whatever forces he now had, including the Marine Division\\", implying that he could retreat if needed.Vien, p. 102. Trưởng returned to Đà Nẵng to be greeted by the start of a PAVN offensive.Dougan and Fulghum, pp. 69-70. President Thiệu made a nationwide radio broadcast that afternoon proclaiming that Huế would be held \\"at all costs\\",Dougan and Fulghum, p. 70. contradicting the previous order. That evening Trưởng ordered a retreat to a new defense line at the My Chanh River to defend Huế,Willbanks, p. 250. thereby ceding all of Quảng Trị Province. He was confident that his forces could hold Huế, but was then astounded by a late afternoon message from Thiệu that ordered \\"that because of inability to simultaneously defend all three enclaves, the I Corps commander was free ... to redeploy his forces for the defense of Đà Nẵng only.\\"Vien, p. 104. The people of Quảng Trị and Huế began to leave their homes by the hundreds of thousands, joining an ever-growing exodus toward Đà Nẵng. Meanwhile, the PAVN closed in on Đà Nẵng amid the chaos caused by Thiệu's confused leadership.Willbanks, pp. 247-50. Within a few days I Corps was beyond control.Dougan and Fulghum, p. 74. The South Vietnamese tried to evacuate from the other urban enclaves into Đà Nẵng, but the 1st Division collapsed after its commander, Brigadier General Nguyễn Văn Diệm, angered by Thiệu's abandonment, told his men, \\"We've been betrayed ... It is now sauve qui peut (every man for himself) ... [S]ee you in Đà Nẵng.\\"Hosmer, Kellen and Jenkins, p. 109. The overland march, pummeled by PAVN artillery the entire way, degenerated into chaos as the 1st Division descended into anarchy as it moved toward Đà Nẵng. The remainder of the force deserted or began looting. Only a minority survived and some disillusioned officers committed suicide.Dougan and Fulghum, p. 73.Willbanks, pp. 250-51. As anarchy and looting enveloped Đà Nẵng, and a defense of the city becoming impossible, Trưởng requested permission to evacuate by sea, but Thiệu, baffled, refused to make a decision.Willbanks, pp. 252-53. When his communications with Saigon were sundered by PAVN shelling, Trưởng ordered a naval withdrawal, as Thiệu was not making a decision either way.Dougan and Fulghum, pp. 80-81. With no support or leadership from Thiệu, the evacuation turned into a costly debacle, as the PAVN pounded the city with artillery, killing thousands of people. Many drowned while jostling for room on the boats; with no logistical support from Saigon, those vessels sent were far too few for the millions of would-be evacuees. Only around 16,000 soldiers were pulled out,Dougan and Fulghum, p. 83. and of the almost two million civilians that packed Đà Nẵng, a little more than 50,000 were evacuated. As a result, 70,000 troops were taken prisoner,Willbanks, p. 253. along with around 100 aircraft.Willbanks, p. 255.Momyer, p. 76. Trưởng and his officers swam to a boat in the sea and evacuated to Saigon.Willbanks, p. 251.Dougan and Fulghum, pp. 74-80. In quick succession the remaining cities along the coastline collapsed and half the country had fallen in two weeks.Isaacs, p. 380.Willbanks, pp. 254-55. Upon arriving in Saigon, Trưởng was reportedly hospitalized for a nervous breakdown as a result of the collapse in I Corps. An American officer who had worked closely with him heard of Trưởng's plight, and arranged for his family to leave on an American ship amid the chaos of the fall of Saigon and the PAVN takeover of South Vietnam. Truong fled Vietnam with former Vice President Nguyễn Cao Kỳ by helicopter on the morning of 30 April 1975, the day of the fall of Saigon. Life in the United States Trưởng's family was initially broken up amid the confusion. His wife and eldest son ended up in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, while his two daughters and second son fled Saigon with a US State Department employee to Seattle. Trưởng's youngest son, aged four, ended up at Camp Pendleton, California; the toddler did not speak English and was not identified for a few weeks. After his family was fully accounted for, Trưởng relocated with them to Falls Church, Virginia. In 1983, he became an American citizen and moved to Springfield, Virginia. He studied computer programming at Northern Virginia Community College and worked as a computer analyst for the Association of American Railroads for a decade until he retired in 1994.Hung, p. 361. Trưởng wrote several military history works commissioned by the United States Army Center of Military History, as part of its Indochina Monographs series. These were The Easter Offensive of 1972 (1979), RVNAF and US Operational Cooperation and Coordination (1980) and Territorial Forces (1981). Death Trưởng died of cancer on 22 January 2007, at the Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia. At the time of his death, Trưởng was survived by his wife, three sons, two daughters, twelve grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. After his death, the Virginia House of Representatives and Senate passed a joint resolution \\"Celebrating the Life of Ngo Quang Truong\\". Assessment Trưởng was widely regarded as South Vietnam's finest officer, and the US officers that worked with him generally rated him to be superior to most American commanders. He was also renowned for his integrity and his uninvolvement in corruption, favoritism or political cronyism, as well as his empathy and solidarity with his soldiers. William Westmoreland, the US commander in Vietnam from 1964–68, said that Trưởng \\"would rate high on any list of capable South Vietnamese leaders ... [other U.S. commanders] so admired Trưởng that they would trust him to command an American division.\\"William C. Westmoreland, A Soldier Reports. New York: Doubleday, 1976, pp. 303, 488. His successor Creighton Abrams, who oversaw the American war effort until 1972, said that Trưởng \\"was capable of commanding an American division\\". Lieutenant General Robert E. Cushman Jr., and his main subordinate, Lieutenant General Richard G. Stilwell, who operated alongside Trưởng in I Corps in the 1960s said that because of Trưởng's efforts, the ARVN 1st Division was \\"equal to any American unit\\". General Bruce Palmer Jr. said that Trưởng was \\"probably the best field commander in South Vietnam.\\" In 1966, Trưởng's American adviser wrote to General Harold K. Johnson, describing the Vietnamese officer as \\"dedicated, humble, imaginative and tactically sound.\\"Tucker, pp. 293–94. General Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded US forces during the Gulf War against Iraq in 1991, served as Trưởng's adviser in the 1960s when he was deployed to South Vietnam as a major during a campaign at Ia Drang. He wrote in his autobiography It Doesn't Take A Hero, that Trưởng \\"did not look like my idea of a military genius: only five feet seven ... very skinny, with hunched shoulders and a head that seemed too big for his body ... His face was pinched and intense ... and there was always a cigarette hanging from his lips. Yet he was revered by his officers and troops--and feared by those North Vietnamese commanders who knew of his ability.\\" Schwarzkopf said that Trưởng was \\"the most brilliant tactical commander I'd ever known\\" and that \\"by visualizing the terrain and drawing on his experience fighting the enemy for fifteen years, Truong showed an uncanny ability to predict what they were going to do\\". Lieutenant Colonel James H. Willbanks, who served in Vietnam and was a professor of military history at the United States Army Command and General Staff College, said of Trưởng: Unlike some South Vietnamese generals who had grown rich as they ascended the ranks, Trưởng was regarded as being completely incorruptible and lived a \\"spartan and ascetic\\" life. According to Lieutenant General Cushman, Trưởng did not own a suit, and by the time he was appointed to command IV Corps, his wife tended to pigs, which were kept behind his basic living quarters in the headquarters at Cần Thơ. Cushman added that Trưởng was always looking for means to raise his soldiers' material and family lives. Trưởng did not tolerate favoritism. He once received a request to transfer his nephew from the front line to a desk job; he refused and the nephew later was killed in action. General Bruce Palmer Jr., said Trưởng \\"deserved a better fate\\" than the mauling of his soldiers amid Thiệu's confused orders and the collapse of South Vietnam.

Cornell Page 77 The Medinan Surahs occur mostly at the beginning and in the middle of the Qur'an (but are said to be the last revealed suras chronologically), and typically have more and longer ayat (verses). Due to the new circumstances of the early Muslim community in Medina, these surahs more often deal with details of moral principles, legislation, warfare (as in Surah 2, al-Baqara), and principles for constituting and ordering the community.

He is best known as one of the guitarists for the 1990s visual kei rock band Malice Mizer. After they went on indefinite hiatus in 2001, he formed the industrial rock duo Eve of Destiny and also started a solo career. Közi is currently in the bands Dalle, XA-VAT, ZIZ and Vamquet, while occasionally performing solo shows. During his time in Malice Mizer, Közi often assumed the role of a pierrot doll, dressing in clown-like costumes with large ruffs, always in shades of red, his favorite color. In music videos and on-stage he would often make movements reminiscent of a marionette. Közi has continued this visual style to some extent, but his contemporary stage costumes are more gothic. His work on the Izayoi no Tsuki project was reminiscent of carnival music, and artwork for his projects usually follow a dramatic, theatrical theme. Very few details about his private life are known. Biography Early life Közi first learned to play bass guitar because everyone else wanted to play guitar. But after seeing guitarist Seiji Watanabe play songs by Los Angeles heavy metal bands like Mötley Crüe and Ratt, he began dabbling in guitar and wanted to form his own band. He performed bass, and occasionally vocals due to revolving lineups, in many cover bands around his hometown in Niigata. He started playing guitar when he moved to Tokyo at eighteen years of age. Career Közi's career began in the mid 1980s in the underground band Girl and, later, as a member of Beyond The Reinsight. Information about both of these bands, however, is very scarce. In 1991, he joined with Mana and released two demo tapes. Közi and Mana left Matenrou after deciding they both had similar ideas about creating music, they formed Malice Mizer in 1992. After Malice Mizer disbanded in 2001, Közi joined Haruhiko Ash (from The Zolge) and created Eve of Destiny, an industrial rock band that toured outside Japan several times. In 2002, Közi collaborated with Japanese author Minako, to provide the soundtrack, Izayoi no Tsuki, for her book of the same name. He then performed a special singing event, which cemented the fact that he was following a solo career. Közi's first solo release was the two-disc, double-single package, \\"Khaos/Kinema\\", released on November 1, 2003. On March 11, 2004, he released his debut album, Catharsis. Közi's second single, \\"Memento\\", was released on December 1, 2004. The song is dedicated to deceased Malice Mizer drummer Kami and was written by Malice Mizer bassist Yu~ki. On May 17, 2006, Közi released his second album, Loki N' Roll. Former Deadman frontman Mako released a photo book called Buried Alive by Words on May 29, 2008, which came with a CD of a song called \\"Buried with the Light\\" that features Közi on guitar and bass. On September 22, 2008, Közi joined the punk rock band Dalle, which consisted of Satoshi on vocals, Atsushi Hatta (Deep) on bass, Fuchi on drums and of course Közi on guitar. The band played its first live on October 18 at Shinjuku Marz during the Tokyo Dark Castle ~ Halloween Special event, which also featured Auto-Mod and Aural Vampire. However, due to a five year hiatus and member changes, they did not have their first release until 2015. The group now consists of Közi, Atsushi, vocalist Ryo (Hollowgram) and Rieu on keyboards. Following numerous singles, Dalle released their first album, Ambivalence to Violenta, at the end of 2017. Közi (left) performing at Deep Sanctuary V in 2016. On December 27, 2008, Közi played on stage with, his former Malice Mizer bandmate Mana's solo project, Moi dix Mois for a session gig at their Dis Inferno Vol.VI ~Last Year Party~ event. In 2009 he went on a short coupling tour with Moi dix Mois called Deep Sanctuary, on July 17 in Osaka and the 19th in Tokyo. A year later in July 2010, Közi went on another tour with Moi dix Mois, titled Deep Sanctuary II. This tour had six shows, but the gig at Akasaka Blitz on the 17th was special, as Malice Mizer bassist Yu~ki, was a special guest. This was the first time in nine years that the three remaining original members played together. The trio have performed together at the event several times since. Around June 2010, Közi started to perform with a band called My Horror Revue. He also formed the band , with Shuji Ishii (Cali Gari, Goatbed) on vocals, Takao Koma (Goatbed) on drums, Sadie Pink Galaxy (Speecies) on rhythm guitar and Közi on lead guitar. They held their first performance on November 16, 2010 and released their first self-titled single on December 2. They released their debut album Tsuya°C on March 26, 2011 in two limited editions, one with a live DVD, the other with a remix CD, and a regular edition. Following a hiatus that began in 2013, XA-VAT resumed activities in 2018 and released the mini-album K-I-S. Közi performed in Paris at Porte de Versailles on April 9 and 10, 2011, with guest Miyu from Royal Cabaret. He planned to go to Moscow with The Candy Spooky Theater and Velvet Eden for a Halloween concert, however, it was moved and took place in Japan. In 2012 he formed the band , composed of his backing band from his solo career; with himself as vocalist and guitarist, bassist Sugiya (Moi dix Mois), guitarist Jiro (Bioactive), keyboardist Yugami (Yugami Hakase) and drummer Chargeeeeee... (Omega Dripp). Their first album, Gift, was released on May 29 and a collaborative EP with Ken Morioka followed on December 28. ZIZ released their second album, Neighboring Chaosmos, on December 12, 2014. In 2016, he formed the trio Vamquet with Sadie Pink Galaxy and Kai (Art Marju Duchain). They released their first album on November 23.

Early life and education The oldest son of John Lyon-Dalberg-Acton and Daphne Strutt, daughter of Robert Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh, he was educated at St George's College in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) and at Trinity College, Oxford, from which he emerged with a Bachelor of Arts in 1963 (later, he would receive a Master of Arts from the same institution). Career He served a term as director of Coutts & Co before being admitted to Inner Temple in 1976 and practising law for about four years. He then served as a Senior Law Officer of the Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs of Zimbabwe from 1981 until 1985. He became the 4th Baron Acton, as well as 11th Baronet of Aldenham in 1989, upon his father's death. He lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, which he notably supported. However, on 17 April 2000, he was created a life peer as Baron Acton of Bridgnorth, of Aldenham in the County of Shropshire, enabling him to return to the House.Profile at peerage.com website Lord Acton sat on the Labour benches and served on the Constitution Committee and on the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills. Personal life From 1965 to 1973, Acton was married to Hilary Cookson, with whom he had a son, Johnny. After having been a widower for a year, he married Judith Todd, the daughter of Sir Garfield Todd, former Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. The marriage ended in 1984. In 1988, Acton married his third wife, Patricia Nassif, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law in Iowa City, Iowa. He divided his time between London and Cedar Rapids in Iowa. The couple remained married until his death. Lord Acton was succeeded by his son from his first marriage and only child John Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 5th Baron Acton.

Retrieved 1/30/20 company based in Omaha, Nebraska founded in 1884. It ranked 307th place in Fortune 500 for United States. Privately held, it is one of the largest construction and engineering organizations in North America. History The company was founded in 1884 as Kiewit Brothers Masonry Contractors by Peter and Andrew Kiewit, who were of Dutch descent. Their father, John Kiewit, emigrated from The Hague in 1857, where he learned the trade of brickmaking. John Kiewit established a brickyard in Omaha, Nebraska where his sons worked and learned the skills for their masonry business. Early projects included the seven-story Lincoln Hotel in Lincoln as stone masons and the Bekins warehouse as general contractor. The original brothers dissolved their partnership in 1904 and the founding Peter Kiewit would continue as a sole proprietorship. In 1912, two of his sons, Ralph and George Kiewit would join their father as partners in the firm. When the founding Peter Kiewit died in 1914, his son Ralph led the company. George and Ralph Kiewit would later leave the company. The founder's youngest son, also named Peter Kiewit, joined the firm in 1919. He led the firm from 1924 until his death in 1979. This is the Peter Kiewit known for building one of the largest construction companies in the world. He was also very active in the Omaha area, including leadership of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben. Notable projects in the 1920s by the firm, now known by Peter Kiewit Sons, included the Livestock Exchange Building (1926), the Burlington railroad depot (Lincoln), the Nebraska State Capitol Tower (1927), Joslyn Art Museum (1928), and Union Station (1929). In 1931, Peter Kiewit incorporated the company as Peter Kiewit Sons’ Co. The firm would begin building transportation projects during the Great Depression. Walter Scott, was also a key figure in the growth of Kiewit. Scott was initially hired to work on the tower project at the Nebraska State Capitol and spent the remainder of his career at Kiewit becoming chief engineer. His son would not only work for Kiewit, but also rise to the position of CEO. Recent projects have included several bridge retrofittings in the San Francisco Bay Area, Interstate H-3 project in Hawaii, rebuilding the spillway at Oroville Dam, and building the world's largest geodesic dome at Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha.\\"Henry Doorly Zoo Desert Dome\\" , Kiewit Corporation.

In 1979, he was elected president. When Peter Kiewit died later that same year, Scott was selected to succeed him as chairman. Expansions In 1963, Peter Kiewit bought the Omaha World-Herald to keep it locally owned. Under the terms of his will, the employees bought the paper in 1979. Starting in 1985 (Kiewit built MFS in the early 1990s; Level 3 was built in the 1997 to 1999 circa), Kiewit also constructed a nationwide fiber optic network. This network was later spun off as Level 3 Communications, which became the formal successor corporation to the original Peter Kiewit Sons'.

Robert C. Gunderson coined the term; synonyms include implex and the German Ahnenschwund (loosely translated: \\"loss of lineage\\").  Overview  Without pedigree collapse, a person's ancestor tree is a binary tree, formed by the person, the parents (2), the grandparents (4), great-grandparents (8), and so on. However, the number of individuals in such a tree grows exponentially and will eventually become impossibly high. For example, a single individual alive today would, over 30 generations going back to the High Middle Ages, have 230 or roughly a billion ancestors, more than the total world population at the time. This paradox is explained by shared ancestors, referred to as pedigree collapse. Instead of consisting of all different individuals, a tree may have multiple places occupied by a single individual. This typically happens when the parents of an ancestor are related to each other (sometimes unbeknownst to themselves). For example, the offspring of two first cousins has at most only six great-grandparents instead of the normal eight. This reduction in the number of ancestors is pedigree collapse. It collapses the ancestor tree into a directed acyclic graph. In some cultures, cousins and other relations were permitted, encouraged, or required to marry. This may have been to keep kin bonds, wealth and property within a family (endogamy) or simply because there was a limited number of potential marriage partners available. Among royalty, the frequent requirement to marry only other royals resulted in a reduced gene pool in which most individuals were the result of extensive pedigree collapse. Alfonso XII of Spain, for example, had only four great-grandparents instead of the usual eight. Furthermore, two of these great-grandparents, Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma, who were first cousins, were parents of another twice great-grandmother, Maria Isabella of Spain. Charles IV was also the brother of another twice great-grandparent, Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies; they were both sons of Charles III of Spain and Maria Amalia of Saxony. More generally, in many cultures intermarriage may frequently occur within a small village, limiting the available gene pool. Ancestry The House of Habsburg gives a well-documented example of pedigree collapse. In the case of Charles II, the last Habsburg King of Spain, there were three uncle- niece marriages among the seven unions of his immediate ancestry (i.e. parents, grandparents and great-grandparents). His father and two of his great-grandfathers married their nieces. His paternal grandparents were first cousins once removed, but they comprised two of the seven marriages because they were also parents to his maternal grandmother. His maternal grandparents' marriage and the final marriage of great-grandparents was between first cousins. The maximum pedigree collapse of 50% within a single generation is caused by procreation between full siblings; such children have only two different grandparents instead of the usual four. If two half-siblings procreate, their children have three grandparents instead of four (25%). If a child and parent were to procreate, their offspring would have four grandparents; so, procreation between parents and children would result in less pedigree collapse than procreation between full siblings – although one of the grandparents would also be a parent and therefore introduce no additional genes. If a person procreates with a full sibling of one of their parents (as with the uncle-niece marriages mentioned above), the offspring have four different persons as grandparents, and eight great-grandparents, but again some of these contribute no additional genes (see Inbreeding). Small, isolated populations such as those of remote islands represent extreme examples of pedigree collapse, but the common historical tendency to marry those within walking distance, due to the relative immobility of the population before modern transport, meant that most marriage partners were at least distantly related. Even in America around the 19th century, the tendency of immigrants to marry among their ethnic, language or cultural group produced many cousin marriages. If one considers as a function of time the number of a given individual's ancestors who were alive at time , it is likely that for most individuals this function has a maximum at around 1200 AD. It was suggested in 1985 that everyone on Earth is at most 50th cousin to everyone else, based on a relatively random mating model. Simulations published in 2004 which take into account the geographical separations and less random patterns of mating in real life suggest that some populations are separated by up to a few thousand years, with a most recent common ancestor perhaps 76 generations back, though some highly remote populations may have been isolated for somewhat longer.

Autocar has been published weekly throughout its life with only strikes in the 1970s interrupting its frequency. The magazine's name was changed from The Autocar to Autocar at the start of 1962. In 1988 Autocar absorbed the rival magazine Motor, with which it had done battle on the newsstands since 1903. From the 7 September 1988 issue the magazine became Autocar & Motor. It reverted to Autocar for the 21 September 1994 issue. The magazine has scored many firsts in its history including the first full road tests and independent performance tests of the Jaguar XJ220, McLaren F1, and the Porsche 911 GT1. It was also the first magazine to produce independently recorded performance figures for the Bugatti Veyron, which were published in the 31 May 2006 issue.

It has been in use in the process industries in chemical plants and oil refineries since the 1980s. In recent years it has also been used in power system balancing modelsMichèle Arnold, Göran Andersson. \\"Model Predictive Control of energy storage including uncertain forecasts\\" https://www.pscc- central.org/uploads/tx_ethpublications/fp292.pdf and in power electronicsTobias Geyer: Model predictive control of high power converters and industrial drives, Wiley, London, , Nov. 2016.. Model predictive controllers rely on dynamic models of the process, most often linear empirical models obtained by system identification. The main advantage of MPC is the fact that it allows the current timeslot to be optimized, while keeping future timeslots in account. This is achieved by optimizing a finite time-horizon, but only implementing the current timeslot and then optimizing again, repeatedly, thus differing from Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Also MPC has the ability to anticipate future events and can take control actions accordingly. PID controllers do not have this predictive ability. MPC is nearly universally implemented as a digital control, although there is research into achieving faster response times with specially designed analog circuitry. Generalized predictive control (GPC) and dynamic matrix control (DMC) are classical examples of MPC.  Overview  The models used in MPC are generally intended to represent the behavior of complex dynamical systems. The additional complexity of the MPC control algorithm is not generally needed to provide adequate control of simple systems, which are often controlled well by generic PID controllers. Common dynamic characteristics that are difficult for PID controllers include large time delays and high-order dynamics. MPC models predict the change in the dependent variables of the modeled system that will be caused by changes in the independent variables. In a chemical process, independent variables that can be adjusted by the controller are often either the setpoints of regulatory PID controllers (pressure, flow, temperature, etc.) or the final control element (valves, dampers, etc.). Independent variables that cannot be adjusted by the controller are used as disturbances. Dependent variables in these processes are other measurements that represent either control objectives or process constraints. MPC uses the current plant measurements, the current dynamic state of the process, the MPC models, and the process variable targets and limits to calculate future changes in the dependent variables. These changes are calculated to hold the dependent variables close to target while honoring constraints on both independent and dependent variables. The MPC typically sends out only the first change in each independent variable to be implemented, and repeats the calculation when the next change is required. While many real processes are not linear, they can often be considered to be approximately linear over a small operating range. Linear MPC approaches are used in the majority of applications with the feedback mechanism of the MPC compensating for prediction errors due to structural mismatch between the model and the process. In model predictive controllers that consist only of linear models, the superposition principle of linear algebra enables the effect of changes in multiple independent variables to be added together to predict the response of the dependent variables. This simplifies the control problem to a series of direct matrix algebra calculations that are fast and robust. When linear models are not sufficiently accurate to represent the real process nonlinearities, several approaches can be used. In some cases, the process variables can be transformed before and/or after the linear MPC model to reduce the nonlinearity. The process can be controlled with nonlinear MPC that uses a nonlinear model directly in the control application. The nonlinear model may be in the form of an empirical data fit (e.g. artificial neural networks) or a high-fidelity dynamic model based on fundamental mass and energy balances. The nonlinear model may be linearized to derive a Kalman filter or specify a model for linear MPC. An algorithmic study by El-Gherwi, Budman, and El Kamel shows that utilizing a dual-mode approach can provide significant reduction in online computations while maintaining comparative performance to a non-altered implementation. The proposed algorithm solves N convex optimization problems in parallel based on exchange of information among controllers. Theory behind MPC A discrete MPC scheme. MPC is based on iterative, finite-horizon optimization of a plant model. At time t the current plant state is sampled and a cost minimizing control strategy is computed (via a numerical minimization algorithm) for a relatively short time horizon in the future: [t,t+T]. Specifically, an online or on-the-fly calculation is used to explore state trajectories that emanate from the current state and find (via the solution of Euler–Lagrange equations) a cost-minimizing control strategy until time t+T. Only the first step of the control strategy is implemented, then the plant state is sampled again and the calculations are repeated starting from the new current state, yielding a new control and new predicted state path. The prediction horizon keeps being shifted forward and for this reason MPC is also called receding horizon control. Although this approach is not optimal, in practice it has given very good results. Much academic research has been done to find fast methods of solution of Euler–Lagrange type equations, to understand the global stability properties of MPC's local optimization, and in general to improve the MPC method. Michael Nikolaou, Model predictive controllers: A critical synthesis of theory and industrial needs, Advances in Chemical Engineering, Academic Press, 2001, Volume 26, Pages 131-204  Principles of MPC  Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a multivariable control algorithm that uses: * an internal dynamic model of the process * a cost function J over the receding horizon * an optimization algorithm minimizing the cost function J using the control input u An example of a quadratic cost function for optimization is given by: :J=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_{x_i} (r_i-x_i)^2 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_{u_i} {\\\\Delta u_i}^2 without violating constraints (low/high limits) with :x_i: ith controlled variable (e.g. measured temperature) :r_i: ith reference variable (e.g. required temperature) :u_i: ith manipulated variable (e.g. control valve) :w_{x_i}: weighting coefficient reflecting the relative importance of x_i :w_{u_i}: weighting coefficient penalizing relative big changes in u_i etc. Nonlinear MPC Nonlinear Model Predictive Control, or NMPC, is a variant of model predictive control (MPC) that is characterized by the use of nonlinear system models in the prediction. As in linear MPC, NMPC requires the iterative solution of optimal control problems on a finite prediction horizon. While these problems are convex in linear MPC, in nonlinear MPC they are not necessarily convex anymore. This poses challenges for both NMPC stability theory and numerical solution.An excellent overview of the state of the art (in 2008) is given in the proceedings of the two large international workshops on NMPC, by Zheng and Allgower (2000) and by Findeisen, Allgöwer, and Biegler (2006). The numerical solution of the NMPC optimal control problems is typically based on direct optimal control methods using Newton-type optimization schemes, in one of the variants: direct single shooting, direct multiple shooting methods, or direct collocation. NMPC algorithms typically exploit the fact that consecutive optimal control problems are similar to each other. This allows to initialize the Newton-type solution procedure efficiently by a suitably shifted guess from the previously computed optimal solution, saving considerable amounts of computation time. The similarity of subsequent problems is even further exploited by path following algorithms (or \\"real-time iterations\\") that never attempt to iterate any optimization problem to convergence, but instead only take a few iterations towards the solution of the most current NMPC problem, before proceeding to the next one, which is suitably initialized; see, e.g., . While NMPC applications have in the past been mostly used in the process and chemical industries with comparatively slow sampling rates, NMPC is being increasingly applied, with advancements in controller hardware and computational algorithms, e.g., preconditioning, to applications with high sampling rates, e.g., in the automotive industry, or even when the states are distributed in space (Distributed parameter systems). As an application in aerospace, recently, NMPC has been used to track optimal terrain-following/avoidance trajectories in real-time.  Explicit MPC  Explicit MPC (eMPC) allows fast evaluation of the control law for some systems, in stark contrast to the online MPC. Explicit MPC is based on the parametric programming technique, where the solution to the MPC control problem formulated as optimization problem is pre-computed offline. This offline solution, i.e., the control law, is often in the form of a piecewise affine function (PWA), hence the eMPC controller stores the coefficients of the PWA for each a subset (control region) of the state space, where the PWA is constant, as well as coefficients of some parametric representations of all the regions. Every region turns out to geometrically be a convex polytope for linear MPC, commonly parameterized by coefficients for its faces, requiring quantization accuracy analysis. Obtaining the optimal control action is then reduced to first determining the region containing the current state and second a mere evaluation of PWA using the PWA coefficients stored for all regions. If the total number of the regions is small, the implementation of the eMPC does not require significant computational resources (compared to the online MPC) and is uniquely suited to control systems with fast dynamics. A serious drawback of eMPC is exponential growth of the total number of the control regions with respect to some key parameters of the controlled system, e.g., the number of states, thus dramatically increasing controller memory requirements and making the first step of PWA evaluation, i.e. searching for the current control region, computationally expensive.  Robust MPC  Robust variants of Model Predictive Control (MPC) are able to account for set bounded disturbance while still ensuring state constraints are met. There are three main approaches to robust MPC: * Min-max MPC. In this formulation, the optimization is performed with respect to all possible evolutions of the disturbance. This is the optimal solution to linear robust control problems, however it carries a high computational cost. * Constraint Tightening MPC. Here the state constraints are enlarged by a given margin so that a trajectory can be guaranteed to be found under any evolution of disturbance. * Tube MPC. This uses an independent nominal model of the system, and uses a feedback controller to ensure the actual state converges to the nominal state. The amount of separation required from the state constraints is determined by the robust positively invariant (RPI) set, which is the set of all possible state deviations that may be introduced by disturbance with the feedback controller. * Multi-stage MPC. This uses a scenario-tree formulation by approximating the uncertainty space with a set of samples and the approach is non-conservative because it takes into account that the measurement information is available at every time stages in the prediction and the decisions at every stage can be different and can act as recourse to counteract the effects of uncertainties. The drawback of the approach however is that the size of the problem grows exponentially with the number of uncertainties and the prediction horizon. Commercially available MPC software Commercial MPC packages are available and typically contain tools for model identification and analysis, controller design and tuning, as well as controller performance evaluation. A survey of commercially available packages has been provided by S.J. Qin and T.A. Badgwell in Control Engineering Practice 11 (2003) 733–764.  MPC vs. LQR  The main differences between MPC and LQR are that LQR optimizes in a fixed time window (horizon) whereas MPC optimizes in a receding time window, and that a new solution is computed often whereas LQR uses the single (optimal) solution for the whole time horizon. Therefore, MPC typically solves the optimization problem in smaller time windows than the whole horizon and hence may obtain a suboptimal solution. However because MPC makes no assumptions about linearity, it can handle hard constraints as well as migration of a nonlinear system away from its linearized operating point, both of which are downsides of LQR.

As a child he lived in Shanghai. He later emigrated with his ethnic Vietnamese parents to Saigon when the Chinese Communist Party took over China in 1949.My Life He attended Aurore University in Shanghai, China. In 1950, he attended the Vietnamese Military Academy, graduating second in his class in 1951. In 1963, he graduated from Command and General Staff College, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. His assignments included G3/Joint General Staff, G3/1st Corps, Chief of Staff of 1st Division, Chief of Staff of I Corps, Chief of Staff of II Corps, Commander of 22nd Division, Chief of Staff of II Corps, Commander of 5th Division, Deputy Commander of I Corps, Minister of Anti- Corruption under Vice-President Trần Văn Hương, Deputy Commander of III Corps, Commander of Forward HQ III Corps, and MG Deputy Commander of III Corps. He was found dead on 8 April 1975 at III Corps Headquarters, Biên Hòa, and theories that he had been assassinated emerged. Two days later, he was posthumously promoted to lieutenant general. Military operations Quyết Thắng 202 (Đỗ Xá), 1964 Hiếu, II Corps Chief of Staff, designed and executed Operation Quyết Thắng (Sure Win) 202Đỗ Xá Campaign aiming directly at the Viet Cong (VC) stronghold at Đỗ Xá (), deep in the Annamite Mountains, at the junction of Kon Tum, Quảng Ngãi and Quảng Tin provinces, from 27 April to 27 May 1964. Units of 50th Regiment, 25th Division participated under the command of Major Phan Trong Trinh, four Ranger battalions under the command of Major Son Thuong and one Airborne battalion under the command of Captain Ngô Quang Trưởng. Troops were ferried to two landing zones by three helicopters squadrons: USMC HMM-364 Squadron, 117th and 119th squadron of US Army 52nd Aviation Battalion. The VC attacked the helicopters at the landing zones during the two first days, and then vanished into the mountains, avoiding contacts with the invading troops. Operation Đỗ Xá achieved the following results: a communication network of the VC command composed of five stations was destroyed, one of which was used to communicate with North Vietnam, and the other four to link with provincial VC units; the VC lost 62 killed, 17 captured, two 0.51 caliber machine guns, one 0.30 caliber machine gun, 69 individual weapons, and a large quantity of mines and grenades, engineer equipment, explosives, medicine, and documents; in addition, 185 structures, 17 tons of food and of crops were destroyed.Colonel Trinh Tieu (1995), G2/23ID, Operation Eagles Claw 800 Thần Phong II In 1965, the VC attacked all over the Central Highlands in the II Military Region. In early July 1965, three People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) regiments (including 32nd and possibly the 33rd) completely isolated the Central Highlands. ARVN units could not use National Routes 1, 11, 14, 19 and 21, and all resupplies to the Highlands had to be performed by air. On 8 July 1965 Hiếu, II Corps Chief of Staff, was entrusted with the design and execution of a plan to reopen National Route 19.Road-Clearing Operation Contrary to the general practice of a road-clearing operation by concentrating troops to progressively destroy the ambushes set up by the enemy along the highway, from D-6 to D+2, Hiếu ordered the 22nd Division and the 3rd Armored Squadron to attack from Qui Nhơn to Tuy Hòa along National Route 1; the 2nd Airborne Task Force together with Regional Forces and Civilian Irregulars Defense Group Forces to retake Lê Thành District; VNMC Alpha Task Force and the 42nd Regiment to attack from Pleiku up north to Đak Sut on National Route 14; and the 20th Engineer Group to attack from Phú Bổn to Tuy Hòa to repair Interprovincial Route 7. After sowing confusion among the enemy, Colonel Hiếu \\"press[ed] the Viet Cong from three directions with movements launched from Pleiku and Qui Nhơn and a vertical envelopment from north of An Khê. These maneuvers were executed by a task force of the Pleiku sector departing from Pleiku, two task forces of the 22nd Infantry Division departing from Qui Nhơn, and a task force of two airborne battalions heliborne into northern An Khê and attacking south with Task Force Alpha of the marines brigade conducting the linkup.\\" These actions resulted in the free flow of cargo convoys during 5 days from D+3 to D+7, \\"allowing an initial buildup of 5,365 tons of supplies in Pleiku\\". Later, operational units withdrew to their camps during D+8 and D+9. As a result of Operation Thần Phong, \\"the convoys transfused new life into the Highlands. Along with an immediate drop of 25 to 30 percent in the price of food and commodities, the population regained their feelings of security, confidence, and hope. Schoolboys in Pleiku voluntarily helped the troops in unloading the cargoes, and people who had started to evacuate now returned to their homesteads.\\" Major General Vinh Loc, Road Clearing Operation, Military Review, April 1966 Pleime, 1965 After the unsuccessful attempt to overcome the Đức Cơ Special Forces camp in August 1965, General Võ Nguyên Giáp launched the Winter Spring Campaign aiming at cutting South Vietnam in two, from Pleiku in the Central Highlands to Qui Nhơn in the coastal regions. The plan of General Chu Huy Man, VC Field Commander was as following:The Truth about the Pleime Battle # 33rd NVA Regiment feigns to attack Plei Me Camp to entice II Corps to dispatch relief column from Pleiku; # 32nd NVA Regiment sets an ambush to destroy the relief column (an easy target without artillery support nearby); # after destroying the relief column, 32nd NVA Regiment joins up with 33rd NVA Regiment in overcoming Plei Me Camp; # in the meantime, with the defense of Pleiku weakened by the troops sent out to rescue Plei Me, 66th NVA Regiment initiates a preliminary attack against II Corps HQ, awaiting 32nd and 33rd Regiments to overcome Plei Me and to join forces to attack and occupy Pleiku. Hiếu consulted with the US 1st Cavalry Division and came up with the following plan: # II Corps feigns biting the bait by reinforcing Plei Me with a unit of ARVN Airborne Rangers and dispatches a task force from Pleiku to relieve Plei Me; # 1st Cavalry Division lends a brigade to reinforce the defense of Pleiku and heli-lifts artillery batteries to several locations near the ambush site to support the relief column when under attacked. This plan neutralized the 66th NVA Regiment, which remained inactive in the Chư Prông area, destroyed the 33rd NVA Regiment at the ambush site, and the 32nd NVA Regiment abandoned the siege of Plei Me and withdrew into the surrounding jungle.Intelligence Aspects of Pleime/Chupong Campaign, US Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, Assistant Chief of Staff, J2 Liên Kết 66 42nd Regiment, 22nd Division, reinforced by 3rd Airborne Task Force established a blocking position on the mountain side, joined force with an armored squadron of M113s in sweeping the enemy from National Route 1 into the mountains at Phù Cũ Pass in Bình Định Province. Infantrymen following the M113s launched fierce assaults, after an initial salvo of artillery. Airborne Task Force Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Khoa Nam observing the battle from the mountainside with binocular stated: \\"Colonel Hiếu conducts his troops like a seasoned 'armor officer', and combatants of 22nd Division fought as elegantly as our paratroopers.\\"Phan Nhật Nam ̣(2005), South Vietnam Did Not Lack Heroes, Speech delivered in the Book Presentation about General Nguyen Van Hieu: General Hieu took over the command of 22nd Infantry Division in June 1966, and by the end of the year (November), the newly appointed Commander scored a battle victory at Phu Cu Pass (Phu My District). At that time, we, the attached unit (3rd Airborne Task Force-Pnn) established a blockage position on the mountain side, and witnessed our friendly unit (42nd Regiment/22nd Division) joining force with the armored squadron of M113s in sweeping the enemy from National Route 1 into the mountains. The battle unfolded just like a military World War II documentary film. Infantrymen in front line formation followed M113 armored vehicles launched fierce assaults, after a salvo of artillery firing, just like Middle Age's knights charging in combat. Airborne Task Force Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Khoa Nam observed the battle from the mountain side with binocular. Although he was a man parsimonious in words, he had to utter his admiration: \\"Colonel Hieu conducts his troops like a seasoned \\"armor officer\\", and combatants of 22nd Division fought as elegantly as our paratroopers.\\" Those were sincere words from a combatant complimenting another combatant on the battlefield. Đại Bàng 800 In February 1967, Colonel Hiếu launched Operation Đại Bàng 800.Operation Eagles Claw 800 For three days prior to Vietnamese operation, units of the US 1st Cavalry Division were unsuccessful in discovering the enemy in their operational areas. Hiếu lured the enemy by dispatching a reduced regiment to set up an overnight camp in Phù Mỹ, knowing that enemy spies amongst the indigenous farmers would report the status of the operational troops. Hiếu positioned a motorized infantry battalion and an armored unit 10 kilometers away. Thinking they had an easy target, the enemy attacked the camp with a regiment belonging to 3rd NVA Division at 2:00 a.m. Alerted by the regiment's commander, Hiếu sent in the reserve forces to cut off the enemy's retreat and join forces with the defenders. After a three-hour fierce battle, the enemy reportedly left behind more than 300 dead and numerous weapons.Colonel Trinh Tieu, G2/23ID: \\"At 5:00 a.m. the Communists had to leak their wounds, disperse and withdraw into the jungle, leaving behind 300 KIA lying all over the place, numerous weapons and ammunition scattered all over the operational area.\\" Operation Eagles Claw 800 In August 1969 General Le Ngoc Trien replaced Hiếu as commander of the 22nd Division and Hiếu replaced the inept, but politically-connected General Phạm Quốc Thuần as commander of the 5th Division, however US officials had major reservations about this replacement, not regarding Hiếu as a dynamic leader. Toàn Thắng 46 From May to July 1970, the 5th Division participated in the Cambodian Campaign with Operation Total Victory 46 in the Fishhook area, north of Lộc Ninh.Operation Total Victory 46 This base area was considered to be used by the 5th NVA Division as a headquarters location and training area, and the 70th Rear Service Group which moved supplies down the Serges Jungle Highway. Elements of the 5th NVA Division were identified along with elements of the 70th Rear Service Group and its affiliated hospitals. the division's mission was to attack and destroy the 70th and 80th Rear Service Groups: one hospital and one training center. Division elements will locate and destroy or evacuate enemy foods, ammunition, weapons and medical caches in the operational area. In preparation for the operation Hiếu with his G3, the CDAT commander, and the DCAT G3 made the initial area coordination with General Casey of the 1st Cavalry Division and his G3. Upon completion of this initial coordination the Assistant Division Commander of the 5th Division, Commanding Officer of the 9th Regiment, and the DCAT G3 effected direct coordination with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. During the operation coordination was made by the 9th Regimental Commander and his DCAT Commander for the joint occupation of Fire Support Base Gonder by elements of the 9th Regiment and the 1st Cavalry Division. Operation Total Victory 46 was conducted in 5 phases. Phase I was the attack phase. Phase II, III and IV were search and destroy phases. Phase V was the withdrawal phase. In mid-1970 MACV rated General Hiếu as \\"unsatisfactory\\" and recommended his relief as commander of the 5th Division. Toàn Thắng 8/B/5 The 5th Division was notified by III Corps Headquarters on 14 October 1970, to prepare for limited combat operations in the Snuol District of Cambodia, for the purpose of destroying enemy forces, installations, and obtaining enemy information.Operation Total Victory 8/B/5 Operation Total Victory 8/B/9 was conducted from 23 October to 10 November 1970 against the PAVN 5th Division: 174 Regiment, 275 Regiment, Z27 Recon Battalion; Rear Service Group 86, C11 (medical); C1/K2 Guerrilla force, northwest of Snuol; Guerrilla force, Snuol Town Market; Guerrilla force, K'bai Trach, southwest of Snuol. Hiếu together with his G3 Staff, was in charge of planning the details of the whole operation. The operational Task Organization was composed of 3 Task Forces: TF1 (Commanded by CO, 1st ACR), TF9 (Commanded by CO, 9th Regiment) and TF333 (Commanded by CO, 3rd Ranger GP). TF333 was entrusted the protection and security of the main supply route. The Division Operation Plan was approved by III Corps on 21 October 1970. A final coordination meeting was conducted on 22 October 1970 at Lai Khê, and was attended by all commanders involved. Operation Total Victory 8/B/5 was composed of 3 phases. Phase I: movement to contact and contact in the vicinity of Snoul. Phase II: movement north of Snoul. Phase III is the withdrawal phase. Toàn Thắng TT02 (Snuol 1971) In the end of 1970, General Hiếu planned to lure the enemy with a regiment placed in Snuol in Cambodian territory, north of Lộc Ninh on National Route 13. The Communists had 3 Divisions (5th, 7th and 9th) operating in that area. III Corps was ready to commit all of its three Divisions (5th, 18th and 25th) in the event the North Vietnamese engaged one, two or all three divisions into the battlefield. General Trí the III Corps Commander died in a helicopter accident at the end of February 1971. General Minh, who replaced General Trí, did not want to follow through with the luring plan, when 8th Task Force was succeeding in attracting the enemy who gathered two Divisions (5th and 7th) around Snuol. The beleaguered troops of 8th Task Force, when neither rescue column nor B-52 bombers were in sight, were about to raise the white flag to surrender to the enemy. However, Hiếu executed his withdrawal plan in time to bring his troops back to Lộc Ninh. The troops' withdrawal was executed in three phases:The Truth of a Forgotten Battlefield # on 29 May 1971, 1/8th Battalion pierced through enemy blocking line at the northern outpost to rejoin the 8th Task Force Command Post located at Snuol market; # on 30 May 1971, 8th Task Force using 1/8th Battalion as the spear-head to pierce enemy blocking line, followed behind by 2/8th Battalion, Task Force Command Post, 1st Armored Squadron with 2/7th Battalion acting as rear cover, to withdraw from Snuol to the location defended by 3/8th Battalion, 3 kilometers Southeast of Snuol on National Route 13; # on 31 May 1971, 3/8th Battalion replaced 1/8th Battalion as the spearhead in piercing enemy blocking line, followed by 3/9th Battalion, 2/7th Battalion, Task Force Command Post, 1st Armored Squadron with 1/8th Battalion acting as rear cover, allowing 8th Task Force to reach the border on a 3 kilometer stretch and to return to Lộc Ninh. Regarded by US advisers as the worst ARVN Division commander, Hiếu's forces had been badly handled during the Snuol operation, and his troops, according to II Field Force, Vietnam commander Michael S. Davison, were close to mutiny. Pushed by both Abrams and Minh to relieve him, Thiệu finally acceded and in April 1971 brought Col. Lê Văn Hưng up from Phong Dinh Province to take over the battered Division. Unfortunately, Hưng was the one ARVN officer whose candidacy American advisers had specifically recommended against. To the despair of US advisers Hiếu was promoted to deputy commander of I Corps. Svay Riêng, 1974 In 1974, as Deputy Commander of Operations/III Corps, assistant to General Phạm Quốc Thuần, Hiếu applied Blitzkrieg (lightning war) tactics to alleviate the pressure exerted by 5th NVA Division originating from Svay Rieng Province in the Parrot's Beak area of Cambodian territory aiming at Đức Huệ base camp. Hiếu employed twenty mobile battalions to surround the Parrot's Beak area.Elephant's Foot and Angel's Wing Secondly, on April 27, he launched 49th Infantry Regiment and 7th Ranger Group through the swamp lands around Đức Huệ towards the Cambodian border, and had VNAF airplanes attack positions of 5th NVA Division units. In the meantime, he relied on two Regional Force battalions belonging to IV Corps to move from Mộc Hóa up north to establish blocking positions on the southwestern edge of the 5th NVA Division's logistical base and assembly area. On 28 April, General Hiếu launched eleven battalions into the battleground to conduct preliminary operation in preparation of the main offensive. The next morning, three armored squadrons of the III Corps Assault Task Force rushed across the Cambodian border from Gò Dầu Hạ, aiming directly at 5th NVA Division HQ. Meanwhile, a task force composing of infantry and armor of IV Corps, originating from Mộc Hóa, maneuvered across the Cambodian border into the Elephant's Foot area to threaten the retreat of 275th NVA Regiment. The three armored squadrons continued their three-pronged advance 16 kilometers deep into the Cambodia before they veered south toward Hậu Nghĩa, and helicopters dropped troops unexpectedly on enemy positions, while other ARVN units conducted rapid operations into the region between Đức Huệ and Gò Dầu Hạ. On 10 May, when the last ARVN units returned to their base camp, enemy communications and supplies networks were seriously disrupted. The Communists suffered 1,200killed, 65 prisoners, and tons of weapons captured; while, due to speed, secrecy and coordination factors of a multi-faced operation, the ARVN suffered less than 100 casualties.Samuel Lipsman and Stephen Weiss, The False Peace, page 123-124, The Vietnam Experience, Boston Publishing Company Anticorruption czar Vice President Trần Văn Hương appointed General Hiếu anticorruption czar on 10 February 1972. He occupied this position until October 1973. At that time corruption was rampant among the ARVN leadership, in the army, the administration, the police, the power authority, Air Vietnam, customs, etc. General Hiếu chose to attack first the Military Pension Fund. After a five- month investigation, he presented his findings in detail on the national television on 14 July 1972.Military Pension Fund As a result, the Defense Minister, General Nguyễn Văn Vy and seven colonels were ousted and the Military Pension Fund disbanded. Hiếu was not allowed to move on to other corruption targets. President Thiệu limited Hiếu's investigative authority and prior presidential approval was necessary to commence an investigation at the level of chief of province. These limitations disappointed General Hiếu who sought to return to the military and declared, \\"Either we correct our faults or the Communists will correct them for us.\\" Airgram, Saigon 12125, AMEMBASSY SAIGON, August 17, 1972, Subject: Pending Special Decree on Corruption Evaluation I Corps American Advisors' evaluation report in May 1968: Colonel John Hayes, ARVN 5th Infantry Division Senior Advisor's evaluation on 7 February 1970: General Trần Văn Đôn's assessment: Unanswered questions concerning his death On 8 April 1975, news came out of III Corps headquarters in Biên Hòa that General Hiếu was dead in his office. General Nguyễn Văn Toàn, III Corps Commander, was immediately suspected since he had the reputation of being corrupt, while General Hiếu was very clean, and furthermore, had held the position of anticorruption czar under Vice President Trần Văn Hương. The next day, after attending the military press conference, UPI correspondent sent out the following dispatch:General Kills Self In Saigon Dispute SAIGON (UPI) - The deputy commander of South Vietnamese troops defending the Saigon area was found shot to death Tuesday night following an argument with his superior over tactics. Military sources said he apparently committed suicide. The sources said Maj. Gen. Hiếu was found with a bullet wound in his mouth at his III Corps office at the edge of Biên Hòa airbase, northeast of Saigon.

Digitigrades include walking birds (what many assume to be bird knees are actually ankles), cats, dogs, and many other mammals, but not plantigrades or unguligrades. Digitigrades generally move more quickly and quietly than other animals. There are anatomical differences between the limbs of plantigrades, like humans, and both unguligrade and digitigrade limbs. Digitigrade and unguligrade animals have relatively long carpals and tarsals, and the bones which would correspond to the human ankle are thus set much higher in the limb than in a human. In a digitigrade animal, this effectively lengthens the foot, so much so that what are often thought of as a digitigrade animal's \\"hands\\" and \\"feet\\" correspond only to what would be the bones of the human finger or toe. Humans usually walk with the soles of their feet on the ground, in plantigrade locomotion. In contrast, digitigrade animals walk on their distal and intermediate phalanges. Digitigrade locomotion is responsible for the distinctive hooked shape of dog legs. Unguligrade animals, such as horses and cattle, walk only on the distal-most tips of their digits, while in digitigrade animals, more than one segment of the digit makes contact with the ground, either directly (as in birds) or via paw-pads (as in dogs).

It is part of the University of Houston System. Its campus spans in Downtown Houston, with a satellite location in northwestern Harris County. Founded in 1974, UHD is the second-largest university in the Houston area with more than 14,000 students. The university serves students in four academic colleges. UHD offers 52 degree programs: 45 bachelors and seven masters. Awarding more than 2,400 degrees annually, the university has more than 40,000 alumni. History One Main Building (formerly Merchants and Manufacturers Building) Recognizing the need for a university presence in Downtown Houston, the Board of Regents of the University of Houston acquired the assets of South Texas Junior College on August 6, 1974 and opened the University of College () as a four-year institution under the organization and control of the University of Houston. By August 1979, it became a stand-alone university when the 66th Texas Legislature established as a separate and distinct institution in the University of Houston System. The college's first four-year degree was a Bachelor of Science degree in criminal justice and resident students attended for $4 per credit hour. The school purchased its first and only dormitory in 1981. The dormitory, formerly the Harley Hotel located at 101 Main Street and known as the University Center, remained in the university's possession until 1991 when it was demolished in favor of renovation. On April 26, 1983, the word \\"College\\" was dropped from the institution's name to become University of (UHD). During this decade when Houston was booming, UHD succeeded in having the Merchants and Manufacturers Building named to the National Register of Historic Places, degree programs continued to grow, and UHD's first Red Rose Ball became a signature fundraiser. Tuition increased in 1984 to $12 per credit hour. By fall 1988, more than 8,300 students were enrolled on campus. In 1992, Max Castillo came from San Antonio College to lead the university. During the 1990s, UHD focused on becoming a metropolitan university—appealing to traditional students as well as working professionals. During the early 1990s, UHD also began key partnerships with community colleges and it moved to meet greater Houston's demand for qualified teachers when it added a teacher certification program in urban education. During this time, the Weekend College Program began and a new Academic Building and the Jesse H. Jones Student Life Center opened. National Register of Historic Places in 2004 As the 1990s ended, UHD moved ahead again, earning full approval from the Texas Legislature and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to offer graduate programs; the University's first master's degree in criminal justice was approved. UHD also began offering degree programs at Lone Star College–University Center and eventually at the UH System teaching center in Cinco Ranch. UHD's expansion and growth continued as a new millennium arrived. Master's degree programs in criminal justice and teaching were added. Physical growth also continued and the Willow Street Pump Station was renovated while a new, bricked-face Commerce Street Building opened at the corner of Commerce Street and Main Street—providing a new home for the College of Public Service. As UHD grew so did the number of students participating in commencement. In 2002, UHD became the first university to award degrees in Minute Maid Park. UHD won national recognition for its wireless campus and the Bachelor of Business Administration degree program in general business became the university's first on-line degree. In November 2007, the Shea Street Building opened as the new home of the UHD's College of Business. After 38 years as an open admission institution, the Board of Regents of the UH System approved admission standards for UHD in February 2012.Rhor, Monica. \\"UH-Downtown ends open admissions.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Institutional structure The University of Houston–Downtown (UHD) is one of four separate and distinct institutions in the University of Houston System. The institution is separately accredited, offers its own academic programs and confers its own degrees, and has its own administration. UHD is a stand-alone university; it is not a branch campus of the University of Houston (UH). Although UHD and UH are both component institutions of the University of Houston System, they are separate universities. The organization and control of the University of Houston–Downtown is vested in the Board of Regents of the University of Houston System. The Board has all the rights, powers, and duties that it has with respect to the organization and control of other institutions in the System; however, UHD is maintained as a separate and distinct institution. Administration The president is the chief executive officer of the University of Houston–Downtown, and the position reports to the chancellor of the University of Houston System. The president is appointed by the chancellor and confirmed by the Board of Regents of the University of Houston System. Since April 2017, the president of the university is Dr. Juan Sánchez Muñoz.

It is also observed in other areas in regard to the abolition of serfdom or other forms of involuntary servitude. August 1 Political history of the Caribbean and Central America, 1830 The Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery throughout the British Empire (with the exceptions \\"of the Territories in the Possession of the East India Company\\", the \\"Island of Ceylon\\" and \\"the Island of Saint Helena\\"; the exceptions were eliminated in 1843), came into force the following year, on 1 August 1834. Only slaves below the age of six were freed. Enslaved people older than six years of age were redesignated as \\"apprentices\\" and required to work, 40 hours per week without pay, as part of compensation payment to their former owners. Full emancipation was finally achieved at midnight on 31 July 1838. Antigua Antigua celebrates carnival on and around the first Monday of August. Since 1834 Antigua and Barbuda have observed the end of slavery. The first Monday and Tuesday in August was observed as a bank holiday so the populace can celebrate Emancipation Day. Monday is J'ouvert, a street party that mimics the early morning emancipation. Anguilla Anguilla: In addition to commemorating emancipation, it is the first day of \\"August Week\\", the Anguillian Carnival celebrations. J'ouvert is celebrated August 1, as Carnival commences. The Bahamas The Bahamas: Celebrations are mainly concentrated in Fox Hill Village, Nassau, a former slave village whose inhabitants, according to folklore, heard about their freedom a week after everyone else on the island. The celebration known as the Bay Fest, beginning on August 1 and lasting several days, is held in the settlement of Hatchet Bay on the island of Eleuthera, and \\"Back to the Bay\\" is held in the settlement of Tarpum Bay, also on Eleuthera. Barbados Emancipation Day in Barbados is part of the annual \\"Season of Emancipation\\", which began in 2005. The Season runs from April 14 to August 23. Commemorations include: * the anniversary of Bussa's rebellion, a major slave rebellion in 1816, April 14 * National Heroes Day, April 28; * Crop Over festival, which includes May, June and the first week of August * Africa Day, May 25 * Day of National Significance, which commemorates the Labour Rebellion of 1937, July 26 * Emancipation Day, August 1 * birthday of Marcus Garvey, August 17 * International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, August 23 Emancipation Day celebrations usually feature a walk from Independence Square in Bridgetown to the Heritage Village at the Crop Over Bridgetown Market on the Spring Garden Highway. At the Heritage Village, in addition to a concert, there is a wreath-laying ceremony as a tribute to the ancestors. Traditionally, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Culture, and representatives of the Commission for Pan African Affairs are among those laying wreaths. Bermuda Bermuda celebrates its Emancipation Day on the Thursday before the first Monday in August, placing it in either July or August. British Virgin Islands British Virgin Islands: The first Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of August are celebrated as \\"August Festival\\". Canada The Slavery Abolition Act 1833 ended slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834, and thus also in Canada. However, the first colony in the British Empire to have anti-slavery legislation was Upper Canada, now Ontario. John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada (1791–1796), passed an Act Against Slavery in 1793, which ended the importation of slaves in Upper Canada and manumitted the future children of female slaves at age twenty-five. It was superseded by the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. While the date of the First August Monday holiday in Canada is historically linked to the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1834, not all of provinces commemorate the holiday as such. Ontario Every year Canadians celebrate an August vacation day on the first weekend of the month, ostensibly to reflect on the gift of responsible provincial government. In Toronto this vacation day is known as \\"Simcoe Day\\" to commemorate the first Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, John Graves Simcoe. In 2008 during the 10-year administration of Dalton McGuinty, the Province designated August 1 as \\"Emancipation Day\\" to commemorate Simcoe who in 1793 approved a piece of legislation that abolished slavery in Upper Canada (known now as Ontario). This was the first jurisdiction in the British Empire to abolish slavery. Toronto, the capital city of Ontario, also hosts the Toronto Caribbean Carnival (known as Caribana until 2006), which is held the first Saturday in August of Civic Holiday observed on the first Monday of August. Started in 1967, it has become the largest Caribbean festival in North America. It is a two-week celebration, culminating in the long weekend with the Kings and Queens Festival, \\"Caribana\\" parade and Olympic Island activities. Owen Sound has celebrated Emancipation with a picnic for 157 years, and now holds an Emancipation Festival. In 1932, the first Emancipation Day Parade was held in Windsor, Ontario and would come to be known as the 'Greatest Freedom Show on Earth.' Organized by Walter Perry, the parade and festival boasted famous guests like Martin Luther King Jr., Mary McLeod Bethune, Stevie Wonder, Benjamin Mays, Fred Shuttlesworth, Martha Reeves and The Vandellas, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Though Perry's death in 1968 had a significant influence on the end of the tradition, fears over the Detroit Riot of 1967 caused the city's councillors to deny organizers necessary permits to stage an Emancipation Day celebration. Dominica Dominica: The first Monday is celebrated as August Monday. Grenada Grenada: The first Monday in August is celebrated as \\"Emancipation Day\\" with Cultural activities. Jamaica Redemption Song by Laura Facey (2003), Emancipation Park, Kingston, Jamaica 1 August, Emancipation Day in Jamaica is a public holiday and part of a week- long cultural celebration, during which Jamaicans also celebrate Jamaican Independence Day on August 6, 1962. Both August 1 and August 6 are public holidays. Emancipation Day had stopped being observed as a nation holiday in 1962 at the time of independence. It was reinstated as a national public holiday under The Holidays (Public General) Act 1998 after a six-year campaign led by Rex Nettleford, among others. Traditionally people would keep at vigil on July 31 and at midnight ring church bell and play drums in parks and public squares to re-enact the first moments of freedom for enslaved Africans. On Emancipation Day there is a reenactment of the reading of the Emancipation Declaration in town centres especially Spanish Town which was the seat of the Jamaican government when the Emancipation Act was passed in 1838. Emancipation Park, a public park in Kingston, opened on the eve of Emancipation Day, July 31 in 2002, is named in commemoration of Emancipation Day.

The Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 came into full effect in the Cape Colony on the December 1, 1838 after a four-year period of forced apprenticeship. About 39,000 enslaved people were freed and £1.2 million (roughly equivalent to £4,175,000,000 as a proportion of GDP in 2016 pounds) – of £3 million originally set aside by the British government – was paid out in compensation to 1,300 former slave holding farmers in the colony. December 1 is celebrated as Emancipation Day in South Africa most notably in the city of Cape Town. Trinidad and Tobago On August 1, 1985 Trinidad and Tobago became the first independent country in the world to declare a national holiday to commemorate the abolition of slavery. Before independence, Jamaica had declared it a national holiday in 1893. In Trinidad and Tobago, Emancipation Day replaced Columbus Discovery Day, which commemorated the arrival of Christopher Columbus at Moruga on 31 July 1498, as a national public holiday. The commemoration begins the night before with an all-night vigil and includes religious services, cultural events, street processions past historic landmarks, addresses from dignitaries including an address from the President of Trinidad and Tobago and ends with an evening of shows that include a torchlight procession to the national stadium.\\"Trinidad and Tobago Emancipation Day.\\" Holidays, Festivals, and Celebrations of the World Dictionary, edited by Helene Henderson, Omnigraphics, Inc., 5th edition, 2015.

In the capital, Tallahassee, Civil War reenactors playing the part of Major General Edward McCook and other union soldiers act out the speech General McCook gave from the steps of the Knott House on May 20, 1865. This was the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation in Florida. Georgia Thomaston, Georgia has been the site of an Emancipation Day celebration since May 1866. Organizers believe it is \\"the oldest, continuously observed annual emancipation event in the United States.\\" The annual event is scheduled for the Saturday closest to May 29. William Guilford was an early organizer of the event first held in 1866. Kentucky Emancipation Day is celebrated on August 8 in Hopkinsville, Christian County; Paducah, McCracken County; and Russellville, Logan County Kentucky, as well as other communities in western Kentucky. According to the Paducah Sun newspaper, this is the anniversary of the day slaves in this region learned of their freedom in 1865. According to a PBS documentary, it celebrates the liberation of the slaves of U.S. President Andrew Johnson, one of whom started the annual celebration in eastern Tennessee.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARGAsxFaJo4 Mississippi In Columbus, Mississippi, Emancipation Day is celebrated on May 8, known locally as \\"Eight o' May\\". As in other southern states, the local celebration commemorates the date in 1865 when African Americans in eastern Mississippi learned of their freedom.https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/05/emancipation- day-commemoration-from-columbus-mississippi/361971/ Though the 13th amendment was ratified by the necessary three quarters vote, Mississippi withheld its ratification document after the constitutional amendment was submitted to the states. Mississippi finally submitted the ratification document on February 7, 2013.https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/02/mississippi-officially- abolishes-slavery-ratifies-13th-amendment/ https://www.archives.gov/federal- register/constitution/ Texas In Texas, Emancipation Day is celebrated on June 19. It commemorates the announcement in Texas of the abolition of slavery made on that day in 1865. It is commonly known as Juneteenth. Since the late 20th century, this date has gained recognition beyond Texas, and has been proposed for a national Emancipation Day.  Territories   Puerto Rico  Puerto Rico celebrates Emancipation Day (), an official holiday, on March 22. Slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico in 1873 while the island was still a colony of Spain. US Virgin Islands Statue of Buddhoe at Fort Frederik, St. Croix The United States Virgin Islands celebrates V.I. Emancipation Day (Danish West Indies Emancipation Day) as an official holiday on July 3. It commemorates the Danish Governor Peter von Scholten's 1848 proclamation that \\"all unfree in the Danish West Indies are from today emancipated,\\" following a slave rebellion led by John Gottlieb (Moses Gottlieb, General Buddhoe) in Frederiksted, Saint Croix. In addition to recognizing Emancipation Day, since 2017 the full week leading up to July 3 has been recognized as Virgin Islands Freedom Week. Emancipation Day, Freedom Week, and the culmination of St. John Festival are celebrated throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands with concerts, dancing, workshops, a historical skit, and a reenactment of the walk to Fort Frederik.

TiB2 is resistant to oxidation in air at temperatures up to 1100 °C, and to hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, but reacts with alkalis, nitric acid and sulfuric acid. Production TiB2 does not occur naturally in the earth. Titanium diboride powder can be prepared by a variety of high-temperature methods, such as the direct reactions of titanium or its oxides/hydrides, with elemental boron over 1000 °C, carbothermal reduction by thermite reaction of titanium oxide and boron oxide, or hydrogen reduction of boron halides in the presence of the metal or its halides. Among various synthesis routes, electrochemical synthesis and solid state reactions have been developed to prepare finer titanium diboride in large quantity. An example of solid state reaction is the borothermic reduction, which can be illustrated by the following reactions: (1) 2 TiO2 \\\\+ B4C + 3C → 2 TiB2 \\\\+ 4 CO (2) TiO2 \\\\+ 3NaBH4 → TiB2 \\\\+ 2Na(g,l) + NaBO2 \\\\+ 6H2(g) The first synthesis route (1), however, cannot produce nanosized powders. Nanocrystalline (5–100 nm) TiB2 was synthesized using the reaction (2) or the following techniques: * Solution phase reaction of NaBH4 and TiCl4, followed by annealing the amorphous precursor obtained at 900–1100 °C.S.

Admixture of about 10% silicon nitride facilitates the sintering,Titanium diboride sintered body with silicon nitride as a sintering aid and a method for manufacture thereof though sintering without silicon nitride has been demonstrated as well. Thin films of TiB2 can be produced by several techniques. The electroplating of TiB2 layers possess two main advantages compared with physical vapor deposition or chemical vapor deposition: the growing rate of the layer is 200 times higher (up to 5 μm/s) and the inconveniences of covering complex shaped products are dramatically reduced. Potential applications Current use of TiB2 appears to be limited to specialized applications in such areas as impact resistant armor, cutting tools, crucibles, neutron absorbers and wear resistant coatings. TiB2 is extensively used for evaporation boats for vapour coating of aluminium. It is an attractive material for the aluminium industry as an inoculant to refine the grain size when casting aluminium alloys, because of its wettability by and low solubility in molten aluminium and good electrical conductivity. Thin films of TiB2 can be used to provide wear and corrosion resistance to a cheap and/or tough substrate.

During the early days of the colonies that formed Australia, foreign as well as British currency was used, but in 1910, a decade after federation, Australian coins were introduced. Australia used pounds, shillings and pence until 1966, when it adopted the decimal system with the Australian dollar divided into 100 cents. With the exception of the first Proclamation Coinage and the holey dollars, all Australian coins remain legal tender despite being withdrawn from circulation.  First coins  For many years after the first Australian colony, New South Wales (NSW), was founded in 1788, it did not have its own currency and had to rely on the coins of other countries. During the early days of the colony, commodities such as wheat were sometimes used as a currency because of the shortage of coins. Also many transactions were carried out using promissory notes or a barter system, which included trafficking in alcohol, known as 'rum currency', a system disbanded when Macquarie became governor on 1 January 1810.[1] Spanish dollars were sometimes cut into \\"pieces of eight\\", quarters, and then into 2/3 and 1/3 segments, with the 2/3 segments (1/6 of original coin) being \\"shillings\\" and the 1/3 segments (1/12 of original coin) \\"sixpences\\"Early Australian Currency In 1791 Governor Phillip of New South Wales fixed the value of the Spanish dollar to equal five shillings. Under the decree of 19 November 1800 by the governor Philip Gidley King, the following eleven coins were legal tender for the exchange value of: *Gold Johanna (Portugal coin of 12800 Reis) = £4/0/- (four pounds) *Gold Half Johanna (Portugal coin of 6400 Reis) = £2/0/- (two pounds *Guinea = £1/2/- (One pound and two shillings) *Gold Mohur = £1/17/6 (one pound, 17 shillings and sixpence). *Spanish dollar = 5 shillings. *Ducat = 9/6 (9 shillings 6 pence). *Rupee = 2/6 (2 shillings and 6 pence). *Pagoda = 8/- (8 shillings). . *Dutch Guilder = 2/- (2 shillings). *English shilling = 1/1 (1 shilling and 1 penny). *Copper coin of 1 oz = 2 pence.Renniks Australian coins and their value 19th edition 2000. page 6. The settlers did have some George III one- penny coins, which were referred to as \\"Cartwheel pennies\\". These were the first British coins to be officially exported to the Australian colonies, and so can be considered Australia's first official coins. They were dated 1797 and 1799, with Britannia on one side and King George III on the other. In 1812, Governor Lachlan Macquarie of New South Wales bought Spanish dollar coins, following the arrival of the ship Samarang at Port Jackson with 40,000 Spanish dollars, paying four shillings and nine pence for each dollar. He was worried that the coins would quickly be exported out of the colony and had holes cut in the middle of them to try to keep them in Australia. These were known as Holey dollars (valued at five shillings), with the piece from the middle being called the Dump (valued at around 15 pence). Both were declared legal currency on 30 September 1813 and went into circulation in 1814.National Museum of Australia collection highlights: Holey dollar British currency became the official currency of the Australian colonies after 1825, with almost £100,000-worth of British coins being imported during 1824–25. The Holey dollar was no longer legal tender after 1829. Gold coins and Sovereigns Australia 1857 Sovereign (proof) Unofficial gold coins were used during the gold rush of the 1850s. Traders' tokens were also used because of the shortage of coins caused by the large increase in population. Requests to make gold coins in Adelaide in 1852 to compensate for the shortage of coins were rejected by Britain after 25,000 One Pound pieces were struck.One Pound Type I Adelaide Assay Office Australia's first official mint was in Sydney, founded in 1855. It produced gold coins with an original design between 1855 and 1870, with \\"Sydney Mint, Australia, One Sovereign\\" on one side and Queen Victoria on the other, or \\"Sydney Mint, Australia, Half Sovereign\\", before starting in 1870 to mint gold coins of British design. One gold sovereign equalled £1. The pound Federation in 1901 gave the Commonwealth a constitutional power to issue coins and removed this power from the States. British coins continued in use until 1910, when Australian silver coins were introduced. These included florins, shillings, sixpences and threepences. They had a portrait of King Edward VII on one side. Australian pennies and half- pennies were introduced into circulation the following year. In 1931 gold sovereigns stopped being minted in Australia. A crown or five-shilling coin was minted in 1937 and 1938. The dollar 'Design of the new decimal currency' first broadcast by the ABC in 1964. The Australian dollar replaced the Australian pound on 14 February 1966 as part of the decimalisation process. At this time, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cent coins were issued. $1 coins were first issued in 1984, and $2 coins soon followed in 1988. The one- and two-cent coins were discontinued in 1990 and withdrawn from circulation in February 1992.

Born into a wealthy Jewish family of Alexandria but abandoning or neglecting the Jewish religion, he rose to become procurator of Judea (c. 46-48) under Claudius. While Prefect of Egypt (66-69), he employed his legions against the Alexandrian Jews in a brutal response to ethnic violence, and was instrumental in the Emperor Vespasian's rise to power. In 70, he participated in the Siege of Jerusalem as Titus' second-in- command. He became the most powerful Jew of his age, and is ranked as one of the most prominent Jews in military history. Early life Tiberius Julius Alexander was probably born early in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius (14-37). His father was Alexander, an Alexandrian Jew who held the office of Alabarch as head of customs on the Arabian frontier. Andrew J. Schoenfeld,of Israel in Caesar's Service: Jewish Soldiers in the Roman Military, Shofar Vol. 24, No. 3 (Spring 2006), pp. 115-126, pp.118-120.but it may have denoted a senior customs official. The family of the older Alexander, a member of the Egyptian gentry, had Roman citizenship, something not infrequent amomg the wealthy Jews of Alexandria. He also had business connections both with Agrippa, grandson of Herod the Great, and with Antonia, mother of the emperor Claudius.Turner, p. 54. Another prominent member of Tiberius Alexander's family was his uncle, the philosopher Philo. With both Tiberius and his younger brother Marcus Julius Alexander, the father preferred to give them a grounding in classical languages, rather than have them receive a traditional Jewish education, and both had been groomed to enter into the Roman bureaucracy Marcus Julius Alexander was the first husband of Herodian Princess Berenice. Marcus died in 43 or 44, leaving no children. The Jewish historian Josephus introduces his portrait of Tiberius by condemning him for impiety, explaining that he \\"did not remain in his ancestral customs\\". Josephus, Antiquities 20.100. This has traditionally been taken to mean that he became an apostate from Judaism at an early age, a view which finds some support in his appearance as a character in two of Philo's philosophical dialogues, making arguments against divine providence which Philo attempts to refute.Turner, p. 56. However, some more recent scholars believe that Josephus is criticizing Alexander simply for his decision to take up the service of Rome, placing the interests of the Empire above the Jewish religion.Modrzejewski, p. 187. He nevertheless continued to benefit from his family's connections, which were enhanced after the Emperor Claudius came to power in 41. Agrippa had helped to secure Claudius' accession after the assassination of Caligula, and was appointed king of Judea. Tiberius' father, who had been imprisoned by Caligula, was released on Claudius' orders, and it was at this time that his younger brother Marcus became Berenice's husband.Josephus, Antiquities 19.276. Tiberius's first senior appointment was as governor of the Thebaid in 42 CE. Career until 63 Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position he is known to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of epistrategus of the Thebaid, one of the three regions into which the Roman province of Egypt was divided.Modrzejewski, p. 186. This was an administrative and judicial post involving no military command. He may have perhaps maintained contacts with his brother Marcus, who was trading in the same area until his premature death in 43 or 44.Turner, pp. 58-59. In recognition of his administrative abilities in the Thebaid after four years of service there, Claudius appointed him procurator of Judea in 46 CE. The province had returned to direct Roman rule only after the death of Agrippa in 44, and from the tenure of Alexander's predecessor Cuspius Fadus it had been a hotbed of zealot nationalism Despite the opinion of some fellow Jews that he was a turncoat, his period of office as Procurator in Judea was marked by peace, as Josephus himself writes. He did condemn James and Simon, sons of an earlier rebel named Judas of Galilee, to crucifixion. It was also at this time that Judea was afflicted by a severe famine. In 48 he was succeeded by Ventidius Cumanus.Josephus, Antiquities 20.101-103; The Wars of the Jews 2.220. Alexander appears to have risen in the ranks - though the details are unknown, until, with the reign of Nero, he served as a staff officer under the prominent general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo during campaigns against Parthia, under whom he distinguished himself. In 63 he was dispatched along with Corbulo's son-in-law to escort the Armenian king Tiridates, with whom he himself had initiated negotiations, to the Roman camp, on the first stage of his journey to receive the status of client king from Nero.Tacitus, Annals 15.28. Prefecture of Egypt In May 66, after Corbulio had backed him, Nero appointed Alexander Prefect of Egypt, one of the two most prestigious posts available to an equestrian along with Prefect of the Praetorian Guard.Josephus, War 2.309. Alexander may have benefitted from a philhellenic tendency in equestrian appointments under Nero, but his experience of Egypt must also have commended him.Turner, p. 59. The year he assumed office saw the outbreak of the First Jewish–Roman War in Judea, and aggression inevitably spilled over into the large Jewish community of Alexandria. An outbreak of ethnic violence during a Greek assembly escalated when the Greeks took prisoners, leading the Jewish side to threaten to burn the assembled Greeks to death. Alexander sent mediators to calm the Jews, warning he would have to use the Roman legions if violence continued.Josephus, War 2.490-493. The threat was ineffective, and Josephus describes the outcome: A less violent side to Alexander's government is demonstrated by other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents.Turner, p. 61. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, less than a month after Nero's death.Translated in This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his ability to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province. Neither Galba nor his successor Otho survived long in office. In April 69, Vitellius was recognized as Emperor by the Roman Senate, but his opponents were beginning to rally behind Vespasian, commander of the Roman forces conducting the war in Judea. The loyalties of Alexander, who commanded two legions and had control of the grain shipments from Alexandria to Rome, were of crucial importance. Fortunately for Vespasian, Alexander was willing to correspond with him secretly; go-betweens suspected by modern historians include Berenice (soon to be lover of Vespasian's son Titus), and an Egyptian official named Basilides.Berenice was first proposed by For Basilides: On July 1 Alexander became the first to make a decisive move against Vitellius: on receipt of a letter from Vespasian, he instructed his forces to take the oath of allegiance to Vespasian as Emperor. His lead was followed by legions throughout the eastern Empire, and the anniversary of Vespasian's accession was later celebrated on this date.Josephus, War 4.616-617; Tacitus, Histories 2.79; Suetonius, Vespasian 6.3. According to Tacitus and Suetonius it was only several days later that Vespasian's own troops took the oath in his presence; Josephus disagrees. Siege of Jerusalem Model of Herod's Temple, currently in the Israel Museum. Vespasian moved rapidly to Egypt, leaving the Jewish war under the command of Titus. At the same time Alexander, as a proven commander with experience of Jewish affairs, was sent by Vespasian to join Titus as his chief of staff and adviser, second only to Titus himself. The siege of Jerusalem was conducted by four legions, and even after the city walls were overcome, the defenders held out in the Temple. Alexander participated in an initial decision not to destroy the Temple, which would remain an ornament, but to quench the fire. Two subsequent assaults by Jewish forces were repelled, and the survivors retreated to the inner temple. In a sortie, according to Josephus they clashed with the Roman troops tasked with putting the flames out, and one enraged Roman soldier threw a brand into the sanctum, destroying it. Josephus's accounts of the sequence of events, and of who was responsible, is highly contradictory,Louis H. Feldman, Josephus and Modern Scholarship (1937–1980), Walter de Gruyter 2015 p.365. though, as in rabbinic tradition, both this and the earlier destruction of the Temple were due to God's will, Nebuchadnezzer and the Romans being but his instruments.Fausto Parente, 'The Importance of Titus, or Josephus' Bellum Judaicum, as an Example of \\"Pathetic\\" Historiography' in Joseph Sievers, Gaia Lembi, (eds.),Josephus And Jewish History in Flavian Rome And Beyond, Brill BRILL 2005 pp.45-69 p.50. He makes Titus willing and unwilling to destroy the Temple, depending on what passage of his works one relies on. Stephen Simon Kimondo, The Gospel of Mark and the Roman-Jewish War of 66-70 CE: Jesus' Story as a Contrast to the Events of the War,' Wipf and Stock Publishers 2018 pp.478,81,103. Later career By this time, Vespasian's position in Rome was secure. The details of Alexander's career under the new emperor remain unclear. A damaged papyrus refers to Alexander as holding the position of \\"Praetorian Prefect\\", which is open to two interpretations. It could indicate his rank during Titus' campaign in 70, which would mean that he held his own independent imperium (commanding authority). According to another view, it means that he became Prefect of the Praetorian Guard at Rome, which in later years became a common position for former Prefects of Egypt.Turner, p. 61-64. In either case, Alexander attained a position in the Roman Empire that was unparalleled for a man of Jewish birth, not to mention one who suffered from the further stigma of an Egyptian origin. The xenophobic speaker of Juvenal's first Satire, composed in the late 1st or early in the 2nd century AD, complains of passing the Forum's triumphal statues, \\"where some Egyptian Arabarch's had the nerve to set up his titles. At his image it's right to do more than piss!\\"Juvenal, Satires 1.129-131. This is very likely a reference to Alexander.Turner, p. 63.

History  The Ahwatukee area of Phoenix experienced explosive growth in the 1990s. The Kyrene School District, the elementary school district in the area, opened a string of new schools here at this time, and the Tempe Union High School District followed suit by opening its last two high schools west of I-10. Mountain Pointe was completed by the fall of 1990, but the Tempe Union district could not open it right away due to funding shortfalls.http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1992-10-14/news/birth-of-a-team- legendary-football-coach-karl-kiefer-starts-another-winning-tradition/2/ The new, US$27 million facility ($ in dollars) opened to students the following year. The 1,100 students in grades 9 and 10 that attended the school at its start were asked to pick a mascot: an eagle, thunder, rough riders or a pride of lions, which won out.http://www.azcentral.com/community/ahwatukee/articles/2011/09/09/20110909ar- mpanniversary0909.html Its rival Desert Vista High School was opened to serve the growing southwestern part of Ahwatukee in 1996. Prior to Mountain Pointe's opening, Ahwatukee was part of the service areas of Corona del Sol High School (five miles away from Mountain Pointe and east of the Interstate 10 freeway) and Tempe High School. In the spring of 1994, Mountain Pointe graduated its first graduating class. Mountain Pointe is the largest high school in Ahwatukee with open boundaries. Many people who live in the 85044 zip code attend Mountain Pointe along with commuters from the South Mountain area. There also are a great number of students from the Maricopa area that attend Mountain Pointe High School. The Tempe Union High School District, which had to redraw boundaries significantly in the early 2000s as Corona del Sol grew over its capacity, also includes significant portions of west Chandler in Mountain Pointe's boundaries. While Corona has since shrunk in size, the boundary oddities remain.  Campus  Mountain Pointe is an open boundary school that permits any student to attend.https://www.tuhsd.k12.az.us/view.php?page=5,38 Mountain Pointe enforces a closed-campus policy and has since its inception, in which ninth, tenth, and eleventh graders may not leave campus without an adult checking them out for the day. Seniors are only permitted to leave campus with a special ID which can only be obtained with a signed and notarized parent permission form. As of the 2009–2010 school year, Mountain Pointe High School now operates on a traditional schedule.http://www.tuhsd.k12.az.us/mtp/activities/BellSchedule2009-2010.pdf This change comes after a ruling in which all six of the Tempe Union district schools did not meet the Arizona standards for required classroom time. The day now consists of five 57 minute classes, one 63 minute homeroom (five extra minutes for announcements), and a 30-minute lunch. A major criticism of traditional schedule is the loss of an academic lab, a 45–minute study hall, which allowed each student to travel to one teacher for extra help. A 40-minute academic lab returned to Mountain Pointe in the fall of 2011.

Geography Country Club Park is bounded by Olympic Boulevard on the north, Crenshaw Boulevard on the west, Pico Boulevard on the south, and Western Avenue on the east. The Thomas Guide, 2006, page 633 It is adjacent to the Arlington Heights neighborhood. Country Club Park is partially gated; three streets that intersect Pico Boulevard are closed to through-traffic. History The name Country Club Park refers to the area's previous use. In 1897, The Los Angeles Golf Club established a 9-hole course called the Windmill Links at Pico and Alvarado Street. Overcrowding inspired the organizers to move west and in 1899, the club moved to the corner of Pico and Western (the area that is now Country Club Park). The course remained there until 1910, at which time it moved to Holmby Hills. After The Los Angeles Golf Club moved west, Isaac Milbank, with partner George Chase, subdivided the property for mostly large homes and mansions. Country Club Park matured in the 1920s and homes were constructed in the latest architectural styles: Craftsman, Tudor Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, Colonial Revival and Mediterranean Revival. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Shelley v. Kraemer (1948) which struck down racial exclusionary covenants, Country Club Park was one of the first affluent neighborhoods in Los Angeles to allow blacks to purchase homes. In 2010, the neighborhood was designated a Los Angeles Historic Preservation Overlay Zone because of the large number of intact buildings dating back to the earliest phases of Los Angeles’ development.Preservation.lacity.org: Country Club Park HPOZ; with Survey Map, Adopting Ordinance, and Preservation Plan links. Parks and Recreation Country Club Park Heritage Plaza is at 1015 South Wilton Place. It has a children's play area, picnic tables, and a walking path. Filming 1120 Westchester Place in Country Club Park The pilot episode of American Horror Story was shot on location in a house in Country Club Park. Designed and built in 1902 by Alfred Rosenheim, the president of the American Institute of Architects' Los Angeles chapter, the Collegiate Gothic-style single family home is located at 1120 Westchester Place. The home was previously used as a convent. An adjoining chapel was removed from exterior shots using CGI. After the pilot episode, filming continued on sets constructed to be an exact replica of the house. Details such as Lewis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows, and hammered bronze light fixtures, were re-created to preserve the look of the house. Other projects that have been shot in the neighborhood include Ali, Daddy Day Care, and Running with Scissors.

He played college football for and graduated from Grambling State University. College career Standing six feet (1.83 m) tall, and weighing over 260 lb Eugene was given the nickname \\"Round Mound of Touchdown\\". He was much heavier than the typical quarterback, but proved to be exceptionally quick and agile for a man his size. He was also a very accurate passer, and was rated one of the top players in Division I-AA college football. Injured in the first game of the 2004 season, Eugene sat out the entire remainder of the year. He received a sixth year of eligibility from the NCAA. Eugene was a three-time finalist for the coveted Walter Payton Award, which is given annually to I-AA's top football player (the equivalent of the Heisman Trophy in Division I-A). In 2003, he threw for 3,805 yards with 34 TD vs 13 INT. He also ran for 412 yards with 6 TD. He followed that up with an amazing performance during the 2005 season throwing for 4,408 yards with 56 TD vs 6 INT while running for an additional 157 yards and 3 TD. At the NFL combine, Eugene recorded a score of 41 on the Wonderlic test, one of the highest ever. Professional career Eugene was signed as a free agent by the New Orleans Saints within hours of the conclusion of the 2006 NFL Draft. Bruce was released from the Saints on June 15, 2006. After a short stint with the Canadian Football League's Saskatchewan Roughriders he signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on January 11, 2007. Eugene was assigned to the Frankfurt Galaxy of the now-defunct NFL Europa for the 2007 season. Frankfurt Galaxy was at the time the defending World Bowl champion. At the end of training camp, Eugene was released by Frankfurt, then acquired by 3-time World Bowl champions Berlin Thunder, where he replaced third-string quarterback Walter Washington, who was released after camp, and injured back-up Omar Jacobs. He played his first game for Thunder in the 7-16 loss to the Hamburg Sea Devils on April 22, 2007. Coaching career Eugene moved into coaching, working at different schools in the Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) in New York City. In 2011, he was the quarterbacks coach at Alcorn State University in Lorman, Mississippi. In 2012, he returned to PSAL as the head football coach at High School of Enterprise, Business, & Technology (also known as Grand Street Campus or Grand Street) in Brooklyn, New York.\\"Grand Street holds off Beach Channel\\" , MSG Varsity, September 16, 2012.

The party has been inactive since 2005. History The party was established in 1986, aiming to be a multi- racial party.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p630 It was formed by former People's National Movement members and opposition parties, including the Organisation for National Reconstruction (a party established in by PNM dissident Karl Hudson-Phillips in 1980), the United Labour Front, the Democratic Action Congress and the Tapia House Movement – the latter three having previously been part of an electoral pact known as the National Alliance. The new party won the 1986 elections, taking around 66% of the national vote (the first time the PNM had failed to win over 50% since 1956)Nohlen, pp639-641 and winning 33 of the 36 seats in the Trinidad and Tobago. A. N. R. Robinson, previously leader of the DAC, became Prime Minister. The NAR entered government with broad national support and goodwill, but support declined as fiscal austerity and neo-liberal economic policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program resulted in increased unemployment and a 10% cut in salaries in the public service. Infighting over government posts and economic policies split the party and some ministers defected after a single year in power. In 1988 former ULF leader Basdeo Panday was expelled, taking with him five other former ULF members to form the Indian-dominated United National Congress.Nohlen, p631 Subsequently, a further five MPs defected to become independents. In 1990 the Jamaat al Muslimeen attempted to capitalise on the dissatisfaction with an attempted coup. Despite surviving the attempted coup the NAR was defeated in the 1991 general elections, winning only two seats, both in Tobago. Following the defeat Robinson resigned as party leader, and several other prominent NAR members retired, leaving the NAR severely weakened. In the 1992 local elections the NAR suffered another humiliating defeat, failing to win a single seat. The NAR did however retain its dominance in the Tobago House of Assembly, winning eleven of the twelve seats in the 1992 elections. The party went through rapid leadership changes. Former Works Minister Carson Charles served as leader from 1992 until 1993. He was replaced by former Finance Minister Selby Wilson. Charles left the NAR and formed his own group the National Development Party. In a 1994 by-election an attempt was made to have the NAR and its two daughter parties the UNC and NDP, run a joint platform. However, the proposals failed to come to fruition. The UNC was adopting a policy of attracting 'NAR voters' directly rather than attempting another formal alliance, and following his failure to reunite the party, Wilson resigned and the NAR was leaderless until just prior to the 1995 elections. During this period NAR chairman Robert Mayers served as the de facto leader. When elections were called in 1995, Robinson was persuaded to return and resume leadership of the party. In the elections the party retained its two Tobago seats, but failed to win any in Trinidad. However, it joined the UNC-led coalition and returned to government. Robinson was appointed Minister Extraordinaire and was elected president in 1997. Former Speaker of the House Nizam Mohammed replaced him as NAR leader. However the NAR continued to weaken and fracture. Its bargaining position was reduced when two PNM (People's National Movement) MPs defected and joined the government as independents. In the 1996 Tobago elections an NAR assemblywoman, Deborah Moore-Miggins, contested as an Independent and won, although the party won ten of the twelve seats. However, two other NAR assemblymen later defected and joined her in forming the People's Empowerment Party. During the 1996 local elections the NAR contested around a third of the 124 seats, whilst the UNC contested the remaining two-thirds. Most of the seats contested by the NAR however were PNM strongholds, where the NAR had little support. Even in places like Arima where the NAR could potentially have won, independent candidates split the vote, leading to PNM victories. The NAR won no seats and accused the UNC of supporting the independents, deliberately preventing the NAR from regaining representation in Trinidad. Further problems for the party from its two MPs. Morgan Job (who had taken over Robinson's seat) frequently sided with the UNC against the NAR leadership, whilst the other was increasing friendly with the PEP and eventually became an independent. The party subsequently withdrew from the government. Mohammed did not seek reelection and former Attorney General Anthony Smart became the new NAR leader in 1999. In the 2000 elections the party was reduced to a single seat.Nohlen, p642 The following year the party lost the Tobago House of Assembly elections, defeated by the PNM. Early national elections were also held in 2001, which saw the NAR lose its single seat. In another early election the following year the party increased its vote share to 1.1%,Nohlen, p641 but failed to regain a seat. The NAR suffered a further blow in 2004 when a portion of the Tobago wing of the party led by Hochoy Charles split away from the NAR and re-formed the DAC, reducing the NAR to two seats. In the 2005 Tobago elections it received just 113 votes and lost both. Party leaders *A. N. R.

Founded in 1846 by the Sisters of Mercy, the university enrolls 3,896 students.  History  Saint Xavier University was founded as a women's college by the Sisters of Mercy in 1846 at the request of Bishop William Quarter. With the City of Chicago less than 10 years old, the religious sisters, under the guidance of Mother Mary Francis Xavier Warde, R.S.M., established Saint Francis Xavier Female Academy. The Academy, which would later become Saint Xavier College, and finally Saint Xavier University, was the first Mercy College in the world and is the oldest chartered college in the city of Chicago. The original campus, which burned down in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, was located on Wabash Avenue between Madison and Monroe in downtown Chicago. Soon after, the campus was rebuilt on a site on the southern boundary of Chicago.  Academics  Saint Xavier University offers undergraduate majors and graduate programs through their three schools: * The College of Arts and Sciences * The Graham School of Management * The School of Nursing and Health Sciences (a recognized Center of Excellence by the National League for Nursing) Saint Xavier University has one of the most diverse undergraduate student bodies in Chicago and is a federally-designated Hispanic-serving institution.  Campuses   Chicago  Saint Xavier's main campus is located in City of Chicago in the Mt. Greenwood neighborhood on the corner of 103rd Street and Central Park Avenue. The university's main campusCampus map is made up of several buildings, including the Warde Academic Center, which is the oldest building on campus and houses administrative offices and the library; the Shannon Center; McDonough Chapel, a small Catholic chapel; the Graham School of Management Building; Andrew Conference Center and Driehaus Center. Within a mile of the main campus are the Visual Arts Center and O'Grady Center, which houses the departments of University Relations and University Advancement. In 2001, an influx of students to the University led to the opening of four new dormitories on campus. McCarthy, Morris, Rubloff and O'Brien Halls are apartment-style suites that accommodate students on campus. In 2009, former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley recognized Saint Xavier University for its eco- friendly efforts with the opening of the Arthur Rubloff Hall and O'Brien Halls on campus. These residence halls are environmentally friendly, featuring rooftop gardens and clean-source alternative energy.  Athletics  The Saint Xavier Cougars are the athletic teams of Saint Xavier University. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), competing in most sports as a member of the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC). In football, the Cougars are affiliated with the Midwest League of the Mid-States Football Association. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, soccer and track & field; women's sports include basketball, bowling, cheerleading, cross country, dance, soccer, softball, track & field and volleyball. The baseball team is coached by Addison Rouse. The football team is coached by Mike Feminis. Athletic facilities on campus include the Shannon Center, which holds up to 3,500 students and houses the university fitness center. It is home to both men's and women's basketball and volleyball teams. Bruce R. Deaton Memorial Field is home to football, soccer, and track. In 2011, Saint Xavier won the NAIA Football National Championship.

In basketball, a personal foul is a breach of the rules that concerns illegal personal contact with an opponent. It is the most common type of foul in basketball. A player fouls out on reaching a limit on personal fouls for the game and is disqualified from participation in the remainder of the game. Players routinely initiate illegal contact to purposely affect the play, hoping it is seen as too minor to be ruled a foul. The threshold is subjective and varies among officials and from game to game. Most contact fouls are not regarded as unsportsmanlike. However, excessive or unjustified contact is penalized more severely. The NBA refers to these as flagrant fouls; other rulebooks call them unsportsmanlike or disqualifying fouls. History Basketball has always had the concept of fouls. In 1891, James Naismith's original 13 rules defined a foul as: *running with the ball, *holding the ball with the arms or body, *striking the ball with the fist, *shouldering, holding, pushing, striking or tripping in any way of an opponent. Only the fourth definition remains. Running with the ball and striking it with the fist are now violations. Holding the ball with the arms or body is now rare but legal. Originally, on a player's second foul, the player would be removed without substitution until the next successful goal (similar to a penalty in ice hockey). Before long, free throws were introduced, originally worth three points each, then one. Originally, any team member was allowed to shoot free throws. In 1924, the rules were changed so that the fouled player shot the free throws. The victim of a contact foul used to be given three attempts at a free throw, and the offense retained possession of the basketball. Now, a player fouled in the act of shooting gets from one to three shots and the other team tends to get possession afterwards (see Penalties below). Principles Personal contact does not necessarily constitute a personal foul, unless it gives a player an advantage or puts the opponent at a disadvantage. Cylinder In FIBA, the cylinder principle gives each player exclusive rights within an imaginary cylinder defined: *in the front by the palms of the hands, when the arms are bent at the elbows so that the forearms and hands are raised, but no farther in front than the feet, *in the rear by the buttocks, *at the sides by the outside edge of the arms and legs. The cylinder extends from the floor to the ceiling, allowing the player to jump upward. A player can occupy any cylinder not already occupied by the opponent. No one else is allowed to step or reach into this cylinder. A player must not extend his limbs or bend his body in a way that is not normal. If there is a breach of this principle that places the opponent at a disadvantage, the official may penalise it. The NBA does not use the cylinder principle to judge contact; it only says that a player may not bend or reach in a position that is not normal (nor push, hold, and so on). Elements of time and distance The elements of time and distance concern the reaction time and distance of another person. They apply only to players without the ball, not to the ball carrier. For example, a player cannot suddenly step in front of a sprinting player, even without invading the cylinder. Another example is when a player sets a screen directly behind a player: the player would not physically be able to react to the screen in enough time to avoid it. Types of foul Justin Doellman, then a Valencia Basket player, is fouled in a Eurocup match. Charging and blocking When significant illegal contact between the ball-carrier and a defender occurs, it usually means that either — *The defender committed a blocking foul, or *The ball-carrier committed the offensive foul of charging. Deciding between the two is complex, partly subjective, and often controversial. Generally, the ball-carrier committed a charge if all of the following are true: *The defender was still, or moving sideways or backward but not forward, when contact occurred. *The defender took a legal guarding position before the contact, that is, one with both feet on the floor. *The defender was hit on the torso (as opposed to the arm or leg). In the NBA, in contact during a move to the basket, officials do not consider the position of the defender's feet, but decide whether the defensive player's torso was set in position before the offensive player began his upward motion. An exception is that a charging foul is usually not called if the ball-handler is within a 4-foot (1.22 m) radius around the center of the basket (known in the rules as the \\"restricted area\\" and sometimes colloquially as the \\"smiley face\\"). That is, if the ball-carrier is under the basket, the defense usually cannot restrict his or her movement by drawing a charge. However, a charge can be called if the offensive player receives the ball within an area close to the basket known as the \\"lower defensive box.\\" A related call is the player control foul. ;Strategy Apart from using hands in neutral space to shield or deflect a pass or a shot, the defender uses his or her body to impede the ball-carrier's advance toward the basket. The defender's only absolute way to achieve this is to stand directly in the ball-carrier's path and \\"draw a charge.\\" Short of this, the defender's use of the body may make the ball-carrier hesitate or change tactics. Both opponents are restrained by their desire not to commit a foul. It is not a foul to grab for the ball, or to touch a hand of the ball-carrier that is on the ball, but the ball-carrier, especially in the act of shooting, can easily cause greater contact that is a blocking foul against the defender. Once contact is made, the defender may fall to the ground to exaggerate the force of the collision and induce a foul to be called. (The ball-carrier rarely does so, as it would disrupt the effort to score a goal.) Overt deception is disparagingly called a \\"flop\\" and is penalized at every level of basketball. ;Screening A screen is an attempt by an offensive player to stop a defender from guarding the ball-carrier. For example, John Stockton and Karl Malone were well known for their pick and roll (or screen and roll) play. The ball- carrier's teammate is the screener; he stands in the path of the defender as the ball-carrier dribbles past the screener. This at least costs the defender time, and may induce a collision. Either leaves the ball-carrier unguarded. However, if the screener moves towards the ball-carrier when contact occurs, or does not respect the elements of time and distance, or initiates contact, he is charged with illegal screening or setting a moving pick. These are blocking fouls. Other fouls on the ball-carrier In the NBA, the ball- carrier cannot attempt to dribble past a defender where there is not enough space, such as dribbling between a defender and either a boundary or another defensive player. If the ball-carrier has space to put head and shoulders past the defender, then the defender is responsible. In FIBA, this rule is not codified, but contact caused by the dribbler is still penalized. Fouls away from the ball The rules are symmetrical for contact between offensive and defensive players not involving the ball-carrier. Any player has the right to a position on the court legally acquired. A player acquiring a position that will impede an opponent must respect the elements of time and distance; that is, not take a position so close, or so quickly, that the opponent cannot avoid contact. This includes gradually slowing down after running with the opponent, and situations where the opponent is shielded from seeing the player's movement. Other personal fouls *Pushing — Contact that displaces an opponent (for example, pushing a player away from the basket, or using body weight to affect a player's movement). *Holding — Contact that interferes with a player's freedom of movement (for example, physically grabbing a player driving to the basket). *Illegal use of hands — Extending the hands outside the cylinder and causing illegal contact (for example, going for a steal but hitting the player's hand or arm, or hitting the arm of a shooter). *Hand-checking — Contact by the defense on a ball handler that impedes a player's speed, quickness, rhythm, and/or balance. *Illegal use of elbow — Moving one's elbow outside the cylinder to disadvantage an opponent. This mostly occurs during a post-up play situation, where either offense or defense attempt to gain a better position. *Illegal use of legs or knees (on the dunk): Jumping up with one knee forward as to intentionally hit the defender. Non-foul Referees who called every case of illegal player contact would dominate the game to the exclusion of the athletes, but reluctance to make calls would make the game excessively violent. The rules direct referees to seek a balance between these extremes, though they do not define it. When players are competing for a ball that goes out of bounds, and one player commits illegal but minor contact, referees often do not feel a foul is justified but resolve the situation by simply awarding possession of the ball to the other team. The \\"reach-in foul\\" is a misnomer. Reaching toward a player is not a foul, though physical contact may be a foul. Penalties The official scorer records the foul in two counts of fouls on the scoresheet: *As a player foul against the offending player during the game. A player who accumulates too many fouls will foul out (see below). *As a team foul against the offending player's team during the current quarter or half. A team that accumulates too many fouls in that period enters the penalty situation and puts the other team into the \\"bonus.\\" In men's college basketball (but not women's), another, higher number of team fouls gives the other team a \\"double bonus\\" regarding the number of free throws. (See the article on free throws.) On a foul committed by the defense (and on a loose-ball foul when neither team is in possession of the ball), if the team committing the foul is in the penalty situation or the fouled player was in the act of shooting, the fouled player is awarded free throws. Otherwise, and on offensive fouls, the fouled player's team is awarded possession of the ball to pass inbounds from the out- of-bounds point nearest to the foul. The shot clock is reset. In some rulebooks, such as that of FIBA, a technical foul is included in the count of player fouls. If the game goes to overtime, foul counts are not reset, but continue as though overtime were a continuation of the final regulation period. The NBA and WNBA are exceptions, in that each overtime period has its own count of team fouls. ;Free throws plus possession The NBA awards the fouled player free throws followed by possession of the ball in the following cases: *A flagrant foul. *A defense foul when the ball carrier is in the frontcourt with a \\"clear path\\" to the basket (no defender between the ball carrier and the basket). *A foul \\"away from the ball\\" in the last two minutes of the game. Strategy Sam Van Rossom scores a two-point shot and is fouled on the same play. Fans and commentators often speak of a \\"good foul” when the fouled player would otherwise have made a sure basket. By fouling the player and preventing an easy two points, the defender forces the offensive player to \\"earn\\" the two points from the free throw line. However, if the foul does not prevent the player from scoring, the basket is counted and the fouled player gets an additional free throw. After the fouled player shoots free throws, the team that was on defense is likely to gain possession of the ball. This is by award, if the final free throw was made. Even if it is missed, defensive players can occupy better positions at the side of the lane to get the rebound. Near the end of the game, a team that is losing may purposefully foul offensive players to stop the clock and regain possession of the ball, with the hope that the player will miss his free throws. Coaches study free- throw percentages, so that the defense will foul a ball carrier who is poor at free-throw shooting. The \\"Hack-a-Shaq\\" strategy was famously practiced against Shaquille O'Neal in view of his poor percentage. The defense is not free to foul its choice of the five offensive players, as a foul \\"away from the ball\\" results in free throws plus possession. The use of intentional fouls to prolong a game is unique to basketball; most other sports consider such maneuvers a form of unsportsmanlike conduct and impose stiffer penalties to teams that attempt them (see the professional foul and unfair act in football codes). ;Foul to give Near the end of the game, a team may have committed so few fouls that it can commit one or more fouls without putting the opponent in the bonus. It is said that the team has one or more fouls to give. A player who is not close to fouling out can foul an opponent with impunity to prevent a likely score. To keep games from being bogged down with cheap fouls, the NBA rules provide that the second foul in the final two minutes of a half puts the fouled team in the bonus (enabling free throws) regardless of the number of team fouls. Fouling out A player who commits five personal fouls over the course of a 40-minute game, or six in a 48-minute game, fouls out and is disqualified for the remainder of the game. A player within one or two fouls of fouling out is in \\"foul trouble.\\" Players who foul out are not ejected and may remain in the bench area for the remainder of the game. Fouling out of a game is not a disciplinary action. In the NCAA and FIBA, if a team is reduced below five players by fouling out, injury, or ejection, play continues. A team is declared the loser if reduced to a single player. This rule was invoked in an NCAA game between the Minnesota Golden Gophers and the Alabama Crimson Tide on November 25, 2017. With 13:39 remaining in the second half, a scuffle broke out involving Minnesota players in the game and Alabama players on the bench. Alabama's entire bench was ejected, leaving the Crimson Tide with only five active players. Alabama's Dazon Ingram fouled out at the 11:37 mark, and John Petty left the game with a sprained ankle, forcing the Tide to play the final 10:41 with three players. In the NBA and WNBA, teams cannot be reduced below five players. A player foul penalty situation exists when only five eligible players remain. If there are only five players, a player who fouls out stays in the game. If another of the five players is ejected or injured, the last player to foul out rejoins the game. Under the player foul penalty rule, each situation results in a technical foul, with the non-offending team shooting one technical foul free throw. If that player commits another foul, the opponent will be awarded one additional free throw under the same situation in addition to any free throws awarded, including offensive fouls, which normally are not assessed free throws. Each such situation will be scored as a non- unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul. These technical fouls are not for unsportsmanlike conduct, so they do not result in ejections from the game. This rule let Don Otten set the NBA record for personal fouls in a regular- season game. He had eight fouls while playing for the Tri-Cities Blackhawks (now the Atlanta Hawks) against the Sheboygan Red Skins on November 24, 1949. The rule was also invoked in a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers on February 5, 2014. With the Lakers down to five players due to injuries, when Robert Sacre fouled out, he remained in the game. In FIBA-authorized 3x3 half-court competition, players cannot foul out because personal foul counts are kept only on a team basis and not individually. However, unsportsmanlike and disqualifying fouls (equivalent to the flagrant fouls of most North American rule sets) are assessed to individuals, and a player who commits two unsportsmanlike fouls or one disqualifying foul is removed from the game. In the NBA, disqualifying fouls are two technicals or one flagrant 2 (unnecessary and excessive contact). Bench players and staff are subject to accumulating team technical fouls. The coaching staff is also subject to ejection from the game. Ejected personnel may incur fines as well.

The calling of branch president is very similar to the calling of bishop, except that instead of presiding over a ward, the branch president presides over a branch. The branch president is directly responsible for the operation of his branch and the well-being of its patrons. The branch president usually has two counselors to assist him in his duties. These three men comprise the branch presidency. Like almost all callings in the LDS Church, the branch president is not paid for his work in the church. A branch president must hold the priesthood and at a minimum must hold the office of priest. Unlike a bishop, a branch president is not required to be married or be a high priest, but conforming with these stipulations may depend on whether the branch is part of a district or a stake. In branches within stakes that contain several priesthood holders a branch president will usually be married and may be ordained to the office of high priest. In branches where no resident member is a worthy priesthood holder, a full-time missionary may be called to be branch president. Branch presidents are given the honorific title \\"President\\".

He was the first margrave of the Babenberg dynasty which ruled the March and Duchy of Austria until its extinction in 1246. Life The origins of Leopold the Illustrious are not known. According to some sources, his father Berthold was count in the Nordgau, the region north of Ratisbon (Regensburg) in the Duchy of Bavaria. A more recent theory identifies Leopold as a younger son of Duke Arnulf of BavariaWegener 1965, p. 77. and brother (or nephew) of Count Berthold of Schweinfurt. While his ancestry remains disputed, some affiliation with the ducal Luitpoldings dynasty is probable. Bavaria with the marches of Austria, Carinthia and Verona, 952-976 Leopold is first mentioned in a document issued by Emperor Otto I on 13 February 962 as Liupo, count of the Bavarian Donaugau region near Ratisbon,Pohl 1995, p. 12. count of the Traungau region, and a faithful follower of the emperor.Brooke 1938, p. 52. After Otto I had defeated the Magyars in the 955 Battle of Lechfeld, he re-established the Bavarian Marcha orientalis (Eastern March) in the conquered territories, placing them under the command of Margrave Burkhard, a brother-in-law of Duchess Judith, consort of Duke Henry II of Bavaria. When Burkhard joined the uprising of Duke Henry II (\\"the Wrangler\\") against Emperor Otto II, he was deposed at the Imperial Diet of Ratisbon in 976. According to a charter dated 21 July 976, loyal Leopold was appointed margrave of the Marcha orientalis, the core territory of the later Archduchy of Austria.Leeper 1940, p. 153. The resettlement of the east was a slow process that centered from the fortress of Pöchlarn down the Danube river. Leopold's margraviate originally coincided with the present-day Wachau valley, and whose eastern boundary was the Traisen river near Sankt Pölten east of Krems.Leeper 1940, p. 158. With the Magyar threat largely reduced following their defeat in 955, Leopold focused on securing his holdings from internal threats and dissensions. In 984, he engaged in the reduction of the fortress at Melk, which was still controlled by supporters of the late margrave. Once Melk was secured, Leopold most likely used it as his residence, founding a monastery there for twelve secular priests. By 987, Leopold extended the boundary of his margraviate to the east as far as the Wienerwald mountain rangeLeeper 1940, p. 159. and by 991, jointly with reinstated Duke Henry II of Bavaria, further down to the Fischa river . In 994, Leopold travelled to Würzburg to mediate a dispute between his cousin Margrave Henry of Schweinfurt and the Würzburg bishop Bernward von Rothenburg, one of whose knights Henry had seized and blinded.Leeper 1940, p. 164.Lechner 1976, p. 54. At a tournament held on 8 July, Leopold was hit in the eye by an arrow directed at his cousin. Two days later, on 10 July 994, he died from his injuries.Thietmar 2001, pp. 166–167. He was buried in Würzburg. In 1015, his son Duke Ernest I of Swabia, was buried next to his father. In the thirteenth century, their remains were returned to Melk Abbey. Historiography Leopold ruled over the re-established Marcha orientalis for eighteen years. He organized and expanded it with great ability, and left behind a margravate that had assumed the character of \\"an ordered and civilized land\\". The chronicler Thietmar wrote that no man was wiser that he in all his actions, or of a worthier nature.Thietmar 2001, p. 21. Perhaps the highest testimony to Leopold's life and reputation came from the actions of Emperor Otto III, who immediately invested his son Henry I with his father's margravate. Although Leopold is not mentioned in the Babenberger Chronicle written by his descendant Otto of Freising—which only starts with Leopold's grandson Adalbert—he is known today as the progenitor of the Babenberg dynasty. Otto of Freising's claim of ancestry to the Franconian Babenbergs, who are remembered for the Babenberger insurgency of the early tenth century, has not been proven, but cannot be completely ruled out. In 1976, the millennial anniversary of Leopold's appointment as margrave was celebrated as a \\"Thousand Years of Austria\\". Celebrations under the same title were held twenty years later at the anniversary of the famous 996 Ostarrîchi document first mentioning the Old German name of Austria. Marriage Margravine Richardis, Babenberger Stammbaum Leopold married Richardis, the daughter of Count Ernest IV of Sualafeldgau (according to other sources of the Ezzonid count Erenfried II) and probably the aunt of Duke Adalbero of Carinthia.Lechner 1976, p. 45. Their marriage produced eight children: # Henry I (died 1018), second Margrave of Austria # Judith # Ernest I (died 1015), Duke of Swabia # Adalbert (985–1055), third Margrave of Austria # Poppo (986–1047), Archbishop of Trier # Kunigunda # Hemma, married Count Rapoto of Dießen # Christina, a nun at Trier References ;Citations ;Bibliography      External links * Leopold I.

Its plot follows Mary Henry, a young woman whose life is disturbed after a car accident. She relocates to a new city, where she finds herself unable to assimilate with the locals, and becomes drawn to the pavilion of an abandoned carnival. Director Harvey also appears in the film as a ghoulish stranger who stalks her throughout. Filmed in Lawrence, Kansas and Salt Lake City, Carnival of Souls was shot on a budget of $33,000, and Harvey employed various guerrilla filmmaking techniques to finish the production. It was Harvey's only feature film, and did not gain widespread attention when originally released as a double feature with The Devil's Messenger in 1962. Set to an organ score by Gene Moore, the film has been contemporarily noted by critics and film scholars for its cinematography and foreboding atmosphere.Siskel & Ebert-\\"Carnival of Souls\\" (Home Video) 1989 The film has a large cult following and is occasionally screened at film and Halloween festivals, and has been cited as a wide-ranging influence on numerous filmmakers, including David Lynch, George A. Romero, and Lucrecia Martel. Plot In Kansas, Mary Henry is riding in a car with two other young women when two men challenge them to a drag race. During the race, the women's car plunges off a bridge into a river. Three hours after the police start dredging the water to look for them, Mary miraculously surfaces on land, but cannot remember how she survived. Mary moves to Salt Lake City, where she has been hired as a church organist. While driving through the desert, Mary's radio starts playing nothing but strange organ music, and she has visions of a ghoulish, pasty- faced figure (simply called \\"The Man\\" in dialogue). She also sees a large, abandoned pavilion on the shores of the Great Salt Lake. A gas station attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before it closed. In town, Mary rents a room. She meets the proprietor who informs there is another lodger staying there. Mary unpacks her suitcase and goes to the church where she will be playing the organ. At the Church she meets the minister and plays the organ for the first time. At the minister's offer, Mary takes a ride out to the pavilion at the lake. She is stopped from entering by the minister who warns her that to enter would be illegal. When she returns to her lodgings Mary meets a man, John, the only other lodger, who wants to become better acquainted. The blonde newcomer though is not interested. That night, she becomes upset when she sees The Man downstairs and retreats to her room. Soon, Mary begins experiencing terrifying interludes when she becomes invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world, as if she simply is not there. When The Man appears briefly in front of her in a park, she flees, right into the arms of a Dr. Samuels. He tries to help her, acknowledging he is not a psychiatrist. Mary's new employer, the minister (Art Ellison), is put off when she declines a reception to meet the congregation. When she practices for the first time, she finds herself shifting from a hymn to eerie music. In a trance, she sees The Man and other ghouls dancing at the pavilion. The minister, hearing the strange music, denounces it as sacrilege and insists upon her resignation. Terrified of being alone, Mary agrees to go out with John. When they return home, he follows her to her bedroom door. John tries to convince Mary to let him stay the night, but she walks away, apparently uninterested. Nevertheless, he follows her to her bedroom, where she sees The Man in the mirror. Frightened, she tells John what has been happening to her. He leaves, believing she is losing her mind. After going back to Samuels' office, Mary believes she has to go to the pavilion. However, Mary is confronted by The Man and his fellow ghouls. She tries frantically to escape, boarding a bus to leave town, only to find that all the passengers are ghouls. It is just a nightmare; she awakes in her car. In the end, she is drawn back to the pavilion, where she finds her tormentors dancing, a pale version of herself paired with The Man. When she runs away, the ghouls chase her onto the beach. She collapses as they close in. The following day, Samuels, the minister, and police go to the pavilion to look for Mary. They find her footprints in the sand and they end abruptly. Back in Kansas, her car is pulled from the river. Mary's body is in the front seat alongside the other two women. Cast Production Conception Harvey was a director and producer of industrial and educational films based in Lawrence, Kansas, where he worked for the Centron Corporation. While returning to Kansas after shooting a Centron film in California, Harvey developed the idea for Carnival of Souls after driving past the abandoned Saltair Pavilion in Salt Lake City. \\"When I got back to Lawrence, I asked my friend and co-worker at Centron Films, John Clifford, who was a writer there, how he'd like to write a feature,\\" Harvey recalled. \\"The last scene, I told him, had to be a whole bunch of ghouls dancing in that ballroom; the rest was up to him. He wrote it in three weeks.\\" Casting In New York City, Harvey discovered then- twenty-year-old actress Candace Hilligoss, who had trained with Lee Strasberg, and cast her in the lead role of Mary Henry. Hilligoss had been offered a role in the Richard Hilliard-directed horror film Violent Midnight (1963), but opted for the role in Carnival of Souls. She stated that at the time, she took the role as a \\"take-the-money-and-run type of situation\\"; she was paid approximately $2,000 for her work in the film. Filming Harvey shot Carnival of Souls in three weeks on location in Lawrence and Salt Lake City. Harvey took three weeks off from his job at Centron in order to direct the film, starting with an initial production budget of $17,000. The $17,000 cash budget was raised by Harvey asking local businessmen if they were willing to invest $500 in Harvey's production. The other $13,000 of the total $30,000 budget was deferred. Harvey was able to secure the rental of the Saltair Pavilion for $50, and several other scenes, such as the scene featuring Mary in the department store, were shot guerrilla style, with Harvey paying off locals to allow the crew to quickly film. Hilligoss described the filming process as brisk, with the cast and crew working seven days a week. Harvey employed techniques he had learned in his work on industrial films in order to limit production costs. There was not enough money for a process screen to create a rear projection effect, which was the method typically used at that time to create the impression that a scene was taking place inside a moving car, by combining footage shot inside a static car with separate footage of a moving background. Instead, Harvey used a battery-powered hand-held Arriflex camera to film the shots inside moving cars, removing the need for compositing. The Arriflex, which was at that time more often used by cameramen filming newsreel footage, also allowed them to use a moving camera in other scenes without the need for gear like dollies or cranes. Harvey's assistant director was Reza Badiyi, a young Iranian immigrant who was just beginning his film work in the States. At this time, Reza had been second unit director on one other film, Robert Altman's directing debut The Delinquents, but would go on to make (amongst other notable work) some of the most well-known, iconic series openings and montages, including: Hawaii Five-O, Get Smart, and The Mary Tyler Moore Show.Reza Badiyi-IMDB The shot where the face of The Man appears in the car window was accomplished through the use of an angled mirror placed on the far side of the window. The scene at the start of the film where the car goes off the bridge and into the river was filmed in Lecompton, Kansas. The town did not charge a fee for the use of the bridge, only requiring the film crew to replace the bridge's damaged rails once they were done filming. This was done, at a cost of $38 for the new rails. Musical score Carnival of Souls features an original organ score by composer Gene Moore. Film and music scholar Julie Brown comments on the score, noting: \\"The organ is one of the spectral presences in Carnival of Souls, summoning up, or being summoned up by, the various allusions in the film to cinema's past.\\" Screenwriter John Clifford has stated that the locations Harvey chose for the film (particularly the Saltair Pavilion, and the grand church organ) influenced the decision to use an organ score. The onscreen depiction of the organ played by Mary was implemented by Harvey to add to the film's \\"Gothic look.\\" An original soundtrack album for Carnival of Souls was released in 1988, featuring Gene Moore's original musical score. Release Carnival of Souls had its world premiere at the Main Street Theatre in Lawrence, Kansas, in September 1962. While the US release of Carnival of Souls failed to include a copyright on the prints, automatically placing them in the public domain, the foreign release marketed by Walter Manley did contain a copyright card and was protected for overseas sales. The 35 mm theatrical prints were cut by Herz-Lion to 78 minutes Letterboxd which trimmed the camera original. However, the 16 mm television copies were printed complete and individually cut by each station to fit their time slot, which is why they vary in length. WOR-TV in New York City used to broadcast the film intact in a late night timeslot in the 1960s. The scenes cut by the theatrical distributor include a scene where Mary stops at a gas station and discusses the carnival building with the attendant, a longer dialogue sequence between the minister and carpenter and an extra scene where the doctor talks to the landlady. In 1989, the film was screened at festivals across Europe and the United States, affording it renewed public interest, and it has subsequently appeared at numerous Halloween film festivals. Prints of Carnival of Souls vary in length from 78 minutes in theatrical release to 84 minutes in the original cut. While some sources have erroneously listed the film at a 91-minute-runtime, Michael Weldon stated in The Psychotronic Video Guide to Film that the original theatrical cut of the film ran approximately 80 minutes. He also stated that the director's cut, which runs 84 minutes, is \\"the best and most complete version we'll ever see.\\" Reception Carnival of Souls went largely unnoticed by critics upon its initial release and received \\"delayed acclaim\\" in the ensuing decades, with numerous arthouse screenings in 1989 in conjunction with the Halloween season. It has since become regarded by many film schools as a classic, often praised for its lighting and sound design, in which \\"sight and sound come together... in a horrifying way.\\" Some scholars, such as S. S. Prawer, consider Carnival of Souls more an art film than a straightforward horror film. The Time Out film guide commended the film's \\"striking black-and-white compositions, disorienting dream sequences and eerie atmosphere,\\" adding that the film \\"has the feel of a silent German expressionist movie. Unfortunately, so does some of the acting, which suffers from exaggerated facial expressions and bizarre gesturing. But the mesmerising power of the carnival and dance-hall sequences far outweighs the corniness of the awkward intimate scenes.\\" Leonard Maltin gave Carnival of Souls 2½/4 stars, calling the film an \\"eerie\\" and \\"imaginative low budget effort.\\" Critic Roger Ebert likened the film to a \\"lost episode of The Twilight Zone,\\" noting it possessed an \\"intriguing power.\\" Joe Brown of The Washington Post remarked upon the film's cinematography, writing: \\"Harvey's camerawork gives a new twist to the word 'deadpan,' making the most mundane places and people imaginable seem like ghastly hallucinations, and the director shows a flair for elegantly employing existing locations and lighting for maximum disorientation value.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times saw the 1989 screening at the Fantasy Festival and wrote: \\"What has earned Carnival of Souls its reputation is the director's knack for building a mood of fatalistic angst.\\" TV Guide gave Carnival of Souls a score of three stars out of four, praising the film's atmosphere, acting, and eerie score, calling it, \\"A chilling ghost story with artistic pretensions.\\" Film Reel.com gave Carnival of Souls a positive review, praising the film's atmosphere, slow-building tension, and disturbing visuals.Carnival Of Souls-Film Reel Reviews-The Film Reel Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 86%, based on , with a rating average of 7.48/10. The site's consensus states that the film \\"offers delightfully chilling proof that when it comes to telling an effective horror story, less can often be much, much more\\". Home media Due to its public domain status in the United States, Carnival of Souls has been released in a significant number of formats through numerous distributors, which, according to film scholars Chris Vander Kaay and Kathleen Fernandez-Vander Kaay, has ensured it \\"a constant presence in the video market and [contributed to] its enduring cult popularity.\\" The Criterion Collection issued a 2-disc DVD set of the film in 2000, featuring both a 78-minute theatrical version and an extended 84-minute director's cut. In 2009, Legend Films released the film on DVD featuring both the black-and-white and a colorized version of the directors cut, including an audio commentary track by comedian Michael J. Nelson, a former writer and host of Mystery Science Theater 3000. In 2016, The Criterion Collection reissued the film on DVD, as well as premiering it on Blu-ray, featuring a new restoration. Legacy Carnival of Souls has gradually developed a cult following since its release and is now considered a low-budget classic. The film has since been included in multiple lists by various media outlets as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Complex magazine ranked Carnival of Souls number 39 on its list of the 50 scariest movies ever made. Slant Magazine placed the film at #32 on its \\"100 Best Horror Movies of All Time\\". Paste magazine ranked the film at #85 in its list of \\"100 Best Horror Movies of All Time\\". In 2012, the Academy Film Archive restored Carnival of Souls. The film has been named as a precursor to the works of various filmmakers, including David Lynch, George A. Romero, Lucrecia Martel Lucrecia Martel’s Closet Picks-Criterion Collection on YouTube and James Wan.CARNIVAL OF SOULS: The Art of Herk Harvey on Vimeo The film was used for a RiffTrax Live event in October 2016, where former Mystery Science Theater 3000 cast members Bill Corbett, Kevin Murphy and Michael J.

The remake has little in common with the 1962 film, borrowing little more than the revelation at the end. Sidney Berger, who had appeared in the original film as John Linden, appeared in a cameo in the remake. The remake followed the story of a young woman (Phillips) and her confrontation with her mother's murderer. The filmmakers had asked for Candace Hilligoss, the star of the first film, to also appear, but she declined, feeling that Clifford and the filmmakers of the remake had shown disrespect to her in initiating the film without consulting her or considering her treatment for a sequel to the 1962 version. The remake was marketed as Wes Craven Presents 'Carnival of Souls. It received negative appraisals from most reviewers Wes Craven Presents: Carnival of Souls (1998)-Rotten Tomatoes and did not manage to secure theatrical release, going direct-to-video. An unofficial remake of Carnival of Souls was released in 2008 under the title Yella, directed by Christian Petzold.

The coordinates of Wilson airport are:1° 19' 12.00\\"S, 36° 48' 54.00\\"E (Latitude:-1.320000; Longitude:36.815000). Overview The airport serves domestic and international traffic. It is used mostly by general aviation traffic. Industries that use Wilson Airport extensively include tourism, health care and agriculture. Wilson Airport averages traffic of around 120,000 landings and take-offs annually. Airkenya and other small airlines use Wilson Airport for scheduled domestic passenger services, instead of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Missionary aviation operators AMREF, Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) and AIM AIR use Wilson Airport as their airport base on the African continent. It is used also for flight training. The airport is under the supervision of Kenya Airports Authority (KAA). De Havilland Chipmunk trainers of the Kenya Air Force at Wilson Aerodrome in April 1973 As a result of faster check-in times and fewer flight delays, as compared to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Wilson Airport is commonly used by business executive aircraft for domestic and international travel. Common domestic destinations from Wilson Airport include Kisumu Airport, Mombasa International Airport and Eldoret International Airport. At above sea level, Wilson Airport has two asphalt runways: Runway 1 measures long and wide; Runway 2 measures long and wide. History The airport was established in 1929 by Florence Kerr Wilson, a wealthy widow as Nairobi West Aerodrome. Built at a cost of £50,000 (£3.2 million in 2020),Mrs Wilson hired Tom Campbell Black, a pilot to run the airport in which they had a brief affair. After the outbreak of World War 2 in 1939, the airport, its aircraft fleet and its pilots were taken over by the then colonial government and made a Royal Air Force base until after the war where it continued functioning as a civilian airport. In 1962, it was named Wilson Airport in honor of its founder who died in 1968.https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/lifestyle/society/How- woman-one-plane-venture-grew-into-modern-Wilson- Airport/3405664-3408044-9kpct4/index.html Airlines and destinations Accidents and incidents *On 24 December 1968, Douglas C-47A 5Y-ADI of the Kenya Police Air Wing was damaged beyond economic repair.

His business acumen and contacts eventually made Holcombe a millionaire. Six years after founding his business, in 1921, Holcombe won his first term as mayor. He served as mayor from 1921 to 1929. Holcombe was defeated in the 1929 election by Walter Monteith, who supported a more fiscally conservative approach. Holcombe ran for mayor again in 1931, promising to do more for the unemployed, but Monteith was elected again. Holcombe served subsequent mayoral terms from 1933 to 1937, 1939 to 1941, 1947 to 1953, and 1956 to 1958. His administrations were considered to be conservative and pro-business, though Holcombe was also aggressive about expanding the city's boundaries and improving public services (such as libraries, a municipal auditorium, and an improved sewage system). Holcombe married Mary Grey Miller on May 3, 1912.

Moraes began his training in Capoeira de Angola at the age of eight. His father was also a Capoeirista, or practitioner of Capoeira Angola, the traditional style of Capoeira in Bahia, Brazil. At the time he began studying capoeira in the 1950s, he trained at the academy of Vicente Ferreira Pastinha. However, by that time Pastinha was blind with and no longer taught classes. The academy was run by Pastinha's students João Grande and João Pequeno, who taught classes. He states that he is truly the student of João Grande due to the impression made on the young Moraes by the inspiring way that João Grande played capoeira. In 1970, while in the employ of the Brazilian military, he left Salvador for Rio de Janeiro, where he stayed for twelve years. To preserve and transmit his mentors' teachings, he founded Grupo Capoeira Angola Pelourinho (GCAP) in 1980, and two years later he moved with his organisation back to Salvador. His aim was to return to capoeira's philosophical bases and its African, specifically Angolan roots, and to turn away from the more commercial and martial-arts aspects. Moraes is a strong advocate of the Angola style of capoeira, and believes that the source of capoeira is the n'golo, or 'zebra dance', a ritual combat performed by young warriors in southwestern Angola. He codified the Angolan musical style, and defined its basic instrumental ensemble, and requires GCAP's members to be versed in all aspects of capoeira Angola's music. Moraes has stated his idea of capoeira Angola's basic philosophy: \\"The capoeira ring, whose geometric form facilitates the propagation of energy, is one of the symbolic representations of the 'macro' world. The movements we make inside this ring symbolise the adversities we encounter in life, which we often don't know how to deal with. In the game of life, our opponents, in most cases, know nothing of capoeira, but have movements peculiar to their own game, which we should be able to interpret and understand in their context, taking the capoeira ring as a point of reference. Playing in the ring, we succeed in establishing a fusion between playful elements and respect for the other person. But the ring isn't reality: the world is. If we win in this ring, we can take the other one too!\\" Moraes lives in Salvador, Bahia, where he divides his time between teaching English and Portuguese at a public school, and directing GCAP which now exists as more of a cultural outreach project which trains older visiting students as well as children who would otherwise not have a direction in which to put their energies. He is the teacher of Cinézio Feliciano Peçanha. They parted ways in the 1990s over organizational differences.

The original design was proposed in the 1940 IRE paper, A New Standard Volume Indicator and Reference Level, written by experts from CBS, NBC, and Bell Telephone Laboratories. The Acoustical Society of America then standardized it in 1942 (ANSI C16.5-1942) for use in telephone installation and radio broadcast stations. Consumer audio equipment often features VU meters, both for utility purposes (e.g. in recording equipment) and for aesthetics (in playback devices). Surround audio VU meter graphic The original VU meter is a passive electromechanical device, namely a 200 µA DC d'Arsonval movement ammeter fed from a full-wave copper-oxide rectifier mounted within the meter case. The mass of the needle causes a relatively slow response, which in effect integrates or smooths the signal, with a rise time of 300 ms. This has the effect of averaging out peaks and troughs of short duration, and reflects the perceived loudness of the material more closely than the more modern and initially more expensive PPM meters. For this reason many audio practitioners prefer the VU meter to its alternatives, though the meter indication does not reflect some of the key features of the signal, most notably its peak level, which in many cases, must not pass a defined limit. 0 VU is equal to +4 dBu, or 1.228 volts RMS, a power of about 2.5 milliwatts when applied across a 600-ohm load. 0 VU is often referred to as \\"0 dB\\".VU Meter. The meter was designed not to measure the signal, but to let users aim the signal level to a target level of 0 VU (sometimes labelled 100%), so it is not important that the device is non-linear and imprecise for low levels. In effect, the scale ranges from −20 VU to +3 VU, with −3 VU right in the middle. Purely electronic devices may emulate the response of the needle; they are VU- meters in as much as they respect the standard. In the broadcast industry, loudness monitoring was standardized, in 2009 in the United States by the ATSC A/85, in 2010 in Europe by the EBU R-128, in 2011 in Japan by the TR-B32, and in 2010 in Australia by the OP-59.  Lead  The original designers of the VU meter were tasked with finding a way to measure complex audio signals with a simple technology. Since a VU meter is a mechanical device, it can never reflect the instantaneous signal peaks of complex audio signals. The designers of the VU meter therefore took a different approach. They created a meter that did not measure peaks, but simply inferred them. A real VU meter has a very specific \\"ballistic characteristic\\". This means that it responds to changing audio signals at a very precise speed, rising from no signal to 99% of \\"0 VU\\" when a 1 kHz sine wave tone is applied for 300 milliseconds. When using a VU meter, the audio system is calibrated with a sine wave tone at a \\"reference level\\" for the system. At the reference level, the VU meter shows \\"0\\" for a sine-wave tone, but the engineer must know that, with music or speech, to always infer that peak levels are always between 6 dB and 10 dB higher than the reference level. The usefulness of the VU meter comes from the fact that for most types of audio sources the system engineer can count on these peaks being within this range and can design the audio system with confidence. Good engineering practice is to always build in a little extra \\"headroom\\", as it is called, to cover the strange conditions where an audio signal might exceed normal peak levels or the equipment operator fails to adjust the levels correctly. Typically the levels considered when designing systems using a VU meter are: * Reference level (typically +4 dBu, valid with tones only); * Standard output level (10 dB above reference, typical peak levels); * Clip level (6 dB above standard output level, \\"headroom\\" to allow for unusual conditions)  Standard characteristics  The behaviour of VU meters is defined in ANSI C16.5-1942, British Standard BS 6840, and IEC 60268-17.  Reference level   Rise time  The response of a VU meter (black line) compared to instantaneous input level (grey area) of a drum beat. Level is in dB and time is in seconds The rise time, defined as the time it takes for the needle to reach 99% of the distance to 0 VU when the VU-meter is submitted to a signal that steps from 0 to a level that reads 0 VU, is 300 ms. The overshoot must be within 1 to 1.5%. The fall time is the same as the rise time, 300 ms.  Frequency response  The level specification is meant at 1000 Hz. The reading should not depart from the reading at 1000 Hz by more than 0.2 dB from 35 Hz to 10 kHz or more than 0.5 dB between 25 Hz and 16 kHz. Note that the specification mentions only sinusoid waveforms. Given the electromechanical principle of the meter, the deviation of the needle is actually approximately proportional to the average of the part of the signal with more than approximately 0.4 V instantaneously because of the two copper- oxide rectifiers always in series, which transfer function curve has a knee around 0.2 V. Signals generally do not have a sinusoidal waveform by far, even if they all fall within the VU-meter bandpass. The reading is the average of the voltage,Average Voltage Tutorial and is not an indication of the power of the signal, which is proportional to the average of the square of the voltage, or the root-mean-square (RMS) value. As a conventional VU reading, however, it served its purpose as an indication a) of the overall level and dynamics of the signal and b) of the proximity to the maximum admitted level, to the operators of recording and broadcasting equipment. Maintenance staff could also use it as a measurement apparatus, to check for losses in transmissions and level alignment, provided that they used exclusively sine waves as test signals.  Impedance  The VU meter and its attenuator should present a 7,500-ohm impedance to the circuit it is applied to, measured with a sinusoid signal that sets the indicator to 0 dB.  History  Neon bar graph VU meter The VU-meter was originally developed in 1939 by the combined effort of Bell Labs and broadcasters CBS and NBC. In the 1970s–80s, neon-filled, planar dual display dekatrons with up to 201 segments per stereo channel were popular among broadcasters as fast bar graph VU meters.  Other level meters  The consumer audio industry often uses volume indicators that do not comply with any standard.Meter Madness – Mike Rivers. BBC sound engineers would refer to the VU meter as the \\"Virtually Useless\\" meter, preferring the PPM. Academic research has shown that a SVI or VU meter behaves differently to the average value and RMS meters. The ballistics shown by this instrument in response to signals with large crest factor position its readings halfway between both. For example, an increment of 3 dB in the crest factor of an audio signal gives approximately a fall of −3 dB in a RMS meter, −6 dB in an average meter, and −4 dB in a VU meter.Method to Evaluate the Ballistics of Audio Meters – Victor M.

W. F. Hegel and Friedrich Schelling, both of whom were German idealist philosophers in the 19th century. The label has also been attached to others such as Josiah Royce, an American philosopher who was greatly influenced by Hegel's work, and the British idealists.Absolute Idealism – Britannica.comThe term ' occurs for the first time in Schelling's Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur als Einleitung in das Studium dieser Wissenschaft (Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature: as Introduction to the Study of this Science), Vol. 1, P. Krüll, 1803 [1797], p. 80. A form of idealism, absolute idealism is Hegel's account of how being is ultimately comprehensible as an all-inclusive whole (das Absolute). Hegel asserted that in order for the thinking subject (human reason or consciousness) to be able to know its object (the world) at all, there must be in some sense an identity of thought and being. Otherwise, the subject would never have access to the object and we would have no certainty about any of our knowledge of the world. To account for the differences between thought and being, however, as well as the richness and diversity of each, the unity of thought and being cannot be expressed as the abstract identity \\"A=A\\". Absolute idealism is the attempt to demonstrate this unity using a new \\"speculative\\" philosophical method, which requires new concepts and rules of logic. According to Hegel, the absolute ground of being is essentially a dynamic, historical process of necessity that unfolds by itself in the form of increasingly complex forms of being and of consciousness, ultimately giving rise to all the diversity in the world and in the concepts with which we think and make sense of the world. The absolute idealist position dominated philosophy in nineteenth-century England and Germany, while exerting significantly less influence in the United States. The absolute idealist position should be distinguished from the subjective idealism of Berkeley, the transcendental idealism of Kant, or the post-Kantian transcendental idealism (also known as critical idealism)Frederick C. Beiser, German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781-1801, Harvard University Press, 2002, p. 3. of Fichte and of the early Schelling.Nectarios G. Limnatis, German Idealism and the Problem of Knowledge: Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, Springer, 2008, pp. 138, 166, 177. Schelling and Hegel's Absolute Dieter Henrich characterised Hegel's conception of the absolute as follows: “The absolute is the finite to the extent to which the finite is nothing at all but negative relation to itself” (Henrich 1982, p. 82). As Bowie describes it, Hegel's system depends upon showing how each view and positing of how the world really is has an internal contradiction: \\"This necessarily leads thought to more comprehensive ways of grasping the world, until the point where there can be no more comprehensive way because there is no longer any contradiction to give rise to it.\\" For Hegel, the interaction of opposites generates, in a dialectical fashion, all concepts we use in order to understand the world. Moreover, this development occurs not only in the individual mind, but also throughout history. In The Phenomenology of Spirit, for example, Hegel presents a history of human consciousness as a journey through stages of explanations of the world. Each successive explanation created problems and oppositions within itself, leading to tensions which could only be overcome by adopting a view that could accommodate these oppositions in a higher unity. At the base of spirit lies a rational development. This means that the Absolute itself is exactly that rational development. For example, the assertion that \\"All reality is spirit\\" means that all of reality rationally orders itself and while doing so creates the oppositions we find in it. Even nature is not different from spirit (German: Geist) since nature is ordered by the determinations given to us by spirit. Nature, as that which is not spirit is so determined by spirit, therefore it follows that nature is not absolutely other, but understood as other and therefore not essentially alien. The aim of Hegel was to show that we do not relate to the world as if it is other from us, but that we continue to find ourselves back into that world. With the realisation that both the mind and the world are ordered according to the same rational principles, our access to the world has been made secure, a security which was lost after Kant proclaimed the thing-in-itself (Ding an sich) to be ultimately inaccessible. In addition to the dialectic element of the Absolute, Hegel frequently equated it with the Christian conceptions of God, formulating the concept of God as a dialectic between the I and the Other; an Absolute Identity: > In the religion of absolute Spirit the outward form of God is not made by > the human spirit. God Himself is, in accordance with the true Idea, self- > consciousness which exists in and for itself, Spirit. He produces Himself of > His own act, appears as Being for “Other”; He is, by His own act, the Son; > in the assumption of a definite form as the Son, the other part of the > process is present, namely, that God loves the Son, posits Himself as > identical with Him, yet also as distinct from Him. The assumption of form > makes its appearance in the aspect of determinate Being as independent > totality, but as a totality which is retained within love; here, for the > first time, we have Spirit in and for itself. The self-consciousness of the > Son regarding Himself is at the same time His knowledge of the Father; in > the Father the Son has knowledge of His own self, of Himself. At our present > stage, on the contrary, the determinate existence of God as God is not > existence posited by Himself, but by what is Other. Here Spirit has stopped > short half way. The importance of 'love' within the formulation of the Absolute has also been cited by Hegel throughout his works: > The life of God — the life which the mind apprehends and enjoys as it rises > to the absolute unity of all things — may be described as a play of love > with itself; but this idea sinks to an edifying truism, or even to a > platitude, when it does not embrace in it the earnestness, the pain, the > patience, and labor, involved in the negative aspect of things. Yet Hegel did not see Christianity per se as the route through which one reaches the Absolute, but used its religious system as an historical exemplar of Absolute Spirit. Arriving at such an Absolute was the domain of philosophy and theoretical inquiry. For Hegel speculative philosophy presented the religious content in an elevated, self-aware form. Thus the play between opposites, totalizing all 'difference' not just 'similarity' or identity results in a system of the Absolute, one not so much transcendental from these differences and similarities but arising therefrom, an Absolute 'whole'. To put it another way, Absolute Knowledge or Consciousness is the passing through of different consciousnesses, the historical experience of difference, of the Other, to get to a total Oneness (Universe) of multiplicity and self- consciousness. This is a variation, if not a transformation, of Hegel's German Idealist predecessor Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling (1775–1854), who argued for a philosophy of Identity: > ‘Absolute identity’ is, then, the link of the two aspects of being, which, > on the one hand, is the universe, and, on the other, is the changing > multiplicity which the knowable universe also is. Schelling insists now that > “The I think, I am, is, since Descartes, the basic mistake of all knowledge; > thinking is not my thinking, and being is not my being, for everything is > only of God or the totality” (SW I/7, p. 148), so the I is ‘affirmed’ as a > predicate of the being by which it is preceded. Yet this Absolute is different from Hegel's, which necessarily a telos or end result of the dialectic of multiplicities of consciousness throughout human history. For Schelling, the Absolute is a causeless 'ground' upon which relativity (difference and similarity) can be discerned by human judgement (and thus permit 'freedom' itself) and this ground must be simultaneously not of the 'particular' world of finites but also not wholly different from them (or else there would be no commensurability with empirical reality, objects, sense data, etc. to be compared as 'relative' or otherwise): > The particular is determined in judgements, but the truth of claims about > the totality cannot be proven because judgements are necessarily > conditioned, whereas the totality is not. Given the relative status of the > particular there must, though, be a ground which enables us to be aware of > that relativity, and this ground must have a different status from the > knowable world of finite particulars. At the same time, if the ground were > wholly different from the world of relative particulars the problems of > dualism would recur. As such the absolute is the finite, but we do not know > this in the manner we know the finite. Without the presupposition of > ‘absolute identity’, therefore, the evident relativity of particular > knowledge becomes inexplicable, since there would be no reason to claim that > a revised judgement is predicated of the same world as the preceding — now > false — judgement. In both Schelling and Hegel's 'systems' (especially the latter), the project aims towards a completion of metaphysics in such a way as to prioritize rational thinking (Vernuft), individual freedom, and philosophical and historical progress into a unity. Inspired by the system-building of previous Enlightenment thinkers like Immanuel Kant, Schelling and Hegel pushed Idealism into new ontological territory (especially notable in Hegel's The Science of Logic (1812-16)), wherein a 'concept' of thought and its content are not distinguished, as Redding describes it: > While opinions divide as to how Hegel’s approach to logic relates to that of > Kant, it is important to grasp that for Hegel logic is not simply a science > of the form of our thoughts. It is also a science of actual content as well, > and as such has an ontological dimension. Therefore, syllogisms of logic like those espoused in the ancient world by Aristotle and crucial to the logic of Medieval philosophy, became not simply abstractions like mathematical equations but ontological necessities to describe existence itself, and therefore to be able to derive 'truth' from such existence using reason and the dialectic method of understanding. Whereas rationality was the key to completing Hegel's philosophical system, Schelling could not accept the absolutism prioritzed to Reason. Bowie elaborates on this: > Hegel's system tries to obviate the facticity of the world by understanding > reason as the world's immanent self-articulation. Schelling, in contrast, > insists that human reason cannot explain its own existence, and therefore > cannot encompass itself and its other within a system of philosophy. We > cannot, [Schelling] maintains, make sense of the manifest world by beginning > with reason, but must instead begin with the contingency of being and try to > make sense of it with the reason which is only one aspect of it and which > cannot be explained in terms of its being a representation of the true > nature of being. Schelling's scepticism towards the prioritization of reason in the dialectic system constituting the Absolute, therefore pre-empted the vast body of philosophy that would react against Hegelianism in the modern era. Schelling's view of reason, however, was not to discard it, as would Nietzsche, but on the contrary, to use nature as its embodiment. For Schelling, reason was an organic 'striving' in nature (not just anthropocentric) and this striving was one in which the subject and the object approached an identity. Schelling saw reason as the link between spirit and the phenomenal world, as Lauer explains: \\"For Schelling [...] nature is not the negative of reason, to be submitted to it as reason makes the world its home, but has since its inception been turning itself into a home for reason.\\" In Schelling's Further Presentation of My System of Philosophy (Werke Ergänzungsband I, 391-424), he argued that the comprehension of a thing is done through reason only when we see it in a whole. So Beiser (p. 17) explains: > The task of philosophical construction is then to grasp the identity of each > particular with the whole of all things. To gain such knowledge we should > focus upon a thing by itself, apart from its relations to anything else; we > should consider it as a single, unique whole, abstracting from all its > properties, which are only its partial aspects, and which relate it to other > things. Just as in mathematical construction we abstract from all the > accidental features of a figure (it is written with chalk, it is on a > blackboard) to see it as a perfect exemplar of some universal truth, so in > philosophical construction we abstract from all the specific properties of > an object to see it in the absolute whole. Hegel's doubts about intellectual intuition's ability to prove or legitimate that the particular is in identity with whole, led him to progressively formulate the system of the dialectic, now known as the Hegelian dialectic, in which concepts like the Aufhebung came to be articulated in the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807). Beiser (p. 19) summarises the early formulation as follows: > a) Some finite concept, true of only a limited part of reality, would go > beyond its limits in attempting to know all of reality. It would claim to be > an adequate concept to describe the absolute because, like the absolute, it > has a complete or self-sufficient meaning independent of any other concept. > b) This claim would come into conflict with the fact that the concept > depends for its meaning on some other concept, having meaning only in > contrast to its negation. There would then be a contradiction between its > claim to independence and its de facto dependence upon another concept. c) > The only way to resolve the contradiction would be to reinterpret the claim > to independence, so that it applies not just to one concept to the exclusion > of the other but to the whole of both concepts. Of course, the same stages > could be repeated on a higher level, and so on, until we come to the > complete system of all concepts, which is alone adequate to describe the > absolute. Hegel's innovation in the history of German idealism was for a self- consciousness or self-questioning, that would lead to a more inclusive, holistic rationality of the world. The synthesis of one concept, deemed independently true per se, with another contradictory concept (e.g. the first is in fact dependent on some other thing), leads to the history of rationality, throughout human (largely European) civilisation. For the German Idealists like Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, the extrapolation or universalisation of the human process of contradiction and reconciliation, whether conceptually, theoretically, or emotionally, were all movements of the universe itself. It is understandable then, why so many philosophers saw deep problems with Hegel's all-encompassing attempt at fusing anthropocentric and Eurocentric epistemology, ontology, and logic into a singular system of thought that would admit no alternative. Neo-Hegelianism Neo-Hegelianism is a school (or schools) of thought associated and inspired by the works of Hegel. It refers mainly to the doctrines of an idealist school of philosophers that were prominent in Great Britain and in the United States between 1870 and 1920. The name is also sometimes applied to cover other philosophies of the period that were Hegelian in inspiration—for instance, those of Benedetto Croce and of Giovanni Gentile. Hegelianism after Hegel Although Hegel died in 1831, his philosophy still remains highly debated and discussed. In politics, there was a developing schism, even before his death, between right Hegelians and left Hegelians. The latter specifically took on political dimensions in the form of Marxism. In the philosophy of religion, Hegel's influence soon became very powerful in the English-speaking world. The British school, called British idealism and partly Hegelian in inspiration, included Thomas Hill Green, Bernard Bosanquet, F. H. Bradley, William Wallace, and Edward Caird. It was importantly directed towards political philosophy and political and social policy, but also towards metaphysics and logic, as well as aesthetics. America saw the development of a school of Hegelian thought move toward pragmatism. German twentieth-century neo-Hegelians In Germany there was a neo-Hegelianism (Neuhegelianismus) of the early twentieth century, partly developing out of the Neo-Kantians. Richard Kroner wrote one of its leading works, a history of German idealism from a Hegelian point of view. Other notable neo-Hegelians *Karl Marx (1818–1883), a German philosopher, economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist and socialist revolutionary. *Francis Herbert Bradley (1846–1924), a British absolute idealist who adapted Hegel's Metaphysics. *Bernard Bosanquet (1848–1923), a British idealist and speculative philosopher who had an important influence in political philosophy and public and social policy. *Josiah Royce (1855–1916), an American defender of absolute idealism. *Benedetto Croce (1866–1952), an Italian philosopher who defended Hegel's account on how we understand history. Croce wrote primarily on topics of aesthetics, such as artistic inspiration/intuition and personal expression. *Giovanni Gentile (1875–1944), important philosopher within the fascist movement. Ghost-wrote \\"The Doctrine of Fascism\\". *Alexandre Kojève (1902–1968), gave rise to a new understanding of Hegel in France during the 1930s. His lectures were attended by a small but influential group of intellectuals including Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, Maurice Merleau- Ponty, André Breton, Jacques Lacan, Raymond Aron, Roger Caillois, Michel Leiris, Henry Corbin, and Jean Hyppolite, and influenced Jean-Paul Sartre. Criticisms Exponents of analytic philosophy, which has been the dominant form of Anglo-American philosophy for most of the last century, have criticised Hegel's work as hopelessly obscure. Existentialists also criticise Hegel for ultimately choosing an essentialistic whole over the particularity of existence. Epistemologically, one of the main problems plaguing Hegel's system is how these thought determinations have bearing on reality as such. A perennial problem of his metaphysics seems to be the question of how spirit externalises itself and how the concepts it generates can say anything true about nature. At the same time, they will have to, because otherwise Hegel's system concepts would say nothing about something that is not itself a concept and the system would come down to being only an intricate game involving vacuous concepts. Schopenhauer Schopenhauer noted that Hegel created his absolute idealism after Kant had discredited all proofs of God's existence. The Absolute is a non-personal substitute for the concept of God. It is the one subject that perceives the universe as one object. Individuals share in parts of this perception. Since the universe exists as an idea in the mind of the Absolute, absolute idealism copies Spinoza's pantheism in which everything is in God or Nature. Moore and Russell Famously, G. E. Moore’s rebellion against absolutism found expression in his defense of common sense against the radically counter-intuitive conclusions of absolutism (e.g. time is unreal, change is unreal, separateness is unreal, imperfection is unreal, etc.). G. E. Moore also pioneered the use of logical analysis against the absolutists, which Bertrand Russell promulgated and used in order to begin the entire tradition of analytic philosophy with its use against the philosophies of his direct predecessors. In recounting his own mental development Russell reports, \\"For some years after throwing over [absolutism] I had an optimistic riot of opposite beliefs. I thought that whatever Hegel had denied must be true.\\" (Russell in Barrett and Adkins 1962, p. 477) Also: Pragmatism Particularly the works of William James and F. C. S. Schiller, both founding members of pragmatism, made lifelong assaults on Absolute Idealism. James was particularly concerned with the monism that Absolute Idealism engenders, and the consequences this has for the problem of evil, free will, and moral action. Schiller, on the other hand, attacked Absolute Idealism for being too disconnected with our practical lives, and argued that its proponents failed to realize that thought is merely a tool for action rather than for making discoveries about an abstract world that fails to have any impact on us. Absolute idealism has greatly altered the philosophical landscape. Paradoxically, (though, from a Hegelian point of view, maybe not paradoxically at all) this influence is mostly felt in the strong opposition it engendered. Both logical positivism and Analytic philosophy grew out of a rebellion against Hegelianism prevalent in England during the 19th century. \\"Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the analytic tradition—such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism, existentialism, or Marxism—feel it necessary to define their position in relation to analytic philosophy.\\" John Searle (2003) Contemporary Philosophy in the United States in N. Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy, 2nd ed., (Blackwell, 2003), p. 1. Continental phenomenology, existentialism and post-modernism also seek to 'free themselves from Hegel's thought'. Martin Heidegger, one of the leading figures of Continental philosophy in the 20th century, sought to distance himself from Hegel's work. One of Heidegger's philosophical themes was \\"overcoming metaphysics\\".

He was a member of the House of Babenberg. He was canonized on 6 January 1485 and became the patron saint of Austria, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, and Vienna. His feast day is 15 November.Lingelbach 1913, pp. 90–91. Life Leopold was born at Babenberg castle in Gars am Kamp, the son of Margrave Leopold II and Ida of Formbach- Ratelnberg. The Babenbergs had come to Austria from Bavaria where the family had risen to prominence in the 10th Century. He grew up in the diocese of Passau under the influence of the reformer Bishop Altmann of Passau. In 1096 Leopold succeeded his father as margrave of Austria at the age of 23. He married twice. His first wife, who died in 1105, may have been one of the von Perg family. The following year he married Agnes, the widowed sister of Emperor Henry V whom he had supported against her father Henry IV. This connection to the Salians raised the importance of the House of Babenberg, to which important royal rights over the margravate of Austria were granted. Also, Agnes had influential connections through her previous marriage to Frederick of Hohenstaufen, one of her sons being Conrad III of Germany. Leopold called himself \\"Princeps Terræ\\", a reflection of his sense of territorial independence. He was considered a candidate in the election of the Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire in 1125, but declined this honour. He is mainly remembered for the development of the country and, in particular, the founding of several monasteries. His most important foundation is Klosterneuburg (1108). According to legend, the Virgin Mary appeared to him and led him to a place where he found the veil of his wife Agnes, who had lost it years earlier. He established the Klosterneuburg Monastery there. He subsequently expanded the settlement to become his residence. Leopold also founded the monasteries of Heiligenkreuz, Kleinmariazell and Seitenstetten which developed a territory still largely covered by forest. All of these induced the church to canonize him in 1485. Leopold also fostered the development of cities, such as Klosterneuburg, Vienna and Krems. The last one was granted the right to mint but never attained great importance. The writings of Henry of Melk and Ava of Göttweig, which are the first literary texts from Austria, date back to Leopold's time. He is buried in the Klosterneuburg Monastery, which he founded. His skull is kept in an embroidered reliquary, which leaves the forehead exposed; it also wears an archducal hat. In 1663, under the rule of his namesake Emperor Leopold I, he was declared patron saint of Austria instead of Saint Koloman. The brothers Joseph and Michael Haydn, each of whom sang in the choir of St. Stephen's Cathedral, both sang in that capacity at Klosterneuburg on this day. Joseph Haydn later became the more famous composer of the two. Michael Haydn later (1805) wrote a Mass in honour of Leopold, the Missa sub titulo Sancti Leopoldi. Since the death of King Leopold I, the King's Feast is celebrated in Belgium on Leopold's feast day. Children By his first marriage, possibly to a lady of the Perg family: * Adalbert or Albert II The Devout, Markgraf (1136–1137), d. 1137 By his second wife, Agnes of Germany, widow of Frederick I, Duke of Swabia: * Leopold IV * Henry II Jasomirgott. * Berta, m.

It was shut down in December 2002 as a result of a lawsuit by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Origin According to John Deep, a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Madster software was originally inspired by his daughter's use of instant messaging software. His idea was to combine instant messaging with file sharing. John Deep's daughter Aimee had an interest in providing privacy to her online friends; instant messaging was lacking when it came to privacy protection. Features The Control Panel and File Search windows in Madster showing search results after a search for \\"Bob Dylan\\".The Madster service was initially called Aimster, but it was later renamed to Madster due to concerns that the Aimster name infringed AOL's AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) trademark. The Madster software allowed users to share files via instant messaging services. In particular, users could share files specifically with users who were included on a \\"buddy list\\" with the advantage of privacy. Around March 2001, support for encrypted network communications was included in a new release of the Madster software (at the time, the Aimster name was still in use.) Among other things, the Madster service hoped that the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act would have the effect of prohibiting others from monitoring the encrypted Madster network communications. In addition, the Madster operators argued that the encryption meant that they could not be aware of any copyright infringement that took place. Later on, around April-May 2001, a service was introduced wherein a network including tens of thousands of people could be searched for music and other content and new users would by default be added to this network although users could choose to instead restrict trading to buddy list members. At one point, the company announced a premium service that was available for US$4.95 per month. PC Magazine gave Madster a 1 out of 5 rating of \\"Dismal,\\" based on interface design, partner advertising, and content selection. Recording industry collaboration In 2000, for a short time, Capitol Records authorized Madster (which was called Aimster at the time) to provide some Radiohead video files on the service's Web site and to release a skin for the Madster software that had a Radiohead theme. This collaboration was done for the purpose of promoting a new Radiohead album. Legal difficulties and shutdown In December 2002, the company was ordered by a federal judge to disconnect its computer systems from the Internet. Earlier on in September, the court stated that Aimster had knowledge of copyright infringements, including a Web-based \\"Aimster Guardian\\" tutorial that showed copyrighted materials and the tracking of popular songs on the service via \\"Club Aimster\\"; the latter also indicated contribution to infringing activity and the monthly fees for the service indicated a financial interest for the Aimster operators in conjunction with infringing usage. The requirement for users to sign up and log in to use the service meant that Aimster was in a position to control the activities of its users. The injunction to disconnect was upheld in June 2003 by the decision in In re Aimster Copyright Litigation of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In particular, it was found that Madster's support of encrypted file sharing was \\"willful blindness\\" and was not a valid defense with regard to copyright infringement. At the same time, a company could avoid copyright liability if it was \\"highly burdensome\\" for the company to detect and prevent copyright infringement. In January 2004, the US Supreme Court refused without explanation to hear an appeal of the lower court's ruling. Madster was represented in court by Boies, Schiller & Flexner, the same law firm which defended Napster. In 2005, Deep sued Boies for malpractice and misappropriation, but ultimately lost the case in 2008.

Cyclopentadienyl ligands almost invariably bind to metals as a pentahapto (η5-) bonding mode. The metal–cyclopentadienyl interaction is typically drawn as a single line from the metal center to the center of the Cp ring.Elschenbroich, C. \\"Organometallics\\" (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. Examples Biscyclopentadienyl complexes are called metallocenes. A famous example of this type of complex is ferrocene (FeCp2), which has many analogues for other metals, such as chromocene (CrCp2), cobaltocene (CoCp2), and nickelocene (NiCp2). When the Cp rings are mutually parallel the compound is known as a sandwich complex. This area of organometallic chemistry was first developed in the 1950s. Bent metallocenes are represented by compounds of the type [MCp2Lx]. Some are catalysts for ethylene polymerization. Metallocenes are often thermally stable, and find use as catalysts in various types of reactions. Mixed-ligand Cp complexes containing Cp ligand and one or more other ligands. They are more numerous. One widely studied example is the Fp dimer, (Cp2Fe2(CO)4). Monometallic compounds featuring only one Cp ring are often known as half sandwich compounds or as piano stool compounds, one example being cyclopentadienylmanganese tricarbonyl (CpMn(CO)3). Bonding modes All 5 carbon atoms of a Cp ligand are bound to the metal in the vast majority of M–Cp complexes. This bonding mode is called η5-coordination. The M–Cp bonding arises from overlap of the five π molecular orbitals of the Cp ligand with the s, p, and d orbitals on the metal. This π bonding is significant, hence these complexes are referred to as π-complexes. Almost all of the transition metals, that is, group 4 to 10 metals, employ this coordination mode. In relatively rare cases, Cp binds to metals via only one carbon center. These types of interactions are described as σ-complexes because they only have a σ bond between the metal and the cyclopentadienyl group. Typical examples of this type of complex are group 14 metal complexes such as CpSiMe3. An example of both is (Cp2Fe(CO)2).. It is probable that η1-Cp complexes are intermediates in the formation of η5-Cp complexes. Still rarer, the Cp unit can bond to the metal via a three-carbons. In these η3-Cp complexes, the bonding resembles that in allyl ligands. Such complexes, sometimes called \\"slipped Cp complexes\\", are invoked as intermediates in ring slipping reactions. Synthesis of Cp complexes The compounds are generally prepared by salt metathesis reactions of alkali-metal cyclopentadienyl compounds with transition metal chlorides. Sodium cyclopentadienide (NaCp) and lithium cyclopentadienide are commonly used. Trimethylsilylcyclopentadiene cyclopentadienylthallium (CpTl) are alternative sources. For the preparation of some particularly robust complexes, e.g. nickelocene, cyclopentadiene is employed in the presence of a conventional base such as KOH. When only a single Cp ligand is installed, the other ligands typically carbonyl, halogen, alkyl, and hydride. Most Cp complexes are prepared by substitution of preformed Cp complexes by replacement of halide, CO, and other simple ligands.

The angle between the two Cp rings is fixed. Rotation of the rings about the metal-centroid axis is stopped as well. A related class of derivatives give rise to the constrained geometry complexes. In these cases, a Cp ligand as linked to a non-Cp ligand. Such complexes have been commercialized for the production of polypropylene. Bulky Cp ligands Pentamethylcyclopentadiene gives rise to pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) complexes. These ligands are more basic and more lipophilic. Replacing methyl groups with larger substituents results in cyclopentadienes that are so encumbered that pentaalkyl derivatives are no longer possible. Well-studied ligands of this type include C5R4H- (R = iso-Pr) and 1,2,4-C5R3H2- (R = tert- Bu). Constrained geometry complexes Constrained geometry complexes are related to ansa-metallocenes except that one ligand is not Cp-related. Applications Cp metal complexes are mainly used as stoichiometric reagents in chemical research. Ferrocenium reagents are oxidants. Cobaltocene is a strong, soluble reductant. Derivatives of Cp2TiCl2 and Cp2ZrCl2 are the basis of some reagents in organic synthesis. Upon treatment with aluminoxane, these dihalides give catalysts for olefin polymerization. Such species are called Kaminsky-type catalysts.

The Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC), formerly the Kenyatta International Conference Centre, is a 28-story building located in Nairobi, Kenya. The KICC is located in the City Square of Nairobi, and is a crucial address for a number of Government offices, including those of recently elected Senators. It is an internationally renowned venue for conferences, meetings, exhibitions and special events within walking distance of several five star hotels. During its four-and-a-half-decade history it has been the host of several international conferences, seminars, exhibitions and summits. The KICC is ranked as one of the top places to hold conferences on the continent,. After completion, the building held the rank of the tallest building in Nairobi up until the construction of Teleposta Towers. The building has since then ceded its position as the tallest tower to a host of other newer projects including the UAP Old Mutual Tower, Times Tower and the Britam Tower, which is the tallest building in Nairobi as of 2020.  History  The Kenyatta International Conference Centre, locally known as the \\"KICC\\", was commissioned by Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, the 1st President of the Republic of Kenya, in 1967. It was designed by David Mutiso & Karl Henrik Nøstvik was a contractor. and the construction was carried out by contractors Solel Boneh & Factah. This was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower and Phase III involved the Plenary.KICC Construction, 7 April 2013. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring in September 1973 presided over by President Kenyatta. The Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) was then made a State Corporation established under the Tourism Act. 2011 that came into operation on 1 September 2012. Whereas the centre is known as a leading meeting venue in Nairobi, its national mandate following the Act became to nurture and promote the country as a destination most preferred for business travel and MICE tourism. M.I.C.E has been recognized as one of the four key products to be developed under the Kenya Vision 2030. In September 2013, as the iconic complex celebrated its 40th anniversary, it was renamed to the Kenyatta International Convention Centre. Structure General The KICC currently stands as the ninth tallest building in Kenya, reaching a height of just over 105 metres.Kenyatta International Conference Centre Stats, 7 April 2013. It succeeded the Hilton Nairobi as the tallest building in Kenya, a position it held for 26 years before being surpassed by Teleposta Tower. The tower consists of 28 floors, including a revolving restaurant which offers panoramic views of the city, rotating 360° in 76 minutes.KICC Specs, 7 April 2013. The building's light terracotta façade reflects traditional African architecture, as does the use of simple solid shapes- cuboids make up the Plenary hall, the tower consists of a cylinder composed of several cuboids and the amphitheatre and helipad both resemble cones.KICC Façade, 7 April 2013. There are several well-equipped conference and meeting rooms with the largest having a capacity over 4,000 delegates. The KICC is equipped with Simultaneous Interpretation Equipment with a capability of up to seven languages, a modern business centre, a banking facility, tour and travel services, expansive grounds and ample and secure parking. It is often depicted as an icon of Nairobi. Up until the 1980s, there was a 'revolving restaurant' atop the KICC that was popular with politicians and the elite, but years of neglect literally brought it to a halt, though concerted efforts in 2012 to revive it were somewhat short lived. The 148-seater restaurant has a revolving mortar programmed to make approximately one revolution in 76 minutes.  The Amphitheatre  At the amphitheatre \\"heritage and modernity meet\\". It is designed for medium-sized convening, 800 sittings on three balconies surrounding the auditorium, brings to life and control any serious business meeting. It is equipped with SIE Booths, full logic recording facilities, state of the art public address system and sound proofing.  The Plenary  The largest conference chamber of its kind in East Africa, the plenary is fortified with sound proof grey stone, deep natural wood and lofty ceilings. It caters for large international meetings, exhibitions and grand balls, and has a capacity of 5000 people. It is equipped with Advanced Sound Amplification & recording systems, Wireless Simultaneous interpretation Equipment (up to 7 languages) booths, and observer galleries. Its high ceilings were made for elaborate décor, hosting banners and other promotional materials.  Courtyard  This is a paved 75 square meter courtyard surrounding the Jomo Kenyatta statue. It was designed as a respite for those attending conferences. The courtyard includes gardens, pools and geyser fountains. Numerous flag poles and balconies in the courtyard are fashioned to host promotional identities.  COMESA Grounds  The COMESA grounds consist of expansive grounds overlooking the Kenyan parliament. In 1999, the largest ever exhibition to be held in Kenya, bringing together exhibiters from all COMESA countries, was held at the KICC. Among the attendees were nine heads of state, having come for the Heads of State Summit. The Ground can be used to hold large exhibitions or park up to 1000 cars.

His distinctive features--partially the result of disfiguring burns--together with a haunting style and demeanor led to his being called \\"The Face That Launched a Thousand Trips\\". Life and career Born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, he was the son of actor and operetta singer Sigmund Natzler (1862-1913).The Alfred Hitchcock EncyclopediaTheater an der Wien He was a cousin of actresses and singers Grete Natzler and Hertha Natzler. As a young man he performed at second-rate Vienna theatres and from the 1930s in several cabarets in Paris. After World War II he worked for the German language service of the BBC. Nalder is perhaps best remembered for his roles as an assassin in Alfred Hitchcock's 1956 remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much, the vampire Kurt Barlow in the 1979 TV adaptation of the Stephen King novel Salem's Lot, and the Andorian ambassador Shras in the Star Trek episode \\"Journey to Babel\\". Nalder appeared (at the request of star Frank Sinatra) in a brief, uncredited role as a communist spymaster in John Frankenheimer's 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate. He also had a brief role in the 1981 Walt Disney film The Devil and Max Devlin. In an interview, Nalder claimed that he could not stand working with Bill Cosby, the star of the film.

Lawrence was born in Somerset, England and went to work in a quarry at the age of 12 and became a shop steward in the Operative Stonemasons' Union at the age of 18. He entered politics, running for election in Battersea in London. Known as \\"Mr. Labour\\", Sam Lawrence was an alderman, controller, and the Mayor of Hamilton from 1944 to 1949. He was also President of the Stone Cutters' Union, Vice-President of the Hamilton Trades and Labour Council, and leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) Party in the Ontario legislature as well as Ontario CCF president in the early 1940s Early years Born in the Somerset village of Norton-sub-Hamdon to William Lawrence and Ann Geard on 16 August 1879, Sam was the fourth child in a family of 5 boys and 5 girls and he attended school from the age of 3 to 10. His father, who Sam described as a 'radical liberal', was a stonemason, and Sam gave him credit for the position he took in the Labour movement. At the age of 12, Lawrence was working twelve hours a day, from six to six, and was apprenticed to a stonemason at 13. He had served half his time when his father became the foreman at Arundel Castle, the principal seat of the Duke of Norfolk. Lawrence went to London at 17 and joined the Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons of England, Ireland and Wales in Battersea and was shop steward at the age of 18. Whilst serving in the Coldstream Guards during the Boer War, a young recruit by name of Knobby Taylor loaned Lawrence \\"Looking Backward\\" by Edward Bellamy. Lawrence's experiences in the Boer War and Bellamy's American Utopian novel led to him becoming a socialist. In 1906, the then 27-year-old trade unionist and war veteran stood in an abortive election campaign for the Battersea Borough Council and, six years later, decided to follow three of his brothers and two sisters who had already gone to Canada.  Career  Lawrence immigrated to Canada, settling in Hamilton, Ontario with his family in 1912. He immediately joined the Journeymen Stonecutters' Association of North America and found work as a stonemason. He became involved in the local labour movement and was elected to Hamilton, Ontario City Council as an Independent Labour Party alderman in 1922. He ran as a Labour candidate in the 1925 federal election but lost his bid for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, coming in second. He remained on city council and was elected to Hamilton's Board of Control in 1929, retaining his seat until 1934 when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Hamilton East, the first Co- operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) MLA ever elected in Ontario. He was also the only CCFer elected in the 1934 election, and was defeated in his bid for re-election in the 1937 election. He was elected Ontario CCF president in 1941, and served as Mayor of Hamilton from 1944 to 1949 leading a CCF slate in that city. Lawrence then served for a time as president of the local Industrial Union Council, and subsequently regained his seat on the Board of Control and kept it for six years. He was elected the first Labour mayor of Hamilton in the 1944 municipal election and was re-elected mayor annually until his retirement from the office in 1949. During his tenure as mayor, the city went through the deeply divisive 85-day Stelco strike of 1946. The strike was the union's first, and its victory established the United Steel Workers of America as a major force in Canada. It also helped establish the right of Canadian workers to collective bargaining. Lawrence was publicly supportive of the strike, and led a 10,000-person march from Woodlawns Park to the gates of Stelco. Despite pressure from the federal and provincial governments, he refused to call in police or the military against the illegal strike, and thus helped ensure its victory. When the federal government sent the army in, Lawrence angrily stated that \\"the government was acting as the nation's chief strike breaker.\\" After stepping down as mayor in 1949, Lawrence continued on the Board of Control for six years until his retirement from politics.  Legacy  Sam Lawrence Park, Hamilton Sam Lawrence Park can be found on the western-end of Concession Street. Prior to 1944, this property was the Webb Quarry. In February 1944, The City of Hamilton was given of land for park use by Thomas Hambly Ross, MP (Hamilton East), and his wife Olive. The park was originally named Ross Park, then renamed Patton Park in 1946, in honour of captain John MacMillan Stevenson Patton, a Hamiltonian who risked his life during World War II by detonating an unexploded bomb. For this exploit he received the first George Cross for Valour. In 1960, the park was renamed to honour Sam Lawrence. During 1990 to 1994, Sam Lawrence Park underwent a major upgrading that included repairing the stone walls, installing new walkways, site lighting, site furniture, and the redevelopment of the major rock gardens.Photograph of downtown Hamilton, Ontario taken from Sam Lawrence Park When the (Ontario) Workers Arts and Heritage Centre purchased the historic Custom House on Stuart Street in the north end of Hamilton in 1996, they began hosting an annual Sam Lawrence Dinner after their November AGM.

It is one of seven Independent System Operators in North America. The IESO was established in April 1999 as the Independent Electricity Market Operator (IMO) under the Government of Ontario during the premiership of Mike Harris in preparation for deregulation of the province's electrical supply and transmission system. As part of government plans to privatize the assets of Ontario Hydro, the utility was split into five separate Crown corporations with the IMO responsible for directing the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, province-wide network owned by Hydro One and other transmission companies. It was also given the responsibility of managing and operating the competitive wholesale electricity market and working with neighbouring jurisdictions to manage an integrated North American electricity network. The IMO was renamed to the IESO in January 2005 as a result of the passage of Bill 100, which redefined the direction of deregulation and also led to the creation of the Ontario Power Authority. The IESO is an independent, not-for-profit entity. It is governed by a board whose directors are appointed by the government of Ontario, its fees and licences were set by the Ontario Energy Board and it operates independently of all participants in the electricity market. In April 2012, the Energy Minister of Ontario Chris Bentley introduced legislation in Parliament to merge the Ontario Power Authority and IESO.https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2013/05/24/possible_opa_merger_would_reduce_public_consultation_on_planning_oppositions_says.html The merger was expected to take place in late 2012.

The Wilderness Road was one of two principal routes used by colonial and early national era settlers to reach Kentucky from the East. Although this road goes through the Cumberland Gap into southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee, the other (more northern route) is sometimes called the \\"Cumberland Road\\" because it started in Fort Cumberland in Maryland. Despite Kentucky Senator Henry Clay's advocacy of this route, early in the 19th century, the northern route was selected for the National Road, connecting near Washington, Pennsylvania into the Ohio Valley of northern Kentucky and Ohio. In 1775, Daniel Boone blazed a trail for the Transylvania Company from Fort Chiswell in Virginia through the Cumberland Gap. It was later lengthened, following Native American trails, to reach the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville. The Wilderness Road was steep, rough and narrow, and could only be traversed on foot or horseback. By contrast, wagons could travel along the National Road route (originally the Braddock Road blazed by the competing Ohio Company and George Washington circa 1750), particularly after the improvements. Despite the adverse conditions, thousands of people used the Wilderness Road, particularly slaveholders after the states of Ohio, then Indiana and finally Illinois became free states (abolishing slavery) on the northern bank of the Ohio River, where travelers often embarked on boats to travel westward. In 1792, the new Kentucky legislature provided money to upgrade the road. In 1796, an improved all-weather road was opened for wagon and carriage travel. The road was abandoned around 1840 (construction on the National Road after Vandalia, Illinois also stopping due to the Panic of 1837 and early railroad construction), although modern highways follow much of its route. Early exploration Wilderness Road The first European explorers of the southern Appalachian Mountains were Spanish. Hernando de Soto and his troops traversed the region in 1540 and 1541 searching for gold. The first recorded English explorations of the mountains were those of Abraham Wood, which began around 1650. Later, Wood sent exploring parties into the mountains. The Batts-Fallam expedition reached the New River Valley in 1671. In 1673, Wood sent Gabriel Arthur and James Needham to the Overhill Cherokee of modern Tennessee. The purpose was to try to make direct contact with the Cherokee for trade, so as to circumvent the Ocaneechee \\"middlemen\\" traders. The expedition did reach the Overhill Cherokee area, but Needham was killed on the return trip. Gabriel Arthur was almost killed, but was rescued and adopted by a Cherokee chief. For his own safety, Arthur was then sent with one of the chief's raiding parties. For about a year, he traveled with the Cherokee throughout the Appalachians. He was probably the first European to visit modern West Virginia and cross the Cumberland Gap. In 1750, Dr. Thomas Walker, an investor in the Loyal Land Company, with five companions, made a famous exploration through the Cumberland Gap and into eastern Kentucky. The Loyal Land Company settled people in southwest Virginia, but not Kentucky. In 1769, Virginia longhunter and explorer Joseph Martin made the first of several forays into the region. Acting as an agent for Dr. Thomas Walker, to whom Martin was connected through family relationships, Martin began an expedition to Powell's Valley in early 1769 in return for a promised land grant from Walker and the Loyal Land Company. Martin and his men built the earliest westernmost frontier fort at present-day Rose Hill, Virginia, a fort dubbed Martin's Station. Later that year Indians chased off Martin and his men, who returned to Albemarle County. Martin returned six years later to rebuild the fort, and a few months later became an agent for Richard Henderson's Transylvania Company.A Short History of Martin's Station, historicmartinsstation.com In 1774, Richard Henderson, a judge from North Carolina, organized a land speculation company with a number of other prominent North Carolinians called the Transylvania Company. The men hoped to purchase land from the Cherokees on the Kentucky side of the Appalachian Mountains and establish a British proprietary colony. Henderson hired Daniel Boone, an experienced hunter who had explored Kentucky, to blaze a trail through the Cumberland Gap into central Kentucky. Boone, the trailblazer The Appalachian Mountains form a natural barrier to east-west travel. From New York to Georgia there are only five ways to travel to the west, with only three natural interior breaks allowing animal powered travel without great engineering works. These were the Gaps of the Allegheny and the several ways such as the Kittanning Paths in Pennsylvania, the Cumberland Narrows in northwestern Maryland host to Nemacolin's Path, and the Cumberland Gap in the four-state region of North Carolina and Virginia on the east side and through the gap, Tennessee and Kentucky. While late 19th and 20th century technologies would later bridge the mountain chain in other places, these all required significant civil engineering works to make a road bed past the barrier range geologist classify as the ridge-and-valley Appalachians. Settlers from Pennsylvania tended to migrate south along the Great Wagon Road through the Great Appalachian Valley and Shenandoah Valley. Daniel Boone escorts settlers through Cumberland Gap Daniel Boone was from Pennsylvania and migrated south with his family along this road. From an early age, Boone was one of the longhunters who hunted and trapped among the Native American nations along the western frontiers of Virginia, so-called because of the long time they spent away from home on hunts in the wilderness. Boone would sometimes be gone for months and even years before returning home from his hunting expeditions. Boone recommended three essentials for a pioneer: \\"A good gun, a good horse, and a good wife.\\" He also would need a strong body, a sharp ax and good luck. Another essential was salt. Before 1776, it had to be shipped into the Thirteen Colonies from the West Indies at great expense. It was the only meat preservative available for men on the move and Kentucky had an extra lure with its large salt brine lakes near what is today the community of Boonesborough, Kentucky. The many \\"salt licks\\" of Kentucky are today reflected in the many place names in the state that use the words \\"lick\\" or \\"licking\\". Starting on March 10, 1775 Boone, along with 35 axmen, cut a trail from Long Island in Kingsport, Tennessee through the forests and mountains to Kentucky. It was a rough mud trail, hardly more than a path. The Transylvania Company had obtained title to Kentucky from the Cherokee and Iroquois, and even the Shawnee chief Cornstalk, defeated in Dunmore's War, had promised at the Treaty of Camp Charlotte on October 19, 1774 that his tribe would no longer hunt or claim land south of the Ohio River in Kentucky. Notwithstanding this promise, the Shawnee viewed Boone and other settlers as invaders. On March 24, 1775 Boone and his party were only from their final destination of the Kentucky River when they camped for the night. Just before daybreak a group of Shawnee, slinging tomahawks, attacked the sleeping men. Some of Boone's party were killed and a few were wounded but most were able to escape into the woods. Boone regrouped his men and managed to drive off the hostile Shawnee. The party did, however, lose some of their horses. Here Boone built a temporary open barricade with 6 to high logs. By the next year, the Shawnee had been joined by the Chickamauga Cherokee in the Cherokee–American wars with the settlers, which lasted until 1794. Route The route of the Wilderness Road made a long loop from Virginia southward to Tennessee and then northward to Kentucky, a distance of . From the Long Island of the Holston River (modern Kingsport, Tennessee), the road went north through Moccasin Gap of Clinch Mountain, then crossed the Clinch River and crossed rough land (called the Devils Raceway) to the North Fork Clinch River. Then it crossed Powell Mountain at Kanes Gap. From there it ran southwest through the valley of the Powell River to the Cumberland Gap. After passing over the Cumberland Gap the Wilderness Road forked. The southern fork passed over the Cumberland Plateau to Nashville, Tennessee via the Cumberland River. The northern fork split into two parts. The eastern spur went into the Bluegrass region of Kentucky to Boonesborough on the Kentucky River (near Lexington). The western spur ran to the Falls of the Ohio (Louisville).Kincaid, p. 77 As settlements grew southward, the road stretched all the way to Knoxville, Tennessee, by 1792. Dangers Because of the threat of Native American attacks, the road was so dangerous that most pioneers traveled well armed. Robbers and criminals also could be found on the road, ready to pounce on weaker pioneers.Kincaid, p. 351 Although the Transylvania Company had purchased the region from the Cherokee, and the Iroquois had ceded it at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, other tribes, such as the Shawnee, still claimed it and lived there. Often entire communities and church congregations would move together over the road to new settlements. Hundreds of pioneers were killed by Indian attacks.Kincaid, p. 175 Defensive log blockhouses built alongside the road had portholes in the walls for firing at Native American attackers. They were often called \\"stations\\". No one knew exactly when the next attack would happen. The Shawnee came from the north, while the Chickamauga (Cherokees who rejected the land sale treaty) came from the south. The tribes were resentful of the settlers taking their ancestral hunting lands, and the French and Indian War had further stirred up their passions against the white man.Kincaid, p. 116 There was a great variety of animal life in the wilderness. At night, the pioneers could hear the hoots and screeches of owls, the howls of wolves, and the cries of panthers and wild cats. Sometimes the Native Americans imitated these sounds. Venomous snakes such as copperheads and rattlesnakes blended into the leaves and undergrowth which were a danger to the pioneers, their horses and cattle. Settlement Judge Richard Henderson had made a treaty with the Cherokee at Sycamore Shoals in 1775, purchasing over of land between the Cumberland and Kentucky Rivers. On March 28, 1775, he left Long Island (Kingsport, Tennessee) with about 30 horsemen on the grueling trip down the Wilderness Road to Kentucky. At Martin's Station 40 to 50 additional pioneers joined the venture. On their way, they met nearly a hundred refugees fleeing Native American attacks further down the road. Despite the danger, the party kept going toward Kentucky. Since some of the streams were flooded, the pioneers had to swim with their horses. On April 20, they arrived at Boonesborough, a fortified town, named by Judge Henderson in honor of Boone.Kincaid, pp. 98-110 After 1770, a surge of over 400,000 Scots-Irish immigrants arrived in the colonies to escape the poor harvest, high rents and religious intolerance of Ulster. Since the better lands had already been taken, they constantly pressed onward to the western frontier of the foothills of the Carolinas. The flood of Scots-Irish, German, and others immigrants kept coming. Over 200,000 pioneers came over the Wilderness Road, enduring severe hardships. In the winter of 1778-79, the weather was so cold that the Kentucky River froze to a depth of two feet. The frontier settlements alongside the road struggled to survive. Many of the cattle and hogs froze to death. The settlers had to eat frozen cattle and horses to survive.Kincaid, p. 151 Often the Chickamauga, under the leadership of Dragging Canoe, would hide in ambush for weeks between Cumberland Gap and Crab Orchard, a distance of . They would not attack large groups but wait for weaker ones who were not able to defend themselves. More than 100 men, women and children were killed in the fall of 1784 along the Wilderness Road. Many families, even in ice and snow, crossed the creeks and rivers without shoes or stockings; they often had no money and few clothes. They lived off the land by hunting in the woods and by fishing in the streams.Kincaid p. 175 Since they had hardly any money, entire families sometimes walked hundreds of miles after landing in America. They even used cattle as pack animals to carry their heavy loads. Cabins were built and land was cleared of trees and undergrowth so crops could be planted. Chestnut was the most popular wood since its logs could be used to build cabins and rail fences to protect crops from wild animals. It could easily be split into shingles for roofs to cover cabins and barns. Its bark was used to make medicine and tannic acid for tanning and dyeing. In the fall, its rich nuts were used to fatten razorback hogs for the market and the home. Hemlock was also highly valued for its many uses.Rouse, p. 6 Commerce and mail The Wilderness Road served as a great path of commerce for the early settlers in Kentucky, as well as for coffles of slaves being transported through Tennessee to the new plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana. Horses, cattle, sheep and hogs herded in the other direction found waiting markets in the Carolinas, Maryland and Virginia. Hogs in groups of 500 or more were driven down the Road to market. Beef in Eastern markets had become a main source of income for farmers in Kentucky.Kincaid, p. 205 A postal road was opened in 1792 from Bean Station, Tennessee through Cumberland Gap to Danville, Kentucky. This was due largely to the efforts of Governor Isaac Shelby of Kentucky. This connection of Kentucky to the East was a great advantage. Frontier settlers considered the postal riders heroes and waited eagerly for their arrival for news from settlements along the trails as well as getting their mail and newspapers.Kincaid, p. 187 Civil War and decline Use of the Wilderness Road fell when the National Road was opened in 1818, allowing travel to the Ohio River on more level ground from the East. The Panic of 1837, geology and new railroad technology doomed the James River Canal, once envisioned as augmenting this commercial route. At the same time, the steamboat first appeared on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, allowing faster and cheaper travel both up and down the rivers.Hitchcock, 85 During the 1850s, the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad was constructed along part of this route. During the American Civil War, both the Union Army and the Confederate States Army used the Wilderness Road. An early battle (Camp Wildcat), stymied the first Confederate attempt to seize control of neutral Kentucky. The Cumberland Gap changed hands four times throughout the war. Southern troops used the road for marches into Virginia. General Ulysses S. Grant came down the road for the Union campaign in Tennessee in 1864. Grant was so taken by the Road that he said, \\"With two brigades of the Army of the Cumberland I could hold that pass against the army which Napoleon led to Moscow.\\"Bodett, p. 100 Preservation  Cumberland Gap height of land along the Wilderness Road A segment of the Wilderness Road was among the first roads in the United States to be paved. The old road from the town of Cumberland Gap, Tennessee to Middlesboro, Kentucky through the mountain pass was paved and completed on October 3, 1908. This was an \\"object-lesson\\" road (a new kind of paved macadam construction funded by local communities but with federal governmental supervision) initiated by the U.S. Office of Public Roads. At that time, only about of paved roads existed in the United States. Its name was later changed to U.S. Route 25E. This new road brought a new industry, tourism, to the rural areas filling hotels and restaurants with travelers.Kincaid, p. 352 Cumberland Gap is a National Historical Park, and portions of the Wilderness Road can be visited at Wilderness Road State Park in Virginia. Additionally, a reconstructed fort at Martin's Station in Virginia on the Wilderness Road can be visited about east of the Cumberland Gap. Since the completion of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel in 1996, a project has been underway to restore the original appearance of the Wilderness Road as it crosses the historic Cumberland Gap. Since 2001 Hwy. 25E has been obliterated over several miles of its length and the original grade restored, including the addition of of elevation to restore the Gap to its original contour, with virtually all modern artifacts, buildings and roads removed. The replanting of thousands of seedlings from original forest stocks in the area is intended, over a period of decades, to recreate a forest that will allow visitors to view the crossing of the Gap on the Wilderness Road as travelers would have experienced it circa 1790. This section of the Wilderness Road is now a hiking trail, including an interpretive center about the road's history located on the Tennessee side.

The football team currently plays in Primera División, the top division of the Argentine football league system. The squad plays its home games at the Estadio Julio H. Grondona, named after one of the founders, which has a capacity of 16,000. It opened in 1964 but was not used in the First Division until 2004. The club's colours are red and light blue, in honour of the traditional teams of Avellaneda (Independiente and Racing). Arsenal won its first Primera División championship in 2012. Until then, club's major title had been the Copa Sudamericana won in 2007. Apart from football, the club hosts other sports such as futsal and handball. History Primera C championship in 1964. The beginning The club was founded in January 1957 by brothers Héctor and Julio Humberto Grondona. The club were founded near to where the country's military arsenal was housed, which inspired the name. The team's shirt colour is light blue with a diagonal red band (similar to the shirt used by River Plate). The colours were chosen as a combination of the two older clubs in Avellaneda – Racing (light blue) and Independiente (red). The 1962 Arsenal team, which won the first official title for the institution. Julio Grondona went on to become president of Independiente, and then, in 1979, president of the Argentine Football Association, until 2014. He was also a vice-president of FIFA. Héctor Grondona, and then son Julio Ricardo, became presidents of Arsenal. The club's best known former player is Jorge Burruchaga, who started his career at Arsenal in 1979, and had several stints as coach. Burru, as he is nicknamed, scored the winning goal for Argentina in the 1986 FIFA World Cup final against Germany. Arsenal's football team was promoted to successively higher divisions in 1962, 1986 and 1992, finally reaching the Primera División in 2002. On 6 September 2006, Arsenal and Spanish club FC Barcelona (Barça) struck a deal whereby in exchange for the option to acquire young players that have not played more than one year in the Arsenal first team, Barça would help to improve Arsenal's infrastructure. A member from Barça was to oversee the project, and visit the club on a monthly basis. This deal, however, fell through in 2007, reportedly because Arsenal could not afford the infrastructure to keep up with the plan. International tournaments The club's first appearance in an international tournament was in 2004, when, coached by Burruchaga, Arsenal reached the Quarter-finals of the Copa Sudamericana, eliminating Banfield and River Plate before losing to Bolivian club, Bolívar in its first ever official tie with a non-Argentine team. Arsenal's results in the Apertura and Clausura of the 2006–07 season, qualified them for two major international tournaments, the secondary 2007 Copa Sudamericana and the top 2008 Copa Libertadores, the first time in their history that Arsenal qualified for South America's premier club tournament. Arsenal's run through the 2007 Copa Sudamericana would lead Sports Illustrated to declare them \\"the underdog that couldn't be stopped\\". They beat reigning Argentine champions San Lorenzo in the qualifying round to earn a place in the Round of 16 where it faced Brazilian team Goiás. Arsenal won 3–2 in Brazil and recorded a 1–1 draw in the second leg to win the tie 4–3 on aggregate, achieving its first official victory over foreign opposition. Arsenal then met Mexican side Guadalajara in the quarter-finals, with a 0–0 draw at home, and a 3–1 victory at Estadio Jalisco. Advancing to the semi- finals, Arsenal met the other Argentine team still in the running, River Plate. Both games against River ended 0–0, Arsenal progressing to the final after winning the penalty shootout 4–2, with a number of saves from Mario Cuenca, Arsenal's goalkeeper. In the first leg of the 2007 Copa Sudamericana final, Arsenal beat Club América of Mexico 3–2 at Estadio Azteca. Their upcoming home field advantage was mitigated by the fact that the second match could not be held in the Estadio Julio H. Grondona, because its capacity of 16,300 did not meet the CONMEBOL criteria of 40,000 for major finals. The game was finally held at the Estadio Juan Domingo Perón in Avellaneda. Arsenal entered the match without captain Carlos Castiglione, who was suspended due to a red card in the first leg. With these mitigating factors, Arsenal needed to avoid letting Club América win by a two-goal margin. The match started badly for the Argentine team when Christian Díaz scored an own goal inside the first 20 minutes. José Luis Calderón then hit the woodwork twice for Arsenal. In the 2nd half Arsenal conceded a second goal, but with only 7 minutes remaining Martín Andrizzi scored, giving Arsenal their first major title on the away goals rule. Arsenal was not as successful in the 2008 Copa Libertadores, which started the month after their 2007 Copa Sudamericana. However, on 30 July 2008, Arsenal won its second international cup, the Suruga Bank Championship, which they qualified for as Copa Sudamericana champion. The rival was J.League Cup champions Gamba Osaka from Japan. After a hard match, captain Carlos Casteglione scored the only goal with a precise header on the 86th minute of play. First domestic titles Arsenal won its first championship on 24 June 2012 after defeating Belgrano de Córdoba 1–0 with a goal scored by Lisandro López.\\"Arsenal es campeón por primera vez en su historia\\", Clarín, 24 June 2012 The squad totalized 38 points over 19 games played, with 11 matches won and only 3 defeats.\\"Primera División de Argentina, tabla final Clausura 2012\\", ESPN, 24 June 2012 Arsenal also became the first team to win a Primera División title after playing in the five divisions that Argentine football league system is made of.\\"Histórica coronación de Arsenal\\", Perfil, 24 June 2012 As champions, Arsenal classified for the Supercopa Argentina, a one-match tournament between the Primera División and the Copa Argentina winners.

Grondona The Estadio Julio H. Grondona in Sarandí has a capacity of 36,300, and is known as el Viaducto (The Viaduct). It is located at 3660 Juan Díaz De Solís in Sarandí. Arsenal's first stadium was started to be built on 11 October 1962, officially opening on 22 August 1964. When Arsenal won promotion to the Primera, its basic concrete stadium was deemed unfit for the league and the team played at the grounds of Lanús and Racing for two seasons until work on the stadium was complete. The remodeled stadium (named \\"Julio Humberto Grondona\\") was opened on 7 August 2004 with a party for the fans. The first game was against Banfield in the Copa Sudamericana. The new stadium has witnessed defeats of the biggest teams in Argentine football such as Boca Juniors and River Plate. Players Current squad .

Jelon Vieira is a Brazilian choreographer and teacher who, in 2000, achieved recognition by New York City's Brazilian Cultural Center as a pioneer in presenting to American audiences the Afro-Brazilian art and dance form, Capoeira. In 1975, Jelon Vieira and fellow choreographer/performer Loremil Machado became the first artists to bring traditional Afro-Brazilian artistic endeavors to the United States. For over a quarter century, as the founder and artistic director of The Capoeira Foundation, Vieira has guided the dance company, DanceBrazil through critically acclaimed engagements across the United States, including performances at Spoleto Festival USA, the Kennedy Center and Lincoln Center. The company has also toured in Europe, Asia and Brazil and has been featured on the PBS documentary series, EGG, the Arts Show and Alive from Off-Center. Vieira has worked with numerous major cultural institutions, including NYC's Caribbean Cultural Center and San Antonio's Carver Community Cultural Center. In 1999, City Lore, a New York City community organization, inducted him into its Hall of Fame for lifetime contribution. In addition to his solo performances and works for DanceBrazil, his choreographic credits include the films Brenda Starr, Rooftops, and Boomerang. For Times Square 2000, the globally televised, multinational 24-hour dance marathon in New York City, Vieira was chosen to create the only Brazilian performance. He has been a guest master teacher at Yale University, Oberlin College, Columbia University, Princeton University, Stanford University and other institutions. In 2000, he was the Bacardi Distinguished Visiting Eminent Scholar at the University of Florida in Gainesville. He has taught Capoeira to legendary footballer Pelé and American movie stars Wesley Snipes and Eddie Murphy. Snipes, himself a top martial arts practitioner, has described Vieira as one of \\"the masters of the martial arts of the 20th century\\". He is a recipient of a 2008 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. Upon returning to Brazil, in his home community of Boca do Rio, a bairro of the nation's third-largest city, Salvador, Vieira continues to teach children and young adults the art of Capoeira to build self-esteem, instill self-discipline and raise social consciousness while at the same time becoming a vital part of their own community. In 2007, after having devoted many years to Grupo Capoeira Brasil, he founded Grupo Capoeira Luanda.

The goal of each of these games is to fly military missions in a RAH-66 Comanche attack helicopter, which was in development and prototyping at the time of release. Comanche was the first commercial flight simulation based on voxel technology via the company's proprietary Voxel Space engine (written entirely in assembly language).

Reception Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer—United States Army Aviation AH-64 pilot Bryan Walker—liked Comanche Maximum Overkill in 1993, calling it an \\"eye-popping glimpse into 21st-century helicopter warfare\\". He stated that it created a \\"more believable terrain model than the Army's Combat Mission Simulator\\" and was the first game to replicate \\"the thrill of low-altitude flying\\". Walker enjoyed the flight model's stability and ease of use, and reported that the cockpit corresponded to MANPRINT (\\"Manpower and Personnel Integration\\") principles. He compared the helicopter's handling as akin to \\"a slug ... joystick jocks may end up gritting their teeth\\", and also criticized the \\"meager\\" choice of missions and enemy targets, and the unrealistically high durability and weapon loads. Walker nonetheless concluded that \\"cutting- edge graphics firepower gives [it] the edge to sweep more than a couple of competitors off the battlefield\\". In 1993 Walker reviewed Mission Disk One for the magazine, stating that he \\"honesty expected more from an add-on disk that retails for $40\\". He criticized the lack of improvement in the flight model (\\"CMOs Comanche still flies like Barney Fife is at the controls\\"), and concluded that it \\"is like refueling a gunship without rearming it\\". In 1994 Walker liked the harder difficulty of the Over the Edge mission disk's \\"40 tough new missions\\", as well as the improved graphics and controls. He concluded that the expansion \\"clearly shows the superiority of the new features and makes for a far more enjoyable game\\". Walker also liked the Comanche CD compilation but only recommended it to those new to the game or without the expansions. He reiterated, however, that \\"many of the limitations I noted in my review of the original CMO are still present ... it would be nice to see NovaLogic produce a chopper title on par with Falcon 3.0 in the technical realism arena\\". A reviewer for Next Generation opined that \\"For pure multiplayer action, Werewolf vs. Comanche is hard to beat.\\" He noted that because the two crafts are on separate discs, gamers only needed to buy half as many copies of the game as the number of players in a networked session. He scored it four out of five stars. Comanche Maximum Overdrive was nominated for an award at the 1993 Game Developers Conference. The overall Comanche series achieved combined global sales of 2.5 million copies by November 2001, before the release of Comanche 4. Comanche Mac received 4 out of 5 stars from MacUser.

Among academics in Germanic philology, the document is widely considered to be a hoax or forgery. The manuscript first came to public awareness in the 1860s. In 1872, Jan Gerhardus Ottema published a Dutch translation and defended it as genuine. Over the next few years there was a heated public controversy, but by 1879 it was universally accepted that the text was a recent composition. Nevertheless, a public controversy was revived in the context of 1930s Nazi occultism, and the book is still occasionally brought up in esotericism and Atlantis literature. The manuscript's author is not known with certainty, hence it is unknown whether the intention was to produce a pseudepigraphical hoax, a parody or simply an exercise in poetic fantasy. Historian Goffe Jensma published a monograph on the manuscript in 2004, De gemaskerde god (The Masked God), including a new translation and a discussion of the history of its reception. Jensma concludes that it was probably intended as a \\"hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians\\", as well as an \\"experiential exemplary exercise\\" by Dutch theologian and poet François Haverschmidt. Zeker ook nieuw aan mijn boek is wat ik op grond van het handschrift zelf kon concluderen over de tijd van ontstaan en over de wijze waarop het is gemaakt, namelijk in een aantal fases en niet door één auteur, maar zeker door twee en vermoedelijk door drie auteurs. History of reception 19th century The Oera Linda Book, known in Old Frisian as Thet Oera Linda Bok, came to light in 1867 when Cornelis Over de Linden (1811-1874) handed the manuscript, which he claimed to have inherited from his grandfather, via his aunt, over to Eelco Verwijs (1830-1880), the provincial librarian of Friesland, for translation and publication. Verwijs rejected the manuscript, but in 1872 Jan Gerhardus Ottema (1804-1879), a prominent member of the Frisian Society for History and Culture, published a Dutch translation. Ottema believed it to be written in authentic Old Frisian. The book was subsequently translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876, and published by Trübner & Co. of London. Within the first few years after the appearance of the Oera Linda Book, its recent origin was established not only based on the exceptional claims being made, but also because of a number of anachronisms it contained. The text was nevertheless a source of inspiration for a number of occultists and speculative historians. While there was some debate among Dutch academics and in a number of newspapers about the book's authenticity during the 1870s, by 1879 it was widely recognized as a forgery. Nazi Germany More than forty years later, beginning in 1922, Dutch völkisch philologist Herman Wirth revived the issue. Wirth published a German translation of what he dubbed the \\"Nordic Bible\\" in 1933, as Die Ura Linda Chronik. A panel discussion on Wirth's book at the University of Berlin on 4 May 1934 was the immediate impulse for the foundation of Ahnenerbe by Himmler and Wirth, together with Richard Walther Darré. Because of the infatuation of Himmler with the Oera Linda Book and its consequent association with Nazi occultism, it became known as \\"Himmler's Bible\\". Wirth's book was by no means universally acclaimed among the Nazi-era Nordicist academics, and the 1934 panel discussion was steeped in heated controversy. Alfred Rosenberg and his circle rejected it. Gustav Neckel had praised Wirth's work before publication, but upon seeing its content published a dismayed recension.Der Tag, Berlin, 31. December 1933. Speaking in defense of the book's authenticity were Walther Wüst and Otto Huth, besides Wirth himself. Speaking against its authenticity were Neckel, Karl Hermann Jacob- Friesen (who identified it as a satirical hoax by Linden) and Arthur Hübner. Hübner was one of the most respected Germanists of his generation, and his verdict of the Oera Linda being a falsification settled the defeat of Wirth's party. The public defeat of Himmler's scholarly brand of \\"esoteric Nordicism\\" resulted in the foundation of Ahnenerbe, which attracted occultists such as Karl Maria Wiligut and was viewed with suspicion by the mainstream National Socialist ideologues of Amt Rosenberg.Gerd Simon, Himmlers Bibel und die öffentlichkeitswirksamste Podiumsdiskussion in der Geschichte der Germanistik Modern esotericism The book experienced a revival of popularity in the English-speaking world with the writings of Robert Scrutton. In The Other Atlantis (1977) he reproduced the full text of Sandbach's 1876 English translation, interspersed with his own commentaries on history and mythology.Scrutton, Robert. The Other Atlantis (1977) In Secrets of Lost Atland (1979) he became the first to link the book with the concept of earth mysteries, and, in particular, ley lines and telluric energy.Scrutton, Robert. Secrets of Lost Atland (1979) Following Scrutton's example, English language accounts of the Oera Linda Book tend to place it within the New Age or alternate history genres, and do not associate it with National Socialism, as is the case in Germany. Another figure to formulate a contemporary Neopagan tradition influenced by the Oera Linda Book was Tony Steele, who considered the book to reveal the genuine truth about the ancient European megalithic culture. In Water Witches (1998) he examined the book's use as a cultural identity marker by the Frisian-descended canal folk of the English Midlands.Steele, Tony. Water Witches (1998) In The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft (2001) he connected the religious practices of the priestesses described in the book with later medieval witchcraft traditions.Steele, Tony. The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft (2001) Authorship Among those who doubt the book's authenticity, the most popular candidates for the author of the manuscript are Cornelis Over de Linden or Eelco Verwijs. A recent third choice is the Protestant preacher François Haverschmidt (1835-1894), well known for writing poetry under the pseudonym Piet Paaltjens. Haverschmidt lived in Friesland and was an acquaintance of Verwijs.Skepsis.nl Goffe Jensma (2004) argued that Haverschmidt was the main writer of the book, with the help of Over de Linden and Verwijs. According to Jensma, Haverschmidt intended the Oera Linda Book as a parody of the Christian Bible. An article in late 2007 by JensmaExtraordinary professor of Frisian Language and Culture, in particular the literary-historical aspects of Frisian, at the Faculty of Humanities of the Universiteit van Amsterdam says that the three authors of the translation intended it \\"to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way.\\"Oera Linda-boek was poging van Haverschmidt om bijbel te ontkrachten Rijks Universiteit Groningen, 2004. Ignoring clues that it was a forgery, J. G. Ottema took it seriously, and it achieved popularity for the reasons given above. Its creators felt unable to admit that they had written it, and it became the foundation for new occult beliefs. Jensma concludes his article by saying \\"It is a perfect irony that a book written to unmask the Holy Bible as a book of human making was to become a bible itself.\\" Contents Themes running through the Oera Linda Book include catastrophism, nationalism, matriarchy, and mythology. The text alleges that Europe and other lands were, for a large part of their history, ruled by a succession of folk-mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess Frya, daughter of the creator god Wr-alda and Jrtha, the earth mother. The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet that was the ancestor of the Greek and Phoenician alphabets. Modern historiography is essentially ignored, particularly in the area of basic chronology of known events in the recent and distant past of Europe. Geological as well as geographical evidence that was readily available even as far back as Over de Linden's time is also mostly absent from the manuscript. The earliest portion of the Oera Linda Book, namely Frya’s Tex, was supposedly composed in 2194 BC, whereas the most recent part, the letter of Hidde Oera Linda, dates to AD 1256. Almost half of the entire book comprises The Book of Adela’s Followers, the original text around which the rest grew. It is purported to have been compiled in the 6th century BC from a mixture of contemporary writings and ancient inscriptions. The last two sections of the Oera Linda Book contain a number of lacunae and the book itself breaks off in mid-sentence. It also describes a lost land called Atland (the name given to Atlantis by the 17th century scholar Olof Rudbeck), which was supposedly submerged in 2194 BC, the same year as 19th century Dutch and Frisian almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology given for Noah's flood.

(6 April 1696Richard Sharp, ‘Grey, Richard (1696–1771)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. – 28 February 1771) was an English churchman and author, archdeacon of Bedford from 1757. He is now remembered for his Memoria Technica, a work on a memory system. Life He was born in Newcastle, the son of John Grey. and studied at Oxford. He matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford, 20 June 1712, and graduated B.A. in 1716 and M.A. 16 January 1719.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Greenhill-Gysby He was ordained in 1719, and became chaplain and secretary to Nathaniel Crew, bishop of Durham. Crew had him presented in the following year to the rectory of Hinton, Northamptonshire. Through the same influence Grey obtained the little rectory of Steane Chapel, and in 1725 the additional living of Kimcote, near Lutterworth, Leicestershire. He was also appointed a prebendary of St. Paul's Cathedral, London, and official and commissary of the archdeaconry of Leicester. He proceeded D.D. in 1731, and was archdeacon of Bedford from 1757 for the rest of his life. He was a friend of Philip Doddridge, was well known to Samuel Johnson, who admired his learning, and was intimate with John Moore. He died on 28 February 1771 and was buried at Hinton, where he had been rector for fifty years. Memoria Technica In 1730 appeared his 'Memoria Technica; or a new Method of Artificial Memory.' Grey's system consisted in changing the last syllable of names into letters which represented figures according to an arbitrary table, and in stringing together the new formations in lines with a hexameter beat. It therefore uses strings of letters to remember numbers. Example: az = 10, tel = 325, teib = 381. The 'Memoria Technica' was applied to the dates and figures of chronology, geography, measures of weight and length, astronomy, and so on, and though uncouth and complicated met with great favour. The book went through several editions in the author's lifetime, and continued to be reprinted with modifications till 1861. On Grey's system were founded Solomon Lowe's 'Mnemonics,' and several aids to memory connected with other names. According to Francis Fauvel Gouraud, Grey indicated that a discussion on Hebrew linguistics in William Beveridge (bishop)'s Institutionum chronotogicarum libri duo, una cum totidem arithmetices chronologicæ libellis (London, 1669) inspired him to create his system of mnemotechniques which later evolved in to the Mnemonic major system. Other works His numerous publications commenced with An Answer to Barbeyrac's Spirit of the Ecclesiastics of all Ages as to the Doctrines of Morality, 1722. In 1730 he published A System of English Ecclesiastical Law, extracted from the \\"Codex Juris Ecclesiastici Angli\\" of Bishop Edmund Gibson, for the use of students for holy orders. It was in recognition of this work, which passed through four editions in a few years, that the University of Oxford gave him the degree of D.D. In 1736 Grey published The Miserable and Distracted State of Religion in England, after previous consultation with Dr. Zachary Grey.

Grey also printed sermons and pamphlets on religious subjects. Family He married Joyce, youngest daughter of John Thicknesse, rector of Farthingo, Northamptonshire, and brother of Philip Thicknesse. She died on 12 January 1794, aged 89. He left three daughters, of whom the eldest, Joyce, married at the age of forty- five Dr. Philip Lloyd, dean of Norwich, and was known for painted windows in Norwich Cathedral. The youngest, Bridget, married the Rev. William Thomas Bowles, and was mother of William Lisle Bowles.

This includes setting rates, and licensing all participants in the electricity sector including the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), generators, transmitters, distributors, wholesalers and electricity retailers, as well as natural gas marketers who sell to low volume customers. To ensure an adequate level of consumer protection in the energy markets, the Board developed codes of conduct for gas marketers and electricity retailers, and established a complaint resolution process for energy consumers. The Board also provides a broad range of information to energy consumers about electricity and natural gas in Ontario. The Board oversees the electricity market and ensures regulated gas and electricity monopoly utilities comply with Board decisions and orders. This includes conducting audits, performing compliance monitoring activities and monitoring various aspects of the gas and electricity utilities’ financial operating performance. Electricity In the electricity sector, the Board sets transmission and distribution rates, and approves the IESO's budget and fees. The Board also sets the regulated price of electricity for residential and small business consumers on the Regulated Price Plan. Consumers who have signed contracts with an electricity retailer will pay the price set out in their contract. The Board licenses all electricity retailers who sell electricity to residential and small commercial consumers. Prior approval by the Board is required for: * Construction of electricity transmission lines longer than two kilometres; * Amalgamation between an electricity distributor and another company; * Acquisition of a significant shareholding (in excess of 20 per cent of the voting securities) of an electricity transmission or distribution company; * Disposal of electricity transmission or distribution assets; * Acquisition of electricity transmission or distribution assets by an electricity generation company or affiliate; and * Acquisition of electricity generation facilities by an electricity transmission or distribution company or affiliate. The Board also monitors markets in the electricity sector and reports to the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure on the efficiency, fairness, transparency and competitiveness of the markets, and reports any abuse or potential abuse of market power. The Board may also be asked to review the IESO market rules and consider appeals of IESO orders. Natural Gas In the natural gas sector, utilities are required to submit the rates they propose to charge their customers to the Board for review. The Board approves rates associated with the cost to transport, store and distribute natural gas from utilities to consumers as well as charges to administer natural gas accounts. The Board also approves the price utilities can charge consumers for the natural gas they use. Natural gas utilities do not make a profit on the sale of natural gas. It is sold to consumers with no mark-up. Consumers who have signed contracts with a natural gas marketer will pay the price set out in their contract. The Board licenses all natural gas marketers who sell natural gas to residential and small commercial consumers. The Board is required to determine if constructing a natural gas pipeline is in the public interest by considering need, safety, economic feasibility, community benefits, security of supply and environmental impacts. Each municipality may grant a gas utility the right to deliver gas service and use road allowances or utility easements within its borders. The specific terms and conditions of these franchise agreements between the municipality and the utility are subject to Board approval. The Board also reviews applications by gas distributors to create and operate underground gas storage areas and designates geological formations suitable to store natural gas in Ontario. Board approval is also required before a natural gas utility can sell its distribution system or amalgamate with another distributor. There are currently two default service providers of natural gas in Ontario, Enbridge and Union Gas. These two entities are regulated by the Board. The Board does not regulate competitive services in the natural gas sector. These include the sale of natural gas, water heater rentals and repair or maintenance services. These products and services are competitive services and can be obtained from various companies.

It is popular with both the surfing community and walkers. It is part owned by the National Trust, and offshore on Godrevy Island is a lighthouse maintained by Trinity House which is said to be the inspiration for Virginia Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse. Godrevy lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the South West Coast Path runs around the whole promontory. There are several public car parks on the western side where the National Trust owns and operates a café.  Godrevy Head  Map of Godrevy Head The headland () is on the Atlantic coast in Cornwall on the eastern side of St Ives Bay and about three miles (5 km) northeast of the town of Hayle. The nearest village is Gwithian, half a mile west beyond Godrevy Bridge across the Red River. The promontory is roughly square in shape and faces north into the Atlantic occupying an area of approximately . In 1939, and of coastline was donated to the National Trust by D. W. Thomas of Gwithian, followed by a further of land adjoining Godrevy Farm in 1962 by Nicholas and Charles Thomas. Godrevy Head has some of the best coastal heathland in Cornwall, with many species of plant, animal and insect life. Part of the headland, along with the coast to the east, was designated as part of the Godrevy Head to St Agnes SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) in 1951. The western side of Godrevy Head is bounded by rocks to the north and a wide sandy beach to the south which is popular for surfing. At the north-western corner of the headland is Godrevy Point; at the north-eastern corner is Navax Point (, meaning head of the autumn dwelling). The cliffs between the two points are approximately above sea level. On the northern side of the headland are two coves named Mutton Cove and Kynance Cove (, meaning cove of the autumn dwelling) beyond which the Nathaga Rocks (, meaning milky ones) lie off Navax Point. On the eastern side of the headland are Castle Giver Cove (, meaning cove of the goat's castle) and Fishing Cove. South of Navax Point is an area of heath named The Knavocks (, meaning autumn dwelling) which is managed by The National Trust. The grassland and gorse scrub is criss-crossed with footpaths and is home to many species of butterflies and birds, notably nesting stonechats. The Knavocks, like other coastal heathlands in Cornwall, is managed by regularly cutting back the gorse and by grazing, the National Trust having introduced a herd of ponies for the purpose. Beyond Fishing Cove, the coast swings to the east towards Hell's Mouth and North Cliffs. The land here rises to approximately , the highest point on this section of clifftop. The cliffs, offshore rocks and coast around Godrevy Head form a renowned habitat for seabirds including cormorants, fulmars, guillemots, and razorbills and several species of gull. There is also a substantial population of grey seals throughout the year. Occasionally, bottlenose dolphins can be seen in the area. Godrevy Island and The Stones Godrevy Island lies approx three hundred yards off Godrevy Point. The uninhabited island is the site of Godrevy Lighthouse, operated by Trinity House. The island covers an area of and is home to seagulls, oystercatchers and pipits. Its vegetation is dominated by grasses, with primroses and sea thrift flowering in the spring. Landings may only be made on the island with the permission of Trinity House. Seaward of Godrevy Island is a submerged reef known as The Stones which extends for approximately to the northwest across the eastern approach to St Ives Bay. It has been the site of many sinkings over the years but it was not until the disastrous loss of the SS Nile on 30 November 1854, with the loss of all aboard, that Trinity House was pressured to construct a lighthouse on the island. It was built in 1859 and was converted to fully automatic operation in 1939.  Geology  The rocks at Godrevy are Devonian mudstones overlain with Quaternary ice age deposits. The mudstone was laid in a deep sea sedimentary basin and subject to seismic activity, forming turbidites. Under gravitational slumping the coarser material settled first followed by the finer material. Overlying the turbidites are a sequence of rocks laid down during recent ice ages, and Godrevy is considered to be one of the most important Pleistocene (2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago) sites in the south west of England. Mammal fossils are rare in Cornwall and a dog was found within the poorly sorted, course–grained sediments of head dated to 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of domestication is a dog, or wolf puppy, in a human burial site in Israel from 12,000 years ago. The earliest British domestic dog remains are from Starr Carr, Yorkshire, dated to 9,538 (± 350) BP. In order to date the skeleton, and to test three hypotheses, part of a bone was sampled at the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The three hypotheses were:– * if the skeleton is in context with the geology (i.e. the same age as the head deposits), then the deposits are younger than previously thought, * if the dating of the head deposits is correct than the dog is a very early example of domestication, * if the skeleton is younger, it is not in context with the geology. The dog skeleton dates to 1650 AD (± 30) which implies that it is possible for a recently dead animal to be within ice age deposits but leave no indication of how it happened. Fossil occurrence within ice age deposits need to be treated with caution, and skeletal remains need to be dated by AMS to provide their actual age and geological significance.

History Initially from Canada, the two founding brothers (Richard and Peter Yanofsky) moved to Hong Kong to form the company in 1982, as an independent research & development and manufacturing outfit. As an OEM seller, they produced products such as the Power Rangers Power Gloves and the Talking Tots dolls. In 1987, the company changed focus, building and marketing toys under their own brand in response to a fall in OEM orders. In 1999, they produced new products including a robotic dog (MegaByte), T-Rex, and the Animaltronics and Dinotronics lines of remote control animals. In 1998 the company was purchased by Hasbro. Under Hasbro Shortly before the Hasbro sale, Peter Yanofsky reportedly caught physicist/roboticist Mark Tilden on the Discovery Channel, and soon hired him as a consultant. Initially Tilden worked part-time with WowWee while he continued his work with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, but in 2001, Tilden joined the company full-time. One of his first products with WowWee was the B.I.O. Bug, released in 2001. Unfortunately, while sales were good they weren't as strong as either WowWee or Hasbro would have liked. In part this has been attributed to the after- effects of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks, while Tilden has also expressed disappointment with some of the limitations placed on the product design by Hasbro. After moving to WowWee full-time in 2001, Tilden focused his attention on developing Robosapien. While Tilden was developing Robosapien, Hasbro canceled the project several times, leading Yanofsky to negotiate out of the contract in 2003. Robosapien was released in 2004, and over 1.5 million were reportedly sold in the first five months of sale. Robosapien was the first commercially available biomorphic robot, and the first to integrate personality-like features. Tilden continued to develop the line with the Robosapien V2 (released in 2005), which added functionality like speech capability; RS Media™ robot (released in 2006), which included user-created functions, and Roboreptile (also in 2006). The Roboquad a four-wheeled robot (released in 2007); the RS Tri-Bot, a three-wheeled robot (released in summer 2008),WowWee RS Tri-bot and RS Media (2006). In 2007, working with inventor Sean Frawley, WowWee released the FlyTech Dragonflya remote control flying ornithopter. The Dragonfly was named as one of the inventions of the year by Time in 2007. The success of the Dragonfly led to other flying toys, such as the Bladestar (a remote controlled helicopter) and the Butterfly (a wind-up ornithopter aimed at younger children). Under Optimal Group On September 27, 2007, the publicly traded Optimal Group announced they had entered into a purchase agreement to acquire WowWee Ltd, which they completed in November of that year. At the 2008 CES, several new products (including the Rovio and Femisapien) were announced with their estimated release dates and prices.

WowWee denied any wrongdoing and asserted that the shapes Gibson claimed as trademarks were generic and therefore could not function as trademarks. On November 24, 2010, the court denied Gibson's request for a temporary restraining order, but on December 22, 2010, granted Gibson's motion for a preliminary injunction.

Starting from a single house constructed in Ottawa, Ontario, Campeau built a large land development corporation around the development of the suburb of Kanata. Expansion in the U.S. led Campeau to diversify into the ownership of retail department stores to anchor commercial development projects. The Campeau Corporation used leveraged buyouts to buy the department stores and went bankrupt when it could not maintain the debt payments. Early years Born in Chelmsford, Ontario, Campeau's formal education ended in Grade 8, at the age of 14. He talked himself into jobs at Inco as a general labourer, carpenter and machinist. In 1949, he entered the residential end of the construction business. His first project was a single home constructed in partnership with his cousin in Ottawa, Ontario. Real estate development In Ottawa, Campeau was able to construct both office complexes and residential subdivisions to accommodate Canada's rapidly expanding civil service. Campeau frequently found himself at odds with Ottawa Mayor Charlotte Whitton over planning decisions. Whitton was quoted as saying, \\"When I look at his (Campeau's) houses, I think perhaps nuclear bombardment might not be such a terrible thing after all.\\" His Campeau Corporation had two main rivals in the residential housing market: Assaly Construction Limited and Minto Developments Inc., the latter owned by the family of future Ottawa Mayor Lorry Greenberg. Despite opposition from Whitton, Campeau developed a reputation as a high-quality builder and became the most successful in the city. A street is named after him in the Ottawa suburb of Kanata, much of which he developed. For many years, it was city policy that buildings in the downtown core were not to be taller than the Peace Tower of the parliament buildings. Campeau objected to this rule and was drawn into conflict with city council over large high-rise developments such as Place de Ville. Due to his relationships with many civil servants and ministers, he was able to have most of his projects approved. He counted amongst his personal friends politicians like Jean Chrétien, Jean Marchand, André Ouellet, Marc Lalonde, and Michael Pitfield. Campeau's real estate development success soon spread outside Ottawa. In Toronto his developments included Scotia Tower (the city's third tallest skyscraper) and the Harbour Castle Hotel (now part of the Westin Hotels chain). Corporate takeovers and bankruptcy In the 1980s, Campeau embarked on a series of leveraged buyouts (LBOs). His first attempt as a large takeover was the Royal Trust Company, which was valued at Can$7 billion compared to the $866 million for Campeau Corporation. The bank was later sold and is now part of the Royal Bank of Canada. As his business expanded, Campeau ventured into the United States, looking for acquisitions that would add shopping mall real estate to his portfolio of assets. Through junk bond LBOs, Campeau Corporation gained control of Allied Stores for US$3.6 billion in 1986 and Federated Department Stores, owner of Bloomingdale's for $6.6 billion in 1988. Campeau retained well-known investment banker Bruce Wasserstein to assist with the transactions. However, the debt obligations that needed to be covered following the merger were too large and exacerbated by a market downturn that hurt retail sales; Campeau Corporation was unable to meet its debt obligations. By June 1989, following Campeau's takeover of Federated Department Stores, both Federated and Allied Department Stores were losing money despite increased sales in year-over-year comparisons. Federated and Allied eventually filed for bankruptcy reorganization. The company was eventually acquired by the Reichman brothers who filed for bankruptcy themselves and Campeau Corporation ceased to exist. A New York Times editorial stated: \\"Any corporate executive can figure out how to file for bankruptcy when the bottom drops out of the business. It took the special genius of Robert Campeau, chairman of the Campeau Corporation, to figure out how to bankrupt more than 250 profitable department stores. The dramatic jolt to Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus, Jordan Marsh and the other proud stores reflects his overreaching grasp and oversized ego.\\" Personal life Campeau resided in a lakeside castle in Austria and he became involved in some real estate projects, including developing a large subdivision in Teltow (former GDR) near Berlin, Germany. That project failed and Campeau's company went bankrupt in 2001. The funds of the charitable foundation (Robert Campeau Family Foundation) used in his business were lost. In 1996, Campeau and his wife, Ilsa, mother of three of his children, separated. While she stayed in Austria, he first lived in Berlin with Christel Dettmann, a former East German politician, and then he returned to live in Ottawa in 2001 together with Christel. The divorce proceedings went on for many years; Ilsa's pleadings were struck and, in the end, an Ontario judge ruled in his favour.

He is the second most prominent, after Mindaugas, Grand Duke of Lithuania in the 13th century. His reign ended a seven-year unrest period after Mindaugas was assassinated in 1263 and firmly established the Grand Duchy as a pagan state for another hundred years. Traidenis expanded the Grand Duchy into the territories of Sudovians and Semigalians and strengthened its influence in Black Ruthenia. Unlike Mindaugas, Traidenis did not concentrate on expansion into the east. Kernavė hill forts. Kernavė was the Ducal Seat of Traidenis The circumstances surrounding Traidenis' advance to power are not clear. While his ancestors are unknown, it is known that he came from Aukštaitija, as he was Duke of Kernavė. From the outset his relationships with Halych-Volhynia were tense as he replaced Shvarn, Duke of Halych-Volhynia and Lithuania. The tension eventually resulted in the 1274–1276 war. Despite Mongol support to Halych-Volhynia, Traidenis was successful in battle and his control over Black Ruthenia (Navahradak, Hrodna, Slonim, and other cities) was strengthened. Traidenis also made incursions into Poland, especially surroundings of Lublin and Łęczyca, that continued to about 1306. However, these raids did not affect Masovia as Traidenis established a dynastic link through his daughter Gaudemunda with its dukes. This dynastic relationship was further developed by Gediminas. Traidenis, known for his devotion to paganism and anti-German attitude, was also successful in fighting with the Livonian Order. In 1270 he won the Battle of Karuse, fought on ice near Saaremaa, and killed Otto von Lutterberg, master of the Order. A new master, Andreas von Westfalen, sought a quick revenge, but was also killed by Traidenis. However, by 1272 the Order retaliated, attacking Semigalia and building Dinaburg Castle in 1273 on lands nominally controlled by Traidenis. Despite four siege engines used to throw stones, he was unable to capture the new fortress and had to retreat in 1278. In 1279 the order attacked Lithuanian lands, reaching as far as Kernavė, but on their way back they suffered a great defeat in the Battle of Aizkraukle. The Order's master, Ernst von Rassburg, became the third master to be killed by Traidenis. The defeat encouraged conquered Semigallians to rebel. The Semigalians, led by Nameisis, were now willing to acknowledge Lithuania's superiority and asked Traidenis for assistance. In 1281, Traidenis conquered Jersika Castle in the present-day Preiļi District, and was able to exchange it for Dinaburg Castle. However, Traidenis died soon afterwards, and assistance to Semigalians, exhausted by constant warfare, diminished. Traidenis is the first known Lithuanian duke to have died a natural death. All others before him were assassinated or killed in battle.

The name is taken from Bryce Canyon—a rugged region with many of the same landscapes that were first simulated with the software.Kitchens, Susan A. and Gavenda, Victor, Real World Bryce 4, page 18, Peachpit Press, 2000  History  The original Bryce software arose from work with fractal geometry to create realistic computer images of mountain ranges and coastlines. An initial set of fractal based programs were developed by Ken Musgrave (who later created MojoWorld) a student of Benoît Mandelbrot, and extended by Eric Wenger. Wenger later met and worked with software artist Kai Krause to design a basic user interface. The first commercial version, Bryce 1.0, appeared in 1994 for the Macintosh. Bryce 2.0, shipped in 1996, included much beyond the original notion of creating a realistic mountain range. These included independent light sources, complex atmospheric effects, the addition of primitive forms with Boolean methods to combine them, and a revamped Texture Editor. Bryce 2.0 was also ported to the Windows platform, although the first stable version, 2.1, was not released until 1997. The ability to animate a scene was added (in a stable form) with the cross- platform Bryce 3D (version 3.1) in 1997 by the newly formed MetaCreations Corporation. A \\"camera object\\" unseen in the final image acted as the observer. The camera can be held in one place for a single image, or sent on a trajectory with images being rendered at many locations. The collection of images created along the camera's trajectory are combined to create a realistic animation simulating a journey through a dynamic world. In 1999 Bryce 4.0 was released with major improvements in the handling of atmospheres and skies, textures and also in the import/export of objects. In 2000 Bryce was purchased by Corel Corporation. Corel released version 5 of Bryce in 2001, which included several new features, like Tree Lab and metaballs. Soon followed a patch to version 5.01, which fixed some bugs and added a few undocumented features. In 2004, the software was sold again, to DAZ 3D.http://www.corel.co.uk/uk/pdfs/press/uk_daz_bryce.pdf In 2005, DAZ 3D released Bryce 5.5 which included the Daz Studio Character plugin. This integration between DAZ's application for the manipulation of 3D models, Daz Studio, and Bryce allowed users to import content from Daz Studio and Poser, complete with all materials including transparencies, directly into Bryce thus making it easier to have human figures in Bryce scenes. In October 2006, DAZ 3D released Bryce 6.0 and has released an update (6.1), this includes a Mac Intel compatible update. New features include animation import, support for dual-processor systems as well as hyper-threading, random replicate tool, advanced terrain editing, HDRI support and other tweaks. The interface remained largely the same, but with a green tint to it, and different buttons in the create palette.

They were introduced in Power Pack #1 (August 1984) and were created by Louise Simonson and June Brigman. Fictional biography The Kymellians resemble anthropomorphic horses. Centuries ago, the Kymellians experimented with a formula to generate energy from anti-matter, but destroyed their home planet, Kymellia. Many Kymellians survived, and created a new home: a huge artificial world named Kymellia II. Kymellians have the latent potential of superpowers. These include abilities they consider \\"lesser\\" such as teleportation and healing, and other, \\"major\\" ones. Mastering the major powers is very rare among them, and the Kymellians call those among them who succeed \\"Sorcerers\\". A Kymellian named Aelfyre Whitemane (nicknamed \\"Whitey\\") and his \\"smartship\\" (a sentient starship, one of many used by Kymellians), called Friday after the character in Robinson Crusoe (after Aelfyre's interest in human literature), were studying Earth when a human scientist, Dr. James Power, was about to commit the same mistake that destroyed Kymellia. Whitey tries to ask his people for permission to interfere and save the Earth, but his message is intercepted by the Kymellians' enemies, the Zn'rx (anglicized \\"Snarks\\"), and they kidnap Dr. Power and his wife to gain the anti-matter formula. Whitey is mortally wounded in the process. Whitey rescues Power's four children, and grants them the powers he had mastered as a Kymellian Sorcerer: control over gravity and the abilities to fly, to change his molecular density, and to convert matter into energy. With this final act, Whitey perishes.Power Pack #1 (August 1984) The children use their new powers to save the world and their parents, and become the superhero group Power Pack.Power Pack #2-4 (September-November 1984) Months later, Power Pack (with Kofi Whitemane and Franklin Richards) travel to Kymellia II, where they learn that most Kymellians thought poorly of Whitey's decision, and that their culture was under the influence of a ruthless Kymellian Technocrat. The Pack even had to fight the Kymellian champions, Force Four, a team of four Kymellian Sorcerers: Firemane, who had fire powers; Ghostmare, who could become intangible; Team Leader, who could invent anything, and Thunderhoof, who had super strength. (Force Four was a homage to the Fantastic Four, even having pig Latin versions of their real names.) The Pack defeated them, and then saved the Kymellians from the Snarks with Kofi's help. During these events, Ghostmare became The Matriarch, the Kymellians' spiritual leader, and established a new planet, Kymellia III. The Technocrat later tried to regain control of his race; but failed, and the Kymellians continue peacefully on Kymellia III. The Inhumans and the Kree later form an alliance with the Kymellians and even perform the operation that would enable them to survive the Terrigen Mist. These Kymellians alongside the Badoons, the Centaurians, and the Dire Wraiths join with the Inhumans to form the Universal Inhumans. The Kymellians' procedure involves them consuming the nectar that blooms from the Antigen Tree (a mutagenic substance).Fantastic Four #577 Known Kymellians * Aelfyre Whitemane - * Byrel Whitemane - * Fayrelyte Strongheart - * Force Four - * Kal Blackbane - A Kymellian Swordsman who is a member of the Universal Inhumans' Light Brigade.

Human scientists mined the ship for technology and the pilot's DNA for experimentation. In the latter case, Kymellian DNA was bonded to an unwilling teenage test subject who not only developed teleportation abilities (similar to Kofi's), but also gained the ability to assume a Kymellian form, all before escaping from his captors. The teen, born Elric Freeman, took the name Elric Whitemane in honor of his new Kymellian heritage (intimating that the unnamed Kymellian pilot was that reality's Aelfyre Whitemane), and combining his horse-like alternate form with his love of stories of the American Old West, assumed a cowboy-like costumed identity as Kid Colt to fight oppression on the rapidly deteriorating Earth counterpart. Currently, this Earth has been shifted into the \\"prime\\" Marvel reality (Earth-616) as the latest planet to be dubbed Counter-Earth, and Kid Colt is a member of that world's premiere team of young superheroes, the Young Allies.

He was the secretary of the West Bengal State Committee of Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) and member of the party's Polit Bureau beginning in 1998.  Early life  Biswas born in a peasant family of Darermath village near Karimpur, Nadia district. While in high school he was attracted to the Left movement in the area. in 1961 he joined the Krishnagar Government College and came under the influence of Marxist leaders like Harinarayan Adhikari and Dinesh Mazumdar and also became an active member of the Students' Federation of India. He was a student leader in College elections. After taking an Honours degree in political science, he shifted to Kolkata to pursue his academic career.  Politics  He became the full-fledged party member of the CPI(M) in 1965. In the same year he was arrested under the Defence of India Rules 1962 and was imprisoned for 11 months. From jail custody he completed the master's degree in Political Science. In 1969 he became a whole-timer of the party and joined Ganashakti as a reporter. Biswas' close association with Ganashakti continued until 1998 and it was during his editorship the newspaper reached the height circulation. Anil Bisaws became member of the Central Committee of the party in the year of 1985. In 1998 he took charge of the General secretary of the State committee and also became a member of the Polit Bureau. He was mentored by Pramod Dasgupta. He was the editor of Marxbadi Path (The Road of the Marxist), the theoretical quarterly in West Bengal. He was known to be a deft strategist and the brain behind the party's important decisions in West Bengal politics. In one of his genius decisions, he influenced the party to name Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as Chief Minister of West Bengal replacing Jyoti Basu before the 2000 West Bengal Legislative Assembly Elections. This was a strategically shrewd decision because people of West Bengal was frustrated by the same Chief Minister for more than 20 years. It got the Left front a huge victory in spite of strong opposition from Mamata Banerjee's TMC. Because of Anil Biswas' organized election tactics as the State General Secretary in the 2006 West Bengal Assembly Election, the opposition reduced to significantly small number of seats. He used to manage the media and the ground-workers so well that he knew the pulse of the general public in and out. It is largely believed that the demise of Anil Biswas and other important ground-leaders such as Subhas Chakraborty paved the way for the opposition to come into power replacing the Left front.  Death  He died on 26 March 2006 after being hospitalised by a brain haemorrhage on 18 March. His body was donated to NRS Medical College and Hospital according to his last wishes. He is survived by his wife Gita and daughter Ajanta.

Biography Alioto was born in San Francisco in 1916. His father was a Sicilian immigrant who owned and operated several fish processing companies. His mother, Domenica Mae Lazio, was born in San Francisco in 1893. His parents met on a fishing boat while escaping the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Education He attended Sacred Heart High School (presently Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory). He graduated with honors from St. Mary's College, Moraga, California in 1937 and from law school at The Catholic University of America with honors in 1940. Law practice Alioto worked for the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and then for the Board of Economic Warfare. He returned to San Francisco after World War II and started an antitrust practice, representing Walt Disney and Samuel Goldwyn, among others, eventually becoming a millionaire. He was on the briefs in Radovich v. National Football League and argued Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690 (1962),https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=91756109290821031 an antitrust landmark, and Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685 (1967),https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3718843325874113120 all three Supreme Court of the United States cases. In Radovich, the Supreme Court held that professional football, unlike baseball, was subject to antitrust laws. Continental Ore is one of the most comprehensive and important antitrust cases ever decided by the Supreme Court. In 1980, he represented Al Davis and the Oakland Raiders in a landmark antitrust case entitled Los Angeles Coliseum Commission v. The NFL. The case established the right of football franchises to move to football markets throughout the United States without the approval of other franchise owners. In 1993, he represented his father-in-law Billy Sullivan in his lawsuit against the NFL. The court ruled that Sullivan was forced by the league to sell his team at below market value and awarded him $114 million. Political career Alioto served on the San Francisco Board of Education from 1948 to 1954, and in the 1960s, served as the chair of the city's Redevelopment Agency. In 1967, Alioto signed on as campaign finance chairman for the mayoral candidacy of California State Senator J. Eugene McAteer. When McAteer collapsed and died while playing a game of handball, Alioto entered the race. John Shelley, the incumbent, bowed out, allegedly because of poor health but probably because Alioto was more pro-development than Shelley; additionally, Shelley was expected to lose a re-match against his 1963 opponent, Republican Harold Dobbs. Alioto defeated Dobbs, 44.2%-37.8%, in an 18-candidate field.\\"San Francisco Mayor, November 07, 1967\\"; https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=131872. Joseph L. Alioto was inaugurated on January 8, 1968, served a term, and was handily re- elected in 1971. Alioto delivered the speech nominating Hubert Humphrey at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. There were rumors that Humphrey would select Alioto as his running mate, but Humphrey selected Edmund Muskie. An article in the September 23, 1969 issue of Look magazine claimed that Alioto had business and personal ties to the Los Angeles Mafioso boss Jimmy Fratianno. Alioto later sued Look for libel and won a $450,000 judgment. In the course of the litigation, Alioto proved that Look, desperate and on the verge of bankruptcy, simply conjured up (with no proof) an alleged mob meeting in Vacaville, California at the Nut Tree Restaurant. He later claimed that he had documents that showed that the Nixon administration leaked disinformation to the magazine in order to stall his career. \\"Alioto's Odyssey\\" in Time Magazine, November 13, 1972 In January 1970, the State of Washington, three cities, a port authority, and eight public utilities brought a civil suit against Alioto because he split a $2.3 million fee in an antitrust case with Washington State Attorney General John J. O'Connell and an O’Connell deputy, George Faler. Attorney General O’Connell had maintained Public Utility Districts as private clients during his time as AG. The Public Utility Districts were suing electrical manufactures that were fixing prices at an improperly high level. The case began in 1962 and O’Connell retained Alioto, a very successful anti-trust attorney, to work on the case. Originally, Alioto agreed to receive 15% of what was awarded with a $1 million cap. Later, O’Connell, apparently without telling his clients, abolished the fee ceiling. Alioto ended up receiving approximately $2.3 million and gave $802,815 of those fees to O’Connell and Faler. The state and other groups sued to have the entire $2.3 million returned. The trial took six months and jury unanimously found the three were entitled to the $2.3 million. Alioto was also indicted by a federal grand jury in March 1971 on bribery charges because of the means by which the fees were awarded. When the case went to court, Alioto was cleared of the federal charges by a judge who ordered acquittal because he was convinced a jury would not convict when it considered the evidence.\\"U.S. Judge Orders Acquittal for Alioto, 2 Others,\\" Associated Press in the Los Angeles Times, June 20, 1972, page A-1 \`Library card required\` Under California law it was illegal for public employees to strike.City and County of San Francisco v. Cooper, 534 P.2d 403, 13 Cal. 3d 898, 120 Cal. Rptr. 707 (1975). Nevertheless, city employees called a strike in March 1974, picketing city hall and shutting down municipal services. After a week Mayor Alioto and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors agreed to the strikers' demands. The city controller, however, refused to pay out what he believed were illegal salaries. In April 1975 the California Supreme Court ordered the city controller to pay the salaries, with Justice Mathew Tobriner finding that contracts secured through illegal strikes are still legally enforceable.City and County of San Francisco v. Cooper, 534 P.2d 403, 13 Cal. 3d 898, 120 Cal. Rptr. 707 (1975). Major crime became a problem with the Zodiac Killer, the Symbionese Liberation Army attacks and the Black Power Zebra Murders all occurring under Alioto’s watch. During the Zebra Murders in 1974, Alioto's wife, Angelina Alioto, vanished, reappearing after 18 days to claim that she had taken off to \\"punish\\" her husband for neglect. During the time Angelina was missing, she toured the missions of California as part of a religious pilgrimage. Angelina filed divorce proceedings against him in 1975. He remarried in 1978. Alioto ran in the 1974 Democratic primary for governor, finishing second behind Jerry Brown. In July 1975 the LAPD unexpectedly announced a pay raise. For years the San Francisco Police Department had been the top paid in the state, with the San Francisco Fire Department guaranteed the same pay. The SF police promptly demanded they be paid more than the LAPD.Comment, Emergency Mayoral Power: An Exercise in Charter Interpretation, 65 Cal. L. Rev. 686. The Board of Supervisors, however, determined that the pay raise would drive the city into deficit, and unanimously approved a raise only half of what the police requested. California law still prohibited public employees from striking.Verreos v. City and County of San Francisco, 63 Cal. App. 3d 86, 133 Cal. Rptr. 649 (Ct. App. 1976). The police and firefighters elected to strike anyway, with 90% illegally abandoning their posts. The city then obtained a court order declaring the strike illegal and enjoining the officers to return to work. The court messenger delivering the order was met with violence and the police continued to strike. Only managers and African-American officers remained, with 45 officers and 3 fire trucks responsible for the whole city.Comment, Emergency Mayoral Power: An Exercise in Charter Interpretation, 65 Cal. L. Rev. 686. citing S.F. Chronicle, August 20, 1875, at 1, col. 2. Supervisor Dianne Feinstein pleaded for Mayor Alioto to ask Governor Jerry Brown to call out the National Guard to patrol the streets but Alioto refused. When enraged citizens confronted police at the picket lines the police arrested them. Federal authorities were forced to intervene after striking firefighters attempted to seize San Francisco International Airport.Comment, Emergency Mayoral Power: An Exercise in Charter Interpretation, 65 Cal. L. Rev. 686 citing N.Y. Times, Aug. 21, 1975, at 28, col 4. Heavy drinking on the picket line became common and after striking police officers started shooting out streetlights the ACLU obtained a court order prohibiting strikers from carrying their service revolvers. Again, the police ignored the court order. On August 20 a bomb detonated at the Mayor’s home with a sign reading \\"Don’t Threaten Us\\" left on his lawn. On August 21 Mayor Alioto advised the Supervisors that they should concede to the strikers' demands. The Supervisors unanimously refused. Mayor Alioto then immediately declared a state of emergency, assumed \\"legislative powers\\", and granted the strikers’ demands.Verreos v. City and County of San Francisco, 63 Cal. App. 3d 86, 133 Cal. Rptr. 649 (Ct. App. 1976). The Supervisors and taxpayers sued but the court reaffirmed that contracts obtained through illegal strikes are still legally enforceable. Nevertheless, the Supervisors placed on the November ballot charter initiatives revoking the mayor’s emergency powers, requiring police to be automatically fired if they strike, preventing firemen from holding second jobs, and requiring future pay raises to be averaged with California’s other large cities. All the ballot initiatives passed by extremely large margins. After he left office, Alioto went back into private practice. He and his son Joseph Jr. lost a major malpractice case against a cattle rancher in 1980. He received millions in legal fees after counseling the Oakland Raiders win against the City of Oakland.City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders, 203 Cal. App. 3d 78, 249 Cal. Rptr. 606 (Ct. App. 1988). In 1991, he and his son went to battle in court against each other over legal fees in the Raiders case. Death Alioto died of prostate cancer in San Francisco on January 29, 1998 and was interred at Cypress Lawn Cemetery in Colma, California. A cenotaph is located at Holy Cross Cemetery (Section D). Legacy Alioto presided over a time of turmoil and change in San Francisco. Events that occurred during his tenure as mayor included strife in the Haight- Ashbury with the drug culture, anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, the start of the gay Castro District, Black Panther marches, the Zebra murders and Zodiac killings. He ran on a platform of reducing taxes and fighting crime. Alioto put his energy behind the development of three major building projects: the Bay Area Rapid Transit System (BART); the Transamerica Pyramid; and the Embarcadero Center. These efforts engendered opposition in the development stage but were eventually built, transforming the quality of life and skyline of San Francisco. Alioto helped to bring more minorities into city politics, launched a reform of the city charter, and mediated protracted police and fire department strikes in 1975. Alioto's tenure began with a citywide newspaper strike of the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner in February 1968. The first faculty strike at a college or university in the United States was at San Francisco State College, now San Francisco State University, during 1968–1969; Alioto gave the law enforcement resources of the City and County of San Francisco to the university president, S.I. Hayakawa. Joseph L. Alioto Recreation Center The Joseph L. Alioto Recreation Center at his alma mater, Saint Mary's College in Moraga, California opened in 2015 and is named after him. The privately funded facility cost $23.5 million, and includes an outdoor aquatics center, indoor exercise equipment, a rock climbing wall, and a cafe. The center serves the general student body, while varsity athletes use separate dedicated training facilities. After his death, the Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco was dedicated as the \\"Joseph L. Alioto Performing Arts Piazza\\" on October 28, 1998. Additionally, there is a mini park and community garden named for him in the Mission District of San Francisco. Alioto family Alioto had five sons and a daughter with his first wife,https://www.kqed.org/news/11669089/call-me-a-san-franciscan-angela- alioto-on-political-lessons-from-her-dad-and-her-run-for-mayor (Thur., 17 May 2018) and a son and daughter with his second wife. Members of Alioto's family are still involved in San Francisco politics. His second wife, Kathleen Sullivan Alioto, was a member of the Boston School committee and a candidate for a United States Senate seat in Massachusetts in the 1978 primary. Sullivan and Alioto married in 1978 and remained together until his death in 1998. Because they were both divorced, the wedding was performed by excommunicated Catholic priest and activist Joseph O'Rourke. Angela Alioto, the daughter from his first marriage, served eight years as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, two as its President. One of Angela's three sons, Joe Alioto Veronese, campaigned for a California State Senate seat in 2008. One of his granddaughters, Michela Alioto-Pier, was appointed to the Board of Supervisors in 2003 by San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom and won election to the Board in 2004. His grandson Joseph Alioto Jr. ran an unsuccessful bid for a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in District 3. Several of his sons, as well as many of his grandchildren, are successful attorneys and businesspersons in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Initially implemented from 2001 to 2007, it had bipartisan support from the Coalition and Labor opposition at the time. The Pacific Solution consisted of three central strategies: thousands of islands were excised from Australia's migration zone or Australian territory, the Australian Defence Force commenced Operation Relex to intercept vessels carrying asylum seekers and the asylum seekers were removed to detention centres in Nauru and on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, while their refugee status was determined. A number of pieces of legislation enabled this policy. The policy was developed by the Howard Government in response to the Tampa affair in August 2001 and the Children Overboard affair, and was implemented by then Australian Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock on 28 September before the 2001 federal election of 24 November. The policy was largely dismantled in 2008 by the first Rudd Government following the election of the Labor Party; Chris Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship described it as \\"a cynical, costly and ultimately unsuccessful exercise\\". In August 2012, the succeeding Gillard Government (Labor) introduced a similar policy, reopening the Nauru and Manus detention centres for offshore processing. On 19 July 2013, newly returned Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, during his short-lived second term of office, announced that \\"asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in Australia\\", striking a Regional Resettlement Arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea, colloquially known as the PNG Solution, to divert all \\"unauthorised maritime arrivals\\" to mandatory detention on Manus Island with no possibility of attaining Australian residency. The Operation Sovereign Borders policy took over from the Pacific Solution after the 2013 federal election, won by the Coalition. It commenced on 18 September 2013 under the new Abbott Government. In 31 March 2019, Operation Sovereign Borders reported that there were no people held in the detention centre on Nauru, which had been closed, and the Manus centre had been officially closed on 31 October 2017. However, on 30 September 2019 the total number of asylum seekers still in PNG and Nauru was 562 (separate numbers were not published), being housed in alternative accommodation. Implementation (2001–2007) Afghan refugees returning to Afghanistan worldwide 1994–2011 versus boat people arriving in Australia 1994–2012 The Australian Government passed legislation on 27 September 2001, with amendments to the Commonwealth Migration Act (1958). The implementation of this legislation became known as the Pacific Solution. By redefining the area of Australian territory that could be landed upon and then legitimately used for claims of asylum (the migration zone), and by removing any intercepted people to third countries for processing, the aim was to deter future asylum seekers from making the dangerous journey by boat, once they knew that their trip would probably not end with a legitimate claim for asylum in Australia. On 28 October 2001, at his 2001 election campaign policy launch, Prime Minister John Howard said \\"we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come\\" in an effort to build support for the policy. Asylum seekers were intercepted at sea while sailing from Indonesia and moved using Australian naval vessels. Detention centres were set up on Christmas Island, Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, and on the island nation of Nauru. Some were also accepted for processing by New Zealand. Most of the asylum seekers came from Afghanistan (largely of the Hazara ethnic group), Iraq, Iran, China, and Vietnam. The last asylum seekers to be detained on Nauru before the end of the policy had come from Sri Lanka and Myanmar.\\"Sri Lankans to be sent to Nauru\\". BBC, 15 March 2007 Arrivals dropped from a total of 5516 people in 2001 to 1 arrival in 2002 after implementation of the policy, and remained below 150 annually until 2008. The removal of the Taliban from power in Afghanistan may have had some effect in this decrease, as nearly six million Afghans had returned to Afghanistan since 2002, almost a quarter of the country's population at the time. A lower level of boat arrivals continued throughout the Pacific Solution period, and it has significantly peaked in numbers since the abolition of the policy, despite worldwide asylum claim numbers remaining low by historical standards. These arrivals have also corresponded with increasing numbers of new refugee arrivals in Indonesia after the abandonment of the policy: 385 in 2008, 3,230 in 2009, 3,905 in 2010, 4,052 in 2011, 7,218 in 2012 and 8,332 in 2013. A probable link between restrictive refugee policies and lower attempts at seeking asylum in Australia by boat have been confirmed by the UNHCR: in April 2014, UNHCR Indonesia representative Manual Jordao stated: \\"Word that the prospects of reaching Australia by boat from Indonesia are now virtually zero appears to have reached smugglers and would-be asylum seekers in countries of origin such as Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Myanmar. The numbers registering with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in Indonesia have dropped from about 100 a day during 2013 to about 100 a week now.\\" Four boats were successfully returned to Indonesian waters out of the twelve Suspected Illegal Entry Vessels (SIEVs) intercepted by the Navy during Operation Relex during 2001–2002, having made 10 attempts to enforce the policy, based on judgements of whether it was safe to do so or not. Three men allegedly drowned trying to swim back to shore after returning to Indonesia. In November 2003, a boat carrying 53 passengers was successfully deterred, and in March 2004, Customs returned a boat with 15 people after interception at the Ashmore Islands. The success rate was 36 per cent of boats, or 31 per cent of asylum seekers sent back to Indonesia. Details of operations from 2005 to 2008 are scant. Operation Resolute began in July 2006, run jointly by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Defence Force. During the Pacific Solution period, mainland detention centres were closed at Baxter, Woomera and Curtin. The number of asylum seekers assessed as genuine refugees via the Pacific Solution process was lower than for onshore processing. 68 per cent of the asylum seekers were deemed genuine refugees and less than 40 per cent of asylum seekers sent to Nauru received resettlement in Australia. A 2006 report by the Australian Human Rights Commission showed that of the 1509 asylum seekers sent to Nauru by that time, 586 were granted Australian resettlement (39%), 360 resettled in New Zealand (24%), 19 resettled in Sweden (1.2%), 10 in Canada (<1%) and 4 in Norway (<1%). A total of 482 asylum seekers (32%) were deemed not genuine refugees and sent home. The cost of the Pacific Solution between 2001 and 2007 was at least $1 billion. Amnesty International, refugee rights groups and other non-governmental organisations said that Australia was failing to meet its international obligations. The ad hoc nature in which the policy evolved was also criticised, as it resulted in people being moved to Manus Island and Nauru before facilities were ready. Poor facilities and services including intermittent electricity and fresh water, poor medical facilities and the serious mental impact of detention on people in these conditions without the certainty of being granted refugee status were also strongly criticised.http://info.humanrights.curtin.edu.au/local/docs/Nauru- report-12Sept2012.pdf Suspension During the campaign for the 2007 parliamentary election, Australian Labor Party leader Kevin Rudd promised to continue the Howard Government's policies of turning boats back to Indonesia and the issue of temporary protection visas.http://www.andysrant.com/2013/07/audio-of-kevin-rudd-saying-turn-back- the-boats-in-2007.html Upon Kevin Rudd's 2007 election win, the Pacific Solution was abandoned, with the Nauru processing centre closed down in February 2008, a move welcomed by the UN Refugee Agency. The last detainees left Manus Island in 2004 and Nauru in February 2008. The Republic of Nauru was concerned about losing much-needed aid from Australia.Nauru fears gap when camps close. The Age, 11 December 2007 Opposition immigration spokesman Chris Ellison said the closure could suggest to people-smugglers that Australia was weakening on border protection. Re-implementation (post-2007) Immigration Detention Population to December 2014 The Australian Government opened the Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre in late 2008, and has since expanded facilities and accommodation there. In the 2012–2013 financial year the Government of Australia budgeted $1.1 billion to cover the processing costs for 450 arrivals per month. From 2007 to 2010, the number of asylum seeker arrivals by boat increased substantially—from 148 in 2007 to 6555 in 2010. This contributed to Rudd's ailing popularity through to 2010, when he resigned prior to a leadership spill of the Australian Labor Party to Julia Gillard; at this time Rudd said \\"This party and government will not be lurching to the right on the question of asylum seekers\\". In July 2010, Gillard showed support for the utilisation of \\"regional processing centres\\". In December 2010, in the aftermath of an asylum seeker boat sinking at Christmas Island in which 48 occupants perished, Queensland Premier and ALP national president Anna Bligh called for a complete review of the government's policy on asylum seekers. In May 2011, the Gillard Government announced plans to address the issue of asylum seekers arriving by boat with an asylum seeker 'swap' deal for long-standing genuine refugees in Malaysia. Refugee lawyers asked the High Court to strike down the deal, arguing that the Immigration Minister did not have the power to send asylum seekers to a country that has no legal obligations to protect them. There were calls on the Australian Government to reinstate the Pacific Solution by reopening the detention centres on Nauru. Several of these came from former outspoken critics of the policy. Refugee lawyer Marion Le, who had demanded the facility be shut down in 2005, said that it was \\"time for Labor to bite the bullet and reopen Nauru\\", while human rights lawyer Julian Burnside disagreed, but conceded that \\"Nauru [was] certainly the less worse, but both are unacceptable.\\" This echoed the sentiment of Independent MP Andrew Wilkie who several days previously, while stopping short of calling for a return to the previous arrangement, noted that \\"John Howard's Pacific Solution was better.\\" The Malaysian people swap deal was deemed unlawful by the High Court. During the 2010 Australian federal election campaign Liberal Leader Tony Abbott said he would meet with the President of Nauru, Marcus Stephen, to demonstrate the Coalition's resolve to reinstate the Pacific Solution policy, should he become Prime Minister.Abbott to talk to Nauru on reopening camp, Yuko Narushima and Kirsty Needham, The Age, 8 August 2010.

The Age. Retrieved 25 December 2010 In August 2012, a government-appointed expert panel (Houston Report) recommended a number of changes to the current policy including the reintroduction of the Pacific Solution after an increase in boat people and deaths at sea. It handed down 22 recommendations, including the immediate reopening of immigration detention facilities on Manus Island and Nauru, which the government implemented with bipartisan support. This was expected to cost $2 billion over four years for Nauru and $900 million for Papua New Guinea. The bill to do so was passed on 16 August 2012. Asylum seekers who arrive by boat to Australia are now to be transferred to remote Pacific islands indefinitely while their claims to refugee status are being processed. Amnesty International described the conditions of the Nauru detention facility as \\"appalling\\" at this time. The Government announced on 21 November 2012 that it was recommencing onshore processing with bridging visas. ALP caucus meeting in July 2013 On 21 November 2012 Immigration Minister Chris Bowen announced the reopening the Pontville Detention Centre in Tasmania. On 19 July 2013 in a joint press conference with PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd detailed the Regional Resettlement Arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea:REGIONAL RESETTLEMENT ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA.. Retrieved 26 July 2013. The subsequent Department of Immigration and Citizenship press release stated: \\"Australia will work with PNG to expand the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre, as well as explore the construction of other regional processing centres in Papua New Guinea...The arrangements also allows for other countries (including Pacific Island states) to participate in similar arrangements in the future.\\" The number of arrivals continued to climb, to 25,173 in the 2012–13 financial year, and approximately 862 asylum seekers died trying to reach Australia between 2008 and July 2013. In June 2013, Kevin Rudd toppled Gillard in another leadership spill, following weeks of polls indicating the ALP would be defeated at the next election. Operation Sovereign Borders A new policy on boat arrival deterrence, Operation Sovereign Borders, was launched by the new Liberal–National Coalition on 18 September 2013. Papua New Guinea The Regional Resettlement Arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea, colloquially known as the PNG solution, is the name given to an Australian Government policy in which any asylum seeker who comes to Australia by boat without a visa will be refused settlement in Australia, instead being settled in Papua New Guinea if they are found to be legitimate refugees. The policy includes a significant expansion of the Australian immigration detention facility on Manus Island, where refugees will be sent to be processed prior to resettlement in Papua New Guinea, and if their refugee status is found to be non-genuine, they will be either repatriated, sent to a third country other than Australia or remain in detention indefinitely. The policy was announced on 19 July 2013 by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, effective immediately, in response to a growing number of asylum seeker boat arrivals. The then Opposition Leader Tony Abbott initially welcomed the policy, while Greens leader Christine Milne and several human rights advocate groups opposed it, with demonstrations protesting the policy held in every major Australian city after the announcement. Announcement In the fortnight prior to the announcement of the PNG solution, Rudd visited Indonesia for regular annual talks with Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono where they discussed asylum seeker issues, but played down expectations of a policy announcement. On 15 July he and Immigration Minister Tony Burke visited Papua New Guinea to discuss asylum seeker policy, in light of a UN Refugee Agency report saying the Manus Island detention centre did not meet international standards. On 19 July 2013 Rudd, Burke and Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Peter O'Neill announced the policy in Brisbane. Rudd declared \\"From now on, any asylum seeker who arrives in Australia by boat will have no chance of being settled in Australia as refugees.\\" In his speech, he said that asylum seekers taken to Christmas Island will be sent to Manus Island or elsewhere, where their refugee status will be assessed. The announcement also outlined plans to expand the Manus Island detention facility, from 600 occupants to 3,000. All refugees found to be legitimate will be resettled in Papua New Guinea. Any asylum seekers found to be non-genuine refugees will either be repatriated, moved to a third country other than Australia if it is unsafe to be repatriated, or remain in detention indefinitely. Australia will bear the full cost of the setup of the policy, as well as provide funding for reforms of Papua New Guinea's university sector, and assistance with health, education and law and order. Rudd described the policy as \\"a very hard-line decision\\" to \\"combat the scourge of people smuggling\\". The two-page Regional Resettlement Arrangement outlining the policy was signed by Rudd and O'Neill prior to the announcement. Reception The Australian Opposition Leader Tony Abbott initially showed support for the policy, but said it \\"wouldn't work under Mr Rudd\\". The Australian Greens leader Christine Milne slammed the announcement, describing the announcement as \\"a day of shame\\". It was condemned by human rights groups such as Amnesty International Australia, who wrote \\"Mark this day in history as the day Australia decided to turn its back on the world's most vulnerable people, closed the door and threw away the key\\"; and the UN Refugee Agency, describing the policy as potentially \\"harmful to the physical and psycho-social wellbeing of transferees, particularly families and children\\". Protests of hundreds of supporters were held in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide following the announcement. On Manus Island, public opinion regarding the policy and the expansion of the detention centre was mixed. Gary Zuffa, governor of the Oro Province, suggested asylum seekers resettled there are likely to be met with hostility.

He was also active in Boston's Sons of Liberty movement in the years before the war. However, early in the American Revolution, Church was also sending secret information to General Thomas Gage, the British commander, and when one of his letters into Boston was intercepted, he was tried and convicted of \\"communicating with the enemy\\". Biography Family and education Church was born in Newport, Colony of Rhode Island, the son of Benjamin Church, a merchant of Boston and deacon of the Hollis Street Church conducted by the Rev. Mather Byles. His great-grandfather, Colonel Benjamin Church, took a prominent part in the war with the Narragansett Indians and led the force which hunted King Philip to his death on August 12, 1676. Dr Benjamin Church (the third Benjamin Church) was a Mayflower descendant through his great-great grandmother Elizabeth Warren Church who was the daughter of Richard Warren, one of the Mayflower passengers. Benjamin's sister Alice married Boston printer John Fleeming. The third Benjamin attended the Boston Latin School and graduated from Harvard College in 1754. He studied medicine with Dr. Joseph Pynchon, later continuing his studies in London. While there, he married Hannah Hill of Ross, Herefordshire. Returning to Boston he built up a reputation as a talented physician and a skillful surgeon. Church performed cataract surgery, and is also remembered for treating the eye ailments of John Adams. Political ambiguities With growing friction between the colonies and Great Britain, Church supported the Whig cause vigorously with his pen. There is evidence that during this period he was variously considered as an ardent Patriot and as a secret Tory sympathizer. He examined the body of Crispus Attucks and treated some of the wounded in the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. In 1773, he delivered the annual Massacre Day oration, To Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March 1770, which marked him as an orator of high order. In 1774, Church was elected a delegate to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and later made a member of its Committee of Safety, which was in charge of preparing for armed conflict. Around the same time, Gen. Gage began receiving detailed intelligence on the Provincial Congress's activities. On February 21, 1775, the Provincial Congress appointed Church and Dr. Joseph Warren a committee to make an inventory of medical supplies necessary for the army and, on March 7, voted them the sum of five hundred pounds for the purchase of such supplies. On May 8, 1775, after the Revolutionary War had begun, Church became a member of an examining board for surgeons for the army. A June 19 resolution ordered \\"that Dr. Church, Dr. Taylor, and Dr. Whiting be a committee to consider what method is proper to take to supply the hospitals with surgeons and that the same gentlemen be a committee to provide medicine and other necessaries for hospitals.\\" As the chairman of a subcommittee of the Committee of Safety, he signed a report on May 12 which recommended a system of defensive works on Prospect Hill and Bunker Hill. Colleagues noted, however, that he had insisted on entering Boston soon after the Battle of Lexington and Concord, and while there he was seen in conference with British General Thomas Gage; he claimed to have been arrested and released. Director General In May, Church went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to consult the Continental Congress about the defense of Massachusetts colony. On July 27, that body authorized the establishment of a Medical Department of the Army with a Director General and Chief Physician who would be head of both the Hospital Department of the first Army Hospital and of the first headquarters of regimental surgeons (located in the Henry Vassall House, Cambridge, MA). In the meantime, on July 2, General George Washington had arrived at Cambridge to take command of the colonial forces, and Church was one of the committee appointed to receive him. Church had difficulty administering his department, and the regimental surgeons. A storm of complaints poured into Army headquarters, and Washington was compelled to order an investigation of the Medical Service. In his own defense, Church complained that rivals were jealous of his position and reportedly asked for permission to leave the Army. In the meantime, an incident arose which brought him before an Army court martial on October 4, 1775. \\"Criminal correspondence\\" and court martial In July 1775, Church had sent a cipher letter addressed to a Major Cane, a British officer in Boston, through a former mistress. The letter was intercepted by another of the woman's ex-lovers, and was sent to Washington in September. When two teams of gentlemen decoded it, they found it contained an account of the American forces before Boston, though no disclosures of great importance. It did, however, declare Church's devotion to the Crown, and it asked for directions for continuing the correspondence. The matter was placed before a court of inquiry made up of general officers, Washington presiding, to whom Church admitted the authorship of the letter, but explained that it was written with the object of impressing the enemy with the strength and position of the colonial forces in order to prevent an attack while the Continental army was still short of ammunition and in hopes of aiding to bring about an end to hostilities. The court considered that Church had carried on a criminal correspondence with the enemy and recommended that the matter be referred to the Continental Congress for its action. The report of Washington to the President of Congress stated: Church was briefly incarcerated in a room of the Henry Vassall House in Cambridge, where his carved name can be seen today. The Massachusetts Provincial Congress arraigned Church on November 2. Despite an eloquent appeal in his own defense, he was unanimously expelled as a member of the House. The Continental Congress on October 17, 1775, elected Dr. John Morgan \\"in the room of\\" Dr. Church, and on November 7 passed the following resolution: In accordance with this resolution, Church was confined at Norwich, Connecticut. Becoming ill, he was released from jail in January 1776, and was permitted considerable movement under guard. On May 13, he returned to Massachusetts under bond. He remained imprisoned until 1778, and was named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act of that year. Shortly thereafter he sailed from Boston, presumably for Martinique, but the vessel on which he took passage was never heard from again. Assessment When scholars were able to open General Gage's files early in the 20th century, they discovered earlier letters with significant intelligence about the American forces that could only have come from Church. The files included notes that had been entrusted to him to carry into and out of Boston. Until then, historians had had difficulty estimating the degree of Dr. Church's guilt. It is now clear that he was supplying the British military with information in early 1775, most likely because he was deeply in debt and needed the money. It is worth noting that Church shared this information when Americans were not yet fixed on independence. Therefore, a charitable view of his actions would be that \\"he visualized himself as the arbitrator who should bring about the restoration of friendly relations between the fatherland and the colonies, little suspecting that its effects would place him in the ranks of those we brand as traitors.\\" That said, he went to considerable lengths to conceal his activities. Church's widow and family were pensioned by the British government. Popular culture *In the video game Assassin's Creed III, Church is portrayed as member of the antagonistic Templars. He later betrays the Templars by supplying information to the British, counter to the Order's current plans. *Church appears as a character in the novel Thieftaker by D. B. Jackson in which he examines the titular character.

Hasenfus (born January 22, 1941) is a former United States Marine who helped fly weapons shipments on behalf of the U.S. government to the anti communist Contra in Nicaragua. He was the sole survivor after his plane was shot down by the Nicaraguan government in 1986, and was sentenced to 30 years in prison for terrorism and other charges, but pardoned and released the same year. The statements he made to the Sandinista government resulted in a controversy in the U.S. government, after the Reagan administration denied any connection to him. Personal life Eugene Hasenfus was born on January 22, 1941. In 1986, he lived in Marinette, Wisconsin. The U.S. army described him as having joined the Marine Corps in May 1960 and having spent five years in the corps before receiving an honorable discharge. At the time of his capture, he was married to Sally Hasenfus. He had a brother named William. Contra scandal Capture On October 5, 1986, Hasenfus was aboard a Fairchild C-123 cargo plane, N4410F, when it was shot down over Nicaragua by the Sandinista government. The aircraft was brought down when it was approximately north of the border with Costa Rica, and a little over southeast of Managua. The plane had been flying weapons to the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels. Three members of the flight crew were killed: Hasenfus was the only survivor. The two pilots and a Nicaraguan radio operator died in the crash. Hasenfus had been wearing a parachute, unusual for Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operatives at the time. Hasenfus managed to dive out of the open cargo hatch of the plane after it was hit by the Nicaraguan missile; he was later captured while sleeping in a makeshift hammock made from his parachute. CIA links After he was captured by the Nicaraguan government, he stated at a press conference that he had previously dropped supplies to CIA agents in South-east Asia, and that flights into Nicaragua were directly supervised by the CIA. His statement also included his recruitment by a friend in the CIA, an operation based in Ilopango airbase in El Salvador, supported by U.S. army colonel James Steele. The CIA and the U.S. government of Ronald Reagan denied any connection with the flight, though they said they supported any civilian effort to support the Contras. U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz stated that the plane had been paid for by private operators, and that none of the men on it had any connection to the U.S. government. Hasenfus later repudiated his statement, saying that he was unaware if his fellow workers were employed by the CIA, and that he had only heard rumors to that effect. The men in question, Max Gomez and Ramon Medina, were Cuban Americans. The CIA had at the time been legally forbidden from helping the Contras by the U.S. Congress. Gomez and Medina had been identified as people who had helped organize covert arms supplies to the Contras. Soon after his capture he said that the two men were friends of then-vice-President of the U.S. George H. W. Bush, but later retracted this statement as well, saying he was not sure. Hasenfus was charged with \\"terrorism, conspiracy and disturbing public security\\". Hasenfus stated that he was sure, however, that the operation to supply the Contras with weapons, named Enterprise, was ultimately supervised by the U.S. government. The capture of Hasenfus provided direct evidence of a link between the Contras, and the U.S. government and the Reagan White house; documents found on the dead men linked them to Oliver North. Sentencing and controversy Hasenfus was tried in Nicaragua, and on November 15, 1986, sentenced to 30 years in prison for terrorism and other charges. His wife Sally made a plea to Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega for clemency. Nicaraguan defense minister Humberto Ortega stated later that the sentence was not directed at Hasenfus himself, but toward the \\"irrational, unjust policy\\" of the U.S. government. On December 17, 1986, Hasenfus was pardoned and released by the Nicaraguan government, at the request of U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd. Hasenfus subsequently unsuccessfully sued US Air Force officer Richard Secord (involved with organizing weapons shipments to the Contras), Albert Hakim, Southern Air Transport and Corporate Air Services over issues relating to his capture and trial. The controversy over the flight led U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill to launch an investigation into the flight. The U.S. press generally believed that there was more to the story of Hasenfus than the Reagan administration had admitted; according to scholar Scott Armstrong, this had the effect of making them more skeptical of the U.S. government's initial denial of the weapons-for-hostages deal during the Iran-Contra affair.

Sizeable groups of Turkmens are found also in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and the North Caucasus (Stavropol Krai). They speak the Turkmen language, which is classified as a part of the Eastern Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages. Examples of other Oghuz languages are Turkish, Azerbaijani, Qashqai, Gagauz, Khorasani, and Salar. In the early Middle ages, Turkmens called themselves Oghuz, and in the Middle Ages they took the ethnonym - Turkmen. In Byzantine, then in the European sources, and later in the American tradition, Turkmens were called Turkomans,D. Yeremeyev. Ethnogenesis of the Turks. M.

Seljuks, Khwarazmians, Qara Qoyunlu, Aq Qoyunlu, Ottomans and Afsharids are also believed to descend from the Turkmen tribes of Qiniq, Begdili, Yiva, Bayandur, Kayi and Afshar respectively. Etymology Turkmen helmet (15th century) The term Turkmen is generally applied to the Turkic tribes that have been distributed across the Near and Middle East, as well as Central Asia, from the 11th century to modern times.Barbara Kellner-Heinkele, \\"Türkmen\\", The Encyclopaedia of Islam, eds. P.J. Bearman, T.H. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. Van Donzel and W. P. Heinrichs, vol. X (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 2000), pp. 682-685 Originally, all Turkic tribes who belonged to the Turkic dynastic mythological system and/or converted to Islam (e.g. Karluks, Oghuz Turks, Khalajes, Kanglys, Kipchaks, etc.) were designated \\"Turkmens\\". Only later did this word come to refer to a specific ethnonym. The current majority view for the etymology of the name is that it comes from Türk and the Turkic emphasizing suffix -men, meaning \\"'most Turkish of the Turks' or 'pure-blooded Turks.'\\", , . A folk etymology, dating back to the Middle Ages and found in al-Biruni and Mahmud al-Kashgari, instead derives the suffix -men from the Persian suffix -mānind, with the resulting word meaning \\"like a Turk\\". While formerly the dominant etymology in modern scholarship, this mixed Turkic-Persian derivation is now viewed as incorrect.,,. Today the terms are usually restricted to two Turkic groups: the Turkmen people of Turkmenistan and adjacent parts of Central Asia, and the Turkomans of Iraq and Syria.

The modern Turkmen people descend from the Oghuz Turks of Transoxiana, the western portion of Turkestan, a region that largely corresponds to much of Central Asia as far east as Xinjiang. Famous historian and ruler of Khorezm of the XVII century Abu al- Ghazi Bahadur links the origin of all Turkmens to 24 Oghuz tribes in his literary work \\"Genealogy of the Turkmens\\". In the 7th century AD, Oghuz tribes had moved westward from the Altay mountains through the Siberian steppes, and settled in this region. They also penetrated as far west as the Volga basin and the Balkans. These early Turkmens are believed to have mixed with native Sogdian peoples and lived as pastoral nomads until being conquered by the Russians in the 19th century. Migration of the Turkmen tribes from the territory of Turkmenistan and the rest of Central Asia in the south-west direction began mainly from the 11th century and continued until the 18th century. These Turkmen tribes played a significant role in the ethnic formation of such peoples as Turks, Turkmens of Iraq and Syria, as well as the Turkic population of Iran and Azerbaijan. To preserve their independence, those tribes that remained in Turkmenistan were united in military alliances, although remnants of tribal relations remained until the 20th century. Their traditional occupations were farming, cattle breeding, and various crafts. Ancient samples of applied art (primarily carpets and jewelry) indicate a high level of folk art culture. Genetics Turkmens in traditional clothes Haplogroup Q-M242 is commonly found in Siberia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia. This haplogroup forms a large percentage of the paternal lineages of Turkmens. Grugni et al. (2012) found Q-M242 in 42.6% (29/68) of a sample of Turkmens from Golestan, Iran. Di Cristofaro et al. (2013) found Q-M25 in 31.1% (23/74) and Q-M346 in 2.7% (2/74) for a total of 33.8% (25/74) Q-M242 in a sample of Turkmens from Jawzjan. Karafet et al. (2018) found Q-M25 in 50.0% (22/44) of another sample of Turkmens from Turkmenistan.Tatiana M. Karafet, Ludmila P. Osipova, Olga V. Savina, et al. (2018), \\"Siberian genetic diversity reveals complex origins of the Samoyedic-speaking populations.\\" Am J Hum Biol. 2018;e23194. https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23194. DOI: 10.1002/ajhb.23194. Haplogroup Q have seen its highest frequencies in the Turkmens from Karakalpakstan (mainly Yomut) at 73%. A genetic study on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups of a Turkmen sample describes a mixture of mostly West Eurasian lineages and minority of East Eurasian lineages. Turkmens also have two unusual mtDNA markers with polymorphic characteristics, only found in Turkmens and southern Siberians. History Turkmens belong to the Oghuz tribes, who originated on the periphery of Central Asia and founded gigantic empires beginning from the 3rd millennium BC. Subsequently, Turkmen tribes founded lasting dynasties in Central Asia, Middle East, Persia and Anatolia that had a profound influence on the course of history of those regions.Stefano Carboni, Jean-François de Lapérouse, Historical overview - \\"Turkmen Jewelry: Silver Ornaments from the Marshall and Marilyn R. Wolf Collection\\", published by Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2011 The most prominent of those dynasties were the Ghaznavids, Seljuks, Ottomans, Safavids, Afsharids and Qajars. Representatives of the Turkmen tribes of Ive and Bayandur were also the founders of the short-lived, but formidable states of Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu Turkmens respectively.Safa, Z. (1986). PERSIAN LITERATURE IN THE TIMURID AND TÜRKMEN PERIODS (782–907/1380–1501). In P. Jackson & L. Lockhart (Eds.), The Cambridge History of Iran (The Cambridge History of Iran, pp. 913-928). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.« The Timurid and Turkmen Dynasties of Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia », in : David J. Roxburgh, ed., The Turks: A Journey of Thousand Years, 600-1600. London, Royal Academy of Arts, 2005, pp. 192-200 Turkmens that stayed in Central Asia largely survived unaffected by the Mongol period due to their semi-nomadic lifestyle and became traders along the Caspian, which led to contacts with Eastern Europe. Following the decline of the Mongols, Tamerlane conquered the area and his Timurid Empire would rule, until it too fractured, as the Safavids, Khanate of Bukhara, and Khanate of Khiva all contested the area. The expanding Russian Empire took notice of Turkmenistan's extensive cotton industry, during the reign of Peter the Great, and invaded the area. Following the decisive Battle of Geok Tepe in January 1881, the bulk of Turkmen tribes found themselves under the rule of the Russian Emperor, which was formalized in the Akhal Treaty between Russia and Persia. After the Russian Revolution, Soviet control was established by 1921, and in 1924 Turkmenistan became the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic. Turkmenistan gained independence in 1991. Culture and society Religion Mary The Turkmen of Turkmenistan, like their kin in Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, are predominantly Muslims. According to the CIA World Factbook, Turkmenistan is 89% Muslim and 10% Eastern Orthodox. Most ethnic Russians and Armenians are Orthodox Christians. The remaining 1% is unknown. A 2009 Pew Research Center report indicates a higher percentage of Muslims with 93.1% of Turkmenistan's population adhering to Islam. The great majority of Turkmen readily identify themselves as Muslims and acknowledge Islam as an integral part of their cultural heritage. However, there are some who support a revival of the religion's status merely as an element of national identity. Language Turkmen (Latin: Türkmençe, Cyrillic: Түркменче) is the language of the nation of Turkmenistan. It is spoken by over 5,200,000 people in Turkmenistan, and by roughly 3,000,000 people in other countries, including Iran, Afghanistan, and Russia. Up to 30% of native speakers in Turkmenistan also claim a good knowledge of Russian, a legacy of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. The Turkmen language is closely related to Azerbaijani, Turkish, Gagauz, Qashqai and Crimean Tatar, sharing common linguistic features with each of those languages. There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these languages. \\"Language Materials Project: Turkish\\". UCLA International Institute, Center for World Languages. February 2007 A handful of specific lexical and grammatical differences formed within the Turkmen language as spoken in Turkmenistan, Iran and Afghanistan, after more than a century of separation between the people speaking the language; mutually intelligibility, however, has been preserved. Turkmen is not a literary language in Iran and Afghanistan, where many Turkmen tend towards bilingualism, usually conversant in the countries' different dialects of Persian, such as Dari and Tajik in Afghanistan. Variations of the Persian alphabet are, however, used in Iran. Literature Magtymguly Pyragy on Soviet rouble, 1991 Turkmen literature comprises oral compositions and written texts in old Oghuz Turkic and Turkmen languages. Turkmens have joint claims to a great number of literary works written in Old Oghuz Turkic and Persian (by Seljuks in 11-12th centuries) languages with other people of the Oghuz Turkic origin, mainly of Azerbaijan and Turkey. This works include, but are not limited to the Book of Dede Korkut, Gorogly and others. The medieval Turkmen literature was heavily influenced by Arabic and Persian, and used mostly Arabic alphabet. There is general consensus, however, that distinctively Turkmen literature originated in 18th century with the poetry of Magtymguly Pyragy, who is considered the father of the Turkmen literature. Other prominent Turkmen poets of that era are Döwletmämmet Azady (Magtymguly's father), Nurmuhammet Andalyp, Abdylla Şabende, Şeýdaýy, Mahmyt Gaýyby and Gurbanaly Magrupy. In the 20th century, Turkmenistan's most prominent Turkmen- language writer was Berdi Kerbabayev, whose novel Decisive Step, later made into a motion picture directed by Alty Garlyyev, is considered the apotheosis of modern Turkmen fiction. It earned him the USSR State Prize for Literature in 1948.  Music  Turkmen bakshy The musical art of the Turkmens is an integral part of the musical art of the Turkic peoples. The music of the Turkmen people is closely related to the Kyrgyz and Kazakh folk forms. Important musical traditions include traveling singers called bakshy, who sing with instruments such as the two-stringed lute called dutar. Other important musical instruments are gopuz, tüydük, dombura, and gyjak. The most famous Turkmen bakshys are those who lived in the 19th century: Amangeldi Gönübek, Gulgeldi ussa, Garadali Gokleng, Yegen Oraz bakshy, Hajygolak, Nobatnyyaz bakshy, Oglan bakshy, Durdy bakshy, Shukur bakshy, Chowdur bakshy and others. Usually they narrated the woeful and gloomy events of the Turkmen history through their music. The names and music of these bakshys have become legendary among the Turkmen people, and passed orally from generation to generation. The Central Asian classical music tradition muqam is also present in Turkmenistan. Cuisine tamdyr Characteristics of traditional Turkmen cuisine are rooted in the largely nomadic nature of day-to-day life prior to the Soviet period coupled with a long local tradition, dating back millennia before the arrival of the Turkmen in the region, of white wheat production. Baked goods, especially flat bread () typically baked in a tandoor, make up a large proportion of the daily diet, along with cracked wheat porridge (), wheat puffs (), and dumplings (). Since sheep-, goat-, and camel husbandry are traditional mainstays of nomadic Turkmen, mutton, goat meat, and camel meat were most commonly eaten, variously ground and stuffed in dumplings, boiled in soup, or grilled on spits in chunks () or as fingers of ground, spiced meat (). Rice for plov was reserved for festive occasions. Due to lack of refrigeration in nomad camps, dairy products from sheep-, goat-, and camel milk were fermented to keep them from spoiling quickly. Fish consumption was largely limited to tribes inhabiting the Caspian Sea shoreline. Fruits and vegetables were scarce, and in nomad camps limited mainly to carrots, squash, pumpkin, and onions. Inhabitants of oases enjoyed more varied diets, with access to pomegranate, fig, and stone fruit orchards; vineyards; and of course melons. Areas with cotton production could use cottonseed oil and sheep herders used fat from the fat-tailed sheep. The major traditional imported product was tea. The Royal Geographic Society reported in 1882, : The food of the Tekkes [sic] consists of well-prepared pillaus and of game; also of fermented camels' milk, melons, and water-melons. They use their fingers in conveying food to their mouths, but guests are provided with spoons. In sharp contrast to other Central Asian and Turkic ethnic groups, Turkmen do not eat horse meat, and in fact eating of horse meat is prohibited by law in Turkmenistan. Conquest by the Russian Empire in the 1880s introduced new foods, including such meats as beef, pork, and chicken, as well as potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage, and cucumbers, though they did not find widespread use in most Turkmen households until the Soviet period. While now consumed widely, they are, strictly speaking, not considered \\"traditional\\". Nomadic heritage Turkmens in Merv in 1890 Prokudin-Gorsky between 1905 and 1915.|left Before the establishment of Soviet power in Central Asia, it was difficult to identify distinct ethnic groups in the region. Sub-ethnic and supra-ethnic loyalties were more important to people than ethnicity. When asked to identify themselves, most Central Asians would name their kin group, neighborhood, village, religion or the state in which they lived; the idea that a state should exist to serve an ethnic group was unknown. That said, most Turkmen could identify the tribe to which they belonged, though they might not identify themselves as Turkmen. Most Turkmen were nomads until the 19th century when they began to settle the area south of the Amu Darya. Many Turkmen became semi-nomadic, herding sheep and camels during spring, summer, and fall, but planting crops, wintering in oasis camps, and harvesting the crops in the summer and autumn. As a rule they did not settle in cities and towns until the advent of the Soviet government. This mobile lifestyle precluded identification with anyone outside one's kin group and led to frequent conflicts between different Turkmen tribes, particularly regarding access to water. In collaboration with the local nationalists, the Soviet government sought to transform the Turkmen and other similar ethnic groups in the USSR into modern socialist nations that based their identity on a fixed territory and a common language. Prior to the Battle of Geok Tepe in January 1881 and subsequent conquest of Merv in 1884, the Turkmen \\"retained the condition of predatory, horse-riding nomads, who were greatly feared by their neighbours as 'man-stealing Turks.' Until subjugated by the Russians, the Turkmens were a warlike people, who conquered their neighbours and regularly captured ethnic Persians for sale as slaves in Khiva. It was their boast that not one Persian had crossed their frontier except with a rope round his neck.\\" The Soviet-led standardization of the Turkmen language, education, and projects to promote ethnic Turkmen in industry, government and higher education led growing numbers of Turkmen to identify with a larger national Turkmen culture rather than with sub-national, pre-modern forms of identity. After gaining independence from the Soviet Union, Turkmen historians went to great lengths to prove that the Turkmen had inhabited their current territory since time immemorial; some historians even tried to deny the nomadic heritage of the Turkmen. Turkmen lifestyle was heavily invested in horsemanship and as a prominent horse culture, Turkmen horse-breeding was an ages old tradition. Before the Soviet era, a proverb stated that the Turkmen's home was where his horse happened to stand. In spite of changes prompted during the Soviet period, the Ahal Teke tribe in southern Turkmenistan has remained very well known for its horses, the Akhal-Teke desert horse – and the horse breeding tradition has returned to its previous prominence in recent years. Many tribal customs still survive among modern Turkmen. Unique to Turkmen culture is kalim which is a groom's \\"dowry\\", that can be quite expensive and often results in the widely practiced tradition of bridal kidnapping. In something of a modern parallel, in 2001, President Saparmurat Niyazov had introduced a state enforced \\"kalim\\", which required all foreigners who wanted to marry a Turkmen woman to pay a sum of no less than $50,000. The law was repealed in March 2005. Other customs include the consultation of tribal elders, whose advice is often eagerly sought and respected. Many Turkmen still live in extended families where various generations can be found under the same roof, especially in rural areas. The music of the nomadic and rural Turkmen people reflects rich oral traditions, where epics such as Koroglu are usually sung by itinerant bards. These itinerant singers are called bakshy and sing either a cappella or with instruments such as the dutar, a two-stringed lute. Society today Since Turkmenistan's independence in 1991, a cultural revival has taken place with the return of a moderate form of Islam and celebration of Novruz, the Persian New Year marking the onset of spring. Turkmen can be divided into various social classes including the urban intelligentsia and workers whose role in society is different from that of the rural peasantry. Secularism and atheism remain prominent for many Turkmen intellectuals who favor moderate social changes and often view extreme religiosity and cultural revival with some measure of distrust. The five traditional carpet rosettes, called göl in Turkmen, that form motifs in the country's state emblem and flag represent the five major Turkmen tribes. Sport Serdar Hudayberdiyew, at 2014 Asian Games opening ceremony Sardar Azmoun, football player of Turkmen origin, who plays for the Russian club Zenith and Iranian national team. Sports have historically been an important part of Turkmen life. Such sports as horseback riding and Goresh have been praised in Turkmen literature. During the Soviet era, Turkmen athletes competed in numerous competitions, including Olympic games as part of the Soviet Union team and, in 1992, as part of the Unified Team. After Turkmenistan gained her independence, new ways of establishing physical and sports movements in the country began to emerge. To implement a new sports policy, new multi-purpose stadiums, physical education and health complexes, sports schools and facilities were built in all regions of the country. Turkmenistan also has a modern Olympic village which hosted 2017 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games, and is unparalleled in Central Asia. Turkmenistan supports the country's sports movements and encourages sports on a state level. While football remains the most popular sport, such sports as Turkmen goresh, horseback riding and lately ice hockey are also very popular among Turkmens. Turkmens in Iran Iranian Turkmen in Bandar Torkman A Turkmen girl and baby from Afghanistan A Turkmen man from Turkmenistan Turkmens in Iran Iranian Turkmens are a branch of Turkmen people who live mainly in northern and northeastern regions of Iran. Their region is called Turkmen Sahra and includes substantial parts of Golestan province. Representatives of such contemporary Turkmen tribes as Yomut, Goklen, Īgdīr, Saryk, Salar and Teke have lived in Iran since the 16th century,Logashova B.R.

Suny; Michigan, 1996. pp. 45-67 Turkmens in Afghanistan The Afghan Turkmen population in the 1990s was estimated at around 200,000. The original Turkmen groups came from east of the Caspian Sea into northwestern Afghanistan at various periods, particularly after the end of the 19th century when the Russians moved into their territory. They established settlements from Balkh Province to Herat Province, where they are now concentrated; smaller groups settled in Kunduz Province. Others came in considerable numbers as a result of the failure of the Basmachi revolts against the Bolsheviks in the 1920s. Turkmen tribes, of which there are twelve major groups in Afghanistan, base their structure on genealogies traced through the male line. Senior members wield considerable authority. Formerly a nomadic and warlike people feared for their lightning raids on caravans, Turkmen in Afghanistan are farmer-herdsmen and important contributors to the economy. They brought karakul sheep to Afghanistan and are also renowned makers of carpets, which, with karakul pelts, are major hard currency export commodities. Turkmen jewelry is also highly prized. Turkmens of Stavropol krai' of Russia In the Stavropol Krai of southern Russia, there is a long established colony of Turkmen. They are often referred to as Trukhmen by the local ethnic Russian population, and sometimes use the self-designation Turkpen.The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire. Eki.ee. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. According to the 2010 Census of Russia, they numbered 15,048, and accounted for 0.5% of the total population of Stavropol Krai. The Turkmens are said to have migrated into the Caucasus in the 17th century, in particular in the Mangyshlak region. These migrants belonged mainly to the Chowdur (Russian variants Chaudorov, Chavodur), Sonchadj and Ikdir tribes. The early settlers were nomadic but over time became sedentary. In their cultural life the Trukhmens of today differ very little from their neighbours and are now settled farmers and stockbreeders. Although the Turkmen language belongs to the Oghuz group of Turkic languages, in Stavropol it has been strongly influenced by the Nogai language, which belongs to the Kipchak group. The phonetic system, grammatical structure and to some extent also the vocabulary have been somewhat influenced. Demographics and population distribution CIA map showing the territory of the settlement of ethnic groups and subgroups in Afghanistan (2005) In 1911, the population of Turkmens in the Russian Empire was estimated to be 290,170, and it was \\"conjectured that their total number [in all countries] does not exceed 350,000\\". Today the Turkmen people of Central Asia and near neighbors live in: * Turkmenistan, where some 85% of the population of 5,042,920 people (July 2006 est.) are ethnic Turkmen. In addition, an estimated 1,200 Turkmen refugees from northern Afghanistan currently reside in Turkmenistan due to the ravages of the Soviet–Afghan War and factional fighting in Afghanistan which saw the rise and fall of the Taliban. * Afghanistan, where as of 2006, 200,000 ethnic Turkmen are concentrated primarily along the Turkmen-Afghan border in the provinces of Faryab, Jowzjan, Samangan and Baghlan. There are also communities in Balkh and Kunduz Provinces. * Iran, where about 719,000 Turkmen are primarily concentrated in the provinces of Golestān and North Khorasan. * Pakistan, to which somewhat fewer than 5,000 Turkmen fled from Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan War. Today a small population of Turkmen resides in Peshawar, where they are mainly involved in the carpet business.

Its population at the 2010 census was 2,275. Hampton Beach is in Rockingham County, about south of Portsmouth. The community is a popular tourist destination and the busiest beach community in New Hampshire. Ocean Boulevard, the main street along the beach, includes a boardwalk, many shops and businesses, several seasonal hotels, and the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom, which hosts national acts in the summer.Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom official site Hampton Beach State Park was named one of four \\"Superstar\\" beaches in the United States in 2011, for having had perfect water-quality testing results in each of the previous three years.  History  The Hampton Beach Village District was established on June 26, 1907, to provide electric power and water to the summer tourist community. In 1923, the village's first fire station was built, after two fires destroyed a large section of the beach settlement in 1919 and 1922. The original fire station was razed and replaced in 2014. On February 26, 2010, during a severe storm, a fire burned down all the buildings in a block at Hampton Beach, including the Surf Hotel, Happy Hampton Arcade, and Mrs. Mitchell's Gift Shop. The fire started in the Surf Hotel and was spread to the other buildings by high winds. The cause of this fire is unknown. The area has been rebuilt, with a larger hotel and a new Mrs. Mitchell's.  Geography  Most of the resort village lies on a barrier spit separated from the mainland by a large estuary system known as Hampton Harbor. The estuary serves as the mouth of several rivers, the largest being the Hampton River from the northwest. New Hampshire Route 1A serves as the main north-south route through the beach area, connecting the village to Seabrook Beach to the south (across the Hampton Bridge traversing the Hampton Harbor Inlet) and Rye Beach to the north. Access from the west is provided by three roads: New Hampshire Route 101 is the main access point to the densely populated southern resort area from most points west, while Winnacunnet Road (officially New Hampshire Route 101E) provides access to the less developed areas at the center of the village near a large salt marsh conservation area. Winnacunnet Road marks the northern edge of the census- designated place, but New Hampshire Route 27, known locally as High Street, marks the northern edge of the resort area. The heaviest development lies south of the Ashworth-By-The-Sea hotel, located at the eastern terminus of NH 101 where it meets NH 1A, known locally as Ocean Boulevard. From this point south, NH 1A splits into two one-way streets: the southbound Ashworth Avenue, and the northbound Ocean Boulevard. Cross streets through this area run from A Street in the north to M Street in the south. The southern end of the spit is mostly state park, with little to no buildings or development. North of the junction of 101 and 1A, the area is much less developed, dominated mostly by a large salt marsh conservation area, with small businesses and bungalows along Ocean Boulevard (NH 1A). North of Winnacunnet Road (and outside the CDP), a second area of heavier development begins with Kings Highway parallel to Ocean Boulevard, and cross streets numbered from 1st Street in the south to 19th Street in the north. The resort ends at the Windjammer Hotel at its northern end, at the junction of NH 27 and NH 1A. The census-designated place (CDP) portion of Hampton Beach extends from the Seabrook town line in the south to Winnacunnet Road in the north. The western border, separating it from the Hampton CDP, follows Tide Mill Creek within the Hampton Saltmarsh, and the eastern border is the Atlantic Ocean shoreline. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Hampton Beach CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 7.23%, are water. Demographics Ocean Boulevard in Hampton Beach, March 2019 As of the census of 2010, there were 2,275 people, 1,227 households, and 555 families residing in the CDP. There were 3,158 housing units, of which 1,931, or 61.1%, were vacant on Census Day. 1,443 of the vacant units were seasonal or vacation rental units. The racial makeup of the CDP was 95.8% white, 0.4% African American, 0.3% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.8% some other race, and 1.9% from two or more races. 1.6% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. Of the 1,227 households in the CDP, 14.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.6% were headed by married couples living together, 9.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 54.8% were non-families. 45.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.83, and the average family size was 2.49. 12.0% of residents in the CDP were under the age of 18, 6.6% were from age 18 to 24, 23.6% were from 25 to 44, 41.7% were from 45 to 64, and 16.0% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 49.3 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.0 males. For the period 2011-15, the estimated median annual income for a household was $53,095, and the median income for a family was $78,929. Male full-time workers had a median income of $56,875 versus $70,461 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $48,728. 14.8% of the population and 12.7% of families were below the poverty line, along with 44.7% of people under the age of 18 and 0.0% of people 65 or older.  Attractions and events  The New Hampshire Marine Memorial is located on the beach along Route 1A at the terminus of New Hampshire Route 101. The Hampton Bridge carries Route 1A into the south border of the community. The Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom has been the center attraction at Hampton Beach for more than 100 years. The Ballroom continues to draw some of the top names in entertainment. Recently, the Ballroom placed in the top 30 for worldwide ticket sales in venues under 3,000 seats.Casino Ballroom history Hampton Beach Seafood Festival - Since 1988, the Hampton Area Chamber of Commerce and Seafood Festival Committee have helped put New Hampshire on the map as a vacation destination. The Hampton Beach Seafood Festival has a profound effect on seacoast businesses, the community, and the overall economy of the area. Restaurants, lodging, shops, and businesses in general depend on the Seafood Festival as the primary contributor to their bottom line. Many Chamber members say it is even bigger than the \\"4th of July\\" in sales volume. The Festival, held the weekend after Labor Day, is also instrumental in extending the summer season. Dozens of non-profit organizations also earn a major portion of their income through revenues earned at the Festival, allowing them to continue to support their causes that benefit the citizens of New Hampshire. The Hampton Beach Seafood Festival has evolved dramatically, and has been acclaimed as \\"One of the Top 100 Events in North America\\", by the American Bus Association in 1996, 2001, 2003 and 2006. Event attendance is now estimated as exceeding 150,000.Hampton Area Chamber of Commerce official site Hampton Beach Sand Sculpture Competition - Since 2001, the Hampton Area Chamber of Commerce has sponsored, with the help of Seaside Hotel, a sand sculpture competition that has brought numerous sculptors from across America to Hampton Beach in mid- June. The 4 day contest is seen by thousands and then put up for illumination for two weeks. Prizes (top prize of $50,000) are rewarded via fan voting and through the Chamber. There are fireworks on the 4th of July and every Wednesday of the summer at 9:30 pm. There are also fireworks held to cap the Hampton Beach Seafood Festival in September, with a launch scheduled for that Saturday at 8:15 pm.Hampton Beach Village District official site  References   External links  * Hampton Beach Village District * Hampton Beach State Park Category:Census-designated places in Rockingham County, New Hampshire Category:Census-designated places in New Hampshire Category:Seaside resorts in the United States Category:Populated coastal places in New Hampshire Category:Hampton, New Hampshire Category:Beaches of New Hampshire ","title":"Hampton Beach, New Hampshire"},{"id":"1100939","text":"Leopold V (1157 – 31 December 1194), known as the Virtuous (), a member of the House of Babenberg, was Duke of Austria from 1177 and Duke of Styria from 1192 until his death. Biography Leopold was the son of the Austrian duke Henry II Jasomirgott from his second marriage with the Byzantine princess Theodora, a daughter of Andronikos Komnenos, the second eldest son of Emperor John II Komnenos.Lingelbach 1913, pp. 91–92. Just before his birth, his father had achieved the elevation of the Austrian margraviate to a duchy according to the 1156 Privilegium Minus, issued by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. As the eldest son of Henry II, Leopold was already enfeoffed with the Austrian duchy by the emperor in the summer of 1174 at Regensburg. He succeeded his father as Duke of Austria upon his death on 13 January 1177. Soon after, Leopold lent his support to Duke Frederick of Bohemia stuck in a conflict with his Přemyslid cousin Soběslav II, who had campaigned in the Austrian duchy. In turn, Leopold reached a peace agreement with the neighbouring Duchy of Bohemia, determined by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa at Eger in 1179. Two years later, he attended an Imperial Diet in Erfurt, where his first-born son Frederick was enfeoffed with the Austrian estate. In 1182 Leopold went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and was received with honour at the courts of King Béla III of Hungary and of Emperor Alexios II Komnenos in Constantinople. Back in Germany, he began negotiating the Georgenberg Pact with the last Otakar duke Ottokar IV of Styria, who had received the ducal title from Emperor Frederick in 1180. The agreement was concluded on 17 August 1186, whereafter Styria and the central part of Upper Austria with Wels and Steyr were amalgamated into the Duchy of Austria upon Ottokar's death in 1192. The next year Leopold was enfeoffed with Styria by the emperor; this was the first step towards the creation of modern Austria. Leopold is mainly remembered outside Austria for his participation in the Third Crusade. Border disputes with King Béla III of Hungary had initially impeded the duke from accompanying Emperor Frederick on his departure in May 1189. When he heard about the emperor's death in 1190, he went to Venice, where he embarked to the Holy Land. Autumn storms forced him to winter in Zadar on the Adriatic coast. He arrived in Palestine to take part in the final stage of the Siege of Acre in spring 1191. Leopold assumed command of the remnants of the Imperial forces after the death of the emperor's son Duke Frederick of Swabia in January. According to legend, his tunic was blood- soaked after the fights. When he doffed his belt, a white stripe appeared. The new emperor Henry VI granted him the privilege to adopt these colours as his new banner, that later would become the flag of Austria. Acre surrendered on July 12, after the arrival of King Philip II of France and King Richard I of England. Duke Leopold, as commander of the German contingent, demanded rights equal to those of the two kings but was rejected. When the banners of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, England, France and Leopold's ducal flag were raised in the city by Leopold's cousin, Marquis Conrad of Montferrat, Richard removed Leopold's colours (see Siege of Acre) and the duke wrathfully left for his Austrian home, where he arrived by the end of 1191. In January 1192 he proceeded to the court of Emperor Henry VI and complained bitterly about Richard, who also was suspected of involvement in the murder of Conrad, shortly after his election as King of Jerusalem in April. The emperor probably agreed with King Philip, already in conflict with the English king, on Richard's capture. When Richard left the Holy Land in late October 1192, he found the French ports closed and sailed up the Adriatic Sea. He took the country road from Aquileia across Austria, to reach the Bavarian estates of his Welf brother-in-law Henry the Lion. Whilst travelling under disguise, he stopped at Vienna shortly before Christmas 1192, where he was recognized (supposedly because of his signet ring) and arrested in Erdberg (modern Landstraße district). Initially Duke Leopold had the king imprisoned in Dürnstein, and in March 1193 Richard was brought before Emperor Henry VI at Trifels Castle, accused of Conrad's murder. A ransom of 35,000 kilograms of silver was paid to release King Richard. Leopold demanded that Richard's niece, Eleanor, marry his son Frederick. Due to Leopold's death, this marriage never took place. Leopold's share of the ransom became the foundation for the mint in Vienna, and was used to build new city walls for Vienna, as well as to found the towns of Wiener Neustadt and Friedberg in Styria. The duke was excommunicated by Pope Celestine III for having taken a fellow crusader prisoner. To receive absolution, Leopold prepared for another crusade, but this plan failed. In 1194, his foot was crushed when his horse fell on him at a tournament in Graz. Though advised by his surgeons to have the foot amputated, no one admitted to being able to do it. He ordered his servants to chop his foot off with an axe, which they succeeded in doing after three swings.Stubbs 1871, pp. 276-78. He succumbed to gangrene. As a result of deathbed promises to make restitution given to the hastily-summoned Archbishop Adalbert of Salzburg, he was reconciled and received a Christian burial at Heiligenkreuz Abbey. Marriage and children At Pentecost 1174, Leopold married Helena (1158–1199), a daughter of late King Géza II of Hungary. By her, Leopold had at least two children: * Frederick I ( – 1198),Fastlinger 1920, p. 112. who succeeded his father as Duke of Austria * Leopold VI (1176–1230), succeeded his father as Duke of Styria (inconsistent with the Georgenberg Pact) and became Duke of Austria upon his brother's death in 1198.

Description The most common khachkar feature is a cross surmounting a rosette or a solar disc. The remainder of the stone face is typically filled with elaborate patterns of leaves, grapes, pomegranates, and bands of interlace. Occasionally a khachkar is surmounted by a cornice sometimes containing biblical or saintly figures. Most early khachkars were erected for the salvation of the soul of either a living or a deceased person. Otherwise they were intended to commemorate a military victory, the construction of a church, or as a form of protection from natural disasters.\\"Armenian Khatchkars\\" (Editions Erebuni, 1978) The most common location for early khachkars was in a graveyard. However, Armenian gravestones take many other forms, and only a minority are khachkars. History The first true khachkars appeared in the 9th century, during the time of Armenian revival after liberation from Arab rule. The oldest khachkar with a known date was carved in 879 (though earlier, cruder, examples exist). Erected in Garni, it is dedicated to queen Katranide I, the wife of king Ashot I Bagratuni. The peak of the khachkar carving art was between the 12th and the 14th centuries. The art declined during the Mongol invasion at the end of the 14th century. It revived in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the artistic heights of the 14th century were never achieved again. Today, the tradition still remains, and one can still see khachkar carvers in some parts of Yerevan.Anatoli L. Yakobson. Armenian Khachkars, Moscow, 1986 About 40,000 khachkars survive today. Most of them are free standing, though those recording donations are usually built into monastery walls. The following three khachkars are believed to be the finest examples of the art form: *One in Geghard, carved in 1213, probably by master Timot and master Mkhitar *The Holy Redeemer khachkar in Haghpat (see gallery), carved in 1273 by master Vahram *A khachkar in Goshavank, carved in 1291 by master Poghos. A number of good examples have been transferred to the Historical Museum in Yerevan and beside the cathedral in Echmiadzin. The largest surviving collection of khachkars is in Armenia, at Noraduz cemetery on the western shore of the Lake Sevan, where an old graveyard with around 900 khachkars from various periods and of various styles can be seen. The largest number was formerly located at Julfa in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan, but the entire medieval cemetery was destroyed by Azeri soldiers in 2005. Present The art of carving khachkars has witnessed a rebirth as a symbol of Armenian culture in the 20th century. There are hundreds of khachkars worldwide, many of which are memorials to commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide. Khachkars have been placed in various locations, including at the Vatican Museums, Canterbury Cathedral's memorial garden, St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, Colorado State Capitol, Temple of Peace, Cardiff, Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, and elsewhere. According to one count, there are nearly 30 khachkars on public locations in France. Armenian khachkars have been acquired or donated to many museums or temporarily represented at significant exhibitions all around the world such as at the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Special Exhibition of the National Museum of Ethnology, Osaka, Japan.British Museum Collection Endangered khachkars A large portion of khachkars, which were created in historic Armenia and surrounding regions, in modern times have become the possession of Turkey, Azerbaijan, and partly Georgia and Iran. As a result of systematic eradication of khachkars in Turkey, today only a few examples survive. Unfortunately these few survivors are not cataloged and properly photographed. Thus, it is difficult to follow up with the current situation.Der Nersessian S. Armenian Art, Paris, 1978. One documented example took place in the Armenian Cemetery in Jugha. One source says that khachkars are being damaged, neglected, or moved in Armenia. Reasons cited for moving these khachkars include; decoration, to create new holy places, or to make space for new burials.

Most of these species became extinct during the latter half of the Pleistocene, and the roles of human and climatic factors in their extinction are contested. There are similarities between prehistoric Australian megafauna and some mythical creatures from the Aboriginal Dreamtime. Causes of extinction Many modern researchers, including Tim Flannery, think that with the arrival of early Aboriginal Australians (around 70,000~65,000 years ago), hunting and the use of fire to manage their environment may have contributed to the extinction of the megafauna. Increased aridity during peak glaciation (about 18,000 years ago) may have also contributed, but most of the megafauna were already extinct by this time. Others, including Steve Wroe, note that records in the Australian Pleistocene are rare, and there is not enough data to definitively determine the time of extinction of many of the species, with many of the species having no confirmed record within the last 100,000 years. They suggest that many of the extinctions had been staggered over the course of the late Middle Pleistocene and early Late Pleistocene, prior to human arrival, due to climatic stress. New evidence based on accurate optically stimulated luminescence and uranium-thorium dating of megafaunal remains suggests that humans were the ultimate cause of the extinction for some of the megafauna in Australia. The dates derived show that all forms of megafauna on the Australian mainland became extinct in the same rapid timeframe—approximately 46,000 years ago—the period when the earliest humans first arrived in Australia (around 70,000~65,000 years ago long chronology and 50,000 years ago short chronology). However, these results were subsequently disputed, with another study showing that 50 of 88 megafaunal species have no dates postdating the penultimate glacial maxiumum around 130,000 years ago, and there was only firm evidence for overlap of 8-14 megafaunal species with people. Analysis of oxygen and carbon isotopes from teeth of megafauna indicate the regional climates at the time of extinction were similar to arid regional climates of today and that the megafauna were well adapted to arid climates. The dates derived have been interpreted as suggesting that the main mechanism for extinction was human burning of a landscape that was then much less fire-adapted; oxygen and carbon isotopes of teeth indicate sudden, drastic, non-climate-related changes in vegetation and in the diet of surviving marsupial species. However, early Aboriginal peoples appear to have rapidly eliminated the megafauna of Tasmania about 41,000 years ago (following formation of a land bridge to Australia about 43,000 years ago as Ice Age sea levels declined) without using fire to modify the environment there, implying that at least in this case hunting was the most important factor. It has also been suggested that the vegetational changes that occurred on the mainland were a consequence, rather than a cause, of the elimination of the megafauna. This idea is supported by sediment cores from Lynch's Crater in Queensland, which suggest that fire increased in the local ecosystem about a century after the disappearance of Sporormiella (a fungus found in herbivorous animal dung used as a megafaunal proxy), leading to a subsequent transition to fire- tolerant sclerophyll vegetation. However, the use of Sporormiella as a megafaunal proxy has been criticised, noting that Sporormiella is found sporadically in the dung of various herbivorous species, including extant emus and kangaroos, not just megafauna, that its presence depends on a variety of factors, often unrelated to megafaunal abundance, and that in Cuddie Springs, a well known megafaunal site, the densities of Sporormiella were consistently low. A study of extinct megafauna at the Walker Creek site in Queensland, found that their disappearance from the site after 40 kya came after an extended period of environmental deterioration. Chemical analysis of fragments of eggshells of Genyornis newtoni, a flightless bird that became extinct in Australia, from over 200 sites, revealed scorch marks consistent with cooking in human-made fires, presumably the first direct evidence of human contribution to the extinction of a species of the Australian megafauna. This was later contested by another study that noted the too small dimensions (126 x 97 mm, roughly like the emu eggs, while the moa eggs were about 240 mm) for the Genyornis supposed eggs, and rather, attributed them to another extinct, but much smaller bird, the megapode Progura. The real time that saw Genyornis vanish is still an open question, but this was believed as one of the best documented megafauna extinction in Australia. \\"Imperceptive overkill\\"; a scenario where anthropogenic pressures take place; slowly and gradually wiping the megafauna out; has been suggested. On the other hand, there is also compelling evidence to suggest that (contrary to other conclusions) the megafauna lived alongside humans for several thousand years. The question of if (and how) the megafauna died before the arrival of humans is still debated; with some authors maintaining that only a minority of such fauna remained by the time the first humans settled on the mainland. One of the most important advocates of human role, Tim Flannery, author of the book Future Eaters, was also heavily criticised for his conclusions. A surprisingly late date of 33-37 kya is known for a Zygomaturus specimen from the Willandra Lakes Region in New South Wales, the latest known date for any Australian Megafauna. This is well after aboriginal arrival in Australia around 50 kya.  Living Australian megafauna  The term \\"megafauna\\" is usually applied to large animals (over ). In Australia, however, megafauna were never as large as those found on other continents, and so a more lenient criterion of over is often appliedDanielle Clode (2009) Prehistoric giants: the megafauna of Australia, Museum Victoria  Mammals  A red kangaroo * The red kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) grows up to tall and weighs up to 85 kg (187 lb).

Although a male typically weighs around 66 kg (145 lb) and stand almost tall, the scientific name Macropus giganteus (gigantic large-foot) is misleading, as the red kangaroo living in the semi-arid inland is larger. * The antilopine kangaroo (Osphranter antilopinus), sometimes called the antilopine wallaroo or the antilopine wallaby, is a species of macropod found in northern Australia at Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and the Kimberley region of Western Australia. can weigh as much as and grow over long. *Common wombats (Vombatus ursinus) can reach .

An saltwater crocodile was reportedly shot on the Norman River of Queensland in 1957; a cast was made of it and is on display as a popular tourist attraction.

Males can grow to long, while females reach a maximum size of . Males commonly weigh around 60 kg (88 lb), with large specimens up to 83 kg (120 lb) or more, against the female weight of 20 kg (44 lb).

It was an ambush predator living at waterholes located in natural sun traps and killed its prey by constriction. * Quinkana was a terrestrial crocodile that grew from to possibly in length. It had long legs positioned underneath its body, and chased down mammals, birds and other reptiles for food. Its teeth were blade-like for cutting rather than pointed for gripping, as with water- dwelling crocodiles. It belonged to the mekosuchine subfamily (all now extinct). It was discovered at the Bluff Downs in Queensland. * Liasis dubudingala, lived during the Pliocene epoch, grew up to long, and is the largest Australian snake known. It hunted mammals, birds and reptiles in riparian woodlands. It is most similar to the extant olive python (Liasis olivacea). *Meiolania was a genus of huge terrestrial cryptodire turtles measuring in length, with horned heads and spiked tails.  Extinct megafauna contemporaneous with Aboriginal Australians  Monsters and large animals in Dreamtime stories have been associated with extinct megafauna. The association was made at least as early as 1845, with colonists writing that Aboriginal people identified Diprotodon bones as belonging to bunyips, and Thomas Worsnop concluding that the fear of bunyip attacks at watering holes remembered a time when Diprotodon lived in marshes. In the early 1900s, John Walter Gregory outlined the Kadimakara (or Kuddimurka or Kadimerkera) story of the Diyari (similar stories being told by nearby peoples), which describes the deserts of Central Australia as having once been \\"fertile, well-watered plains\\" with giant gum trees, and almost solid cloud cover overhead. The trees created a roof of vegetation in which lived the strange monsters called Kadimakara—which sometimes came to the ground to eat. One time, the gum trees were destroyed, forcing the Kadimakara to remain on the ground, particularly Lake Eyre and Kalamurina, until they died. In times of drought and flood, the Diyari performed corroborees (including dances and blood sacrifices) at the bones of the Kadimakara to appease them and request that they intercede with the spirits of rain and clouds. Sites of Kadimakara bones identified by Aboriginal people corresponded with megafauna fossil sites, and an Aboriginal guide identified a Diprotodon jaw as belonging to the Kadimakara. Gregory speculated that the story could be a remnant from when the Diyari lived elsewhere, or when the geographical conditions of Central Australia were different. The latter possibility would indicate Aboriginal coexistence with megafauna, with Gregory saying: After examining fossils, Gregory concluded that the story was a combination of the two factors, but that the environment of Lake Eyre had probably not changed much since Aboriginal habitation. He concluded that while some references to Kadimakara were probably memories of the crocodiles once found in Lake Eyre, others that describe a \\"big, heavy land animal, with a single horn on its forehead\\" were probably references to Diprotodon. Geologist Michael Welland describes from across Australia Dreamtime \\"tales of giant creatures that roamed the lush landscape until aridity came and they finally perished in the desiccated marshes of Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre\\", giving as examples the Kadimakara of Lake Eye, as well as continent-wide stories of the Rainbow Serpent, which he says corresponds with Wonambi naracoortensis. Journalist Peter Hancock speculates in The Crococile That Wasn't that a Dreamtime story from the Perth area could be a memory of Varanus priscus. Rock art in the Kimberley region appears to depict a marsupial lion and a marsupial tapir, as does Arnhem land art. Arnhem art also appears to depict Genyornis, a bird that is believed to have gone extinct 40,000 years ago. An Early Triassic archosauromorph found in Queensland, Kadimakara australiensis, is named after the Kadimakara.  See also   References  * Long, J.A., Archer, M. Flannery, T.F. & Hand, S. (2003).

He obtained Mexican nationality in 2007. Biography Vallejo was born and raised in Medellín, though he left his hometown early in life. He started studies in Philosophy at the National University of Colombia in Bogotá, but after one year he abandoned the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. Soon after he began new studies on biology at the Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá, which he finished. Then he spent one year in Italy at the film academy Cinecittà, where he obtained basic notions on cinema. Vallejo then returned to Colombia with the project of filmmaking. Yet after difficulties with the Colombian Government in producing and, after he produced it, in presenting his first film (it was censored), he decided to leave his country. In Mexico he produced and distributed three films about the violence in Colombia. He also wrote an award-winning children's theater script, \\"El reino misterioso o Tomás y las abejas.\\" He has been living in Mexico since 1971, where he not only produced his cinematographic pieces, but also the whole of his literary work. Despite time spent in other locales, mainly Europe and the United States, most of his novels take place in Colombia. Some of his themes are grammar, biology, philosophy, physics, violence, pederasty, adolescence, drugs, death and politics, mostly related to places such as Antioquia and Medellín; yet his main theme is his life. His books are written in first person, in an autobiographical style, although he manipulates the conventions of autobiography such that the line between autobiography and fiction becomes significantly blurred.See O’Bryen, Rory Literature, Testimony and Cinema in Contemporary Colombian Culture: Spectres of La Violencia (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2008), pp. 43-76 His best- known novel, La virgen de los sicarios, has been translated into English as Our Lady of the Assassins. It deals with his fictionalized return to Medellín, and his relationships with two teenagers caught in the local cycle of violence. The autobiographical/fiction La virgen de los sicarios was made into a full feature film in 2000 and released in the United States as Our Lady of the Assassins. In 2003, Colombian filmmaker Luis Ospina made a feature-length documentary about him: \\"La desazón suprema: retrato incesante de Fernando Vallejo (\\"The Supreme Uneasiness: Incessant Portrait of Fernando Vallejo\\"). In April 2007, Vallejo obtained Mexican citizenship and published a letter in which he publicly renounced his Colombian nationality. The letter presents the reasons for his decision by mentioning several incidents during his career, among them the recent reelection of President Álvaro Uribe, that eventually led him to this decision. Vallejo is openly gay and lives with his partner, scenographist David Antón. He is known as an animal rights defender and vegan, and because of his antinatalist views, he has no children. He is an atheist and fiercely critical of religion. Selected works * \\"El reino misterioso o Tomás y las abejas\\" - [The Mysterious Kingdom, or, Thomas and the Bees] (1975).

The lake, which is 462 metres deep, is located in a mountain valley in Fiordland National Park.  Name  \\"Hauroko\\" translates from te reo Māori as \\"soughing of the wind\\" or \\"sounding wind\\". Prior to 1930, the lake was also called \\"Lake Hauroto\\".  Geography  Lake Hauroko is deep; sources range from calling it the 16th deepest lake in the world to the 23rd deepest. The S-shaped lake is long and has a surface area of . The lake surface is about above sea level. Location One of the country's southernmost lakes, it is only 13 km from the southern coast of the South Island. It sits between the similarly-sized lakes Monowai and Poteriteri. According to the 1925 New Zealand Official Yearbook, it drains about /sec via the -long Wairaurahiri River into Foveaux Strait 10 kilometres to the west of Te Waewae Bay. The largest island in Lake Hauroko is Mary Island, named in 1883 after the wife of the government surveyor John Hay. A smaller island is adjacent to Teal Bay at the southern end of the lake. There are also a few other smaller islets and rocks in the lake.  Geology  Traditionally, Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu say the lake was dug by rangatira Rākaihautū on his journey south with his ko. The lake is a Statutory Acknowledgement site under the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. Geologists say it's a glacial lake, formed near the Hauroko Fault (it and other faults in the area have slipped several kilometres) in early carboniferous granites and metamorphic rocks, on the higher ground, with much more recent Hauroko Formation Eocene - Oligocene sediments such as calcareous sandstone, on the lower ground, towards the southeast. Hauroko granite is about 358 million years old, medium grained, white, granodiorite and granite, with red-brown biotite. It has intruded dikes, plugs and xenoliths into metasediment. Albert Edward Granite is coarser, with pink K-feldspar megacrysts and green-brown biotite. There are also small amounts of carboniferous diorite. Towards the northwest of the lake, the area between the Hauroko Burn and the Hay River has dioritic, felsic dykes.  Access  A road from Clifden to the lake was built in about 1909 and improved in the 1960s. A water taxi runs to the Dusky Track, which starts at the north end of the lake and leads to Lake Manapouri.  Burial on Mary Island  Mary Island is the subject of several local myths, including one that the island is subject to a Māori curse. Such stories are dismissed by local Māori. The island is famous for the discovery of a burial site of a Māori woman in 1967, who is known as \\"the lady of the lake\\" by Southland locals. The burial site is in a cave on the eastern side of the island. Believed to have been placed on the burial site sometime between the late 16th century and 17th century, possibly around 1660, the woman was laid to rest wearing a flax cloak and a dog skin collar with weka feather edging around her neck, and was seated upright on a bier made of sticks and leaves. The reasons for the burial in this manner are uncertain, although it has been suggested that these burials were to either make sure the remains were protected from desecration by enemies, or to protect living descendants from a dangerous \\"tapu\\" (sacred, forbidden or taboo) that Māori may have believed the ancestral bones possessed. This led to the belief that this woman was of high-ranking status, and it was later discovered through an archaeological investigation that she was a chieftain of the Ngāti Moimoi tribe. The burial remains on the island today, with a grille made of steel and wire mesh ensuring that people can still view the burial, but the woman will remain untouched.  Natural history  Trees are mainly matai, totara, rimu, tawhai pango, tawhai, Pseudopanax linearis and rautawhiri (Pittosporum Colensoi). The lake is one of the few not yet colonised by invasive water weeds, except the bulbous rush, Juncus bulbosus, so it retains plants such as Nitella stuartii algae, Callitriche petriei water-starwort, Isoetes kirkii quillwort, Pilularia novaezelandiae pillwort fern, Trithuria inconspicua waterlilies and Charales fibrosa. Pests include stoats and possums, which arrived in the 1990s. They are controlled by trapping, bait stations and periodic 1080 drops.

It forms a sizeable area of Southland region and encompasses its two principal settlements the city of Invercargill and the town of Gore. The Southland Plains include some of New Zealand's most fertile farmland. Geography The Plains extend from the Waiau River in the west to the Mataura River which forms the border with the Otago region to the east. It can be divided into three broad areas: the Southland plain proper, the Waimea Plains and the lower Waiau plain to the west near the Waiau river. The Southland and Waimea Plains are separated by the uplands of the Hokonui Hills, which lie to the west of Gore. The Soutland plain lies to the north of the city of Invercargill, and is formed by several large rivers, the Aparima, the Oreti, and the Makarewa. They stretch inland for over 45 kilometres from the coast of the Foveaux Strait, and cover an area of close to 1500 km². To the northeast of Invercargill, the Waimea Plains of the Mataura River and its tributary the Waimea River stretch inland as far as the town of Gore. At their southern extreme they become the Awarua Plain, a large area of marshy land which stretches from near Bluff to the foot of the Catlins in the far east. Between them, the lowlands around the Awarua Plain and Mataura River cover a further 2000 km². To the west lies the lower Waiau plain which is situated around the mouth of the Waiau River. This smaller region is wedged between the Longwood Range to the east and Fiordland to the west.

It is used medicinally for relief of congestion due to colds, allergies and allergic rhinitis and recreationally for its euphoric effects. The effects are similar to those of methamphetamine, though the duration of propylhexedrine is much shorter. Propylhexedrine differs from methamphetamine only in that it has a saturated cyclohexane ring where methamphetamine has a phenyl ring. Propylhexedrine is most commonly found in over-the-counter Benzedrex inhalers. Benzedrex was first manufactured by Smith, Kline and French after the Benzedrine inhaler, which contained racemic amphetamine, became unavailable following the placement of amphetamines on the US Schedule II status (highest abuse potential, yet with accepted medicinal uses). Benzedrex is currently manufactured by B.F. Ascher & Co. Inc. Pharmaceuticals. Propylhexedrine has also seen use in Europe as an appetite suppressant under the trade name Obesin and in the anticonvulsant preparation barbexaclone its S-isomer (levopropylhexedrine or L-propylhexedrine) is bonded with phenobarbital for the purpose of offsetting the barbiturate-induced sedation. Levopropylhexedrine is also used as an anorectic under the brand name Eventin. Medical use Propylhexedrine is used to treat acute nasal congestion related to common cold, allergies and hay fever. For nasal congestion, the dosage is listed as four inhalations (two inhalations per nostril) every two hours for adults and children 6–12 years of age. Each inhalation delivers 0.4 to 0.5 milligram (400 to 500 μg) in 800 millilitres of air. Historically, it has also been used for weight loss, typically at doses from 5 to 30 milligrams. Contraindications Propylhexedrine should not be used if an MAOI has been used in the past 14 days, or is being currently used, as this can lead to a hypertensive crisis. People with cardiovascular disease should not use propylhexedrine. Additionally, drugs such as stimulants and sympathomimetics should not be taken with propylhexedrine, as this can lead to potentially dangerous spikes in blood pressure and irregular heart rhythms. There is one case of death where a combination of propylhexedrine, acetaminophen, morphine, promethazine, and kratom was detected. However the study indicates that propylhexedrine was most likely the principal cause of death. Pharmacology Propylhexedrine is a TAAR1 agonist, like amphetamine. Consequently, it reverses the transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, leading to a release of monoamines from presynaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft. The increased level of monoamines within the synapse results in increased activity at their respective receptors. Additionally, propylhexedrine appears to inhibit VMAT2, leading to a further increase in the aforementioned monoamines. The pharmacological actions of propylhexedrine are similar to that of structurally similar stimulant phenethylamines, such as amphetamine. Metabolism Propylhexedrine undergoes metabolism to form various metabolites including norpropylhexedrine, cyclohexylacetoxime, cis- and trans-4-hydroxypropylhexedrine. Chemistry Freebase propylhexedrine is a volatile, oily liquid at room temperature. The slow evaporation of freebase propylhexedrine allows it to be administered via inhalation. As an amine, it can easily be protonated to form various salts, such as propylhexedrine hydrochloride, propylhexedrine citrate, or propylhexedrine acetate, depending on the acid used. These salts are stable, clear to off-white crystalline substances that readily dissolve in water. Propylhexedrine is structurally similar to phenylethylamines, with the only structural difference being the substitution of an alicyclic cyclohexyl group for the aromatic phenyl group of phenethylamine. Propylhexedrine is not an amphetamine, nor even a phenethylamine, but instead can be referred to as a cycloalkylamine, or more specifically a cyclohexylethylamine being the N,a-dimethyl derivative of 2-cyclohexylethylamine. Propylhexedrine is a chiral compound (the α-carbon is chiral), and the active ingredient contained in Benzedrex inhalers is racemic (RS)-propylhexedrine as the free base. (S)-Propylhexedrine, also known as levopropylhexedrine, is believed to be the more biologically active isomer of the two. (S)-Propylhexedrine can be synthesized from dextromethamphetamine. Synthesis Propylhexedrine can be synthesized starting with cyclohexylacetone in a similar fashion to the phenylacetone synthesis of methamphetamine. However, more commonly propylhexedrine is prepared by reacting methamphetamine with Adams' catalyst, reducing methamphetamine's aromatic ring to a cyclohexyl moiety. Preparation of propylhexedrine Society and culture Recreational use Propylhexedrine is used recreationally in a manner similar to amphetamine, methamphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Users report a high that is often comparable (but slightly inferior) to clandestine racemic amphetamine, noticeably inferior to dextroamphetamine-majority amphetamine products (e.g. Adderall), and significantly inferior to dextroamphetamine or methamphetamine. Compared to both amphetamine and methamphetamine, propylhexedrine has a much shorter duration of action (which is generally considered undesirable by recreational users). In addition, propylhexedrine products are manufactured using delivery devices (such as sub- recreational-dosage inhalers) that are difficult (or nearly impossible) to consume effectively (at recreational doses) via non-oral routes of administration, further limiting its ability to match or replace other amphetamine-related stimulants for recreational use. The negative physical side effects of propylhexedrine at recreational doses are often notably worse than non-IV methamphetamine, amphetamine, and other commonly abused stimulants, making it sub-optimal for long term recreational use. Long-term health problems may develop from daily use. Compared to dextroamphetamine, it is a heavier strain on the cardiovascular system, and the risk of heart damage increases when used daily. Unlike amphetamine, propylhexedrine's serotonin- releasing properties have the potential to cause long term negative side effects similar to MDMA abuse, though the degree in which decreased serotonergic neurotransmission occurs as a result of recreational propylhexedrine usage is largely unclear in the relevant literature. Effects Propylhexedrine has sympathomimetic, adrenergic, vasoconstrictive and psychostimulant effects when taken above the medical dosage. Effects include increased sweating, talkativeness, mydriasis, emotional lability, anorexia, tachycardia, palpitations, dry mouth, bruxism, anxiety, euphoria or dysphoria, increased aggressiveness, paranoia, headache, dizziness, psychosis, slurred or impaired speech, rarely convulsions and serious heart problems. Propylhexedrine can also cause swelling, dryness and irritation of mucous membranes.Safety Data Sheet - Cayman Chemical Injection risks While propylhexedrine is limited in a number of administration routes, attempts to extract the drug from the nasal inhaler and then inject it have been reported. Recreational use by intravenous injection (IV) is dangerous and could result in serious bodily harm or death. IV use of propylhexedrine is known to cause mild side-effects such as transient diplopia as well as some serious (and potentially fatal) effects such as brainstem dysfunction, and deaths have been recorded in the medical literature. Typically, recorded cases of IV use are prepared by placing propylhexedrine freebase in a solution with hydrochloric acid to form propylhexedrine HCl, the solution is then heated to evaporate the solvent and the resulting crystals are dissolved in water for injection.

History The Kapap system was developed in the late 1930s, within the Jewish Aliyah camps as part of preparatory training before their arrival in Mandatory Palestine. It was primarily considered a practical skill set that was acquired during the training period of the Palmach and Haganah fighters. The main focus was to upgrade the physical endurance, to elevate and strengthen the spirit, and to develop a defensive and offensive skill set. It included cold weapon practical usage, boxing, judo, jujutsu, karate, as well as fighting with knives and sticks. In the 1930s, Maishel Horovitz, the leader of HaMahanot HaOlim youth movement, developed a short stick fighting method in order to deal with the British policemen who were armed with clubs. Later, his method became one of the main components of hand-to-hand combat training for all the Haganah fighters, therefore making a major contribution to the development of Kapap. According to the historian Noah Gross, however, Horovitz did not even know that his stick-fighting system was taught to the soldiers until 1959. Chaim Pe'er is the President and founder of the International Kapap Federation. He is recognized internationally as a Soke – founder of the modern Kapap system.

This 15–16 cm long bird breeds in semi-desert and stony hillsides from Turkey east to Afghanistan and western Pakistan. It is a short-distance migrant, wintering in Egypt, Cyprus and the Greater Middle East. The nest is built in a rock crevice, and 4-5 eggs is the normal clutch. In summer the male Finsch's wheatear is a white and black bird. The white crown, central back and belly contrast with the black face, throat and wings. The tail and rump are white, with an inverted black T giving a pattern like black-eared wheatear, but with a uniformly wide terminal band. The female is brown-grey above, becoming dirty white below. The tail pattern is similar to the male's. Finsch's wheatear feeds mainly on insects. Its call is a whistled tsit, and the song is a mix of clear notes with whistles and crackling. The common name and scientific name commemorate the German ethnographer, naturalist and colonial explorer Friedrich Hermann Otto Finsch (8 August 1839 – 31 January 1917, Braunschweig).

Chávez, who had been elected in 2000, was aided in his return to power by popular support (mostly labor unions)Venezuela: por qué fracasó el golpe and mobilization against the coup by moderate ranks in the military. The situation began on 9 April, when a general strike was called by the trade union organization National Federation of Trade Unions (Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela, CTV). The proposed strike was in response to Chávez's appointments to prominent posts in Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA. Two days later in Caracas, up to one million Venezuelans marched in opposition to Chávez. At one point during the march, opposition leaders redirected the protestors to the presidential palace, Miraflores, where government supporters and Bolivarian Circles were holding their own rally. Upon the opposition's arrival, the two sides confronted each other. A shootout started at the Llaguno Overpass, near the Miraflores Palace, and by that evening 19 people were dead, including both supporters and opponents of the government. The military high command refused Chávez's order to implement the Plan Ávila as a response to the protests and demanded him to resign. President Chávez refused to resign and was subsequently arrested by the military.Rey, J. C. (2002), \\"Consideraciones políticas sobre un insólito golpe de Estado\\" , pp. 1–16; cited in Cannon (2004:296); \\"In 2002, Venezuela's military and some of its business leaders ousted President Chavez from power and held him hostage.\\" (N. Scott Cole (2007), \\"Hugo Chavez and President Bush's credibility gap: The struggle against US democracy promotion\\", International Political Science Review, 28(4), p498) Chávez's request for asylum in Cuba was denied, and he was ordered to be tried in a Venezuelan court. Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce (Fedecámaras) president Pedro Carmona was declared interim president. During his brief rule, the National Assembly and the Supreme Court were both dissolved and the country's 1999 Constitution was declared void.Interim Venezuelan president sworn in. BBC News. (13 April 2002). URL. Retrieved 30 May 2007 By the 13th, the coup was on the verge of collapse, as Carmona's attempts to entirely undo Chávez's reforms angered much of the public and key sectors of the military, while parts of the anti-Chávez movement also refused to back Carmona. When word began to spread that Chávez had not resigned, as was publicly claimed, Chávez supportersCannon (2004:295) surrounded the presidential palace.Kozloff (2007:30) In Caracas, Chávez supporters seized television stations and demanded his return. That night, Carmona resigned and went into exile. The pro-Chávez Presidential Guard retook Miraflores without firing a shot, leading to the removal of the Carmona government and the re-installation of Chávez as president. The coup was allegedly planned for some time, as those who opposed Chávez, such as business lobbies, private media, and Catholic organizations, felt that his government was becoming undemocratic and threatened their interests. At the time, Chávez saw his approval rating of 80% drop to about 30%. The growing dissatisfaction with Chávez among those in the military due to his aggressive manner and alliances with Cuba and paramilitaries also led multiple officers to call on Chávez to resign. Chávez initially denied allegations that the United States government sought to overthrow his government. It was later revealed that the US had prior knowledge of the coup attempt and that members of the US government had ties to prominent participants in the coup. However, the United States repeatedly informed the Venezuelan opposition that they would not be supported if there were a coup and warned the Chávez government of the plot. The private media was accused of biased reporting in support of the anti- Chávez protests and coup, with coverage being described as \\"lopsided\\", as well as \\"suppress[ed] and manipulate[d]\\".Maurice Lemoine, Le Monde Diplomatique, 10 August 2002, \\"Venezuela's press power\\". (Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5n7VaWIad) Allegations that owners of media organizations actively participated in the coup have not been proven. Background Chávez was first elected president in 1998. One of his campaign promises was to convene a new constitutional convention, and on 15 December 1999 he put the new Constitution of Venezuela to the voters in a referendum, which passed with 71.78% of the popular vote. Following the 1999 constitutional referendum, Chávez was reelected in 2000 under the terms of the new constitution. Following these elections, Chávez had gained control of all formerly independent institutions of the Venezuelan government. The popularity of Chávez then dropped due to his clashes with multiple social groups he had alienated and his close ties with controversial world leaders such as Mohammad Khatami, Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi and especially Fidel Castro. Chávez used a strategy of polarization in Venezuela, a them against us situation, in order to single out those who stood in the way of his progress. He would insult and use name calling against original supporters that would question him; the media, business leaders, the Catholic Church and the middle class. Such \\"words spawned hatred and polarization\\" with Chávez, \\"a master of language and communication\\", creating his own reality among Venezuelans. Nelson says that what hurt Chávez's popularity the most was his relationship with Fidel Castro and Cuba, with Chávez attempting to make Venezuela in Cuba's image. Venezuela became Cuba's largest trade partner while Chávez, following Castro's example, consolidated the country's bicameral legislature into a single National Assembly that gave him more power and created community groups of loyal supporters allegedly trained as paramilitaries. Such actions created great fear among Venezuelans who felt like they were tricked and that Chávez had dictatorial goals. This feeling of being tricked especially affected the media since they originally supported Chávez and his promises. Opposition to the Chávez government was then particularly strong, with some of those who were previously in the government before the election of Chávez. The independent media became the primary check on Chávez after he had taken control of most of the Venezuelan government, with the Venezuelan media acting like other forms of media in Latin America at the time that demanded accountability for governmental abuses and exposing corruption. The opposition was worried with Chávez because they believed his rewriting Venezuela's constitution were signs that Chávez was trying to maintain power through authoritarianism. In early 2002, there were also increasing signs of discontent in the military; in February four military officials, including a general and a rear admiral, publicly called on Chávez to resign. On 7 February 2002 Venezuela Air Force Colonel Pedro Vicente Soto and National Reserve Captain Pedro Flores Rivero led a rally protesting the Chávez government's allegedly undemocratic and authoritarian practices. Rear Admiral Carlos Molina Tamayo said on television that if Chávez did not resign, he should be impeached. Besides the opposition accusations that Chávez was undermining democracy and free speech, the military's complaints included Plan Bolívar 2000's use of the armed forces for poverty reduction activities instead of national defense. They also said Chávez was alienating the United States through a foreign policy involving negotiations with Colombian rebels and strengthening links with OPEC countries considered enemies of the United States, including Saddam Hussein's Iraq.Jones (2008:311) Chávez and his allies suggested other motives, including Soto's being passed over for promotion, and pointed to a report in The Washington Post alleging that Soto and Tamayo had received $100,000 each from Miami bank accounts in return for denouncing Chávez.  Events leading to the coup  Social and business tension Chávez's opposition originated from the response to the \\"cubanization\\" of Venezuela when mothers realized that the new textbooks in Venezuela were really Cuban books filled with revolutionary propaganda and with different covers causing them to protest. By the summer months of 2001, the opposition groups grew quickly from concerned mothers to labor unions, business interests, church groups, and right and leftwing political parties, who felt that they were being isolated.The Miami Herald, April 20, 2002 Saturday BR EDITION, Venezuelan defends his brief presidency; Denies conspiring against Chavez, BYLINE: FRANCES ROBLES frobles@herald.com, SECTION: A; Pg. 1 At the same time, groups supporting Chávez became organized, especially among the poor, with their passion for Chávez bordering idolatry since he gave them hope and feeling of being valuable. Enabling Law In 2000, the pro-Chávez National Assembly granted President Chávez emergency powers and the ability to rule by decree through an enabling act to tend to the poor state of the economy. On 13 November 2001, Chávez passed a package of 49 laws, using the enabling act which was set to expire the following day such as rearranging public ministries while also changing major laws in the government, oil businesses and land usage without approval of the National Assembly. The laws \\"marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president\\" with both chavistas and anti-chavistas outraged at the changes. The two decrees in particular sparked protest: a law aimed at strengthening government control over the oil company PDVSA, which Chávez argued had become a \\"state within a state\\", and a more controversial land reform law, which included provisions for the expropriation of \\"idle\\" lands on large estates.Jones, Bart (2008), Hugo! The Hugo Chávez Story: From Mud Hut to Perpetual Revolution, London: The Bodley Head. pp. 305–306 Though the government stated that it would provide the previous owners with compensation at the going market rates, the land laws introduced by Chávez were so vaguely worded that the government could legally expropriate any property it wished to take. While some of the land was genuinely given to the vulnerable, much of it was used in a system of patronage for party members loyal to Chávez. McCaughan described the 49 laws as the \\"plus ultra non\\", the \\"point of no return for Chávez's troubled relations with business, church and media leaders\\".McCaughan (2004: 65, 68) For the opposition, such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that Chávez was a \\"dictator-in-training\\". Opposition to these programmes included an attempt by Democratic Action to have the Supreme Court assess Chávez for potential mental incapacity, which would permit his removal from office under Article 233 of the new constitution.Jones (2008:309)Phil Gunson, Newsweek, 11 November 2001, \\"Is Hugo Chávez Insane?\\" On 10 December 2001, a national strike shut down 90% of the economy and was the largest strike in Venezuela's history, bigger than the strike that assisted with ending the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez in 1958. By January 2002, protests involving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans opposing Chávez became common in Venezuela. Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) In March 2002, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state oil company that acted somewhat autonomously and accounted for 70% of Venezuela's foreign revenue, was targeted by Chávez out of fear of the oppositions ability to call national strikes and was to receive strict control from the government. Chávez's attempts to end the functional independence of PDVSA and to bring its oil revenues under state control were met with strong resistance from PDVSA officials and managers. Many supported the old Rafael Caldera-era policy of apertura, that is, opening the Venezuelan oil sector to much greater foreign participation, to raise production; Chávez argued instead for cutting production, with coordination via OPEC, to raise prices and increase oil revenues. Chávez suspected apertura supporters of ultimately wanting to privatize the company, and the government attacked PDVSA management saying it was diverting too much of its revenues into its own pockets (PDVSA royalties paid to the state had fallen from 71% of gross earnings in 1981 during the peak of Venezuela's economy to 39% in 2000 following decades of financial hardship).Jones (2008:306) On April 7, Chávez fired the President of PDVSA, Brigadier-General Guaicaipuro Lameda Montero and replaced him with \\"a former Communist Party militant\\", in addition to firing another 5 of the 7 members of the PDVSA board of directors on his Aló Presidente program, mocking each worker by name and used a whistle \\"as if to eject them from a soccer match\\".Jones (2008:312–3) Such actions by Chávez caused further anti-Chávez developments with a series of walkouts and work slowdowns followed.Margarita López Maya, \\"Venezuela 2002–2003: Polarization, Confrontation, and Violence\\", in Olivia Burlingame Goumbri, The Venezuela Reader, Washington D.C., U.S.A., 2005, p. 14. The Washington Times then noted that Chávez had \\"choked off foreign investment by doubling the royalty payments oil companies must pay to the government and by restricting corporate ownership on some oil projects to 49 percent\\", and had \\"alienated workers at his country's state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, by replacing long-serving professionals with his supporters\\".The Washington Times, April 25, 2002, Thursday, Final Edition, \\"The fall and rise of Hugo Chavez\\", SECTION: EDITORIALS; p. A18 By early 2002, Chávez's approval rating dropped to around 30%. This action, according to The Los Angeles Times, \\"united all the anti-Chávez forces\\", bringing together labor leader Carlos Ortega with Pedro Carmona Estanga, head of Venezuela's largest business federation, Fedecámaras, in a call for an \\"indefinite general strike\\" in support of oil workers. Military The existing military grew wary of Chávez due to his relationship with Fidel Castro and the Colombian guerrilla group FARC that they were previously taught \\"were the greatest threat to their country\\". The military felt that after fighting against Castro's influence, guerilla groups and attempts to overthrow previous Venezuelan governments to expand his revolutionary presence since the 1960s, that they had finally lost when Chávez came to power. Chávez promoted guerilla fighters into the Venezuelan military and forced the wary existing military servicemen to assist them. One of the more controversial actions that created discontent within the military was when Chávez forced them to assist the FARC with setting up camps in Venezuelan territories, providing ammunition to fight the Colombian government, supplying ID cards so they could move freely through Venezuela and sending members of Bolivarian Circles to their camps to receive guerilla training. The most controversial steps taken by Chávez was ordering the existing military to work with the Cuban military, with the Venezuelan military and intelligence agencies forced to open their bases, files and hard drives for their Cuban counterparts creating a sense of being betrayed by Chávez. The \\"long-simmering resentment in the military\\" was articulated publicly by four high-level officers, including Air Force Gen. Roman Gomez Ruiz, who called on Chávez to \\"resign peacefully and take responsibility for your failure\\". Chávez responded by declaring these officers traitors, ordering their arrest, and forcing their resignations. The Chicago Tribune later reported that although the Venezuelan general public was unaware of it, the country's oil industry was approaching the end of a six-week work slowdown and Chávez's government and oil executives had agreed that members of an oil board picked by Chávez would resign. \\"But labor and business leaders, who had joined in secret with dissident military officers in an effort to oust Chávez, decided that the moment had come to press on\\", the newspaper maintained. \\"The middle-class intellectuals and professionals who had at first delighted in Chávez's talk of restoring 'national honor, Sandra Hernandez later observed in The Los Angeles Times, \\"watched in dismay as Chávez's supporters formed 'Bolivarian circles', muscle groups that intimidated government opponents with threats of physical harm\\". During the year or so preceding the coup, Chávez \\"essentially thumbed his nose\\" at his opponents, claimed a political consultant.Los Angeles Times April 22, 2002 Monday, \\"Rapid-Fire Coup Caught Chavez Foes Off Guard\\", BYLINE: HECTOR TOBAR, PATRICK J.

Writing about the run-up to the coup, Letta Tayler of Newsweek observed that \\"[o]ne of the few certainties\\" about it was \\"that military, business, union and civic leaders had been plotting Chávez's downfall for nearly two years\\".Newsday (New York) April 24, 2002 Wednesday NASSAU AND SUFFOLK EDITION, \\"Peace Kept, for Now; In Venezuela, anarchy threatens at any moment\\", BYLINE: By Letta Tayler; LATIN AMERICA CORRESPONDENT, SECTION: NEWS, p. A06 According to former United States Ambassador to Venezuela, Charles S. Shapiro, the United States had known about a potential coup since late 2001 and that weeks before the coup, he had attempted to dissuade Venezuelan trade union organization from participating, saying the United States would not support such actions and would only accept the change of government by electoral means. On the evening of 11 April, with the coup in full swing, one coup plotter, Colonel Julio Rodriguez Salas, told television viewers that the coup had been long planned: \\"Nine months ago a movement started to organise itself more firmly, a serious movement, and fortunately it has come to fruition today.\\"Jones (2008:334) The Guardian reported that as early as 18 March 2002 that \\"Chávez was saying that he was aware of a plot\\" to overthrow him, and that in the days before 11 April, \\"the political temperature was approaching boiling point\\", with oil workers striking \\"in protest at Chávez's appointments to their board\\" and the media accelerating its criticisms of the regime.The Guardian (London), April 22, 2002, G2: \\"The coup\\": BYLINE: Duncan Campbell, SECTION: G2; p. 2 The Chicago Tribune reported that there had been rumors in Caracas \\"for weeks\\" about a coup, with military figures like Navy Vice Adm. Carlos Molina and Air Force Col. Pedro Soto \\"building support ... in the armed forces\\" for a coup.Chicago Tribune, April 18, 2002 Thursday, \\"Chavez's resolve, foes' mistakes doomed coup\\", BYLINE: By Patrice M. Jones, Tribune foreign correspondent, SECTION: NEWS; ZONE: N; Pg. 7 Hernandez claimed that in early April, \\"the coming coup ... was an open secret\\". On April 9, retired Gen. Manuel Andara Clavier, one of many retired military officials who opposed Chávez, reportedly told her, \\"The table is set. ... Everything is set for the military to let the president know he can't push this country to spill blood.\\"Los Angeles Times, April 21, 2002 Sunday, \\"He's In, He's Out, He's In\\", BYLINE: SANDRA HERNANDEZ, SECTION: OPINION; Part M; p. 1 Shortly before the coup attempt, Alí Rodríguez Araque, a former guerrilla and Chávez ally then serving in Vienna as the General Secretary of OPEC, allegedly heard of a potential oil embargo against the United States by Iraq and Libya, over US support for Israel. More importantly, he heard that \\"the United States was planning to prod a coup into action in Venezuela to head off any threat of embargo\\".Nikolas Kozloff (2007), Hugo Chávez: oil, politics and the challenge to the United States, Palgrave Macmillan. p27 Rodríguez Araque's warning led Chávez to declare that he would not join such an embargo, and to secretly hide several hundred troops in Miraflores' underground corridors, commanded by José Baduel.Greg Palast, The Guardian, 13 May 2002, Opec chief warned Chavez about coup Government On 7 April, the same day that President Chávez fired the PDVSA officials, Chávez met with his cabinet and high level military officials and began the meeting calling the actions by the opposition \\"treasonous\\" and asked those gathered how to counteract such actions. Soon discussions arose on how to defend Miraflores Palace. There were recommendations declaring a state of emergency, beginning the censorship of television and declaring martial law. Chávez then began to discuss Plan Ávila with Manuel Rosendo, the head of the Unified Command of the National Armed Forces, and how to implement it, though the military command did not accept it. The Tactical Command, headed by Cilia Flores, Guillermo García Ponce and Freddy Bernal, then shared plans of using the Bolivarian Circles as a paramilitary force to end marches and also defend Chávez by organizing them into brigades. Another plan was to have the National Guard raid the offices of PDVSA in Chuao and occupy the company by force. They also discussed launching a disinformation propaganda campaign on public and private television and having government loyalists fill the highways with their vehicles and then present the images on TV as if people were busy working like any other day. In another plan to end the strike, Gastón Parra, the president of PDVSA, suggested to give bonuses to PDVSA employees who chose not to participate in the strike. In a 9 April discussion between Finance Minister General Francisco Usón and General Jacinto Pérez, Pérez believed that the Bolivarian Revolution was in a crisis and needed to \\"rejuvenate itself\\". Pérez then stated that the Bolivarian Revolution need had to be \\"purified with blood\\", which concerned Usón since Pérez \\"had the president’s ear\\". Both discussions outraged generals since they believed that the Venezuelan government was proposing violence against the public with General Rosendo stating that it seemed that \\"Chávez actually wanted a confrontation, that he had picked the fight with PDVSA in order to precipitate a crisis\\". Strikes On 10 December, the opposition organised a one-day general strike, which was substantially effective, although shops in poorer neighborhoods remained open. With newspapers, workplaces, schools and the stock exchange closed, \\"the opposition was ecstatic ... [and] ... convinced themselves that Chávez's support had all but vanished\\".Jones(2008:310) On 5 April 2002, the PDVSA opposition to Chávez moved to shut down the company. Thousands of anti-Chávez PDVSA employees, and two of the five main export terminals were paralyzed. On 6 April the Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela (CTV) trade union federation announced a 24-hour general strike for 9 April, to support the PDVSA protestors. It was joined the following day by Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce, headed by Pedro Carmona and Fedepetrol, the country's \\"largest blue-collar petroleum union\\". As in the December general strike, the country's most powerful business group and largest trade union federation acted together.Jones (2008:315) On 7 April, Chávez fired seven PDVSA executives who had been leading the protests, and forced another 12 into retirement. Tensions continued to escalate through March and early April. The mayor of Caracas, Alfredo Peña, a former Chávez ally, said that Chávez was possessed by evil spirits, and called on the Catholic Church to perform an exorcism. Days after the firing of PDVSA heads, on 9 April, the general strike was moderately successful and oil production slowed. Newspapers were not published and television stations cancelled regular programming and commercials to run continuous coverage of the strike, including the stations' own anti-Chávez ads. The strike organizers declared it a success, which the government disputed, and in an effort to show its version of events, ordered a series of \\"cadenas\\" (mandatory government broadcasts), showing daily life continuing (over 30 cadenas on 8 and 9 AprilU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. 31 March 2003 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – 2002. Retrieved 4 August 2006.). On the evening of 9 April, the strike was extended for another 24 hours. On 10 April, the strike was less effective, with many schools and businesses re-opening. As with the previous day, television provided continuous coverage, and the government intervened with cadenas – but this time the networks split the screen, showing the cadena on one side and their coverage of the strike on the other. On the evening of 10 April, Fedecámaras and CTV held televised news conference announcing that the strike would be extended indefinitely, unanimously voted for a \\"coordinating committee for democracy and liberty\\" in order to \\"rescue\\" Venezuela's freedom. The opposition then called for a march to the PDVSA headquarters the following day.Jones (2008:316) In the National Assembly, those close to Chávez stated that Chávez wanted \\"moderation\\" though if an unlimited general strike were to occur from the opposition, an \\"unspecified 'violence will occur. Brigadier General Néstor González then appeared on television to demand Chávez's resignation and to issue an ultimatum. The statement had the desired effect of ensuring that Chávez cancelled his planned trip to a Rio Group summit in Costa Rica: the coup plans supposedly required Chávez to be in Venezuela. The message was recorded in the house of Napoleón Bravo, host of Venevisión's 24 Horas, as Bravo admitted on air on 12 April, in a discussion with Rear Admiral Molina Tamayo.Jones (2008:343) Also on 10 April, a draft of what would become the Carmona Decree was allegedly shown to the leading intellectual Jorge Olavarría for comments. Olavarría warned that it violated democratic norms and would provoke an international reaction. 11 April march The crisis that triggered the coup came when \\"workers and business leaders\\", infuriated by Chávez's \\"meddling in the state oil company\\", as the Chicago Tribune put it, joined in \\"calling for a general strike that cut exports\\" in support of striking oil workers.Chicago Tribune, April 16, 2002 Tuesday, \\"Military played crucial roles in Chavez's ouster, return\\", BYLINE: By Patrice M. Jones, Tribune Foreign Correspondent, SECTION: NEWS; ZONE: N; p. 3 The strike began, according to The Washington Post, \\"as a managerial protest at the state-run oil company, but evolved into a broad effort supported by the country's largest business and labor groups to force Chávez from power.\\"The Washington Post, April 13, 2002 Saturday, \\"Leader of Venezuela Is Forced to Resign; Ex-Oil Executive Takes Office as Interim President\\", BYLINE: Scott Wilson, Washington Post Foreign Service, SECTION: A SECTION; p. A01 After days of general strikes and protests involving thousands of Venezuelans, on 10 April, a speech was held at the CTV headquarters, where CTV and Fedecámaras held speeches that involved a Brigadier General denouncing Chávez's alleged involvement with FARC, and the announcement of a march the next day with the possibility of an indefinite strike. The march on 11 April was to begin at 9:00am, starting at Parque del Este and ending at the PDVSA headquarters. On 11 April, just hours before an operation to take over the PDVSA by force was to begin, General Rosendo, knowing the consequences of such an action, talked Chávez out of the plan. Later that day, hundreds of thousands to millions of Venezuelans marched to the PDVSA headquarters later that day in defense of its recently dismissed management board.Newsweek, 29 April 2002, Hugo's Close Call Chants of \\"Miraflores! Miraflores! Miraflores!\\" could be heard throughout the march with participants calling for a march to the Miraflores Palace. The organizers of the march had planned to announce a \\"spontaneous\\" decision to reroute the march and \\"descend on Miraflores presidential palace to force the president to resign\\".Jones (2008:317) By late morning, speakers at the rally at PDVSA headquarters called for a march to Miraflores, and the crowd approved and began the six-mile march.Jones (2008:319–320) The march was re-routed without consultation with the police, who legally had to approve the changed route. The government, upon seeing how events were unfolding on television, called for a halt in the progress of demonstrators so that the very real possibility of a violent confrontation taking place between the marchers and thousands of Chavistas already gathered there at the palace might be avoided.Jones (2008:320) \\"I don't think there was any intention of a coup\\", Carlos Ortega, president of the Venezuelan Workers Confederation, later told The Los Angeles Times. Newsday indicated that it was Ortega and other protest leaders who called for participants to march to Miraflores. \\"Many marchers said they thought the call to proceed to Miraflores was spontaneous\\", reported Newsday, but some planners \\"said the idea had always been to bring crowds to Miraflores to demand Chávez's resignation once they had sufficient turnout and a pledge from the military that it would second their call for his ouster\\". At the palace the protesters shouted \\"Chávez Out!\\" The New York Times quoted Ortega as shouting: \\"Chávez get out! ... We do not want you! We reject you!\\"The New York Times, April 12, 2002 Friday, Generals Revolt in Venezuela After 10 Protesters Are Killed, BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO, SECTION: Section A; Column 1; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1 Shortly after the protesters arrived at Miraflores, Chávez issued a call for calm on national TV. According to an opinion piece by Sandra Hernandez, opposition TV aired images of anti-Chávez protesters outside the palace being beaten by troops. Hernandez wrote that on 11 April, she was interviewing General Guaicaipuro Lameda, who had resigned in February as president of Venezuela's state-run oil firm \\"to protest Chávez's autocratic management style\\", when an aide interrupted to say that he had to take a call from a family member. When Lameda hung up, he told Hernandez that the call \\"was from an officer who was present when an order was issued to send the military intelligence police after him\\". Lameda assumed the police were coming \\"to prevent him from appearing on television later in the day, when he planned to appeal to the military to choose sides in the growing tensions between Chávez's supporters and his opponents\\". Lameda was not calling for a coup, he said, although he and other opponents of Chávez hoped that anti-Chávez demonstrations would grow so large that Chávez would have to crack down, whereupon the military would be faced with the decision of whether to enforce his orders or not. Miraflores confrontation Close to Miraflores, a line of police and National Guard held the marchers for a time, before the marchers pressed on led by Metropolitan Police on motorcycles. Chavistas belonging to Bolivarian Circles, some with that had military training in Cuba, were also stationed outside of Miraflores. The Circles had been positioned outside of the palace throughout the week during the unrest. Government officials used the hours it took for the march to travel 5 miles to the palace to call on loyalists to gather at Miraflores, with National Assembly Deputy Juan Barreto telling loyalists through the media covering the situation \\"The call is to Miraflores! Everyone to Miraflores to defend your revolution! Don't let them through!\\" Some government supporters who then began to gather were armed with Molotov cocktails, rocks, sticks, chains, baseball bats, and metal pipes and were ignored by the Venezuelan National Guard stationed to defend Chávez. According to General Rosendo, Defense Minister José Vicente Rangel ordered Freddy Bernal to prepare the Bolivarian Circles to attack the opposition demonstration. At about 12:00pm, Chávez knew the march was on its way and believed a coup was about to be attempted so he called for the implementation of a military plan to occupy key locations in the city, Plan Ávila, the plan first used by Carlos Andrés Pérez during the Caracazo that resulted in the killings of hundreds and possibly thousands of Venezuelans.Jones (2008:321–2)Gott, Richard (2005), Hugo Chávez and the Bolivarian Revolution, Verso Books, p225 This caused discomfort among some in the military since they knew that Chávez was violating the constitution he helped create by ordering High Command to have the military control civilians. By 12:30 pm, thousands of government supporters were gathered around the palace blocking all routes to Miraflores except for the Llaguno Overpass, which was where the Bolivarian Circles had gathered to overlook the route. As the march turned a corner and began to approach the Miraflores at about 2:00 pm, the National Guard fired about 12 tear gas canisters from behind the palace walls and the protesters fled back down the road. As more marchers pressed toward Miraflores, the leaders of the protest, Guaicaipuro Lameda and Rear Admiral Molina Tamayo, \\"kept calling on them to surge forward for a direct assault on the palace about two hundred yards away\\" and urged the crowd to advance through the tear gas about 20 minutes after the initial confrontation.Jones (2008:322–3) The protesters made it closer to Miraflores and the Presidential Guard responded with more tear gas, about 20 gas canisters causing panic and a dispersion of the demonstrators to areas surrounding the palace. At about 2:30 pm opposition protesters began to throw objects at the National Guard and the Chavistas a block away; some were thrown back, and the opposition and the Chavistas exchanged insults. Since other routes were blocked by the National Guard, many marchers began to head down Baralt Avenue in order to reach Miraflores. On Baralt Avenue, near the Llaguno Overpass as the march inched closer hundreds of Chávez supporters gathered and began throwing large rocks, Molotov cocktails and even tear gas at the demonstrators. As marchers and Chavistas clashed, the Metropolitan Police attempted to separate both sides from further confrontation with two trucks with water cannons. Police motorcycles pushed the opposition towards the Chavistas, and as a police tank turned onto the main street, gunfire broke out shortly after 3:00pm. By that time, Lameda, Molina Tamayo, Carmona, and CTV leader Carlos Ortega had already left the area.Jones (2008:326) A few minutes after Chávez's broadcast at 3:45 pm, gunfire erupted again and the march began to disperse slightly. As the demonstrators marched closer to the Llaguno Overpass, they could see Chavistas heavily armed, some with pistols. Police began to disperse the Chavista gunmen returning fire and few demonstrators began to follow behind them with pings of gunfire heard on the police armored vehicles, though the marchers fled shortly after as the violence grew. Only when Chávez emerged from the broadcast did he learn the extent of the violence. According to medical staff at the Vargas Hospital, the first to arrive at the hospital were opposition marchers. According to surgeons, the marchers had been shot in the back with handgun fire while fleeing and others were severely injured from 7.62×51mm NATO military rounds from Fal rifles, standard equipment of the National Guard defending Chávez. Later after police responded to pro-Chávez shooting, Chávez supporters then began being seen injured in the hospitals. As a result of the confrontations, between 17 and 19 were left dead and around 60 injured,Gregory Wilpert, NACLA, \\"The Venezuelan Coup Revisited: Silencing the Evidence\\", NACLA Report 42(4) most killed between 3:20 pm and 3:55 pm. Coup Plan Ávila and military insubordination Immediately after Chávez finished his broadcast at 5:25pm he changed into his military fatigues and grabbed his rifle and pistol worrying about rebels entering the palace. Chávez believed that the best way to stay in power was to implement Plan Ávila, a constitutionally banned military contingency plan that was created to maintain public order in Caracas that left hundreds to thousands of Venezuelans dead during the Caracazo. Since General Rosendo would not comply earlier in the day with Chávez's order to implement Plan Ávila, Chávez went directly to General Jorge García Carneiro, one of his most trusted generals and ordered him to go through with it. \\"The killings at the anti-Chávez demonstration rocked the country\\", The New York Times reported on April 20, \\"reviving memories of the violent events in 1989, known as the Caracazo, in which hundreds were killed by government forces. Venezuelans across the political spectrum swore that such violence would never take place again.\\" Five minutes after Chávez's broadcast finished, Lameda and Molina Tamayo went on the air at Venevisión, where many opposition leaders had gathered, and, blaming Chávez for the violence, urged the armed forces to intervene. Shortly after 6:00pm, word spread at Fort Tiuna that Chávez- loyalist General Carneiro was still seeking to implement Plan Ávila. Head of the army General Efraín Vásquez Velasco was meeting at the Army School with other officers concerned about Chávez's use of violence when Chávez ordered General Carneiro, one of Vásquez Velasco's subordinates, to go ahead with Plan Ávila. Vásquez Velasco, who founded the Office of Human Rights of the Venezuelan Army, knew that if the plan were implemented that he would be blamed since he was the head of the army. Soon after, General Vásquez Velasco learned that General Carneiro did not comply with his orders and was sending about 20 tanks to Miraflores to support Chávez. Vásquez Velasco called the tank commander ordering him to return with the commander complying with the general. General Vásquez Velasco then ordered a nationwide military lockdown with military movements requiring written documentation and approval, a move by Vásquez Velasco that was to prevent troops loyal to Chávez from suppressing the march and would also deter rebellious attacks from the military against Chávez. Vásquez Velasco then ordered the Chávez-loyalist General Carneiro be arrested before he could arrest the other officers under Chávez's orders, but Carneiro complied with Vásquez Velasco. At 6:30, leaders of business and labor pulled their support from Chávez and by 6:45 pm, \\"Navy Chief of Staff Vice Adm. Hector Ramirez Perez and nine other generals and admirals who had been talking since July about pressuring Chávez into changing his ways decided to rebel and go public\\", according to The Miami Herald.The Miami Herald, April 13, 2002 Saturday F1 EDITION, \\"Former President Hugo Chavez was under detention in an army...\\", BYLINE: JUAN O. TAMAYO jtamayo@herald.com, SECTION: A; Pg. 1 \\"Even many military officers who were neutral in their feelings about Chávez were persuaded to turn against the president after Thursday's massacre\\", The Chicago Tribune later reported. \\"Soon press conferences flooded the airwaves as dozens of officers, more than 50 in all, denounced the president.\\" At around 7:30 pm, Venevisión began broadcasting its version of events that afternoon, showing the Chavistas firing from Puente Llaguno, juxtaposed with footage of dead or wounded protesters, and accusing the Chavistas of shooting unarmed opposition protestors and of having planned an ambush.Jones (2008:327–8) This showed General Vásquez Velasco and other generals that Chávez had ordered the Bolivarian Circles to attack opposition marchers. The military officers, including General Raúl Baduel, a founder of Chávez's MBR-200, then decided that they had to pull support from Chávez to deter another massacre and shortly after at 8:00 pm, Vásquez Velasco, together with other ranking army officers, declared that Chávez had lost his support.Jones (2008:330–1) This was followed by heads of the Venezuelan Air Force and Navy, with Chávez then losing power of the military. By 8:30 pm, Luis Miquilena, Chávez's mentor and a respected individual among his government being described as \\"the most important civilian who supported the Chávez government\\" pulled his support from Chávez stating, \\"I solemnly declare that it is very difficult that a government of this nature could ever count on the possibility of help on my part ... (the government) had ended up stained in blood\\". Following this, Chávez had also lost the support of the legislative and judicials branches who supported Miquilena. Infuriated by the slaughter but \\"reluctant to stage an outright coup\\", according to The New York Times, a group of military officers who called themselves the \\"Movement for the Integrity and Dignity of the National Armed Forces\\" demanded on Thursday evening that Chávez resign. In a statement, they declared that they had no longer had \\"recognition\\" of Chávez, whom they accused of \\"betraying the trust of the people\\" and held responsible for the deaths of peaceful protesters. The statement was read at a press conference by Vice Adm. Hector Ramirez Perez, chief of staff of the Venezuelan Navy and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and signed by a number of other officers, including 10 senior officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard,The Miami Herald, April 12, 2002 Friday, VENEZUELA IN CRISIS AFTER DEADLY MARCH; President says calm prevails, urges dialogue, BYLINE: JUAN O.

Other signatories included the heads of the paramilitary National Guard and \\"several midlevel commanders based in the capital\\". Perhaps the most prominent member of this group was Gen. Efrain Vásquez, Commander in Chief of the Army, who said, \\"Mr. President, I was loyal to the end, but today's deaths cannot be tolerated.\\" He also told reporters that no coup had been planned before April 11 but that the massacre had been \\"too much and we had to move\\". Navy Vice Admiral Hector Rafael Ramirez agreed, saying, \\"We cannot allow a tyrant to run the Republic of Venezuela.\\" Chávez sought to get out his version of the events, but struggled to do so. Venezuelan television refused to interview any government officials, and the government was left with broadcasts from Miraflores via the state-run Channel 8 (Venezolana de Televisión, VTV). By 10 pm this too was gone, as police loyal to Miranda governor Enrique Mendoza took it over, its employees putting on an old nature documentary before leaving.Jones (2008:331) Shortly before the takeover, Mendoza had said \\"this channel 8 crap needs to stop\\".Régis Bourgeat, Reporters without Borders, Venezuela: Caught between an authoritarian president and intolerant media , April 2003 At 10:20 pm National Guard general Alberto Camacho Kairuz declared on television that Chávez had \\"abandoned\\" his office. This was not the case; Chávez was in Miraflores, contacting ambassadors from a range of countries to keep them informed and seek their help as mediators. Around this time, Chávez contemplated about committing suicide. Near midnight, Fidel Castro called, and urged him not to kill himself and to turn himself in to the military, with José Vicente Rangel later stating that \\"the call from Fidel was decisive so that there was no self-immolation. It was the determinant factor. His advice allowed us to see better in the darkness.\\"Jones (2008:332–3) Chávez's detention Alleged resignation letter of Chávez In the early hours of 12 April, many demanded Chávez's resignation. With the loss of \\"almost all ... military force on hand in order to resist or move to another place\\", Chávez said that he would consider it to avoid a potential bloodbath if there were disturbances involving the crowds outside Miraflores.Bart Jones (2008:337) However, he declared that four conditions would have to be met, including that he be allowed to resign before the National Assembly, with power passing constitutionally to the Vice President prior to new elections, he and his family could go to Cuba and that he would be able to address the nation live on television.Harnecker, Marta. (Z Communications, 9 January 2003).\\"Lessons of the April Coup: Harnecker interviews Chávez\\". Retrieved 7 September 2010. But Vásquez and others would not agree to these conditions and dispatched two generals to arrest Chávez. At 3 a.m., with the coup plotters threatening to bomb the Miraflores palace if Chávez did not resign, Chávez phoned the head of the armed forces, General-in- Chief Lucas Rincón saying that he would do so; he in turn told him that the military leadership was divided on whether to oust him or not. Within twenty minutes Rincon had announced on television that Chávez had been asked for his resignation, and had accepted.Bart Jones (2008:338) A few minutes later, Chávez was told that the four conditions he had declared would no longer be accepted, and Chávez declared that he would surrender himself to the coup plotters as \\"president prisoner\\".Bart Jones (2008:338–9) Chávez later said that he told Rincón during their telephone call that he would \\"abandon\\" the presidency, after which he \\"left the palace to negotiate the terms under which he would do so\\", saying, \\"I am ready to go, but I demand respect for the constitution.\\"The Miami Herald, April 16, 2002 Tuesday FL EDITION, Venezuela's rebellion a bizarre mix of events, BYLINE: JUAN O. TAMAYO jtamayo@herald.com, SECTION: A; Pg. 1 At Miraflores, according to The Los Angeles Times, Chávez dispatched Rincón, his military chief of staff, to meet with the military officers at Fuerte Tiuna who were calling for him to step down. Rincón called Chávez from Fuerte Tiuna to say that the officers were \\"fighting among themselves\\" and insisting on his resignation. As The Chicago Tribune put it, \\"top military commanders\\", unable to countenance \\"the spectacle of a president making war on his own people\\", demanded that Chávez step down. Faced with this demand, Chávez \\"started working the phones\\" and also summoned a clergyman, Monsignor Baltazar Porras, to discuss \\"prayer and forgiveness\\", his purpose being \\"maybe as much to search his soul as to search for a way out of the crisis\\". Porras, whom Chávez had once reviled as one of the church's \\"devils in skirts\\", said that Chávez had \\"personally asked me for forgiveness for everything he had said about me\\". General Vásquez ordered several generals to go to Miraflores and arrest Chávez. Meanwhile, according to Newsday, \\"cabinet members and honor guards sat glumly in the hallway outside ... Chávez's suite\\", awaiting news. Shortly after midnight, Environment Minister Maria Elisa Osorio said, \\"The president is being forced to leave. There's a coup.\\" Faced with his officers' demand, Chávez refused to resign but agreed to \\"abandon his functions\\", a procedure that is provided for by Venezuelan law but that would need to be ratified by the National Assembly. There followed \\"hours of negotiations\\" in which the \\"key figure\\" was Armed Forces Commander Gen. Lucas Rincón Romero, who did not make clear at any point during the crisis where his loyalties lay. Early Friday morning, Rincón told the public, incorrectly, that Chávez had resigned. An hour and a half later, Carmona was named president of what was meant to be a transitional government. On Friday morning a \\"heavily guarded caravan\\" took Chávez, who was \\"wearing his trademark fatigues and red beret\\", from Miraflores to the army base at Fort Tiuna. At the base, Chávez was forced to take off the uniform and beret and dress in civilian garb. (The Miami Herald noted that armed-forces officers had long been irked by his habit of wearing a military uniform during his presidency.). Here he met with representatives of the Roman Catholic Church. \\"By midmorning on Friday\\", reported the Times, Chávez \\"looked to be finished\\". The military later maintained, according to The Guardian, \\"that the civil unrest forced them to ask Chávez for his resignation, which he gave verbally, asking to be flown to Cuba\\". The Cuban government was trying to arrange for him to go into exile in Cuba. Chávez's request to be allowed to go into exile in Cuba was soon rejected, however.

A15 Meanwhile, Rincón, \\"in full uniform\\", had announced on national television at about 2 a.m. that the president had resigned. Rincón denied that a coup was underway. Instead, Chávez would be taken to La Orchila, a military base off the coast of Venezuela, until rebel leaders could decide Chávez's fate. Whilst being held at Fort Tiuna, Chávez had access to television and saw the rolling television claims of his resignation, and became concerned that he would be killed (and the death made to look like suicide) in order to keep the narrative clear.Jones (2008:344) He was able to get word out that he had not in fact resigned, via a telephone call to his daughter, who, via switchboard operators at Miraflores still loyal to Chávez, was able to speak first to Fidel Castro and then to Cuban television.Bart Jones (2008):345 Letter of Chávez disclaiming his resignation After two young female military prosecutors interviewed Chávez at Fort Tiuna on Friday morning about the 11 April massacre. Chávez later described the young women as \\"valiant\\". In an interview with the two women from the military's legal department, Chávez reiterated that he had not resigned, and they faxed a copy of his statement to the Attorney General, Isaias Rodriguez. To make the news public on Venezuelan media, Rodriguez called a press conference, supposedly to announce his own resignation. Instead, on 12 April at 2 pm, he announced live on television that Chávez had never quit, and was being held illegally. Most of his statement was cut off, with Venezuelan networks returning to the studios.Bart Jones (2008):346–347 In the evening, Chávez was flown to the remote naval base of Turiamo, near Puerto Cabello, where he considered the risk of his own murder/assassination. According to Chávez, at one point an officer declared to another, \\"If you kill the president here we'll all kill one another.\\"Bart Jones (2008:354) On 13 April, with the critical support of top military officer Raúl Baduel, and with Chávez supporters having retaken Miraflores and the soldiers holding him now calling him \\"President\\", Chávez wrote a note from his captivity in Turiamo stating specifically that he had not resigned.Bart Jones (2008:359–60) Early on Friday, Carmona was sworn in as interim president. Carmona's interim presidency Businessman Pedro Carmona Estanga, president of Fedecámaras, was installed as interim President after Chávez's detention. Carmona, described by The Miami Herald as \\"president for a day\\" told the newspaper that his acceptance of that position was, in the Herald paraphrase, \\"as a spontaneous act of bravery, not the result of a monthslong conspiracy\\". \\"I was not involved in any conspiracy\\", Carmona said. \\"I cannot accept any conjecture or soap operas. I categorically deny it.\\" The Chicago Tribune said Carmona was \\"a buttoned-down businessman and economist who has degrees from Caracas' Andres Bello Catholic University and the University of Brussels\\" and who \\"has an international reputation, having represented Venezuelan commercial and diplomatic missions abroad\\".Chicago Tribune, April 13, 2002 Saturday, \\"New Venezuela leader installed; Latin American officials troubled by regime change\\", BYLINE: By Patrice M.

One condition imposed by the coup-makers was that the interim president would not be able to run for president in elections several months later, and those who really wanted the long-term position therefore took themselves out of the running for the interim post. Invited to be president by those who had deposed Chávez, Carmona had become nationally prominent as the leading figure in the previous December's general strike.The Washington Post, April 18, 2002 Thursday, \\"Chavez Regained Power While Plotters Bickered; Coup Was Not Planned, Ex-Leader Says\\", BYLINE: Scott Wilson, Washington Post Foreign Service, SECTION: A SECTION; p.

According to Venezuelan political analysts, Carmona was always a \\"moderate\\" and \\"conciliatory\\" figure, but in the years before the 2002 coup he \\"became more aggressive as Chávez did\\". Margarita Lopez Maya of the University of Central Venezuela said that as Carmona rose through the ranks of Fedecámaras, \\"he became more aggravated, a situation which got worse because the government was provoking everyone\\". Upon Carmona's taking office, Juan Calvo, a Venezuelan businessman, said, \\"He always surrounds himself with capable people, and I'm sure that's what he will do now.\\" Upon being sworn in, Carmona told supporters that \\"We must go about returning to the rule of law ...

In addition, he vowed that \\"justice would be done\\" for the survivors of those who had been massacred. Shortly after police confiscated scores of weapons from several Bolivarian Circles, including from a group at the Ministries of Health and Environment that was near Miraflores. One of the immediate changes Carmona made after his inauguration was to change his country's official name back to the Republic of Venezuela from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the name established by the 1999 Constitution. News of this change was greeted with loud cheers from coup supporters at Miraflores. Edgar Paredes, interim head of Petróleos de Venezuela, announced that Venezuela would no longer be selling oil to Cuba. Moreover, Carmona's government repealed the 49 laws passed the previous November that business leaders considered damaging to the economy. Meanwhile, pro-Chávez officers in the military were being removed from their positions or assigned to remote locations. Carmona then issued a decree, which came to be known as the Carmona Decree, dissolving the National Assembly and Supreme Court that were filled with Chávez supporters, and voiding the 1999 Constitution.Strategic Comments, \\"Venezuela's Political Tempests: Can Chávez Weather the Storm?\\", 8 no. 4, May 2002 The decree declared that new elections for a \\"National Legislative Power\\" would take place no later than December 2002, and that this would draft a general reform of the 1999 constitution; new \\"general national elections\\" would take place within a year of the decree's declaration.

The military members of the coalition were also displeased that Carmona did not consult them on military appointments.

And I had the courage to take that step.\\"The New York Times, April 19, 2002 Friday, \\"Venezuela's Leader for a Day Denies There Was a Rebellion\\", BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO, SECTION: Section A; Column 1; Foreign Desk; p. 8 He told The Guardian that he took \\"full responsibility\\" for the actions he made, emphasizing that \\"there was no premeditation, no conspiracy\\" behind the coup and his elevation to the presidency. He said that after the April 11 march on Miraflores, he had been phoned by someone (whom he would not name) who said that Chávez had quit and offered him the presidency. \\"Everything happened so fast that mistakes were made\\", Carmona said. \\"If I could go back in time, I would have had a triumvirate, the power would have been shared – but everything was so quick.\\" When asked if he had been \\"used by the military\\", he replied: \\"There might have been people who used me, you never know what is going on underground\\", but he insisted that he \\"acted purely in the higher interests of the country\\". One Western diplomat told The Miami Herald that during Carmona's brief presidency \\"everybody was saying what a great guy he was, professional, straight, ethical\\" but that after his ouster \\"everyone is pointing fingers at him for being a dope\\". Carmona himself told the Herald that he would remain a \\"civic activist\\" but would leave politics: \\"I have never been a politician; that is not my world\\", Carmona said. \\"As for Venezuela, we will continue the struggle.\\" In addition to Carmona's errors, his coalition partners made several missteps. The first was to refuse to let Chávez leave the country, as he asked, and in return for which he promised, on Thursday, to officially resign. This request was not honored because hard-line members of the coalition wanted to prosecute Chávez for the killings outside Miraflores. It was Chávez's refusal to resign – he described himself as \\"a prisoner president\\" – that ultimately split the anti-Chávez coalition. Also, the coup-makers were criticized for raiding the homes of some Chávez supporters, including Tarek William Saab, chairman of the congressional Foreign Relations Committee, and Ramón Rodríguez Chacín, Minister of the Interior and Justice. Pro-Chávez protests and restoration Chavista loyalists gathered outside of Miraflores Palace after hearing that Chávez had not resigned the presidency. Prompted by the spreading news that Chávez had not resigned, Carmona's installation as President generated an uprising by Bolivarian Circles in support of Chávez that was suppressed by the Metropolitan Police. It also led to a demonstration outside the Presidential Palace by hundreds of thousands of people. According to one commentator, \\"it was the poor from the peripheral barrios who returned Chávez to power.\\"Cannon (2004:295) With the palace surrounded by protestors, and with several hundred paratroopers still ensconced beneath the palace, their commander, José Baduel, telephoned Carmona to tell him that he too was as much a hostage as Chávez was, and gave him an ultimatum that he return Chávez alive within 24 hours.Kozloff (2007:30) Meanwhile, General Raúl Baduel, who headed Chávez's old paratrooper division in Maracay, had been trying unsuccessfully to make public his opposition to Carmona; however, Venezuelan media refused to interview him.Jones (2008:357) Baduel contacted the head of the Presidential Guard, which remained loyal to Chávez, and told him \\"it's now or never\\". Late in the morning of 13 April the Presidential Guard entered the palace from their barracks via tunnels, and retook the palace; many of the coup plotters escaped. Since Chávez was being held in a secret location, the presidency was assumed for several hours by Vice President Diosdado Cabello until Chávez was reinstated. After the retaking of Miraflores, the military coup plotters held a meeting in Fort Tiuna, and drafted a statement recognizing Carmona as President, but demanding the restoration of the country's democratic institutions. In the confusion of the meeting, Chávez ally Jorge García Carneiro crossed out the section recognising Carmona; and it was in this form that the statement was read to CNN (since no Venezuelan media would broadcast it).Bart Jones (2008:358) After the coup, Carmona was placed under house arrest, but was able to gain asylum in the Colombian embassy after an anti- Chávez protest drew away his security detail. Whilst Chávez was temporarily removed from office, the Caracas Stock Exchange saw liquid stocks reach record levels, with the index growing nearly 1000 points in a single trading session. When it became clear the coup had failed, the index fell again.Javier Santiso, Latin America’s Political Economy of the Possible: Beyond Good Revolutionaries and Free Marketeers, MIT Press 2006, p.195 Media role With the increasing disapproval of Chávez in 2001 and constant confrontations with him, the Venezuelan media, which initially approved and supported Chávez, turned against him, which then accelerated his loss of popularity. The constantly growing interruptions Chávez's government made on television with their cadenas that they saw as \\"an overt attempt to block the independent news coverage of the strike\\", media organizations agreed on 9 April to create a split screen effect for cadenas that did not involve the president, only allowing full coverage for the president out of courtesy for him. A few hours after the meeting, the first split screen cadena coverage occurred while covering a speech by the labor minister. The media organizations also felt pressure from the government since DISIP and National Guard units were seen and posted near their communication towers, planning to cut transmissions of the media. At a 10 April meeting involving media representatives, Vice President Diosdado Cabello and Minister of Defense Rangel, the Venezuelan government blamed the media for the anti-government demonstrations, with Cabello stating the media would be \\"responsible for the blood that will be shed\\"; Globovision's president rejected this, saying the Venezuelan government had called on Chávez supporters to confront opposition marches near Miraflores. The use of the split screen for the cadena had also been criticized by Rangel though the media owners said that the effect would continue to be implemented. On 11 April, the anti-government march, the message \\"remove Chávez\\", and the call to redirect the march to the presidential palace in Miraflores, were \\"widely announced, promoted, and covered by privately owned television channels, and whose explicit support for the opposition became evident.\\"Dinges, John. Columbia Journalism Review (July 2005). \\"Soul Search\\", Vol. 44 Issue 2, July–August 2005, pp52–8 At the beginning of the coup, Venezolana de Televisión (VTV), the state television channel, had its workers leave in droves, fearing for their lives since they believed they were targets like in the bloody takeover during the 1992 coup led by Chávez. Then opposition-controlled police allegedly shut down VTV whilst police efforts were made to shut down community radio and television stations.Bart Jones (2008:356) As a result, the news that Chávez had not in fact resigned was largely kept out of the Venezuelan media, and spread by word of mouth; only one Catholic radio network continued to broadcast the developing news. Chávez was able to get word out that he had not in fact resigned, via a telephone call to his daughter, who, via switchboard operators at Miraflores still loyal to Chávez, was able to speak first to Fidel Castro and then to Cuban television. The Attorney-General attempted to make public Chávez's non-resignation via a live press conference supposedly to announce his own resignation; most of his statement was cut off, with Venezuelan networks returning to the studios. At 3:45 pm Chávez called for another cadena, though it was possibly prerecorded in order to distract Venezuelans since government officials reported that Chávez was speaking to them during the broadcast. Broadcasting from an underground location in the palace grounds, Chávez appeared unaware of the violence that was occurring outside and \\"disconnected from reality\\", speaking for ninety minutes on the successes of his administration and calling for peace. With the networks concerned that history was in the making and that Chávez was attempting to block a government massacre, half an hour into the cadena the networks decided to split the screen again, showing the violence outside the palace, with the audio from the cadena appearing disrupted. The video also appeared pre-recorded when Chávez called for the networks to be disconnected due to actions performed on 9 April and not the present day. Shortly after Chávez ordered the networks taken off the air, they were disconnected, with Chávez saying that networks are licensed by the state, but \\"they can't use that right to attack the state itself, to instigate violence, or, knowing there is an insurrectional plan, support it...\\"Jones (2008:324–5) However, a single engineer tricked DISIP and National Guard members into thinking he cut all transmission, though the networks continued to broadcast via satellite to cable, satellite and through other outlets. Controversially, private television stations were able to share a video of pro-government chavistas allegedly firing at protesters. Although who was responsible for the deaths remains unclear (see below), and that video evidence later emerged indicated that the gunmen were possibly firing back at police in self-defense, the media aired the footage \\"non-stop\\" as part of an anti-Chávez campaign. The footage served as a \\"bombshell\\" that triggered greater military participation in the coup. A steady stream of ads asked Venezuelans to participate in the insurrection. RCTV had also sent its reporters to quiet parts of town for \\"live shots of tranquility\\" and allegedly ignored the events. On 13 April, the media met with Carmona at Miraflores and denounced his decision to dissolve the National Assembly and arrest supporters of Chávez. Such opposition to Carmona's moves resulted in his Minister of Defense, Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez, stating that the media was \\"opposed\\" to Carmona's interim government. Carmona's Minister of Defense also called on the media to stop reporting the violence so it would not provoke more violent actions. The head of Globovision reportedly called to CNN in Atlanta \\"to request the U.S. network join the blackout.\\" Venezuelan television media failed to broadcast news of Chávez supporters retaking of the Miraflores palace; the four major television networks stopped providing news reports altogether. The St. Petersburg Times reported that \\"RCTV was showing Walt Disney cartoons. Venevisión ran a daylong marathon of Hollywood movies: Lorenzo's Oil, Nell and Pretty Woman. Another station, Televen, told its viewers 'to stay indoors,' treating them to baseball and soap operas. Globovisión, the country's top 24-hour news station and CNN affiliate, spent much of the day rebroadcasting upbeat footage of Chávez's ouster. An announcer repeatedly cautioned viewers, 'We are living in times of political change'\\" while also urging viewers to remain \\"prudent\\" and not to spread \\"false alarms\\" or \\"rumors\\". According to the media, such actions were performed for safety reasons since there were threats against the media organizations. Two of the three major newspapers El Universal and El Nacional cancelled their Sunday editions, for safety reasons. The third major newspaper, Últimas Noticias, printed a limited Sunday edition accurately reflecting events; some tabloids and regional television stations also covered the news. Chávez supporters on 13 April were also creating an intimidating atmosphere, attacking the offices of RCTV, breaking windows and shouting \\"The palace is in our hands, why aren't you showing that?\\" When CNN announced the rebellion against the coup of a key military division in Maracay (commanded by General Raúl Baduel), \\"CNN expressed amazement that the press were saying nothing.\\" After Chávez loyalist forces had re-taken Miraflores, the military coup plotters drafted a statement demanding the restoration of democracy; it had to be read to CNN studios since no Venezuelan media would broadcast it. Only by 8 o'clock on 13 April was the reinstalled government able to inform the people of the situation, via state television channels. On 18 April, Globovision president Alberto Ravell \\"asked for forgiveness 'from any viewer who feels we failed them that day'\\", further stating that \\"Sacrificing our credibility ... and freedom of expression, we decided not to broadcast images of violence and looting.\\". Aftermath Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in 2005 By the time the Organization of American States' (OAS) Permanent Council met on 13 April, the coup was effectively over, and on 14 April the United States joined with other OAS members in condemning the coup and sending the OAS Secretary General on a fact-finding and diplomatic mission. The OAS subsequently established a \\"mesa\\" dialogue process, as it had in Peru following the May 2000 elections. At Chávez's request, the Carter Center and UNDP were also involved.Andrew F. Cooper, and Thomas Legler (2005), \\"A Tale of Two Mesas: The OAS Defense of Democracy in Peru and Venezuela,\\" Global Governance 11(4) In order to facilitate participation in this process, the anti-Chávez opposition created the Coordinadora Democrática (CD).\\"the creation of the Coordinadora Democratica, on 5 July 2002, from a very fractious, heterogeneous opposition, was prompted in large part by the perceived need to have a single voice when dealing with the Carter Center and the OAS.\\" (Cooper and Legler 2005) However, the Coordinadora Democrática continued to pursue non-electoral means to overthrow the government, and was involved in organising the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03. After the February 2003 collapse of that strike, the CD was much more willing to engage with the mesa process, and pushed for a binding recall referendum under Article 72 of the Constitution of Venezuela, which was ultimately agreed on 23 May 2003.OAS, Agreement Between the Representatives of the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Political and Social Groups Supporting It, and the Coordinadora Democratica and the Political and Civil Society Organizations Supporting It, Caracas, 23 May 2003. Ultimately the CD rejected the outcome of the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum, which saw 59% of the vote for Chávez, despite the OAS and Carter Center's authentication of the result. Reactions Domestic Early on the morning after the coup, opponents of Chávez filled the streets of Caracas, \\"honking horns and waving the gold, blue and red of the Venezuelan flag\\", according to The New York Times. A headline in El Universal read \\"It's over!\\" Oscar Garcia Mendoza, president of the major bank Venezolano de Creditor, ran a \\"gigantic newspaper ad\\" celebrating Chávez's ouster, which, he wrote, would \\"substantially improve Venezuelan society\\".Newsday (New York), April 16, 2002 Tuesday NASSAU AND SUFFOLK EDITION, \\"Simmer Below Surface; Chavez return roils middle, upper class\\", BYLINE: By Letta Tayler; LATIN AMERICA CORRESPONDENT, SECTION: NEWS, p.

Protesters cut the mission's utility cables, slashed tires, and smashed the windshields of three cars with diplomatic plates. Although the Cuban ambassador told a Venezuelan official that he was not sheltering any Venezuelans, he would not allow the building to be searched. International A Rio Group meeting of Latin American governments in Costa Rica taking place soon after the coup adopted a resolution condemning the \\"interruption of constitutional order in Venezuela\\", and requesting a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS); only Francisco Flores of El Salvador said that he would recognise the Carmona government.Parish, Randall, Peceny, Mark and Delacour, Justin(2007), \\"Venezuela and the Collective Defence of Democracy Regime in the Americas\\", Democratization, 14: 2, 207 – 231, pp218–219 The United States government blamed the events on the actions of the Chávez government and said Chávez had resigned the presidency, dismissed his cabinet, and that security forces under his command had fired upon unarmed protesters.http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2002/9316.htm Upon news of Chávez's return, Condoleezza Rice, National Security Advisor to US President George W.

The Guardian. Retrieved 20 July 2006. Bush denied any involvement of the US government in the coup attempt and asked Chávez to \\"learn a lesson\\" from it. Cuban president Fidel Castro later confirmed that after the coup his government had \\"contacted the ambassadors of 21 countries in an attempt to get a plane to Venezuela to rescue Chávez.\\" In Chile, newspapers circulated information soon after the coup attempt showing the Chilean government's \\"discomfort\\" with Chávez returning to power, with President Ricardo Lagos holding Chávez accountable for the political crisis in Venezuela. President Lagos later clarified that his statements were to tell Venezuela to avoid polarization and the Chile opposes the \\"interruption of institutional order\\". Organizations Don MacKay of the Canadian Foundation of the Americas was troubled by the coup, saying: \\"This is the first time in a decade the military has stepped into power in Latin America. It is very troubling. ... This will be a test case to see whether the OAS's democracy clause has any teeth.\\" Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Felipe Pérez Roque said that in the eyes of his country Chávez was still president, and Cuba's Communist Party daily, Granma, wrote that Chávez had been \\"overthrown in a conspiracy by the country's wealthy classes, corrupt politicians and the news media\\". On 13 April, the editors of The New York Times applauded what they incorrectly described as Chávez's resignation, calling him a \\"ruinous demagogue\\" and cheering the fact that \\"Venezuelan democracy [was] no longer threatened by a would-be dictator\\". The Times editors also wrote admiringly of the installation of Carmona as president, describing him as a \\"respected business leader\\".\\"Hugo Chávez Departs\\", Published: April 13, 2002, The New York Times, EDITORIAL, URL: Furthermore, the Times congratulated the U.S. government for its wisdom in \\"never [having] publicly demonized Mr. Chávez, denying him the role of nationalist martyr\\", and in staying out of the coup, which the Times characterized as \\"a purely Venezuelan affair\\".  US role and alleged involvement  Statements of President Chávez over a potential coup involvement of the United States are varied. Shortly before the coup attempt, Chávez dismissed possible hostility from the United States, since \\"times had changed\\". After the coup, however, Chávez asserted numerous times that United States government officials knew about plans for a coup, approved of them, and assumed they would be successful,Observer International, 2002, 'Venezuela coup linked to Bush team'. Retrieved 22 September 2007 alleging that \\"two military officers from the United States\\" were present in the headquarters of coup plotters.BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/1985670.stm \\"Warning to Venezuelan leader\\". Retrieved 22 September 2007 Chávez would also state after the coup that there was \\"little evidence\\" that the United States orchestrated the plan. Rear Admiral Carlos Molina, a central leader of the coup, later said that \\"We felt we were acting with US support ... we agree that we can’t permit a communist government here. The US has not let us down yet.\\"Wilson, Scott, \\"Clash of visions pushed Venezuela toward coup\\", The Washington Post, 21 April 2002, cited in Avilés, William (2009), \\"Policy Coalitions, Economic Reform and Military Power in Ecuador and Venezuela\\", Third World Quarterly, 30: 8, 1549–1564 However, the United States repeatedly informed the Venezuelan opposition that they would not be supported if there were a coup, warned the Chávez government of the plot and following the coup attempt, President George W. Bush denied the United States' involvement. The United States learned of details about a potential coup in late-2001 due to the nature Venezuelan individuals openly plotting to overthrow President Chávez. In March 2002 only days after United States Ambassador to Venezuela Charles Shapiro began his duties in Venezuela and just weeks before the coup attempt, Shapiro met with a trade union organization. During this meeting the group openly shared their desire to be part of the coup, with Ambassador Shapiro informing them that the United States would not support such actions and that governmental change should only occur electorally. On 27 April 2002, Chairman Cass Ballenger and Congressman Bill Delahunt of the United States also met with Venezuelan media heads of Venevisión, Globovisión, Unión Radio, El Nacional, Últimas Noticias and El Mundo, telling them that \\"the U.S. was opposed to any disruption of constitutional government and would condemn any coup, open or disguised, aimed at ousting Chávez\\". At a meeting soon after the coup between Ambassador Shapiro and then Venezuelan Vice President José Vicente Rangel at the Vice President's home, Rangel also stated to Shapiro that \\"no one in the upper echelons of the Venezuelan government really believed that the United States was involved in the attempted overthrow\\" and that if the Venezuelan government did believe so, \\"the two men wouldn't have been sitting in Rangel’s house\\". However, unlike much of Latin America, the US refused to condemn the coup, changing its position only after a popular uprising led Carmona to resign. The British daily The Guardian was told in April 2002 by Wayne Madsen, a conspiracy theorist and blogger, that his country's navy had lent assistance to coup organizers by providing them with intelligence from its vessels in the Caribbean. Its sister paper, The Observer, established that the coup was \\"tied to senior officials in the US government\\" after receiving information from OAS officials that the US was not only aware of the coup, but also gave sanction to its organizers. The paper names Elliot Abrams, who had been convicted of deceiving Congress during the Iran Contra Affair, as being the one who greenlit the coup. In December 2004, The New York Times reported on the release of newly declassified intelligence documents that showed that the CIA and Bush administration officials had advance knowledge of an imminent plot to oust President Chávez,Forero, Juan (3 December 2004). \\"Documents Show C.I.A. Knew of a Coup Plot in Venezuela\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 15 May 2014. although the same documents do not indicate the United States supported the plot. According to Chávez activist and author Eva Golinger in her 2006 book The Chávez Code, on 5 March 2002, the US Embassy cabled Washington to report that Fedecámaras, the CTV, and the Catholic Church had reached an agreement named \\"Bases for a Democratic Accord\\", which the cable described as \\"ten principles on which to guide a transitional government\\".Eva Golinger (2007), The Chávez Code, Pluto Press. p62 An Embassy official, commenting in the cable, said of the accord \\"another piece falls into place... This accord... may well form the frame of reference and code of conduct for a transitional government.\\"Golinger (2007:63) Also in March 2002, the CIA was briefing US officials that a coup might be planned, and on 6 April it issued another brief saying efforts to mount a coup were possibly being stepped up.Jones (2008:314) The 6 April brief noted that \\"To provoke military action, the plotters may try to exploit unrest stemming from opposition demonstrations slated for later this month or ongoing strikes at the state-owned oil company PDVSA.\\"Golinger (2007:65) The United States embassy in Venezuela then allegedly informed Chávez of a possible coup, though Chávez ignored their warnings. The New York Times notes that the documents used by Golinger do not show direct involvement of the U.S. government in the coup attempt; instead, they show that U.S. officials issued \\"repeated warnings that the United States will not support any extraconstitutional moves to oust Chávez,\\" whilst nonetheless talking only \\"broadly\\" to Mr. Chávez about opposition plans, and \\"provid[ing] few hard details of the looming plot\\". The documents were obtained, through Freedom of Information Act requests, and released by Eva Golinger \\"as part of an offensive by pro-Chávez activists to show that the United States government has, at least tacitly, supported the opposition's unconstitutional efforts to remove the president\\". In addition to the CIA documents, The New York Times reported that Golinger also obtained \\"reams of documents from the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit agency financed by the United States government, that show that $2.2 million was spent from 2000 to 2003 to train or finance anti-Chávez parties and organizations\\". Bush Administration officials acknowledged meeting with some of the planners of the coup in the several weeks prior to 11 April but have strongly denied encouraging the coup itself, saying that they insisted on constitutional means.BBC, 16 April 2002, US denies backing Chavez plotters However, the purpose of the meetings was not clarified, and it is also not known why US officials and the Venezuelan opposition broached the subject of a coup months before the attempted ousting took place. In addition, The New York Times quotes an anonymous Defense Department official in charge of developing policy towards Venezuela as saying that, \\"We were not discouraging people. ... We were sending informal, subtle signals that we don't like this guy. We didn't say, 'No, don't you dare, though he denied the Defense Department offered material help, such as weaponry. Because of the allegations, an investigation conducted by the US Inspector General, at the request of US Senator Christopher Dodd, requested a review of American activities leading up to and during the coup attempt. The OIG report found no \\"wrongdoing\\" by US officials either in the State Department or in the Embassy, and concluded that \\"While it is clear that NED’s, DOD’s, and other U.S. assistance programs provided training, institution building, and other support to organizations and individuals understood to be actively involved in the events of April 11–14, we found no evidence that this support directly contributed, or was intended to contribute, to those events.

The majority of the violence that took place on 11 April 2002 was near the Llaguno Overpass. There is no consensus as to who was responsible for the deaths on that day, and this remains a very controversial issue. The opposition version of events puts the blame on Chávez, or at least on his supporters. Many groups of the Bolivarian Circles gathered near the Llagano Overpass before the march reached the area. A Venevisión camera positioned on a rooftop that afternoon captured images of people using handguns to shoot from the pro-Chávez counter-march being held on the Llagano Overpass, an overpass that crosses one of central Caracas's busiest avenues; it is unclear who they are shooting at, but the opposition narrative is that they were shooting at the opposition march and responsible for the deaths. Supporters of Chávez have alleged that the opposition conspired to cause casualties during the incident with Chávez allies such as Jorge García Carneiro and Lucas Rincón Romero claiming thatJones (2008:335) CNN correspondent Otto Neustald said that on the morning of 11 April he recorded a video message from a number of high-ranking military officers, led by Vice Admiral Héctor Ramírez, which was broadcast later in the day. The message held Chávez responsible for massacring innocent people using snipers, referring to at least six dead and dozens wounded.Jones (2008:326–7)Special Broadcasting Service, 11 November 2002, Venezuela – Anatomy of a Coup, Journeyman Pictures According to Neustald, the message was recorded at least two hours before the killings started. However, this claim has never been proven and is contested by the rest of the reporters present, such as Javier Ignacio Mayorca, Mayela León and Adrián Criscaut, who affirmed that the military officers were informed of the death of Tortoza during the filming of the message. The Chavista gunmen that were seen shooting off the bridge argue that they were, in fact, returning fire at unknown snipers and Metropolitan Police firing towards them. There are reports that claim seven were arrested at the Hotel Ausonia and that they were later freed in the chaos of the coup while there was also empty shells found at the Hotel Edén.Bart Jones (2008), Hugo!, p. 329 According to Chávez supporter Gregory Wilpert, video and audio recordings were allegedly provided at the trial of Metropolitan Police leaders which suggested plainclothes police had infiltrated the La Nacional building and were allegedly sniping on the opposition marchers and police below. The La Nacional building housed the offices of pro-Chávez mayor Freddy Bernal. Bernal, a Chávez supporter and former leader of an elite police force, was accused by a Venezuelan military officer of complying with orders from the Defense Ministry to shoot opposition demonstrators. It was also reported that the National Guard, which was firing tear gas and combatting the opposition protesters, did not pay any attention to the gunmen on the La Nacional building and that it was the Metropolitan Police who had attempted to go to the building. Bernal dismissed the allegations as \\"totally false\\". The 2003 documentary titled The Revolution Will Not Be Televised contradicts claims by private media in Venezuela that the pro-Chávez group was firing on the opposition protest from Llagano Bridge. In the documentary, footage captured from another angle by an amateur cameraman shows pro-Chávez gunmen firing over an empty street with no apparent opposition protesters below. Further, the film makers claim that the opposition march never went down that street. While this documentary has been criticized by another called X-Ray of a Lie and American academic Brian Nelson, who argue that the footage is manipulated and obscures Metropolitan Police on the street below, it's not clear whether this is relevant to the veracity of the claim that pro-Chávez gunmen were not firing on opposition protesters from the bridge. The 2004 documentary Puente Llaguno: Claves de una Masacre claimed that the Chavistas on the bridge did not begin shooting until 4:38 pm, by which time most of the opposition deaths had already occurred. Some of the victims, both opposition and Chavistas, were claimed to be shot in locations not reachable from the bridge, being around corners from the main streetBart Jones (2008), Hugo!, p. 328. with an eyewitness with military experience, who was shot himself, reported most victims being killed with precise head shots.Bart Jones (2008), Hugo!, pp. 323–324. In addition, most of the opposition deaths were at least 300 yards away from the bridge, supposedly too far to be killed by the Chavistas' pistols with the precise head shots witnessed. According to Nelson, such claims are false showing that opposition demonstrator Jesús Arellano was killed just before 2:30 pm, with photos showing Chavistas further up the street brandishing firearms and closer than purported by the earlier sources. Within the next 15 minutes, two other opposition demonstrators were shot at 2:45 and 4:30 pm, the Metropolitan Police responded to the Chavista gunfire by going between the marchers and the Chavistas. The Chavistas responded to the Metropolitan Police by moving further up the street and at around 4:35 pm, began firing down from Llagano Bridge onto Baralt Avenue below. Police responded to the Chavista gunfire, with one Chavista who was laying on the bridge being shot in the face, with his body positioning of lying down and facing the Metropolitan Police below possibly resulting in the headshot. Ricochets were also possible from Chavistas ranks firing through the spokes of the railing on the bridge. After 5:30 pm when most of the gunfire concluded, the filmmakers of The Revolution Will Not Be Televised used manipulated footage, according to Nelson, in order to show an empty Baralt Avenue that Chavistas were overlooking. A vehicle used by the Metropolitan Police later showed that approximately 600 bullets impacted the vehicle's side that was facing north toward the Puente Llaguno bridge. Criminal investigation The people filmed shooting from the Puente Llaguno bridge were initially identified as being pro-Chávez political activists Rafael Cabrices, Richard Peñalver, Henry Atencio, and Nicolás Rivera. They were captured by the police and jailed for one year as they awaited trial, but charges were dropped before the trial began. Rafael Cabrices died from a heart attack three years later, in August 2005. Under the 1999 Constitution, military officers are entitled to a pre-trial hearing before the Plenary of the Supreme Court of Justice to rule on whether they should be charged with a crime. In such a hearing on 14 August 2002, the Tribunal ruled by an 11–9 margin (with two justices recused) that four high- ranking military officers charged with rebellion should not stand trial, arguing that what took place was not a \\"coup\\" but a \\"vacuum of power\\" that had been generated by the announcement of Chávez's resignation made by Gen. Lucas Rincón Romero.Sentencia de los Militares . Retrieved 17 November 2005. After Chávez allegedly took over of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice and filled it with his supporters, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, however, ruled on 12 March 2004 that the recusals were unconstitutional, making the hearing invalid and which meant that the military officers (by then retired) should stand trial.. After a trial that had begun back in March 2006 which had seen \\"265 expert testimonies, 5,700 photos, 20 videos and 198 witnesses\\", in April 2009, the ten Metropolitan Police officers were convicted of crimes leading to the deaths of three demonstrators back on 11 April 2002. Six of them, charged with homicide, were sentenced to 30 years each in prison. Only one officer was found \\"not guilty\\".Venezuelanalysis.com, 6 April 2009,Nine Police Found Guilty of April 2002 Venezuelan Coup Deaths Former President of the Supreme Court (TSJ), Eladio Aponte Aponte, who fled Venezuela in 2012 after the Venezuelan government accused him of alleged ties to drug trafficking and removed him from his post, reportedly told U.S. authorities that he was personally ordered by President Chávez to use the full weight of the court to condemn the officers. On 18 November 2004, a leading state prosecutor Danilo Anderson was assassinated shortly before he was scheduled to bring charges against individuals for their alleged participation in the coup. The Venezuelan government claimed individuals from Florida planned the assassination, though other reports suggested that Anderson and others were involved in an extortion racket. Meanwhile, Carmona and several other participants went into exile. In December 2007, Chávez issued a pardon covering more than 60 people who had drafted or signed the Carmona Decree.USA Today, 31 December 2007, Chavez pardons accused coup backers Media Analysis Before the coup, the relationship between Chávez's government and the media were in dispute over press freedom, with the Venezuelan government threatening to revoke licenses of media organizations.David Adams and Phil Gunson, St. Petersburg Times, 18 April 2002, Media accused in failed coup Venezuelan media officials stated that the majority of the media supported Chávez and the change he promised when originally elected in 1998, but after they reported the \\"negative realities\\" occurring in Venezuela, the Venezuelan government began to portray the media as an enemy. After Chávez removed many of the traditional political elements that were barriers to his power, the Venezuelan media, like other forms of media in Latin America, began to criticize the government. In 2001 and 2002, relations between the media and Chávez deteriorated quickly. The Chávez-controlled Supreme Court ruled in June 2001 that the media could be held accountable for \\"half-truths\\", a ruling which Chávez used to threaten media organizations by saying he would be revoking their licenses. As conformations began to grow, both parties became more biased, with media owners down to reporters feeling threatened with Chávez even calling out individual journalists by name in speeches. By January 2002, Chávez supporters were attacking independent reporters, with the headquarters of El Universal assaulted by hundreds of Chavistas, Globovision reporters attacked while they were attempting to record Aló Presidente and a bomb attack on newspaper Así Es la Noticia. As a result of being \\"besieged\\" by Chávez, the media lost its perspective and began to increase its political involvement assisting the opposition. According to Le Monde diplomatique, mainstream Venezuelan media outlets such as El Universal, El Nacional, El Nuevo País, Globovisión, Televen, CMT and RCTV supported the coup and anti- government demonstrations, accusing the media of only disseminating the anti- Chávez point of view in the news reports of international media agencies and organizations.Maurice Lemoine, Le Monde Diplomatique, August 2002, (French)\\"Coups d'Etat sans frontière\\", (Portuguese)\\"Golpes Sem Fronteiras\\".Castillo, Antonio. \\"Breaking Democracy: Venezuela's Media Coup\\" [online]. Media International Australia, Incorporating Culture & Policy, No. 108, August 2003: 145–156. Availability: . [cited 10 May 12]. Following the coup attempt, the Venezuelan media was blamed as being a major contributor to the unrest in Venezuela with one Foreign Policy article, supporting the statements by Le Monde diplomatique about the media's involvement, stating, \\"Never in the history of Latin America had the media played quite so prominent a role in facilitating the overthrow of a democratically elected government,\\" noting that \\"the majority of private outlets in Venezuela were owned by wealthy families with an interest in ousting Chávez.\\" Senior Research Fellow for the leftist thinktank Council on Hemispheric Affairs and Chávez supporter Nikolas Kozloff wrote that Venevisión owner Gustavo Cisneros was \\"widely reported\\" to have bankrolled the coup and that he had hosted the coup plotters, including Carmona, at both his mansion and network offices, supposedly leading Newsweek to place Cisneros \\"at the vortex of the whole mess.\\"Kozloff (2007:68) Opposition legislator Pedro Pablo Alcántara later said of Carmona's regime, \\"This government was put together at Gustavo Cisneros' office.\\" Such allegations of Venezuelan media owners' active involvement in the coup has never been proven, but the media's actions in supporting the anti-Chávez movements hurt its credibility in the future. Media outlets denied allegations of any political bias or involvement, stating that coverage was impeded by the confusion of the coup. This included the confusion from rumors such as \\"Chávez had resigned, been arrested, was fleeing to Cuba, that the military had revolted, that the military high command had resigned\\" as well as the violent targeting of media personnel that left six cameramen shot, with one of those mortally wounded. Media outlets that both opposed and supported Chávez reported difficulties in reporting due to the potential danger their reporters faced, stating that journalists were afraid to cover pro-Chávez demonstrations since the media was targeted. Venevison reported that only 5 of 18 reporters went out to cover events during the coup while a newspaper considered pro-Chávez stated that they had to remove their logo from cars so they would not be attacked by Chávez supporters. It was also reported that the Chávez supporting Bolivarian Circles surrounded media buildings which prevented their reporters from leaving the area. According to a declassified document from the United States State Department, then-Congressmen Cass Ballenger and William Delahunt met with five media outlet owners and presidents following the coup attempt to encourage the media \\"to contribute to a climate that would make possible the dialogue and reconciliation that President Chávez has called for.\\" The media owners and presidents, who admitted there may have been mistakes during the coup attempt, said \\"the media is democratic\\" and was opposed to any coup. The media officials also stated that they were attempting to give Chávez a second chance but remained skeptical, noting his 14 April speeches after returning to power where he admitted errors and asked for forgiveness, but later gave a \\"fiery speech\\" where he said to his supporters that those responsible for the coup attempt, including the media, \\"must pay\\". Media changes Annual World Press Freedom Index rankings of Venezuela from Reporters Without Borders. Source: Reporters Without Borders Chávez said after his reinstatement as president, \\"This coup d'etat would not have been possible without the help of the news media, especially television\\", and began a campaign to establish a \\"media hegemony\\" to prevent similar media conduct from happening in the future. To do so, Chávez used a \\"two-pronged strategy\\" in which his government strengthened its own media and \\"closed, browbeaten or infiltrated almost every independent outlet\\". In 2004, the Law on Social Responsibility in Radio and Television was passed, allowing the government to censor media in order to \\"promote social justice and further the development of the citizenry, democracy, peace, human rights, education, culture, public health, and the nation’s social and economic development\\". The law, which was extended to the Internet and social media in 2010, requires media companies to \\"establish mechanisms to restrict, without delay, the dissemination of messages.\\" Violators can be fined up to US$3,000 or 10 percent of one's yearly income, or face suspension of service, while journalists can be arrested with vague charges, including \\"conspiracy against the state\\" for criticizing the government. In 2007, Chávez revoked the license of leading anti-government broadcaster RCTV, and other stations began toning down dissent to avoid a similar fate. In 2009, 34 radio stations were closed for \\"technical and administrative reasons\\". By the time of Chávez's death in 2013, he left a transformed media atmosphere in Venezuela with the media organizations that opposed him being silenced and an expanding state media as a result. Media workers face legal barriers, defamation lawsuits from Venezuelan officials or are targets of violence.

Fota House Orangery, Fota Island, Ireland Orangerieschloss built by Frederick William IV of Prussia in Potsdam in the mid-19th century. The orangerie of the Royal Castle of Laeken, Belgium (ca.1820), is the oldest part of the monumental Royal Greenhouses of Laeken. An orangery or orangerie was a room or a dedicated building on the grounds of fashionable residences from the 17th to the 19th centuries where orange and other fruit trees were protected during the winter, as a very large form of greenhouse or conservatory.Gervase Markham, in The Whole Art of Husbandry (London 1631) also recommends protecting other delicate fruiting trees— \\"Orange, Lemon, Pomegranate, Cynamon, Olive, Almond\\"— in \\"some low vaulted gallerie adjoining upon the Garden\\". The orangery provided a luxurious extension of the normal range and season of woody plants, extending the protection which had long been afforded by the warmth offered from a masonry fruit wall.Billie S. Britz, \\"Environmental Provisions for Plants in Seventeenth-Century Northern Europe\\" The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 33.2 (May 1974:133–144) p 133. A century after the use for orange and lime trees had been established, other varieties of tender plants, shrubs and exotic plants also came to be housed in the orangery, which often gained a stove for the upkeep of these delicate plants in the cold winters of northern Europe. As imported citrus fruit, pineapples, and other tender fruit became generally available and much cheaper, orangeries were used more for tender ornamental plants. The orangery originated from the Renaissance gardens of Italy, when glass-making technology enabled sufficient expanses of clear glass to be produced. In the north, the Dutch led the way in developing expanses of window glass in orangeries, although the engravings illustrating Dutch manuals showed solid roofs, whether beamed or vaulted, and in providing stove heat rather than open fires.Britz 1974:134f This soon created a situation where orangeries became symbols of status among the wealthy. The glazed roof, which afforded sunlight to plants that were not dormant, was a development of the early 19th century. The orangery at Dyrham Park, Gloucestershire, which had been provided with a slate roof as originally built about 1702,Its columned exterior relates it to the architecture of the house, a feature of orangeries although not of their modern descendants, greenhouses. was given a glazed one about a hundred years later, after Humphrey Repton remarked that it was dark; although it was built to shelter oranges, it has always simply been called the \\"greenhouse\\" in modern times.Graham Stuart Thomas, \\"Orangeries in the National Trust\\", Quarterly Newslette of the Garden History Society, 1967:25. The 1617 Orangerie (now Musée de l'Orangerie) at the Palace of the Louvre inspired imitations that culminated in Europe's largest orangery, the Versailles Orangerie. Designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart for Louis XIV's 3,000 orange trees at Versailles, its dimensions of were not eclipsed until the development of the modern greenhouse in the 1840s, and were quickly overshadowed by the glass architecture of Joseph Paxton. Notable for his 1851 design of the Crystal Palace, his \\"great conservatory\\" at Chatsworth House was an orangery and glass house of monumental proportions. The orangery, however, was not just a greenhouse but a symbol of prestige and wealth and a garden feature, in the same way as a summerhouse, folly, or \\"Grecian temple\\". Owners would conduct their guests there on tours of the garden to admire not only the fruits within but also the architecture outside. Often the orangery would contain fountains, grottos, and an area in which to entertain in inclement weather. Earliest examples Versailles Orangerie built between 1684 and 1686. As early as 1545, an orangery was built in Padua, Italy. The first orangeries were practical and not as ornamental as they later became. Most had no heating other than open fires. In England, John Parkinson introduced the orangery to the readers of his Paradisus in Sole (1628), under the heading \\"Oranges\\". The trees might be planted against a brick wall and enclosed in winter with a plank shed covered with \\"cerecloth\\", a waxed precursor of tarpaulin, which must have been thought handsomer than the alternative: > For that purpose, some keepe them in great square boxes, and lift them to > and fro by iron hooks on the sides, or cause them to be rowled by trundels, > or small wheeles under them, to place them in a house or close gallery.Such > precaution against a sheltering south-facing wall was arranged by the > architect Salomon de Caus at Heidelberg about 1619, with removable shutters > on an unobtrusive permanent frame, according to Britz 1974:134. The building of orangeries became most widely fashionable after the end of the Eighty Years' War in 1648. The countries that started this trend were France, Germany, and the Netherlands, these countries being the ones that saw merchants begin importing large numbers of orange trees, banana plants, and pomegranates to cultivate for their beauty and scent. Construction materials Roof lantern at Meuselwitz Orangery, Meuselwitz, Germany Orangeries were generally built facing south to take advantage of the maximum possible light, and were constructed using brick or stone bases, brick or stone pillars, and a corbel gutter. They also featured large, tall windows to maximise available sunlight in the afternoons, with the north facing walls built without windows in a very heavy solid brick, or occasionally with much smaller windows to be able to keep the rooms warm. Insulation at these times was one of the biggest concerns for the building of these orangeries, straw became the main material used, and many had wooden shutters fitted to keep in the warmth. An early example of the type of construction can be seen at Kensington Palace, which also featured underfloor heating.http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington-gardens/facilities-in- kensington-gardens/the-orangery Contemporary domestic orangeries are also typically built using stone, brick, and hardwood, but developments in glass, other materials, and insulation technologies have produced viable alternatives to traditional construction. The main difference with a conservatory is in the construction of its roof – a conservatory will have more than 75 per cent of its roof glazed, while an orangery will have less than 75 per cent glazed. Domestic orangeries also typically feature a roof lantern. Improved design and insulation has also lead to an increasing number of orangeries that are not built facing south, instead using light maximising techniques to make the most of available natural sunlight. Early orangeries Impressive orangery at Wrest Park The first examples were basic constructions and could be removed during summer. Notably not only noblemen but also wealthy merchants, e.g., those of Nuremberg, used to cultivate citrus plants in orangeries. Some orangeries were built using the garden wall as the main wall of the new orangery, but as orangeries became more and more popular they started to become more and more influenced by garden designers and architects, which led to the connection between the house and architectural orangery design. This became further influenced by the increased demand for beautiful exotic plants in the garden, which could be grown and looked after in the orangeries. This created the increased demand in garden design for the wealthy to have their own exotic private gardens, further fuelling the status of the orangery becoming even more the symbol of the elite. This in turn created the need for orangeries to be constructed using even better techniques such as underfloor heating and the ability to have opening windows in the roofs for ventilation. Creating microclimates for the propagation of more and more exotic plants for the private gardens that were becoming creations of beauty all around Europe.

This orangery sits behind the main house and consists of a large open room with two smaller wings added at some point after the initial construction. The south-facing wall consists of large triple-hung windows. A second story was traditionally part of the style of orangeries at the time of its construction in the middle to late 18th century as a way of further insulating the main section where the plants were kept. According to the current resident, Ms. Tilghman (a descendant of the Lloyd family), it served as a billiards room for the family. This plantation is also notable as having been the home of Frederick Douglass as a young slave boy. George Washington designed and constructed an orangery for his home at Mount Vernon, Virginia. It was designed in the Georgian Style of architecture and stands just north of the mansion facing the upper garden. Completed in 1787, it is one of the largest buildings on the Mount Vernon estate. Washington grew lemon and orange trees and sago palms there. Considered an ambitious structure by his contemporaries, the main room featured a vaulted ceiling for air circulation, and incorporated radiant heating from a series of flues under the floor. The original greenhouse burned in 1835, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1951 using original plans.Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association.

Another orangery stands at Hampton National Historic Site near Towson, Maryland. Originally built in 1820, it was part of one of the most extensive collections of citrus trees in the U.S. by the mid-19th century. The current structure is a reconstruction built in the 1970s to replace the original, which burned in 1926. The orangery at the Battersea Historic Site in Petersburg, Virginia is currently under restoration. Originally built between 1823 and 1841, it was converted into a garage in a later period.

Early years  As an opening batsman, Chopra started his cricketing career with the Sonnet Cricket Club in Delhi. Currently he is a commentator.  Career  International Chopra made his Test debut in Ahmedabad against New Zealand in late 2003 as India sought to find an opening partner for his Delhi teammate Virender Sehwag. Chopra's international career started well, scoring two half-centuries against New Zealand during 2003/04 in the second Test in Mohali. On the 2003–04 tour to Australia, he featured in many solid partnerships with Virender Sehwag, including two century opening partnerships in Melbourne and Sydney. Chopra's work in seeing off the new ball saw him credited with the large scores that India accumulated in that series when middle-order batsmen Rahul Dravid, V. V. S. Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly regularly compiled large centuries. On the subsequent tour to Pakistan, he compiled another century stand with Virender Sehwag as India posted more than 600 runs in the first innings to set up a heavy innings defeat of arch-rivals Pakistan in the first Test in Multan. However, in the second Test, the Indian batsmen failed in a losing effort, apart from a century from Yuvraj Singh, who played in place of the injured captain Sourav Ganguly. When Ganguly returned for the final Test, Chopra was axed and Yuvraj was retained. Chopra was reintroduced as Sehwag's partner in the 2004 Border- Gavaskar Trophy after Tendulkar was injured for the First Test in Bangalore. However, a heavy loss saw Chopra axed for the following match in Chennai upon Tendulkar's return, with Yuvraj elevated to opening the innings. Yuvraj also struggled, and Chopra was recalled for the Third Test in Nagpur. However, a double failure by Chopra, as Australia won a series in India for the first time in 35 years, saw him dropped for the last time, after his career average gradually decreased, however, from 46.25 to only 23. Chopra was replaced by Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, and was overtaken by Gambhir and Wasim Jaffer in the race to partner Sehwag in the Test side. Due to his low scoring rate, he was not considered for One Day Internationals. IPL He played for Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 1, IPL 2, but was sent back to India as he was deemed unfit for T-20 matches played in IPL 2. In IPL 4 he had been signed by Rajasthan Royals. Domestic In September 2008, Aakash played for Delhi in the Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (winners of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan) and scored 4 and 197 for Delhi. The match was drawn but SNGPL won the trophy on first-innings lead. After representing Delhi for a long time, Chopra joined Rajasthan as a guest player in Ranji Plate division.Aakash Chopra to represent Rajasthan He helped Rajasthan to become the first Plate division team to win the Ranji Trophy followed by another Ranji trophy win in 2010–2011 season. He has won three Ranji titles in total---one with Delhi and two with Rajasthan. He's one of the few Indian cricketers who have scored over 8,000 First-Class runs. Media His columns regularly appear in Mid-Day and on Cricinfo. He is currently with Star Sports, Sony and Sony Espn as a cricket commentator and analyst. He was also a commentator for the 7 network with its coverage of the 2018/19 Australia v India test series. In 2009 Chopra released Beyond the Blues: A First-Class Season Like No Other, a diary of Chopra's 2007–08 domestic season. It was published by Harper Collins. It was critically acclaimed and Suresh Menon of Cricinfo wrote that it was \\"the best book written by an Indian Test cricketer\\".Cricinfo review of Beyond the Blues In November 2011, his second book was published by Harper Collins titled Out of the Blue, about Rajasthan's victory in the Ranji Trophy. He went on to write two more books—The Insider with Espn Cricinfo in 2015 and Numbers Do Lie with Impact Index in 2017. Harper Collins has published all his work thus far. In May 2020, Aakash Chopra signed as a commentator with popular mobile cricket game World Cricket Championship to lend his voice for the upcoming WCC3 game.

The Taiwan strait crisis began when the PRC seized the Yijiangshan Islands and forced the ROC to abandon the Tachen Islands, which were evacuated by the navies of the ROC and the US. Although physical control of the Tachen Islands changed hands during the crisis, American reportage focused exclusively on Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu islands, sites of artillery duels between the Communists and the KMT Nationalists. In 1949, the Chinese Civil War ended with the victory of the Communist People's Republic of China (PRC). The government of the Republic of China (ROC), controlled by Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang (KMT), and 1.3 million anti-Communist Chinese supporters fled from mainland China. The ROC government relocated to the island of Taiwan. The territory under ROC control was reduced to Taiwan, Hainan, the Pescadores Islands (Penghu), and several island groups along the south-east coast of China. In April 1950, the PRC captured Hainan. ROC forces there evacuated to Taiwan in May 1950. Background While the United States recognized Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist (Kuomintang) government as the sole legitimate government for all of China, U.S. President Harry S. Truman announced on 5 January 1950 that the United States would not engage in any intervention in the Taiwan Strait disputes, and that he would not intervene in the event of an attack by the PRC. However, after the outbreak of the Korean War on , Truman declared that the \\"neutralization of the Straits of Formosa\\" was in the best interest of the United States, and he sent the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent any conflict between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China, effectively putting Taiwan under American protection. The move was also intended to deter ROC attacks against the Chinese Mainland. On , President Truman issued the following statement: President Truman later ordered John Foster Dulles, the Foreign Policy Advisor to U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson, to carry out his decision on \\"neutralizing\\" Taiwan in drafting the Treaty of San Francisco of 1951 (the peace treaty with Japan), which excluded the participation of both the ROC and the PRC. Each self- claimed legitimate government of China was excluded from the treaty because the question of China's legitimate government remained unresolved after World War II and the Chinese Civil War, and this was considered an intractable sticking point in otherwise comprehensive and multilaterally beneficial peace negotiations. Japan ceded control of Taiwan in the treaty but did not specify a recipient for Taiwan's sovereignty. This situation has been used by supporters of Taiwan independence to argue for their position that the sovereignty status of Taiwan was undetermined, despite the Japanese having already agreed to return Taiwan to Republic of China through their Instrument of Surrender signed at end of the War.Taiwan Independence Movement According to the author George H. Kerr, a supporter of Taiwanese independence, in his book Formosa Betrayed, the political status of Taiwan was under the trust of the Allied Powers (against Japan). It would be the responsibility of the United Nations if this could not be resolved in near future as designed in the peace treaty. The Nationalist China Government (now based in Taiwan) maintained as its goal the recovery of control of mainland China, and this required a resumption of the military confrontation with the Red Chinese. Truman and his advisors regarded that goal as unrealizable, but regret over losing China to international communism was quite prominent in public opinion at the time, and the Truman Administration was criticized by anticommunists for preventing any attempt by Chiang Kai-shek's forces to liberate mainland China. Truman, a member of the Democratic Party, did not run for reelection in the presidential election of 1952, even though he was eligible to do so. This election was won by the Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, a General from World War II. On 2 February 1953, the new President lifted the Seventh Fleet's blockade in order to fulfill demands by anticommunists to \\"unleash Chiang Kai- shek\\" on mainland China. The conflict In August 1954, the Nationalists placed 58,000 troops on Kinmen and 15,000 troops on Matsu. The ROC began building defensive structures and the PRC began shelling ROC installations on Kinmen. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China responded with a declaration on 11 August 1954, that Taiwan must be \\"liberated.\\" He dispatched the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to the area, and it began shelling both Kinmen and the Matsu Islands. Despite warnings from the U.S. against any attacks on the Republic of China; five days before the signing of the Manila pact, the PLA unleashed a heavy artillery bombardment of Kinmen on September 3, during which two American military advisers were killed. In November, the PLA bombed the Tachen Islands. This renewed Cold War fears of Communist expansion in Asia at a time when the PRC was not recognized by the United States Department of State. Chiang Kai-shek's government was supported by the United States because the ROC was part of the United States policy of containment of communism which stretched from a devastated South Korea to an increasingly divided Southeast Asia. On , the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended the use of nuclear weapons against mainland China. President Eisenhower, however, resisted pressure to use nuclear weapons or involve American troops in the conflict. However, on , the United States and the ROC agreed to the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, which did not apply to islands along the Chinese mainland. This treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate on . The PLA seized the Yijiangshan Islands on . Fighting continued in nearby islands off the coast of Zhejiang, as well as around Kinmen and the Matsu Islands in Fujian. On , the Formosa Resolution was approved by both houses of the U.S. Congress authorizing Eisenhower to use U.S. forces to defend the ROC and its possessions in the Taiwan Strait against armed attack. In February, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill warned the U.S. against using nuclear weapons, but in March, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles stated publicly that the U.S. was seriously considering a nuclear strike. In response, the NATO foreign ministers warned at a meeting of the alliance against such action. In late March, U.S. Admiral Robert B. Carney said that Eisenhower is planning \\"to destroy Red China's military potential.\\" Aftermath: China and nuclear weapons Some scholars hypothesized the PRC backed down in the face of American nuclear brinksmanship and in light of the lack of willingness by the Soviet Union to threaten nuclear retaliation for an attack on the PRC. Others see the case as an example of effective application of extended deterrence by the United States. In any case, the Red Chinese government stated on that it was willing to negotiate. On the PLA temporarily ceased shelling Kinmen and Matsu. The fundamental issues of the conflict remained unresolved, however, and both sides subsequently built up their military forces on their respective sides of the Taiwan Strait leading to a new crisis three years later. There are strong indications that Mao used the crisis in order to provoke the United States into making nuclear threats, which would give him home support to pour money into research and production of Chinese nuclear weapons and missile technology. After American nuclear threats during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis, the Politburo gave the green light in 1955 to pursue nuclear weapon and missile research. The first of China's nuclear weapons tests took place in 1964 and its first successful hydrogen bomb test occurred in 1967.

The word \\"strata\\" refers to apartments being on different levels. Strata title was first introduced in 1961 in the state of New South Wales, Australia, to better cope with the legal ownership of apartment blocks. Previously, the only adequate method of dividing ownership was company title, which had a number of defects, such as the difficulty of instituting mortgages. This term also applies to house-type strata title units in Australia. Other countries that have adopted the Australian system (or a similar variant) of apartment ownership include: Canada (Alberta, British Columbia), Fiji, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. Other countries have legislation based on similar principles but with different definitions and using different mechanisms in their administration. Strata Title Schemes are composed of individual lots and common property. Lots are either apartments, garages or storerooms and each is shown on the title as being owned by a Lot Owner. Common Property is defined as everything else on the parcel of land that is not comprised in a Lot, such as common stairwells, driveways, roofs, gardens and so on. In New Zealand In New Zealand, Strata Title, commonly called a Unit Title, is created by the Unit Titles Act 2010.Unit Titles Act 2010 There are 145,000 unit title dwellings in New Zealand. A Unit Title can be either a Stratum in Freehold, where the owners own the underlying land, or Stratum in Leasehold, where another person owns the land and the body corporate pays rent to that person.Unit Titles Act 2010, s 87 As New Zealand uses the Torrens System of indefeasible titles,Land Transfer Act 1952 the title for a Unit Title has a title for the Principal Unit, showing the legal description of the Principal Unit and any Accessory Units and any legal document registered against those units (called an interest); a Supplementary Record Sheet, showing the rules of the body corporate, its registered address and any interests registered against the underlying land; and the survey plan, which shows the boundaries of the units and the common property.

The check writer is also known as the \\"payor\\", \\"signer\\", \\"maker\\", the drawer, or the \\"account holder\\". The signer or presenter of the check, or person who prints and authorizes the check. In U.S. law, in Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, codified in most U.S. State statutes, a check is a form of negotiable instrument evidencing an order (as opposed to a promise) to pay a fixed amount of money, according to §3-104(a). §3-104(f) specifies that Such an order is issued by the drawer. §3-103(a)(3) specifies that Machine A check perforator with a notice of 1889 and 1891 patent dates A check writer (also known as a \\"ribbon writer\\", \\"check signer\\", \\"check protector\\" or \\"check embosser\\"), is a physical device for protecting a check from unauthorized alteration of either the amount or the authorizing signature. Devices of this type that use various technologies are also known as check protectors, check punches, and check perforators. A check punch punches holes in the shapes of numerals. A check perforator punches small round holes that form numerals. A check writer, or ribbon writer, leaves a numerical or written value impression in the payment amount field of a check that is very difficult to alter. This is accomplished by the machine applying downward force on the check and leaving very small inked shreds in the paper. The first check protector was introduced in 1870. The best known check protectors in the early 1900s had the brand name Protectograph (the Todd Company, Rochester, NY). Other well known manufacturers in the industry were F & E Hedman and the Paymaster Company (both out of Chicago, IL) The person preparing a check positions the check in the check writer so its print-heads are centered over the field on the check where the amount of the check would otherwise be written out in words. Using a series of levers or buttons on the checkwriter's control panel, the operator enters the monetary amount of the check. This amount is then printed onto the check by the operator pulling a lever on the side of the unit (or by pressing a button on electric units). This brings the print-heads down upon a wide inked (usually multicolor) ribbon through which they print the selected amount on the check, with a prefix and suffix to prevent a fraudster from adding extra digits. Entering $6,762.64, for example, will produce text reading \\"TheSum6762dol's64cts\\". There is a series of (usually) horizontal indentations on a pressure bar brought up underneath the check during this process, which matches similar indentations on the print-heads. This embosses the numeric amount through the paper of the check form, strongly discouraging any attempt to alter or raise this amount. Because physical check writers and ribbon writers are now considered antique, businesses that still need this check protection technology such as a business, or organization which regularly prepares remittances by issuing high-amount checks can use a physical check writing device. Financial institutions regularly use them to prepare cashier's checks, and they are also used by issuers of money orders such as the United States Postal Service. Newer versions are electronic, but many are still made by PayMaster. Software Online Check Writer is a cloud-based check printing software. This online application facilitates Check printing of any bank, on any blank Check paper using any printer. The company claims they are integrated with QuickBooks and 16000+ Banks and Financial Institutions. The main advantage of the application is it's easy to detect Fraudulent Checks. CheckWriter is business software used to accept payments from customers, patients, members or subscribers. Unlike a physical device, the software facilitates check draft demand draft technology, and Check 21 Act regulations to emulate the check writer. The software prints a physical draft of a customer's checks that a business can then deposit into any U.S. bank the same day. The software has been in circulation since 1996 and operates on a Microsoft Windows PC platform. Uses for CheckWriter software include bill payment acceptance by phone for insurance companies, hospitals, collections agencies, medical professionals, utilities, loan providers, telemarketers, and almost any other industry that needs to take check payments from customers. The company claims CheckWriter as their trademark since 1996 in the software industry, according to their publications, prosecution history, and public record.

In this conflict, the PRC shelled the islands of Kinmen (Quemoy) and the Matsu Islands along the east coast of mainland China (in the Taiwan Strait) to \\"liberate\\" Taiwan from the Chinese Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang (KMT); and to probe the extent of the United States defense of Taiwan's territory. A naval battle also took place around Dongding Island when the ROC Navy repelled an attempted amphibious landing by the PRC Navy. Overview Location of Quemoy County (pink) relative to Taiwan and the PRC The conflict was a continuation of the Chinese Civil War and First Taiwan Strait Crisis. The Republic of China (ROC) had begun to build military installations on the island of Kinmen (Quemoy) and the Matsu archipelago. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) began firing artillery at both Kinmen and some of the nearby Matsu islands. On August 24 and 25, 1958 Chinese Communist and Chinese Nationalist forces clashed in the vicinity of Dongding Island, which the Nationalist troops controlled. The action was seen as an attempt by the communists to land on the island. This was the only naval and amphibious landing action during the crisis. The communist forces were repelled from taking the island. The action has also been seen as an attempt to draw Nationalist forces away from other areas. The American Eisenhower Administration responded to the request for aid from the ROC according to its obligations in the ROC-United States mutual defense treaty that had been ratified in 1954. President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the reinforcement of the U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet in the area, and he ordered American naval vessels to help the Nationalist Chinese government to protect the supply lines to the islands. In addition, the U.S. Air Force deployed F-100D Super Sabres, F-101C Voodoos, F-104A Starfighters, and B-57B Canberras to Taiwan to demonstrate support for the republic. The F-104s were disassembled and airlifted to Taiwan in C-124 Globemaster II transport aircraft, marking the first time such a method was used to move fighter aircraft over a long distance.

Also, under a secret effort called \\"Operation Black Magic\\", the U.S. Navy modified some of the F-86 Sabre fighters of the Nationalist Chinese Air Force with its newly developed early AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. These missiles gave the Nationalist Chinese pilots a decisive edge over the Chinese Communists' Soviet-made MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighters in the skies over the Matsu Islands and the Taiwan Strait. The Nationalist Chinese pilots used the Sidewinder missiles to score numerous kills on People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) MiG aircraft. The operation suffered blowback when one missile lodged in a MiG-17 without exploding, to be removed after landing and reverse-engineered into the Soviet K-13. The US Army's contribution reinforced the strategic air defense capability of the Republic of China. A provisional Nike missile battalion was organized at Fort Bliss, TX, and sent via USMTS to Nationalist China. The 2nd Missile Battalion was augmented with detachments of signal, ordnance and engineers, totaling some 704 personnel. Twelve long-range M115 howitzer artillery pieces and numerous 155 mm howitzers were transferred from the U.S. Marine Corps to the Army of the Nationalist China. These were sent west to Kinmen Island to gain superiority in the artillery duel back and forth over the straits there. Soon, the Soviet Union dispatched its foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko, to Beijing to discuss the actions of the PLA and the PLAAF, with advice of caution to the Communist Chinese. On , the Sidewinder missile was used for the first time in air-to-air combat as 32 Republic of China F-86s clashed with 100 PLAAF MiGs in a series of aerial engagements. Numerous MiGs were shot down by Sidewinders, the first \\"kills\\" to be scored by air-to-air missiles in combat. Soon, the People's Republic of China was faced with a stalemate, as the PLA's artillerymen had run out of artillery shells. The Communist Chinese government announced a large decrease in bombardment levels on . U.S. Marine Corps Marine Air Group 11 stationed at NAS Atsugi, Japan was sent to Taiwan in August and landed at Kaohsiung, Taiwan and moved via trucks to Ping Tung Air Base about north of Kaohsiung. They remained there, conducting air operations from the WWII Japanese air strip until sometime in the spring of 1959 when they returned to Atsugi. They were joined at Ping Tung by a reinforced rifle company from the Ninth Marines based on Okinawa. Aftermath August 23 Artillery Battle Museum in Kinmen Afterwards, both sides continued to bombard each other with shells containing propaganda leaflets on alternate days of the week. This strange informal arrangement continued until the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Communist People's Republic of China in 1979. The timed shelling created little damage and casualties; it was mainly aimed at military compounds and artillery pieces. On August 23, 2019, the sixty-first anniversary of the beginning of the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, President Tsai Ing-wen visited the Taiwushan Martyrs' Shrine () where she placed flowers and offered incense.

Erik Camayd-Freixas, a sociologist considers this group to be a cult. The group had and still has a large following. When Peraza died the Senate of Puerto Rico closed their offices for three days in her honor. Early years García Peraza was born in Hatillo, Puerto Rico, and raised by her parents, both belonging to wealthy Catholic families that had immigrated to Puerto Rico from the Canary Islands in the 1830s. Her father had previously married one of his cousins, of the prominent García family of the Arecibo, Puerto Rico, region; well-known Puerto Rican writer René Marqués García is one of her nephews. After divorcing his cousin, her father married Peraza's mother, from another Canarian family. When her family moved to their townhouse in Arecibo, Peraza became extremely ill. She made a promise to Mita God that if she was cured, she would always serve him.Latin American issues Vol. 3 Peraza considered it a miracle that she was cured of her illness and she decided to keep her promise. She was one of the first Puerto Rican women to preach religion in Puerto Rico. Soon, she became a leader in the church she attended. This, however, made the majority of the male church members feel uncomfortable with her presence and they told her that she was no longer welcome there.40 Boricuas of the 20th Century \\"Mita\\" Peraza's house in Arecibo García Peraza left the Roman Catholic and converted to the Protestant religion of the Iglesia de Dios Pentecostal M.I., and then left the church with 11 other members who followed her to start their own religion. In 1940, she and her followers founded their own church in Arecibo, and in 1947 she relocated to the current location of Hato Rey, a suburb of San Juan. They claimed that \\"The Holy Spirit Spirit of Life\\" revealed to García Peraza the new name of \\"Mita\\". They started calling themselves \\"Mitas\\" and their religion \\"the Mita congregation\\". According to the Mita faith, Mita is the new name of the Holy Ghost on earth and Mita God has chosen a successor before (Peraza) dies.Congregación Mita David Ramos Torres, Historia de la Iglesia de Dios Pentecostal, M.I., Una Iglesia Ungida Para Hacer Mision (1994), page 127Jesus Santos Medina, PhD, Veredas Que Confunden, Un Análisis Histórico y Teológico de Sectas Religiosas (2010), pages 14–16. Under García Perazas' leadership, the church founded many small businesses which provided work, orientation, and help for its members. The first branch of the church outside of Puerto Rico was established in New York City. The church has expanded to Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador, Canada, Curaçao, Ecuador and Spain. Legacy Juanita \\"Mita\\" García Peraza died on February 21, 1970, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Teófilo Vargas Sein (\\"Aarón\\"), was appointed Prophet of God.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"place of the snare\\" for . In November 2019, the name of the river was officially altered to Ōreti River. The Oreti has its headwaters close to the Mavora Lakes between Lake Te Anau and Lake Wakatipu, and flows south across the Southland Plains to its outflow into Foveaux Strait at the southeastern end of Oreti Beach. En route, it runs through the towns of Lumsden and Winton, before passing through the city of Invercargill, close to the river's estuary. For the final part of the river's length, around the city of Invercargill and the river's estuary just south of the city, it is known as the New River, a name occasionally encountered to refer to the whole river. It shares this estuary with several smaller rivers, most notably the Waihopai River. The New River Estuary, which meets the end of the Oreti River before it reaches the sea, is in decline. Recent science reports show that regions of the upper estuary are under stress and showing eutrophication. There is excessive macroalgal growth including sediment quality decline and high concentrations of chlorophyll-a in the water column. Chlorophyll-a was used as an indicator of eutrophic conditions in the water column, and is a colour pigment present in many types of algae that can give an indication of how much algae is present in the water column.

'Limniris' is derived from the Latin for marsh or living-in-lakes iris, or pond iris. This refers to the fact that most species can be grown in moist habitats for part of the year. It was originally described by Tausch in Deut. Bot. Herb.-Buch (Deutsche Botaniker) in 1841. Édouard Spach made changes 1846 in Ann. Sci. Nat., Bot. (Annales des Sciences Naturelles; Botanique). It was divided into sections, 'Limniris', which is further divided down to about 16 series, and 'Lophiris' (also known as 'Evansias' or crested iris). They are both polyphyletic. It has 45 species, which are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a group that has been recognized with few changes since Dykes's 1913 monograph on the genus Iris. Lawrence (1953), Rodionenko (1987) and then Mathew (1989) all tried to modify the group.Rina Kamenetsky, Hiroshi Okubo (Editors) Various authors have tried to classify the list in various ways.

The starting material is phytosterols from plants. These are first hydrogenated to give a plant stanol which is then esterified with a mixture of fatty acids also derived from plants. Plant stanol esters are found naturally occurring in small quantities in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, cereals, legumes, and vegetable oils. Stanol ester is often added to rapeseed oil based margarine or other foods for its health benefits. Studies have indicated that consumption of about 2-3 grams per day provides a reduction in LDL cholesterol of about 10-15%. The compound itself passes through the gut, with very little entering the blood stream or lymph. Its presence in the gut, however, reduces both the amount of cholesterol the body absorbs from food and the reabsorption of the cholesterol component of bile. Despite a well documented cholesterol lowering effect, there are no data available indicating that functional foods supplemented with plant sterol esters reduce cardiovascular events. They are used in food products such as Benecol. Sterol esters can also be used for the same purpose. These compounds have the same effect to LDL, but they are partially absorbed by the body. The effects of higher serum plant sterol levels are so far not completely understood.  Plant stanols in nature  Plant sterols are cholesterol-like molecules found in all plant foods, with the highest concentrations occurring in vegetable oils. Plant sterols are plant equivalents of cholesterol and have a very similar molecular structure. According to their structure, they can be divided into sterols and stanols, stanols being a saturated subgroup of sterols.  Plant stanols in human nutrition  Plant stanols are present in small amounts in human diet. Their main sources are whole-grain foods, mostly wheat and rye. The daily intake of stanols in the average western diet is about 60 mg/d, whereas the intake of plant sterols is about 150–300 mg/d and that of cholesterol is 500–800 mg/d. The relatively low natural levels of stanols in the diet are too low to have a significant effect on serum cholesterol levels. Following evidence from toxicological studies and numerous clinical trials, stanols are characterised as safe by authorities in several European Union countries and by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Structure and properties Stanol esters are a saturated subgroup of sterol esters. Plant stanol esters in Benecol products are fatty acid esters of plant sterols. The sterol part of the molecule is sitostanol or campestanol while the fatty acid residue originates from different vegetable oils. Plant stanol esters have the following physical properties: *Fat-like with a waxy texture *Creamy white colour in the solid form *Viscous clear liquid with a bright yellow colour, bland odour and taste *Insoluble in water and soluble in fat (hydrophobic) *Viscosity higher than that of the triglyceride oil with the same fatty acid composition. These physical properties can be tailored by changing the fatty acid composition. In different technological applications of Benecol products, the fatty acid part is selected so that the melting properties, texture and other characteristics of the plant stanol ester closely resemble the properties of the fat it replaces. Oxidative and processing stability Under normal storage and food preparation conditions, plant stanol esters are very stable because they are more resistant to oxidation than the commonest vegetable oils. Using plant stanol esters in food applications instead of conventional fats does not decrease the shelf life of the end product. As is the case for all fats and oils, stanol esters should be protected from heat, air and light to prevent oxidation. If long-term storage is required, plant stanol esters are typically refrigerated in solid form. Furthermore, the usual antioxidants can be added to plant stanol ester products as they are to other oils or fats to minimise oxidation. Lowering cholesterol Esterified plant stanols have been proven to reduce cholesterol in a number of randomised, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trials. However absolutely no effect on clinical endpoints such as CVD or mortality was demonstrated. Dual effect of plant stanol Plant stanol reduce both cholesterol and plant sterol levels in serum. This may be of importance since elevated plant sterol concentrations have been identified as an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Two ABC transporters (ABCG5 and ABCG8) play an important role in the regulating the intestinal absorption of plant sterols by resecreting previously absorbed plant sterols from the enterocytes back into the intestinal lumen. Mutations in these transporter proteins lead to a rare congenital disease called sitosterolaemia, which is characterised by: *severely elevated serum plant sterol concentrations, *normal to moderately increased serum cholesterol concentrations, and *a high risk of developing CHD at a very early age. It was recently shown that polymorphisms in the ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes contribute to modifying serum plant sterol levels in healthy, non-sitosterolaemic individuals. Furthermore, several epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of developing heart disease seems to be increased even at more \\"normal\\" plant sterol levels.European Commission, Scientific Committee on Foods, General View on the Long-Term Effects of the Intake of Elevated Levels of Phytosterols from Multiple Dietary Sources, with Particular Attention to the Effects on α-Carotene, 26 September 2002. Since statins were shown to increase serum plant sterol concentrations, patients should probably not be treated with statins alone but with a combination therapy focusing simultaneously on improving the serum lipoprotein profile and lowering serum plant sterol concentrations. Cholesterol absorption The molecular mode of actions of stanols has been described in several preclinical and clinical trials and can be divided into two steps: *Step 1: Cholesterol absorption occurs via the formation of micelles with bile acids. Stanols displace cholesterol from these micelles so that less cholesterol is absorbed. Stanols need to be taken as part of a meal in order to be incorporated in the micelles. *Step 2: In vitro studies have shown that stanols activate LXR alpha, LXR beta and ABCA1 transporter proteins. It is thus hypothesised that stanols work in enterocytes by activating the excretion of cholesterol back into the intestinal lumen. Only stanols have been proven to retain their efficacy in long-term use, most likely due to the minimal absorption of stanols, and consequently their lack of effect on bile acid metabolism. As a consequence of the reduced absorption of cholesterol, the absorption of fat-soluble components other than cholesterol, such as vitamins and antioxidants, may also be reduced. Like cholesterol, carotenoids and tocopherols are transported by lipoproteins. Since the number of LDL particles in circulation decreases after consumption of plant sterols or stanols, plasma concentrations of carotenoids and tocopherols also decrease. This is why these antioxidants are often standardized to plasma lipid concentrations. The results of randomised, placebo-controlled trials on the effects of plant sterols or stanols on fat- soluble vitamins and antioxidants were summarised in 2003. Significant reductions were only seen in clinical trials for hydrocarbon carotenoids. These reductions are probably caused by reduced absorption and lower plasma concentrations of the carrier, LDL. After correcting for cholesterol levels, only the reduction in the β-carotene level remained. It is important, however, that carotenoid and tocopherol levels remained within the normal ranges. Clinical trials also showed that when following the recommended diet, including consumption of vegetables and fruit, carotenoid levels did not decrease. Plasma concentrations of retinol (vitamin A), 25-hydroxyvitamin D and vitamin K are unaffected by dietary plant sterols and stanols.

They are currently used to detain people who are under Australia's policy of mandatory immigration detention. Asylum seekers detected in boats in Australian waters have been detained in facilities on the offshore islands of Nauru and Manus Island, previously under the now defunct Pacific Solution and (since 2013 and ) under Operation Sovereign Borders. The facilities' existence has been condemned on human rights grounds and have even been likened to concentration camps by some critics. Background The Migration Act 1958 allowed discretionary detention of unauthorised arrivals until 1992. Since the 1990s when the Keating Government created a policy of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals, with non-citizens arriving by boat without a valid visa being detained until they were either granted a visa, or deported. Towards the end of the 1990s, a large increase in the number of unauthorised arrivals exceeded the capacity of the existing Immigration Reception and Processing Centres at Port Hedland and Curtin. Facilities Immigration Detention Centres (IDCs) Northern IDC, Darwin, 2010 Asylum seekers on the roof of Villawood IDC, Sydney Immigration detention centres detain people who have overstayed their visa, breached their visa conditions and had their visa cancelled or have been refused entry at Australia's entry ports. This includes irregular maritime arrivals claiming asylum without passports, identity papers or valid entry visas. Under the Migration Act 1958, people arriving in this manner are classed as unlawful non-citizens and are currently subject to mandatory detention. However, in 1954 the Australian government ratified the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Under Article 31 of the convention, the Australian government is legally obligated to grant anyone fleeing persecution and seeking asylum the right to enter the country by whatever means possible. Furthermore, the Article states that signatory countries are not to impose penalties on or indefinitely restrict the freedom of movement of those seeking asylum. Australia's Migration Act 1958 requires people who are not Australian citizens and who are unlawfully in Australia to be detained. Unless they are given legal permission to remain in Australia by being granted a visa, unlawful non-citizens must be removed from Australia as soon as reasonably practicable. The Australian government claims that immigration detention is not used to punish people. Instead, they claim it is an administrative function whereby people who do not have a valid visa are detained while their claims to stay are considered or their removal is facilitated. There are, or were, centres located at: * Maribyrnong, established at Melbourne in 1966. * Villawood, established at Sydney in 1976. * Perth, established in 1981. * Christmas Island, established 2001. * Northern, established at Darwin in 2001. * Baxter, near Port Augusta, SA, established 2002, closed 2007. * Wickham Point, established at Darwin in 2011. * Curtin, near Derby, WA, reopened in 2010. * Scherger, near Weipa, Queensland, opened 2010, closed 2014. * Yongah Hill, near Northam, WA, established in 2012. Immigration Residential Housing Centres (IRHC)  Immigration residential housing provides an option for accommodating people in independent family-style housing in a community setting while still formally being detained. This type of facility is one of several types of alternative residential accommodation for detained people, subject to them meeting eligibility criteria. * Perth * Sydney * Port Augusta Immigration Transit Accommodation Centres (ITAC)  The Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation opened in November 2007 and the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation opened in June 2008. Further immigration transit accommodation opened in Adelaide in 2011. ITCs are for short-term, low-risk detainees, however the Melbourne facility was extended with a high- security compound in 2018. * Brisbane * Melbourne * Adelaide Alternative Places of Detention (APOD) Alternative Places of Detention (APOD) can accommodate any person who is in immigration detention. APOD may range from hospital accommodation in cases of necessary medical treatment, schools for the purpose of facilitating education to school-aged minors, rented accommodation in the community (hotel rooms, apartments), or accommodation in the community made available through arrangements with other government departments. * Darwin * Inverbrackie * Leonora * Christmas Island DIAC) Pacific Solution facilities Since the implementation of the Pacific Solution Australia also funded immigration detention centres on: * Manus Regional Processing Centre, Papua New Guinea closed in February 2008, re- opened on 22 November 2012 (re-closed on 23 November 2017). * Nauru Regional Processing Centre closed in February 2008, re-opened in 2012. Services to immigration centres Most facilities were operated by Australian Correctional Management (a subsidiary of G4S) under contract from the Department of Immigration until 2003, when ACM exited the market. Between 2003 and 2009, G4S was appointed as the contractor to manage a large number of facilities. Its contract was not renewed and in 2009 Serco Australia was awarded a five-year contract. Manus Regional Processing Centre was operated by the International Organization for Migration, then by G4S, then by Broadspectrum (formerly Transfield) with security sub-contracted to Wilson Security. Nauru Regional Processing Centre was operated by Broadspectrum and Wilson Security, and then later by Canstruct International (with a $591 million contract) and finally by a Nauruan Government Commercial Entity. The 3 new immigration detention facilities in Lorengau on Manus Island have security and some services provided by Paladin Group under a contract worth more than $423 million. Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre was once operated by G4S but is now operated by Serco as of April 2019. Controversy The facilities have been a source of much controversy during their time of operation. There have been a number of riots and escapes, as well as accusations of human rights abuses from organisations such as refugee advocates, Amnesty International, the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Human Rights Watch, and the United Nations. Journalists are forbidden from entering the detention centres. In January 2014, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens accused the government of a cover-up over a violent clash on 18 October 2013 at the Manus Island facility between the Papua New Guinea army and the Papua New Guinea police mobile squad hired for the facility's security, leading to Australian expatriate staff being evacuated, while local staff and asylum seekers remained. On 5 May 2014, it was reported that several Salvation Army staffers had alleged that refugees were regularly subjected to beatings, racial slurs, and sexual assaults within the facility. In March 2002, Irene Khan, the Secretary General of Amnesty International, said: Former Prime Minister John Howard and successive immigration ministers maintained that their actions were justified in the interests of protecting Australia's borders and ensuring that immigration law was enforced. Refugee \\"Swap\\" with the US In 2016 the Australian government announced an intention to exchange some proven refugees from either Nauru and/or Manus Island for certain displaced people presently in Central America as part of an agreement with the Obama administration of the United States. In early 2017 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that he was confident the agreement would proceed, despite the change of President to Donald Trump. However, latest information appears to cast doubt on the willingness of the US government to honour any such agreement, especially in light of Trump's executive order suspending entry to the US from several countries. On 2 February 2017 Australian news outlets, quoting the Washington Post, reported that a telephone conversation between Trump and Turnbull had been acrimonious in relation to the \\"swap\\", and that Trump had terminated the call ahead of time. Trump has expressed admiration over the detention facilities, opining that the US should do the same. On 4 February 2019 the remaining 4 children who had been detained on Nauru were sent to the U.S. In May 2019, it was revealed that some of the U.S. detainees sent to Australia in the \\"swap\\", were Rwandan men, former members of the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda, who had been accused of mass-murdering tourists in 1999. They had been held in U.S. immigration detention for over 15 years, but were on the verge of being released into the U.S. after a court ruled that their confessions had been obtained by torture. In November 2018 the men were secretly brought to Australia. The Turnbull Government knew about the allegations against the men when they agreed to accept them. The Australian and U.S. Governments initially refused to comment on the matter, but later Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that the men had been assessed by security agencies. The former New Zealand foreign affairs minister Gerry Brownlee described Australia's behaviour as \\"incredibly insensitive\\" and said that New Zealand would have \\"appreciated a heads up\\" that Australia was about to resettle men accused of brutally murdering two New Zealanders [among others]. Suicide and self-harm attempts increase on Manus After the Australian Liberal Party were (unexpectedly, according to polls) re-elected 2019 Australian federal election, reports of despair and attempted self-harm and suicide were reported from Manus. The men had hoped with Labor in government, the New Zealand offer would be accepted and they would at last be resettled. By 4 June there had been at least 26 attempts at suicide or self-harm by men in the Lorengau camps and Port Moresby (in the hospital and accommodation for sick asylum seekers). The PNG paramilitary police squad was deployed around one of the camps in an attempt to deter suicide and self-harm attempts.

It was the band's first release for Fat Wreck Chords and served as a pre-release to their sixth studio album Cool to Be You, released the following month. The EP includes two songs from the album: \\"Nothing with You\\" and Merican\\", and three B-sides from the album's sessions: \\"Here with Me\\", \\"I Quit\\", and the hidden track \\"Alive\\". Merican marked the first release of new studio material from the Descendents since 1996's Everything Sucks and was their third release ever to chart, peaking at number 29 on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart and at number 38 on Top Heatseekers.  Background and recording  In 1987 Descendents singer Milo Aukerman had left the band to pursue a career in biochemistry. The remaining members—bassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson—changed the band's name to All and released eight albums on Cruz Records and Interscope Records between 1988 and 1995 with singers Dave Smalley, Scott Reynolds, and Chad Price. Aukerman contributed occasional songwriting and backing vocals, and in 1995 decided to return to music. The members decided to operate as two bands, working with Aukerman as the Descendents and with Price as All. Both bands signed to Epitaph Records and the Descendents released Everything Sucks in 1996. Following the album's supporting tours Aukerman had returned to his science career, though he recorded backing vocals for All's 1998 album Mass Nerder. All also released Problematic in 2000 and Live Plus One in 2001, a double live album that included a Descendents disc recorded in 1996. The recording sessions for the Descendents' sixth studio album Cool to Be You took place with Aukerman in February 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with additional recording done in April at Planet of Sound in Wilmington, Delaware, and were produced by Stevenson. The band recorded the music for the songs live in the studio with minimal overdubbing, and Aukerman's vocals were recorded over the instrumental tracks. However, these recordings were not released for another two years. Stevenson explained that the gap of eight years between Descendents albums was due to the band members having children, and his father's death.  Release  For the releases of 'Merican and Cool to Be You the Descendents signed to Fat Wreck Chords. Label head and musician Fat Mike was a longtime fan of the band, and his enthusiasm for working with them was a major factor in their decision to sign to the label. Stevenson commented that \\"If you've got the owner of the label saying he wants to put out a record by what is probably his favorite band of all time, that's rad. That's the best possible position for a band to be in.\\" The 'Merican EP was released in February 2004, followed by the full-length album in March. Stevenson remarked that the EP served as a teaser for Cool to Be You: \\"It's funny because, from the old Descendents fan's point of view, it's kind of like 'What? Why did they put out this EP? It doesn't even have the best songs on it. I waited seven years for this?' But from the newer kids perspective, it's more like, hey let's try to introduce this new decade of kids to Descendents so it's at least on the tip of their tongue when the album comes out.\\" 'Merican was released on both compact disc and extended play formats, each with a different cover, drawn by Jeff Hagedorn, depicting the band's Milo character dressed as Uncle Sam.  Themes  The songs on 'Merican address topics including love and relationships, sociopolitical commentary, and frustrations with life in a touring band. Aukerman remarked that \\"there's no part of the 'Merican EP that is a retread of anything we've done in the past. Some of the songs are major departures for us, like 'Here with Me,' and the hidden track 'Alive.' Even the title song is actually a stretch for us; if you look back on all the songs we have done, there are very few that have any 'political' content in them.\\" Merican\\" addresses positive and negative aspects of American history, celebrating cultural figures such as Otis Redding, Duke Ellington, and Walt Whitman while condemning slavery, Joseph McCarthy, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Vietnam War. \\"I Quit\\" was written by Aukerman about the frustrations of being in a band and on the road, with lyrics such as \\"Sick all the time, I miss my wife / I quit / Got better things to do with my life / I quit\\". Aukerman explained of the song: > I can't even count the number of times I've quit this band, dating back to > 1982 and Milo Goes to College! Like most of my songs, \\"I Quit\\" is my attempt > to capture those emotions that come and go, the transient ones. Those types > of emotions, to me, make for the best songs because they tend to be extreme! > So there is no \\"message\\" to the song, just me spewing about the negative > aspects of band life. At the time I wrote the song, I really did want to > quit. I don't really care how people take the song; as the line says, \\"I > don't give a flying fuck what you think of me.\\" Reception 'Merican became the third Descendents release to chart (following Everything Sucks and Live Plus One), peaking at number 29 on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart and at number 38 on Top Heatseekers. John Luerssen of Allmusic gave it three and a half stars out of five, remarking that \\"Nothing with You\\" \\"revisit[s] the timeless lovelorn attack of cherished songs from their past like 'Wendy,' 'Clean Sheets,' and 'Silly Girl, while Merican\\" \\"harks back to vintage Bad Religion\\" and \\"I Quit\\" is \\"a nervous, edgy 'Catalina'-like throwback\\". He was less complimentary about the other two songs, calling \\"Here with Me\\" merely a \\"palatable midtempo number\\" and \\"Alive\\" \\"worth skipping, as it drags in a way that no Descendents number has a right to.\\"  Trivia  Here With Me was originally written in 1989 by Milo and first played with his short lived band Milestone.

Iris arizonica and Iris montana have since been classified as synonyms of Iris missouriensis. The series was then first classified as a 'series' by Diels in 'Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien' (Edited by H. G. A. Engler and K. Prantl) in 1930. It was further expanded by Lawrence in Gentes Herb (written in Dutch) in 1953.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) There is still a lot of confusion within the series. The British Iris Society only lists Iris missouriensis and classes Iris longipetala as a variant of Iris missouriensis. The American Iris Society and Pacific Iris Society lists three species; Iris longipetala (Herbert), Iris missouriensis (Nuttall) and Iris pariensis (Welsh).James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H.

Iris pariensis was found by Stanley Larson Welsh in Utah and published in 'Great Basin Naturalist' 46(2): 256 in 1986. The series has species are native to western North America, seen in Washington (state), Oregon and California. They prefer to have moisture in the spring and a dry period during the summer. They also do not like root disturbance hence they are difficult to grow as nursery plants. They are also rarely grown in the UK. The species have thick rhizomes, fruiting stems (that follow the flowers) that stay on the plant until the next growing season, (or longer) a stigma with 2 teeth (or lobes) and seed capsules with 6 ribs and taper into points on the ends. *Iris longipetala Herbert *Iris missouriensis Nuttall References External links  Longipetalae Category:Flora of the United States Category:Garden plants of North America ","title":"Iris ser.

It runs north–south through the Southern Uplands from Annanhead (north of Moffat) to Annan on the Solway Firth, and in its higher reaches it separates the Moffat hills on the east from the Lowther hills to the west. A long-distance walking route called Annandale Way Annandale Way website running through Annandale (from the source of the River Annan to the sea) was opened in September 2009.The Long Distance Walkers Association - Annandale Way History Annandale was also an historic district of Scotland, bordering Liddesdale to the east, Nithsdale to the west, Clydesdale and Tweeddale to the north and the Solway Firth to the south. The district which was in the Sheriffdom of Dumfries and later became part of the County of Dumfries, one of the counties of Scotland. The main reorganisation took place during the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, which established a uniform system of county councils and town councils in Scotland and restructured many of Scotland's counties. (See: History of local government in the United Kingdom). It is one of three subdivisions of Dumfriesshire, along with Eskdale (previously part of Liddesdale) and Nithsdale. It is famous for its connection with Ben Johnson and Robert the Bruce, as the de Brus family was given this land by David I in 1124, as one of the border lordships when David became Prince of the Cumbrians. Along with Carrick, these lands acted as a buffer between the quasi-independent Lordship or Kingdom of Galloway and David's lands of Strathclyde and Cumbria.

Along with Raul Seixas, Renato Russo and Os Mutantes, Cazuza, both while fronting Barão Vermelho and at solo career, is considered one of the best exponents of Brazilian rock music. In his 9-year career, he sold more than 5 million albums and achieved 11 number one singles and 18 Top 10 singles in Brazil. Biography Early life and influences Son of the record producer João Araújo and the amateur singer Maria Lúcia Araújo, Cazuza always had close contact with music. Influenced since early childhood by the strong values of Brazilian music, he had a special preference for the sad, dramatic overtones of Cartola, Lupicinio Rodrigues, Dolores Duran, and Maysa. He began to write lyrics and poems around 1965. In late 1974, a vacation in London, England, acquainted him with the music of Led Zeppelin, Janis Joplin and The Rolling Stones, and he soon became a great fan. Cazuza enrolled in college in 1978, but abandoned the course of journalism three weeks later to work with his father at Som Livre. He moved later to San Francisco, where he came in contact with Beat literature, becoming highly influenced by it. Barão Vermelho In 1980 he returned to Rio, where he worked with the theatrical group Asdrúbal Trouxe o Trombone (Asdrúbal Brought the Trombone). There he was noticed by the novice singer/composer Léo Jaime, who introduced him to a beginning rock band that needed a vocalist, the Barão Vermelho (Red Baron). With this very successful eighties Brazilian rock band, who had their greatest success with \\"Bete Balanço\\", a song that was part of the soundtrack of a film, Cazuza began his career as a singer. In 1985, Cazuza took part in Rock in Rio with Barão Vermelho, and around this time, Caetano Veloso claimed he was the greatest Brazilian poet of his generation. It was also in this same year that Cazuza was infected with the AIDS virus, precipitating his desire to leave the band to obtain a greater freedom in composition and expression, both musically and lyrically. Solo career After he left the band, Cazuza's music began to diversify, incorporating elements of the blues in songs such as \\"Blues da Piedade\\" (Blues of Compassion), \\"Só as mães são felizes\\" (Only Mothers Are Happy) and \\"Balada da Esplanada\\" (Ballad of the Esplanade), which was based on a poem of the same name by Oswald de Andrade; showcasing increasingly intimate lyrics, like those in \\"Só se for a Dois\\" (Only If It Will Be as a Couple), as well as opening itself up to influences from Brazilian pop music with interpretations of Cartola's \\"O Mundo é um Moinho\\" (The World is a Windmill), Raul Seixas's \\"Cavalos Calados\\" (Silent Horses) and Caetano Veloso's \\"Esse Cara\\" (This Guy). Contrary to what usually happens once an artist leaves a band that has made them famous, Cazuza's solo career proved to be more successful than that of his former group. \\"Exagerado\\" (Exaggerated), \\"O Tempo não Pára\\" (Time Doesn't Stop), and \\"Ideologia\\" (Ideology) were his greatest hits and proved to be a great influence on subsequent Brazilian musicians. In 1986, Cazuza was featured in the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot Organization, performing the song \\"Preciso Dizer que Te Amo\\" in a duet with Bebel Gilberto. Final years In 1989, he admitted publicly for the first time that he had AIDS and released his last album in life: Burguesia. Cazuza was openly bisexual but was not active in the LGBT movement. However, his openness about being a person with AIDS helped to change public perceptions and attitudes about HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Death Cazuza died in Rio de Janeiro on July 7, 1990 at the age of 32, due to a septic shock caused by AIDS. He was buried at the Cemitério São João Batista Botafogo, in Rio de Janeiro.FindAGrave.com burial site Cazuza's mother set up the Viva Cazuza Society (Sociedade Viva Cazuza), a charity which sponsors AIDS prevention and provides a home for HIV-positive children Other media A biopic starring Daniel de Oliveira and directed by Sandra Werneck called Cazuza: O Tempo não Para (\\"Cazuza: Time Doesn't Stop\\") was released in 2004. In 2014, the biographic musical Cazuza – Pro Dia Nascer Feliz opened in São Paulo. It featured songs from Cazuza's solo career as well as from his time as frontman of Barão Vermelho. The musical was directed by João Fonseca and toured Brazil for two years.

The picture was taken by freelance photographer Art Kane for Esquire magazine on August 12, 1958. The musicians were gathered at 17 East 126th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenue. Esquire published the photo in its January 1959 issue.

Most of the children were neighborhood residents, although the second child from the right, Taft Jordan, Jr., had accompanied his father, Taft Jordan, to the photo session. The photography crew was already having trouble directing the adults, and the presence of the children added to the chaos: one of the children appearing in the window kept yelling at a sibling on the curb; another kept playing with Basie's hat; Taft Jordan, Jr. had been scuffling with the older child seated to his left. Ultimately, Art Kane realized that any further attempt to organize the proceedings would be futile, and he decided to incorporate the subjects' actions. Musicians in other photographs Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith was sitting out of shot at the time the main picture used by Esquire was taken. Ronnie Free, Mose Allison and Charlie Rouse turned up too late for the Esquire picture; Dizzy Gillespie took a photograph of them with Mary Lou Williams, Lester Young and Oscar Pettiford. Film Jean Bach, a radio producer of New York, recounted the story behind the photograph in her 1994 documentary film, A Great Day in Harlem. The film was nominated in 1995 for an Academy Award for Documentary Feature. Bach described how, upon the film's release, a number of similar photographs employed the \\"A Great Day in...\\" theme. Hugh Hefner assembled Hollywood-area musicians for \\"A Great Day in Hollywood\\" in conjunction with a sneak preview of A Great Day in Harlem. Soon after, \\"A Great Day in Philadelphia\\" included musicians such as Jimmy Heath, Benny Golson and Ray Bryant.

The transportation system provides free service to guests of the resort and consists of buses, a monorail system, a gondola lift system, watercraft, and parking lot trams. Most of the routes operated by Disney Transport are buses that run along the resort's public roads maintained by the Reedy Creek Improvement District and private roads. None of these modes of transportation charge a fare, which makes the entire network free to use. Buses Except where monorail or ferry service exists or walking is practical, direct bus service is provided from every hotel to every park and to Disney Springs, as well as between parks. The buses are fare-free for all visitors to Walt Disney World. Bus service to and from parks typically starts 45 minutes before the park opens and ends an hour after the park closes; buses from Disney Springs to the resorts run until 2 a.m. Bus stops are located near park entrances; near Disney Springs' Town Center entrance; and along roadways inside the resort (for more expansive resorts) or near the resort's entrance (for smaller resorts). Features At the resorts, there are screens that sometimes indicate when the next bus to a given park will be arriving. This technology tracks the buses through GPS technology to give projected wait times, though buses usually run at intervals of no more than twenty minutes. On board the air-conditioned, ADA-accessible buses, announcements are played to indicate points of interest and bus stops. These announcements use GPS to determine which announcements should be played at which locations. All buses are ADA-accessible and can carry two wheelchairs or mobility scooters per vehicle. Strollers must be folded before boarding the buses. Along Buena Vista Drive between Epcot Center Drive and the Disney Springs Lime Garage, new bus lanes were installed between 2014 and May 2016 as part of the renovation of Disney Springs. These allow buses headed to/from Disney Springs and Typhoon Lagoon to use their own, exclusive right-of-way in the median of Buena Vista Drive. Routes While the bus system is a hub- and-spoke paradigm, it is more akin to a traditional aviation hub-and-spoke model than to the traditional public transit hub-and-spoke model because it has multiple hubs, both primary and secondary in nature, with the routes themselves usually being non-stop. The four theme parks, Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom, as well as Disney Springs, operate as the five primary hubs. Each of the four theme parks has service to the 22 resorts, as well as to the other parks. Disney Springs has service only to the resorts, except for one-way service from the theme parks to Disney Springs after 4 p.m. Bus service is not provided on some routes served by monorail or watercraft, for example between Epcot and the Magic Kingdom, and between the Magic Kingdom or Epcot to resorts on the monorail line. Since March 2019, both water parks offer direct service to and from Disney resort hotels. Guest no longer have to transfer at Disney's Animal Kingdom for Blizzard Beach or Disney Springs for Typhoon Lagoon. ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is served only on select days, and only to and from Pop Century, Caribbean Beach, and All-Star Resorts. Direct transportation between the spokes (the resorts) is not provided, unless they happen to be on the same bus route. Buses also are used for internal resort guest transportation within several of the larger resorts. Disney Transport buses also carry Disney World employees around the resort. The Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC) acts as the primary hub for the Walt Disney World Monorail System, as well as a transfer point for watercraft service. As of late 2013, Disney Transport buses no longer transport visitors to the TTC; however, other bus services still use the TTC, such as the Orlando area's Lynx public bus system, which also stops at Disney University and Disney Springs' West Side section. Beginning in 1983, buses' destinations were marked by a small colored flag on the front of the bus. At the time of the flags' introduction, the resort consisted of two parks, four hotels, the TTC, and the Disney Shopping Village; there were also three bus routes that ran exclusively within the Fort Wilderness Resort. Handbooks were provided so travelers could match the flags with the destinations. However, this became increasingly impractical as more parks and hotels were added, and the flags were retired from the buses in 1995. Now, the destination or destinations are displayed on the electronic route marquee on the fronts and sides of each bus. Newer buses (made from 2015 onward) also have marquees on the backs of each bus. Fleet Disney Transport operates a fleet of Nova Bus LFS, Gillig Low Floor, and New Flyer XD60 Xcelsior bus models. They have approximately 350 buses in their fleet with a further 50 Gillig buses on order , which would expand their fleet to 400 buses. This is an expansion from the 319 buses it had in 2012, and from approximately 289 in years prior. Since 2013, some buses have sported a new red-and-gray, or red-and-white, paint scheme with a new \\"Disney Transport\\" logo, with more buses to be repainted over the coming years. This is a change from previous livery, in which buses were painted white with a red \\"Disney\\" logo and the word \\"Transport\\" in yellow-on-purple text next to the logo. Disney Transport has been expanding its fleet with new Gillig buses, and in 2014, it introduced new articulated New Flyer XD60 Xcelsior buses as a pilot project to increase capacity on certain routes. All Disney Transport buses run on R50 Biodiesel, a cleaner renewable diesel fuel, and in 2013, Disney Transport began testing the use of all-electric buses on its routes. The fleet currently is the third largest fleet of any Florida transportation system, behind Miami's Metrobus and the Jacksonville Transportation Authority. The Disney Transport bus depot is located at 2451 Recycle Way, Orlando, FL 32830. Current active fleet , there are 390 vehicles in Disney Transport's fleet. {class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" ! style=\\"width:80px;\\"|Numbers (Total ordered) ! style=\\"width:130px;\\"|Photo ! style=\\"width:50px;\\"|Year ! style=\\"width:150px;\\"|Builder ! style=\\"width:50px;\\"|Model name ! style=\\"width:160px;\\"|Engine ! style=\\"width:160px;\\"|Transmission or propulsion system ! style=\\"width:600px;\\"|Notes |- align=\\"center\\" |4815-4832 (18 buses)  |120x120px |2000 |rowspan=3|Nova Bus |rowspan=3|LFS |rowspan=3|Detroit Diesel Series 40 |rowspan=3|Allison B500R |rowspan=3 align=\\"left\\"|LeasedTotal # of Disney buses?, disboards.com. |- align=\\"center\\" |4833-4861 (29 buses) |2001 |- align=\\"center\\" |4862-4885 (24 buses) |2002 |- align=\\"center\\" |4886-04 to 4930-04 (45 buses)  |120x120px |2004 |rowspan=2|Gillig |rowspan=2|Low Floor (G29D102N4) |rowspan=2|Cummins ISL |rowspan=2|Voith D864.5 - align=\\"center\\" |4931-06 to 4952-06 (22 buses) |2006 - align=\\"center\\" |4953 (1 bus) 2005 |Nova Bus |LFS |Cummins ISL |ZF 5HP552C align=\\"left\\"|Ex-Nova Bus demo, acquired 2007 |- align=\\"center\\" |4954-07 to 4962-07 (9 buses)  |213x213px |2007 |rowspan=3|Gillig |rowspan=3|Low Floor (G29D102N4) |rowspan=3|Cummins ISL |rowspan=3|Voith DIWA.5 - align=\\"center\\" |4963-08 to 4983-08 (21 buses) |2008 - align=\\"center\\" |4985-09 to 4999-09 (15 buses) |2009 - align=\\"center\\" |5000-10 to 5009-10 (10 buses) |213x213px |2010 |Nova Bus |LFS |Cummins ISL |Allison B500R - align=\\"center\\" |5010-10 to 5022-10 (13 buses) rowspan=\\"4\\" |213x213px |2010 |rowspan=4|Gillig |rowspan=4|Low Floor (G27D102N4) |rowspan=4|Cummins ISL |rowspan=4|Voith D864.5 - align=\\"center\\" |5023-11 to 5069-11 (47 buses) |2011 - align=\\"center\\" |5071-12 to 5121-12 (51 buses) |2012 - align=\\"center\\" |5122-13 to 5145-13 (24 buses) |2013 - align=\\"center\\" |5146-13 to 5151-13 (6 buses) |120px |2013 |New Flyer Industries |XD60 |Cummins ISL9 |Allison B500R - align=\\"center\\" |5152-13 to 5157-13 (6 buses) |120x120px |2013 |Nova Bus |Nova Bus LFS Articulated |Cummins ISL9 |Allison B500R - align=\\"center\\" |5158-15 to 5199-15 (42 buses) |120x120px |2015 |Gillig |Low Floor (G27D102N4) |Cummins ISL9 |Allison B500R - align=\\"center\\" |5200-16 to 5206-16 (7 buses) 2016 |Gillig |Low Floor (G27D102N4) |Cummins ISL9 |Allison B500R } Past fleet {class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" ! style=\\"width:80px;\\"|Numbers (Total ordered) ! style=\\"width:130px;\\"|Photo ! style=\\"width:50px;\\"|Year ! style=\\"width:150px;\\"|Builder ! style=\\"width:50px;\\"|Model name ! style=\\"width:160px;\\"|Engine ! style=\\"width:160px;\\"|Transmission or propulsion system ! style=\\"width:600px;\\"|Notes |- align=\\"center\\" |1000-1002 (3 buses) 1961 |GMC |TDH-5302 |Detroit Diesel 6V71N |Allison VH9 *Former White House Sightseeing Corporation buses. |- align=\\"center\\" |1008 (1 bus) 19??

The three lines, and the rolling stock of twelve Mark VI monorails, are maintained by Disney and form part of the Walt Disney World transportation system. The monorails are ADA-accessible and stroller-accessible, though there is a vertical gap between the monorails and the platforms, so wheelchair users must use a portable ramp, located at each station, to board the monorail. The monorail system opened in 1971 with the Magic Kingdom \\"Resort\\" and \\"Express\\" monorail lines; the former runs in a loop between Magic Kingdom and the TTC via the Polynesian, Grand Floridian, and Contemporary Resorts, while the latter bypasses the resorts and goes directly between the TTC and Magic Kingdom via a parallel loop. The Epcot line was added in 1982. , the system is one of the most heavily used monorail systems in the world with over 150,000 daily riders. Gondola lift Disney Skyliner system The resort operates the Disney Skyliner gondola lift system. The three- line system connects Disney's Pop Century Resort, Disney's Art of Animation Resort, Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort, and Disney Riviera Resort to Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot. Watercraft The Richard F. Irvine ferry in the Seven Seas Lagoon The resort also maintains a fleet of watercraft providing additional access between various Disney resorts and parks. These ferries are also free to ride. While some route duplication does take place (for instance, the Disney Springs water taxis to the Disney Springs Resort Area duplicate buses to these same resorts), the watercraft provide an alternative way to travel from one location to another. Strollers can be transported aboard all of the boats, and the ferries, motor cruisers, Friendship Boats, and water taxis are ADA-accessible when water conditions are favorable. Motor launches cannot accept motorized wheelchairs or unfolded wheelchairs. Routes The boats with the highest capacities are the large ferries that traverse the Seven Seas Lagoon between the TTC and the Magic Kingdom. The three ferries are clad in different trim colors and are named for past Disney executives: the General Joe Potter (blue), the Richard F. Irvine (red) and the Admiral Joe Fowler (green). Motor launches and cruisers link several places in the Seven Seas Lagoon, using colored flags to indicate the route. Launches link the Magic Kingdom to the Grand Floridian and Polynesian Resorts via the Seven Seas Lagoon, using the Gold Route. These launches also connect the Magic Kingdom to Bay Lake via a water bridge to reach the Wilderness Lodge, using the Red Route; and the Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground, using the Green Route. There is also a Blue Route motor launch between the Wilderness Lodge and the Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground, via the Contemporary Resort. Water taxis, which also have colored flags as route indicators, link the Port Orleans Resort – Riverside (yellow), the Port Orleans Resort – French Quarter (purple), the Saratoga Springs Resort (blue), and the Old Key West Resort (green) to Disney Springs along the Sassagoula River. A fourth route, the red- flag route, ferries passengers around Disney Springs. Friendship Boats also connect the International Gateway entrance of Epcot to the BoardWalk Resort; the Yacht and Beach Club Resorts; the Swan and Dolphin Resorts; and Disney's Hollywood Studios. They also connect Epcot's Future World to Morocco in the World Showcase. {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" ! width=100 Type ! width=130 Photo ! width=170 Route !

Because the trams require guests to transfer from one's wheelchair and to fold all strollers and wheelchairs before boarding, they are not ADA-accessible. Both the Magic Kingdom and Epcot parking lots have two tram lanes, with the Magic Kingdom trams serving the \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Villains\\" sides of the lot, while the Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disney's Animal Kingdom parking lots have only one tram lane. The original tram tractors, which ran on compressed natural gas (CNG), were built by United Tractor of Chesterton, Indiana in 1969, while the tram cars were built by Arrow Development during the same period. However, these tractors experienced many problems including overheating, transmission issues, as well as electrical and air brake troubles and were prone to frequent breakdowns. A new fleet of tram tractors, which were custom designed and built in-house by Disney, were put into service in 1972. These tram tractors also originally ran on CNG, but were converted to run on diesel fuel only a few years after entering service due to numerous problems encountered with using CNG. Over the years, these problems were slowly resolved and the tractors were eventually converted back to running on CNG starting in the late 1990s and into the early 2000s. Beginning in late 2010 and throughout 2011, safety doors were added to all of the tram cars along with outward facing speakers so that guests waiting to board the trams could hear the safety announcements more clearly. The 1972 tractors remained in service for over forty five years until late 2016, when Disney began testing a new tram tractor prototype at Disney's Animal Kingdom. The new tractor ran on propane, which made it quieter and more fuel efficient. Following successful testing, Disney upgraded the entire tram tractor fleet to the new propane-fueled tractors throughout 2017. Minnie Van A Minnie Van parked at Disney Springs The vehicle for hire service named after Minnie Mouse began testing in July 2017, with the first Minnie Van service being offered to guests staying at Disney's BoardWalk Resort, Disney's Yacht Club Resort, and Disney's Beach Club Resort at the end of that month. The service is now available to all visitors on Walt Disney World property, whether overnight resort guests or not. Unlike the public transportation, the Minnie Vans charge a distance based fee to transport guests anywhere within the Walt Disney World property (except for the Magic Kingdom; guests using rideshare vehicles to travel to the park must transfer to the ferry or a monorail at the TTC or walk to the park via a walking path from Disney's Contemporary Resort, as rideshare vehicles cannot use the park's bus loops). The vehicles are Chevrolet Traverse SUVs with capacity for up to 6 passengers. Minnie Vans are requested using the Lyft mobile app. ADA accessible Minnie Vans are requested by calling the service on the direct line. Discontinued services Walt Disney World previously had its own small airport: the Walt Disney World Airport (a.k.a.: the Lake Buena Vista STOLport). During the early 1970s, scheduled passenger service was operated by Shawnee Airlines with small de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter commuter turboprops, which had STOL (short takeoff and landing) capabilities on flights to Tampa and Orlando.Airlines (International) system timetable June 15, 1972 timetableimages.comEastern Air Lines system timetable, Air Commuter Service section September 6, 1972 departedflights.com The airport is no longer in operation, but the landing strip still exists and is currently used as space for offices and storage. From late 1973 to early 1980, the steam-powered narrow-gauge Fort Wilderness Railroad provided transportation within the Fort Wilderness Resort. Railroad ties remain in place along certain sections of the railroad's former right-of-way. Watercraft provided service to the Discovery Island zoological attraction from its opening in 1974 to its closure in 1999. As of 2019, the island is abandoned and access is prohibited. Incidents From September 25, 2013 to September 25, 2015, Disney Transport has been involved in 27 total accidents that have been reported to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including two fatal accidents and nineteen others involving injuries.

During his award-winning career, Dean has worked with, interviewed, or performed with thousands of public figures, actors, musicians, authors, artists, and comics. Early life and education Born in Fort Worth, Texas, Dean's career in broadcasting began in junior high school in 1973 on WBAP-TV's Museum of Horrors. After graduating from Ft. Worth's Paschal High School as a highly recruited football player, he took a shift at Abilene Christian University's campus radio station. Dean eventually left college for his first job, at KPAR in Granbury, Texas. A few months later he was hired at 1360 KXOL and has worked in Dallas-Ft. Worth ever since. Career 1980-1987 In 1980, Dean moved to 1190 KLIF. In 1981, he took on a three-hour Tuesday overnight shift at Dallas' legendary KVIL. Dean was eventually promoted to evenings, but his ratings were disastrous. In 1987, he was taken off the air and moved to a behind-the-scenes job as morning show producer, a move that resulted in seven years of tutelage under the direct oversight of National Broadcast Association Hall of Famer Ron Chapman, who remains Dean's close friend and mentor. 1991-1999 In 1991, Dean became executive producer for the Dallas Cowboys Radio Network. In 1994, he moved to KRLD to host a mid-day talk show. Again, his ratings as a solo host were disappointing, and in a last-ditch change, he was reassigned as co-anchor of the KRLD Morning News in 1999. That led to a collaboration with co-anchor Jack Hines that lasted for another six years and included coverage of pivotal events such as the Oklahoma City bombing, the Fort Worth Tornado, and 9/11. In 1995, Dean was named co-host of KTVT's Positively Texas! – an afternoon talk and variety show. After initial success, the show began languishing in the ratings, and Dean was approached about possibly switching to news. He began hosting the noon and 5 p.m. news with Rene Syler on CBS 11 – followed by co- hosting duties with Maria Arita on CBS 11 News at 4. 2002-present By 2005, Ron Chapman was at KLUV and seeking a successor. He turned to Dean, who became KLUV Morning Show host upon Chapman's retirement that year. For a period of time, Jody Dean and the Morning Team was also televised each weekday morning from 7 until 9 on KTXA-TV. Until January 2013, the KLUV Morning Show was co-hosted by news reporter Kathy Jones, traffic reporter Jonathan Hayes, Rebekah Black, and producer Bernie \\"Mac\\" Moreland. Dean was the original deejay, emcee, and rodeo announcer at Billy Bob's Texas, and most recently served as the main public address announcer for Dallas Cowboys home games at Cowboys Stadium. He has also served as public address announcer for the Cotton Bowl since 2009. His final football game at what is now AT&T; Stadium was Super Bowl XLV, allowing his voice to be heard before an international audience during the pregame ceremonies. In 2011, Dean appeared as a peripheral cast member on a cable reality show entitled Most Eligible Dallas. As of late September 2018, Jody Dean was removed from KLUV's morning show, with Jeff Miles being announced as his replacement. Rebekah Black remains as co-host alongside Miles. Dean's last show with KLUV was September 28, 2018.  Personal life  Dean's personal life has been tumultuous. Married four times, he has three children – two of whom are grown. An adoptee, Dean reunited with his birth-family in 2002 and maintains a close relationship with them. Raised in the Church of Christ, Dean is a published author (Finding God in the Evening News) and a frequent motivational and inspirational speaker. A professed Christian, Dean experienced a spiritual reawakening in 2002, but openly continues to wrestle with personal choices, as chronicled in a 2003 article authored by Elise Pierce for D Magazine.

(1999) Not Only the Market: The Role of the Market, Government, and the Civic Sector. Central European University Press. p. 34. This sector is also called the third sector, community sector, and nonprofit sector,See for example: in contrast to the public sector and the private sector. Civic sector or social sector are other terms for the sector, emphasizing its relationship to civil society. Richard Cornuelle coined the term “independent sector” and was one of the first scholars to point out the vast impact and unique mechanisms of this sector.\\"Reconsidering the Independent Sector\\" Accessed 3 June 2020. Given the diversity of organizations that comprise the sector, Peter Frumkin prefers \\"non-profit and voluntary sector\\". Significance to society and the economy The presence of a large non-profit sector is sometimes seen as an indicator of a healthy economy in local and national financial measurements.Verdier, D. (2002) Moving Money: Banking and Finance in the Industrialized World. Cambridge University Press. p. 145. With a growing number of non-profit organizations focused on social services, the environment, education and other unmet needs throughout society, the nonprofit sector is increasingly central to the health and well- being of society.(2007) \\"Laban: Volunteering Canterbury - 2007 Awards\\", June 20, 2007. Retrieved June 26, 2007. Peter Drucker suggests that the nonprofit sector provides an excellent outlet for a variety of society's labor and skills.(2007) \\"Drucker Wisdom: Leadership and the CEO.\\" The Blake Project.

The first two decades of the 20th century were characterized by a public zeal for social reform and social justice known as the Progressive Era. The newly founded National Association of Societies for Organizing Charity had immediate influence during that era. Its extensive field work helped organize new societies and strengthen others. Smaller cities became well-organized, with the South and Northwest particular areas of focus. To permit membership of Canadian societies, the association changed its name in 1912 to the American Association of Societies for Organizing Charity. In 1917, it became the American Association for Organizing Charity. These agencies increasingly were providing direct service to individuals and families. Pauperism, child welfare, juvenile justice, sanitation, tuberculosis, and other health issues were emergent problems for new and existing agencies. The American Red Cross fueled a nationwide fervor for social service. Founded in the United States in 1881, it was reorganized in 1905 to focus on military personnel. With this pivotal decision, the business of organizing charities quickly evolved into the business of social work. In 1976, Daniel Bell predicted that the third sector would become the predominant sector in society, as the knowledge class overcame the effects of the private sector.Bell, D. (1976) The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: a venture in social forecasting. Basic Books. p. 147. This presently holds true in a number of European countries. According to a recent study by Johns Hopkins University, the Netherlands has the largest third sector of 20 countries across Europe.Evers, A. and Laville, J. (2004) The Third Sector in Europe. Edward Elgar Publishing. p. 150. In Ireland the non-profit sector accounts for 8.8% of GDP.Building a caring civil society in Ireland: http://www.2into3.com In Sweden, the nonprofit sector is attributed with fostering a nationwide social change towards progressive economic, social and cultural policies,Muffels, J. (2001) Solidarity in Health and Social Care in Europe. Springer. p. 90. while in Italy the third sector is increasingly viewed as a primary employment source for the entire country.Antonelli, G. and De Liso, N. (2004) European Economic Integration and Italian Labour Policies. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. p. 228. In the United States, approximately 10% of GDP is attributable to the third sector. Donating to private religious organizations remains the most popular American cause, and all religious organizations are entirely privately funded because the government is limited from establishing or prohibiting a religion under the First Amendment.Christopher Eaton Gunn Third-sector Development: Making Up for the Market (Cornell University Press, 2004) 0801488818, 9780801488818 Partially Accessible Copy on Google Books (accessed July 6, 2009 on Google Book Search) Sub-sectors Although the voluntary, community and not-for-personal-profit sectors are frequently taken to compose the \\"Third Sector\\" each of these sectors or sub-sectors have quite different characteristics. The community sector is assumed to comprise volunteers (unpaid) while the voluntary sector are considered (confusingly) to employ staff working for a social or community purpose.Volresource In addition however, the not-for-personal-profit sector is also considered to include social firms (such as cooperatives and mutuals) and more recently governmental institutions (such as Housing Associations) that have been spun off from government, although still operating fundamentally as public service delivery organisations. These other types of institutions may be considered to be quasi-private or quasi-public sector rather than stemming from direct community benefit motivations. Concerns There have been long-ranging arguments regarding the financial accountability of the nonprofit sector throughout Western society.Gettler, L. (2007) \\"Non-profits can be more accountable,\\" The Age. 5/31/07. Retrieved 6/25/07. There is also ongoing concern whether the nonprofit sector will unequally draw retiring workers from the private sector as the currently large Baby Boomers age.The Conference Board. (2007) \\"Non-Profit Firms Face Many Challenges and Some Opportunities With Advent of Retirement of Baby-Boom Generation.\\" Earth Times. 5/31/07. Retrieved 6/25/07. Development of the third sector, it is argued, is linked to restructuring of the welfare state and further globalization of that process through neo-liberal strategies of the Washington consensus.Pawel Zaleski Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector, [in:] Gawin, Dariusz & Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: \\"Civil Society in the Making\\", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006 In a 2013 New York Times op-ed and radio podcast, The Charitable-Industrial Complex, Peter Buffett uses the terms \\"philanthropic colonialism\\" and \\"conscience laundering,\\" and describes his insights into \\"searching for answers with their right hand to problems that others in the room have created with their left\\" rather than systemic change.  Country-specific France Discourse on the \\"third sector\\" began in the 1970s in France as a result of the crisis in the welfare state.  India  In India this sector is commonly called the \\"joint sector\\", and includes the industries run in partnership by the state and Private Sector. In a wider sense the initial investment is made by the state and later the handling is done by the private sector. But here the private sector is responsible to the state when it comes to handling. Israel In Israel this sector is commonly called the \\"Third Sector\\", () and generally refers to non-profit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with the line between the two quite fine. These organizations generally fill a gap in the existing government or municipal service provision. Examples include United Hatzalah for emergency medical first response, Yad Sarah for free loan of medical equipment, Yad Eliezer for poverty relief efforts, Akim for assistance for the mentally handicapped, and SHALVA for children with special needs. United Kingdom The Cabinet Office of the British government until 2010 had an Office of the Third Sector that defined the \\"third sector\\" as \\"the place between State and (the) private sector.\\"UK definition of third sector The Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition Government renamed the department the Office for Civil Society. The term third sector has now been replaced in Government usage by the term Civil Society, or for while under the Cameron government, the term Big Society, which was devised by political advisers and which featured prominently in the Conservative Party's 2010 election campaign.  United States  The U.S. nonprofit sector consisted of approximately 1.56 million organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service in 2015. These reporting nonprofits identified $2.54 trillion in revenues and $5.79 trillion in assets in 2015. Over $400 billion in revenue comes through private support and fundraising. The U.S. nonprofit sector contributed an estimated $985.4 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015, composing 5.4 percent of the country's gross domestic product and employed 11 percent of the U.S. workforce in 2015. Each year, seven out of ten Americans donate to at least one charitable cause. Contributions are from two to 20 times higher in the U.S. than in other countries of comparable wealth and modernity.

Schulten's concept compacts silicon carbide-coated uranium granules into hard, billiard-ball-like graphite spheres to be used as fuel for a new high temperature, helium-cooled type of nuclear reactor. AVR reactor The idea took root and in due course a 46 MWth (megawatt thermal) experimental pebble bed reactor (the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor, or AVR reactor) was built at the Jülich Research Centre in Jülich, West Germany. It operated for 21 years but was shut down in the wake of Chernobyl. HTR-MODUL project Some of the last pebble fuel tested in the AVR was for a low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel cycle anticipated for use in the HTR-MODUL project design by Interatom/SIEMENS.  South African Pebble Bed Modular Reactor  Based on the AVR South Africa along with international partners developed an updated version called the PBMR. The TRISO fuel elements could use either Thorium or U-235 in the form of LEU as fuel. The project was cancelled in 2010 due to lack of investment, even though the technology has essentially been completely developed. HTR-10 China The technology is currently being developed mainly in China who currently operate a 10 MW test reactor (HTR-10) of this type. The Chinese are, as of 2015, building a commercial pebble-bed reactor: HTR-PM.

With 4,255 units located in eighteen 13-story towers and thirty-one two-story \\"garden apartment buildings\\", it is the largest housing development in the U.S. west of the Mississippi River.R. Daniel Foster, \\"Park La Brea, 70-year-old design still feels the love (and hate)\\", Los Angeles Times, February 24, 2012. (In February 25, 2012 print edition, p. E5, under headline \\"Park La Brea: monster or jewel?\\") It sits on of land with numerous lawns. Geography and transportation Park La Brea is bounded by 3rd Street on the north, Cochran Avenue on the east, 6th Street on the south, and Fairfax Avenue on the west. The complex is notable for its octagonal street layout, with many thoroughfares at a 45° angle of displacement relative to the English street grid. The neighborhood After the arrival of the Spanish in the 1780s, most of the area that is now Park La Brea became part of the Rancho La Brea land grant, and remained largely devoted to agriculture and petroleum production well into the 20th century. The growth of Hollywood and the Miracle Mile made the adjacent areas desirable centers for residential development in the 1920s, but the mid-rise apartment towers that give the district its current name were built later, between 1944 and 1948. Park La Brea represents something of a historical anomaly, having been built at a time when most visions of Los Angeles' development were dominated by low-rise tracts of single-family houses along freeway corridors. As the towers are relatively isolated from the rest of the Miracle Mile — set far back from major thoroughfares in a nod to Le Corbusier, they developed a reputation as \\"the projects\\", since they are reminiscent of such notorious housing developments as Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes and New York's Queensbridge. The street layout was created in a masonic pattern as a reference to the masonic heritage of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which built the complex toward the end of World War II and immediately thereafter. Metropolitan Life Insurance also constructed a sister complex, Parkmerced in San Francisco, which features a similar street layout as Park La Brea. At the same time, they built Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan, Parkchester in The Bronx, and Parkfairfax in Alexandria, Virginia just outside Washington, DC. Design Aerial view highlighting the massive Park La Brea complex The Park La Brea townhouses were designed by Leonard Schultz & Son (New York) with associate architect Earl T. Heitschmidt in 1941. The style of the architecture has been described as Modern Colonial. The Park La Brea Towers were designed by Leonard Schultz Associates with consulting architects Stanton + Kaufmann in 1948. Inspired by the innovative housing of Le Corbusier in Paris, this architectural team set out to create innovative multifamily housing. Their plans included square-block sized formations of town houses surrounding shared common green space. The combined shared lawn spaces creates both a large courtyard and tree-dappled open space. The Landmark Towers, in a revolutionary \\"X\\" structure with a unique placement, became icons of the Los Angeles skyline. The ingeniously designed plan ensured that every unit would enjoy expansive views. History and revitalization Carthay Center School Fairfax High School In the 2000s, Park La Brea had become a desirable rental community with its own community center, health club and pool, beauty parlor, and drycleaner in addition to its convenient proximity to local museums, Farmers Market (Los Angeles), and The Grove at Farmers Market shopping complex. In recent years, additional improvements have been made, such as adding new pools. The complex completed another $8 million renovation in 2010.

It is therefore an alcohol of gonane. The name is also used generically for compounds that are derived from this one by substituting other chemical groups for some of the hydrogen atoms, or modifying the bonds in the ring. These sterols or steroid alcohols are a subgroup of the steroids and an important class of organic molecules. They occur naturally in plants, animals, and fungi, and can be also produced by some bacteria (however likely with different functions). The most familiar type of animal sterol is cholesterol, which is vital to cell membrane structure, and functions as a precursor to fat-soluble vitamins and steroid hormones. While technically alcohols, sterols are classified by biochemists as lipids (fats in the broader sense of the term). The gonane skeleton, with the IUPAC recommended numbering of the carbon atoms  Types  Sterols of plants are called phytosterols and sterols of animals are called zoosterols. The most important zoosterol is cholesterol; notable phytosterols include campesterol, sitosterol, and stigmasterol. Ergosterol is a sterol present in the cell membrane of fungi, where it serves a role similar to cholesterol in animal cells.  Role in biochemistry  Sterols and related compounds play essential roles in the physiology of eukaryotic organisms. For example, cholesterol forms part of the cellular membrane in animals, where it affects the cell membrane's fluidity and serves as secondary messenger in developmental signaling. In humans and other animals, corticosteroids such as cortisol act as signaling compounds in cellular communication and general metabolism. Sterols are common components of human skin oils.  Phytosterols as a nutritional supplement  Phytosterols, more commonly known as plant sterols, have been shown in clinical trials to block cholesterol absorption sites in the human intestine, thus helping to reduce cholesterol absorption in humans. They are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as a food supplement; however, there is some concern that they may block absorption not only of cholesterol, but of other important nutrients as well. At present, the American Heart Association has recommended that supplemental plant sterols be taken only by those diagnosed with elevated cholesterol, and has particularly recommended that they not be taken by pregnant women or nursing mothers. Preliminary research has shown that phytosterols may have anticancer effects.  Chemical classification and structure  Sterols are a subgroup of steroids with a hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the A-ring. They are amphipathic lipids synthesized from acetyl-coenzyme A via the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. The overall molecule is quite flat. The hydroxyl group on the A ring is polar. The rest of the aliphatic chain is non-polar.

Geography Sydney Road starts at the northern end of Royal Parade at the boundary of Parkville and Brunswick and continues north through Brunswick, Coburg, Coburg North, Hadfield, Fawkner, Campbellfield, Somerton and Craigieburn, where it joins the Hume Freeway.Google Map The section passing through Brunswick and Coburg, between Park Street at its southern end and Bell Street near the site of the former Pentridge prison, at its northern end, is Melbourne's longest continuous shopping strip, with an abundance of small businesses and a variety of restaurants and coffee shops, clothing stores, places of worship, and community services. It is well known for its wedding fashion shops, discount shopping and a number of specialist food stores.  Transport  Tram route 19 runs along the inner section of Sydney Road, starting at Bakers Road in Coburg North and ending in Elizabeth Street at Flinders Street station in the city. The Upfield railway line from the city loop runs parallel to Sydney Road about 200m to the west, with stations at Jewell, Brunswick, Anstey, Moreland and Coburg. The road has historically been signed as Route 31, but since the opening of the Craigieburn Bypass has been relegated to Route 55. History North end of the road, in Fawkner at the Western Ring Road interchange. In February 1841, George Jones opened a retail store on Sydney Road in Pentridge. The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s caused businesses to flourish on Sydney Road. Many were established to supply the miners on their trek north to the gold fields. Numerous hotels were built along Sydney Road in this period including the Brunswick Hotel, the Cornish Arms Hotel, the Sarah Sands Hotel, the Cumberland Arms Hotel, the Edinburgh Castle Hotel and the Court House Hotel. It was originally called Pentridge Road, as it connected the city with Pentridge prison. It was renamed Sydney Road In 1859. The early hub of business activity was between Weston Street and Albert Street in Brunswick, but by the 1880s businesses were rapidly being established beyond Albion Street. In the 1920s the clothing and textile industries grew; evidence of their presence in the area can still be seen in the existence of tailors shops, fabric shops and an abundance of wedding gown shops. During the 1930s the Unemployed Workers Movement held street meetings on the corner of Sydney Road and Phoenix Street. These meetings were harassed and suppressed by the police, under the direct orders of Police Commissioner, General Thomas Blamey. Young Australian artist Noel Counihan played a significant part in this campaign. The State Government, concerned about the public sympathy being generated, eventually changed the law in regard to obstruction, with no requirement of permits to speak. A Free Speech memorial was built outside the Mechanics' Institute on the corner of Sydney and Glenlyon Roads to commemorate the success of the free speech fights. Counihan's work as an artist and local resident is also commemorated by the Counihan Gallery on Sydney Road run by the City of Moreland Council. During the second world war and in the 1950s, Sydney Road came alive with late night shopping. This included late night shopping parades with floats. The construction of the Barkly Square shopping complex immediately to the east of Sydney Road in the 1980s coincided with a decline in the success of the strip. The Sydney Road Brunswick Association was formed in the early 1990s to provide a focus for action to revive the strip, utilising a range of community development and marketing techniques. With postwar immigration, many migrant families established businesses. The multicultural nature of business on Sydney Road is reflected in the cuisines offered by its restaurants and cafes. Italian, Greek and Balkan cuisines were once the dominant non-Anglo fare, but since the 1980s Sydney Road's eateries have diversified and increased in number, so that the food available now includes Lebanese, Afghan, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, North and East African, Balinese, Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Nepali cuisines. In the early 2000s, several hotels (pubs) were renovated and have become very popular live music venues. Property prices in Brunswick and Coburg (south of Bell Street) rose sharply in the 1990s and early 2000s. The signs of gentrification are increasingly evident in the southern quarter of Sydney Road, with a rising number of clothing boutiques and many new eateries serving eclectic and contemporary Australian 'fusion' cuisine in stylish, designer environments, producing an increasingly diversified street life. As a major activity centre in Moreland, Sydney Road is a key component in any strategies of urban intensification to meet the requirements of the Victorian Government's metropolitan strategy, Melbourne 2030. In his first speech in December 2006, newly elected Moreland Mayor Mark O'Brien proposed turning the entire 4.5 km commercial strip between Brunswick Road and Bell Street into a promenade, which would transform the usually congested Sydney Road into one of the longest pedestrian streets in the world.Sydney Road boulevard of dreams, The Age, 6/1/07 Landmarks Sydney Road contains many historical landmarks. Many of the hotels date from the 1850s, including the Cornish Arms hotel and the Sarah Sands Hotel on the corner of Brunswick Road. The Bombay Rock at the corner of Phoenix Street, was one of the pre-eminent rock music venues in Melbourne in the 1970s and 80s. Brunswick Town Hall, built in 1876 on the corner of Dawson Street, is an imposing Victorian edifice. It was saved from planned destruction by the municipal council in 1973-1974 when Vic and Vida Little, along with the Brunswick Progress Association, led a successful campaign to preserve it. The building was significantly extended and renovated in the early 1990s to upgrade the library, offices and public assembly spaces. Diagonally opposite from the Town Hall stands the Mechanics Institute, built in 1868, and used for worker education and social activities. A monument to the Free Speech fights of the 1930s stands near the corner. The history of many of the single and double story shop fronts can be seen in the names and years moulded into the upper portions of the building facades. The Mechanics Institute now provides a popular performance space and offices for local arts administrators.  Notable institutions  Sydney Road has a number of institutions that are notable for their contribution to the broader cultural life of Melbourne. The Mediterranean supermarket, between Victoria and Blyth Streets is a long- established, large and well-known source of Italian and other European foodstuffs. The A1 Middle Eastern Bakery, at the top of Brunswick Hill is the most high-profile of a number of such bakeries in the area, well known for products such as flat bread that are supplied across Melbourne. A tour of these bakeries forms part of Melbourne's annual Food and Wine festival. Savers is a very popular supermarket-sized second-hand clothing store, located between Albert Street and Glenlyon Road. Well known for its bridal shops, a recent arrival in Sydney Road is Mariana Hardwick's emporium in the eponymously (re)named building between Sparta Place and Ballarat Street. Events Sydney Road street party, 2004 Each year the City of Moreland Council organises the Sydney Road Street Party, usually on a Sunday at the end of February, running from midday to 7pm. Sydney Road is closed to traffic from Union Street to Victoria Street in Brunswick. The Street Party launches the annual Brunswick Music Festival. Several stages are erected for a variety of ethnic, folk and rock music to be performed live. Hundreds of community groups and local businesses set up stalls on the road. Street theatre and kids shows, and a wide variety of tasty food from many cuisines is there to be sampled. Tens of thousands of people enjoy a day of festivities taking over Sydney Road. On 28 May 2006 Australia's first ever Cyclovia was held on Sydney Road. From 8am–2pm the road was closed to motorised vehicles (except trams) between Brunswick Road and Bell Street, leaving the roadway free to be used by cyclists. A second Cyclovia had been planned for Sunday, 17 February 2008, to tie in with a closure of Royal Parade and Swanston Street as part of the Sustainable Living Festival.http://goingsolar.com.au/pdf/transport/newsletters/transport_newsletter_43.pdf However, the event was criticised by the RACV which claimed it was \\"a nuisance\\".Susan Robson, 'Cyclovia flops', Moreland Leader, 14/1/08, p.9 The event was re-scheduled and took place on Sunday, 13 April 2008. Cafés along Sydney Road reported a brisk trade during the Cyclovia, while some other businesses complained they had fewer customers. Moreland councillor Mark Higginbotham called for the event to be held more often. In the early hours of 22 September 2012 Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) employee Jill Meagher was abducted, raped and killed as she walked down Sydney Road. Annually, since her death, residents have marched on Sydney Road to honour her memory.Jill Meagher remembered as thousands march down Sydney Road in Melbourne, ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), 30 September 2013 See also  References  Cited text * External links * Sydney Road Brunswick Association * Sydney Road Street Party Category:Streets in Melbourne Category:Highways and freeways in Melbourne Category:Shopping districts and streets in Australia ","title":"Sydney Road, Melbourne"},{"id":"1101340","text":"I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead (An Anthology) is a two-disc compilation album by American singer-songwriter Warren Zevon, released on Rhino Records in 1996.

He was created by writers Charles Biro and Dick Wood and artist Al Camy. The character disappeared from publications until a 1980s revival under Chuck Dixon that lasted for several years. He has appeared intermittently since then under multiple publishers, sometimes updating his story to the present day. Publication history Golden Age Airboy debuted in Air Fighters Comics #2 (cover-date Nov. 1942), an omnibus series featuring a variety of aviator heroes. The series was renamed Airboy Comics with the twenty-third issue, vol. 2, #11 (Dec. 1945), and ran 89 issues, through vol. 10, #4 (May 1953). In the early issues, Biro wrote the scripts with Dave Wood and drew the covers, Al Camy was the initial story artist. He was followed by Tony DiPreta and, beginning with Air Fighters No. 10 (July 1943), Fred Kida, who would become closely associated with the series. Ernie Schroeder became the regular artist with Airboy Comics #vol. 5, No. 11 (Dec. 1948), through the end of the series' run, with Dan Barry, Maurice Del Bourgo, Carmine Infantino, and others supplying an occasional story.Air Fighters Comics at the Grand Comics DatabaseAirboy Comics at the Grand Comics Database The two consecutive series contained backup stories about other aviators, including Skywolf, Iron Ace, the Black Angel, the Bald Eagle, the Flying Dutchman, the Flying Fool, and the prototypical comic book swamp monster, the Heap. Airboy's most frequently recurring supporting character was the German aviator Valkyrie, who fought on the side of the Axis but then defected to the Allies. Hillman stopped publishing comics in 1953. Two issues were reprinted in 1973 and a trade paperback entitled Valkyrie!: From the Pages of Air Fighters and the Airboy was published in 1982 with five stories from Air Fighters Comics vol. 2, #s 2 and 7 and Airboy Comics vol. 2, #12, and vol. 3 #s 6 and 12. Modern era In 1986, Eclipse Comics published a new Airboy series, updated to the modern era, starring the son of the original character. The 50-issue comic (July 15, 1986 – October 1989), which ran as a half-sized (16-page) bi-weekly through issue No. 33 (November 1, 1987) and monthly thereafter, reintroduced many of the supporting characters from the old series, such as Valkyrie and a Japanese fighter pilot named Hirota, and guest-starred many of the characters who had appeared as backups in the original comics. Chuck Dixon scripted with the occasional assistance of Tim Truman, with Truman, Ron Randall and Stan Woch the main illustrators.Airboy (Eclipse, 1986 Series) at the Grand Comics Database Spinoffs from the Eclipse series include the one-shots Airboy–Mr. Monster Special (Aug. 1987),Airboy series at the Grand Comics Database Airboy Meets the Prowler (Dec. 1987), The Air Fighters Meet Sgt.

Prisoner of the Past was also published in a hardcover edition. Starting in 1988, Eclipse also published Air Fighters Classics, a six issue bimonthly series dedicated to reprinting the original Golden Age stories of Airboy and related characters. In 2007, Moonstone Books announced plans to revive the World War II character in new stories written by 1980s Airboy writer Dixon. However, the revival did not see print until March 2009, when Moonstone released the one-shot Airboy – 1942: Best of Enemies.Airboy – 1942: Best of Enemies at the Grand Comics Database Two issues of Airfighters, featuring Airboy, followed in 2010.Airfighters (Moonstone, 2010 Series) at the Grand Comics Database The Valkyrie character was ranked 45th in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list. In 2012, Antarctic Press started publishing Airboy: Deadeye by Chuck Dixon, Gianluca Piredda and Ben Dunn. In 2014, Image Comics began publishing a new Airboy comic, written by James Robinson and illustrated by Greg Hinkle. This series begins with fictionalised versions of Robinson and Hinkle engaging in an orgy of drink, drugs and sex while trying to find the inspiration to write a new Airboy series, only for the \\"real\\" Airboy to enter their world—much to his horror. Fictional character biography The first Airboy was David (\\"Davy\\") Nelson II, the son of an expert pilot and, despite his youth, a crack flyer himself. His friend, inventor and Franciscan friar Brother Francis Martier, had created a highly maneuverable prototype aircraft that flew by flapping its wings, like a bird. Martier, however, was killed while testing it, and Davy inherited both the plane and a uniform, which had apparently been in Martier's family since the French Revolution. Davy soon christened himself \\"Airboy\\", and in his seemingly sentient new plane, \\"Birdie\\", helped the Allies during World War II. Airboy confronted such weird antagonists as intelligent rats, the mysterious Misery – whose Airtomb imprisoned the souls of dead pilots – and his cleavage-baring Nazi nemesis, Valkyrie, a German aviator who later became his ally. He also contended with a recurring villain, the occultist Zzed. After the conclusion of World War II, David Nelson II continued to work as a freelance pilot and mercenary for a time, but he eventually retired from combat flying and stored Birdie in a barn outside his California estate. He had a son, whom he named David Nelson III, and founded an aircraft manufacturing company, through which he became very wealthy. In the mid-1980s, David Nelson II was assassinated by mercenaries from the South American nation of Bogantilla. When David Nelson III discovered that his father had been assassinated, he began to investigate the circumstances which had led up to his father's death. He soon discovered his father's mothballed plane and uniform and teamed up with a number of the surviving Air Fighters to face many of the same enemies as David Nelson II, as well as South American dictators, Soviets, pirates and corporate criminals. Homages The first volume in the Wild Cards novel series edited by George R.R. Martin includes a character called Jetboy, an Airboy analogue created by Howard Waldrop who wanted to write an Airboy story. The lead character of publisher America's Best Comics' graphic novel Top 10: The Forty-Niners is Jetlad, whom historian Jess Nevins calls, \\"an analogue of Charles Biro's teenaged aviator Airboy.\\" Collected editions Antarctic Press *Airboy: Deadeye collects Airboy: Deadeye #1–5, Softcover: 128 Pages, Publisher: Antarctic Press, October 2013, Eclipse Comics Almost the entirety of Eclipse's Airboy content has been republished by IDW: *Airboy Archives Volume 1 collects Airboy #1–16, Softcover: 312 Pages, Publisher: IDW, March 2014, *Airboy Archives Volume 2 collects Airboy #17–25, Valkyrie #1–3 (1987), Softcover: 300 Pages, Publisher: IDW, September 2014, *Airboy Archives Volume 3 collects Airboy #26–34, Airmaidens Special, Airboy–Mr. Monster Special, Airboy Meets The Prowler, Softcover: 316 Pages, Publisher: IDW, March 2015, *Airboy Archives Volume 4 collects Airboy #35–40, Airfighters Meet Sgt.

After the publication of fellow patrol member Andy McNab's Bravo Two Zero in 1993, Ryan published his own account of his experiences during the Bravo Two Zero mission in 1995, entitled The One That Got Away. Both accounts have been heavily criticised by former SAS member and explorer Michael Asher, who retraced the patrol's footsteps and claimed to have largely debunked both accounts as well as the then-SAS regimental sergeant major Peter Ratcliffe and the other surviving members of Bravo Two Zero in their own published accounts, as largely fictionalised versions of events. Since retiring from the British Army Ryan has published several fiction and non-fiction books, including Strike Back, which was subsequently adapted into a television series for Sky 1, and co-created the ITV action series Ultimate Force. He has also presented or appeared in numerous television documentaries connected to the military or law enforcement. Early life, education and military service Ryan was born in Rowlands Gill in County Durham. After attending Hookergate School, he enrolled in the British Army at the age of 16. Ryan's cousin was a member of the reservist 23 SAS Regiment and invited Ryan to come up and \\"see what it's like to be in the army\\". Ryan did this nearly every weekend, almost passing selection several times, but he was too young to continue and do 'test week'. When he was old enough, he passed selection into 23 SAS. Shortly after that he began selection for the regular 22 SAS Regiment and joined 'B' Squadron as a medic. Needing a parent regiment, Ryan and a soldier who had joined 22 SAS from the Royal Navy, spent eight weeks with the Parachute Regiment before returning to 'B' Squadron. He spent the next seven years carrying out both covert and overt operations with the SAS around the world. Journalist John Pilger wrote in October 2009, \\"Incredibly, the Thatcher government had continued to support the defunct Pol Pot regime in the United Nations and even sent the SAS to train his exiled troops in camps in Thailand and Malaysia.\\" Bravo Two Zero Ryan was a team member of the ill-fated eight-man Bravo Two Zero SAS patrol in Iraq during the Gulf War. The patrol was sent to \\"gather intelligence,... find a good LUP (lying up position) and set up an OP\\" on the main supply route (MSR) between Baghdad and North-Western Iraq, and eventually take out the Scud TELs. However they were compromised and forced to head towards Syria on foot. Ryan made SAS history with the \\"longest escape and evasion by an SAS trooper or any other soldier\\", covering more than SAS trooper Jack Sillito had in the Sahara Desert in 1942. Ryan completed a tab from an observation point on the Iraqi MSR between Baghdad and North-Western Iraq to the Syrian Border. During his escape, Ryan suffered injuries from drinking water contaminated with nuclear waste. Besides suffering severe muscle atrophy, he lost a potentially fatal and did not return to operational duties. Instead, he selected and trained potential recruits, before being honourably discharged from the SAS in 1994. On 29 June 1991 Ryan was awarded the Military Medal \\"in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the Gulf in 1991\\" although the award was not gazetted until 15 December 1998 together with the equally belated announcement of Andy McNab's Distinguished Conduct Medal. Zaire Ryan was also a member of an SAS team sent to protect the British Embassy in Kinshasa, Zaire. The team were to ensure that all British diplomatic staff were safely evacuated from the country before the First Congo War. The operation was meant to last only three days, but eventually took one month. Post-military career Since leaving the SAS, Ryan has written several books. The One That Got Away, his fictionalised account of the Bravo Two Zero mission, is well known, as are fictional best-sellers like Strike Back (2007), which was adapted into the TV show, and Firefight (September 2008). He also writes fictional books for teenage readers, including the Alpha Force Series and \\"Code Red\\", and has written a romantic novel, The Fisherman's Daughter, under the pseudonym Molly Jackson. In addition to his writing Ryan has contributed to several television series and video games. In 2002 Ryan co-created and appeared in ITV's action series, Ultimate Force, playing the role of Blue Troop leader Staff Sergeant Johnny Bell in the first series as well as acting as the military adviser for the video game I.G.I.-2: Covert Strike, helping to make the game more accurate to real-life military operations, tactics, weapons and equipment. Ryan was the titular star of BBC One's Hunting Chris Ryan in 2003 which later aired on the Military Channel as 'Special Forces Manhunt'. In 2004 Ryan produced several programmes titled Terror Alert: Could You Survive, in each programme he demonstrated how to survive disasters including, flooding, nuclear terrorist attack, mass blackouts, and plane hijackings. In 2005, Ryan presented a Sky One show called How Not to Die, detailing how to survive various life-threatening situations, including violent burglary, mugging, and violent attacks. In 2007 Ryan trained and managed a six-man team to represent Team GB at Sure for Men's Extreme Pamplona Chase in Spain during the Running of the Bulls and also appeared in an episode of the Derren Brown series, Mind Control with Derren Brown, where he booby-trapped a course for Brown to follow whilst blindfolded. Ryan presented the television series Elite World Cops, also broadcast as Armed and Dangerous, which aired on Bravo in 2008. In the show, Ryan spends time with various law enforcement agencies around the world, giving him an insight to the war on terrorism and drug trade but from a law enforcement perspective. Personal life Ryan is single and has a daughter, but his experiences in Iraq caused him to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. Following his consumption of radioactive water during his Bravo Two Zero escape, he was warned not to have any children in the future.

In acid soils, these materials react as a base and neutralize soil acidity. This often improves plant growth and increases the activity of soil bacteria, but oversupply may result in harm to plant life. Liming can also improve aggregate stability on clay soils. For this purpose structure lime, products containing calcium oxide (CaO) or hydroxide (Ca(OH)2 in mixes with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) are often used. Structure liming can reduce losses of clay and nutrients from soil aggregates . Liming of a field in Devon The degree to which a given amount of lime per unit of soil volume will increase soil pH depends on the buffer capacity of the soil (this is generally related to soil cation exchange capacity or CEC). Soils with low CEC will usually show a more marked pH increase than soils with high CEC. But the low-CEC soils will witness more rapid leaching of the added bases, and so will see a quicker return to original acidity unless additional liming is done. Over-liming is most likely to occur on soil which has low CEC, such as sand which is deficient in buffering agents such as organic matter and clay.Soil Acidity and Liming (Overview) Most acid soils are saturated with aluminium rather than hydrogen ions. The acidity of the soil is therefore a result of hydrolysis of aluminium.Turner, R.C. and Clark J.S., 1966, Lime potential in acid clay and soil suspensions. Trans. Comm. II & IV Int. Soc. Soil Science, pp. 208-215 This concept of \\"corrected lime potential\\" to define the degree of base saturation in soils became the basis for procedures now used in soil testing laboratories to determine the \\"lime requirement\\" of soils. Note this link loads slowly An agricultural study at the Faculty of Forestry in Freising, Germany that compared tree stocks 2 and 20 years after liming found that liming promotes nitrate leaching and decreases the phosphorus content of some leaves.Huber C, Baier R, Gottlein A, Weis W.

It may also be used for antimony, thallium, or bismuth poisoning, but the evidence for these uses is not very strong. It is given by injection into a muscle. Common side effects include high blood pressure, pain at the site of the injection, vomiting, and fever. It is not recommended in people with peanut allergies. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Dimercaprol works by binding with heavy metals. Dimercaprol was first made during World War II. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States a course of treatment costs more than . Medical uses Dimercaprol has long been the mainstay of chelation therapy for lead or arsenic poisoning, and it is an essential drug. It is also used as an antidote to the chemical weapon Lewisite. Nonetheless, because it can have serious adverse effects, researchers have also pursued development of less toxic analogues, such as succimer. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which copper builds up inside the liver and other tissues. Dimercaprol is a copper chelating agent that has been approved by the FDA to treat Wilson's disease.  Mechanism of action  Arsenic and some other heavy metals act by chemically reacting with adjacent thiol residues on metabolic enzymes, creating a chelate complex that inhibits the affected enzyme's activity.Goldman M, Dacre JC. (1989) Lewisite: its chemistry, toxicology, and biological effects. Rev Environ Contam Toxicol 110: 75-115 Dimercaprol competes with the thiol groups for binding the metal ion, which is then excreted in the urine. Dimercaprol is itself toxic, with a narrow therapeutic range and a tendency to concentrate arsenic in some organs. Other drawbacks include the need to administer it by painful intramuscular injection.Mückter H, Liebl B, Reichl FX et al. (1997) Are we ready to replace dimercaprol (BAL) as an arsenic antidote? Human and Experimental Toxicology 16: 460-465 Serious side effects include nephrotoxicity and hypertension. Dimercaprol has been found to form stable chelates in vivo with many other metals including inorganic mercury, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, gold, and nickel. However, it is not necessarily the treatment of choice for toxicity to these metals. Dimercaprol has been used as an adjunct in the treatment of the acute encephalopathy of lead toxicity. It is a potentially toxic drug, and its use may be accompanied by multiple side effects. Although treatment with dimercaprol will increase the excretion of cadmium, there is a concomitant increase in renal cadmium concentration, so that its use in case of cadmium toxicity is to be avoided. It does, however, remove inorganic mercury from the kidneys; but is not useful in the treatment of alkylmercury or phenylmercury toxicity. Dimercaprol also enhances the toxicity of selenium and tellurium, so it is not to be used to remove these elements from the body. History Its original name reflects its origins as a compound secretly developed by British biochemists at Oxford University during World War II as an antidote for lewisite, a now-obsolete arsenic-based chemical warfare agent.

In the 1890s, European \\"continental conservative\\" clerics detected signs of modernism or classical liberalism, which the Pope had condemned in the Syllabus of Errors in 1864, among the beliefs and teachings of many members of the American Catholic hierarchy, who denied the charges.Frank K. Flinn and J. Gordon Melton, Encyclopedia of Catholicism (2007) p 19 Pope Leo XIII wrote against these ideas in a letter to Cardinal James Gibbons, published as Testem benevolentiae nostrae. The Pope lamented an America where church and state are \\"dissevered and divorced\\" and wrote of his preference for a closer relationship between the Catholic Church and the State along European lines.Letter to Cardinal Gibbons, Acta Sanctae Sedis, vol. 31, pp. 470 et seq., https://www.vatican.va/archive/ass/documents/ASS-31-1898-99-ocr.pdf, available in translation at http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13teste.htm. The long-term result was that the Irish Catholics who largely controlled the Catholic Church in the United States increasingly demonstrated total loyalty to the Pope, and suppressed traces of liberal thought in the Catholic colleges. At bottom, the conflict was cultural, as the continental conservative Europeans, angered at the heavy attacks on the Catholic Church in Germany, France and other countries, moved to stamp out the individualist attitude in America.James Hennessy, S.J., American Catholics: A history of the Roman Catholic community in the United States (1981) pp 194-203 In Europe During the French Third Republic, which began in 1870, the power and influence of French Catholicism steadily declined. The French government passed laws bearing more and more stringently on the Church, and the majority of French citizens did not object. Indeed, they began to look toward legislators and not to the clergy for guidance. Observing this, and encouraged by the action of Pope Leo XIII, who, in 1892 called on French Catholics loyally to accept the Republic, several young French priests set themselves to stop the decline in Church power. They determined that because the Church was predominantly sympathetic to the monarchists and hostile to the Republic, and because it held itself aloof from modern philosophies and practices, people had turned away from it. The progressive priests believed that the Church did too little to cultivate individual character, and put too much emphasis on the routine side of religious observance. They also noted that Catholicism was not making much use of modern means of propaganda, such as social movements, the organization of clubs, or the establishing of settlements. In short, the Church had not adapted to modern needs, and these priests endeavored to correct this. They began a domestic apostolate which had for one of its rallying cries, \\"Allons au peuple.\\" (\\"Let us go to the people.\\") They agitated for social and philanthropic projects, for a closer relationship between priests and parishioners, and for general cultivation of personal initiative, both in clergy and in laity. Not unnaturally, they looked for inspiration to America. There they saw a vigorous Church among a free people, with priests publicly respected, and with a note of aggressive zeal in every project of Catholic enterprise. Isaac Hecker Father Isaac Hecker In the 1890s, this issue was brought forcefully to the attention of European Catholics by Comtesse de Ravilliax's translation of a biography of Isaac Thomas Hecker by Paulist father Walter Elliott, with the introduction by Abbé Felix Klein drawing the most ire from the Vatican. His biography, written in English by the Paulist Father Elliott in 1891, was translated into French six years later and proved an inspiration to the French. Father Hecker, commonly known as \\"The Yellow Dart,\\" had been dead for years at this point and had never been viewed by the Pope with disfavor. However, this translation of Hecker's biography and Abbé Klein's introduction to the book made him appear to have been much more of a radical than he in fact was.Frank J. Coppa, The modern papacy since 1789 (1998) p 138 Hecker had sought to reach out to Protestant Americans by stressing certain points of Catholic teaching, but Pope Leo XIII understood this effort as a watering down of Catholic doctrine. Hecker also had used terms such as \\"natural virtue,\\" which to the pope suggested the Pelagian heresy. Because members of the Paulist Fathers took promises but not the vows of religious orders, many concluded that Hecker denied the need for external authority.David J. O'Brien, Isaac Hecker: an American Catholic (1992) p 384 The French liberals particularly admired Father Hecker for his love of modern times and modern liberty and his devotion to liberal Catholicism. Indeed, they took him as a kind of patron saint. Inspired by Father Hecker's life and character, the activist French priests undertook the task of persuading their fellow-priests to accept the political system, and then to break out of their isolation, put themselves in touch with the intellectual life of the country, and take an active part in the work of social amelioration. In 1897, the movement received a new impetus when Monsignor Denis J. O'Connell, former Rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, spoke on behalf of Father Hecker's ideas at the Catholic Congress in Fribourg. Opposition Catholics who saw striking differences between the Church's treatment by adherents of classical liberalism took alarm at what they considered to be symptoms of pernicious modernism. In France the conservatives were, almost to a man, anti-republicans who distrusted and disliked the democratic abbés. They complained to the Pope, and in 1898, Abbé Charles Maignen wrote an ardent polemic against the new movement called Le Père Hecker, est-il un saint? (\\"Is Father Hecker a Saint?\\"). The European conservatives were reinforced by German American Catholic bishops in the Midwest, who were distrustful of the Irish, who increasingly dominated the American Catholic Church.Hennessy, American Catholics: A history of the Roman Catholic community in the United States (1981) pp 194 Arthur Preuss (1871–1934) the foremost German Catholic theologian in the United States, was an outspoken enemy, filling his scholarly journal Fortnightly Review with attacks.Rory T. Conley, Arthur Preuss: Journalist and Voice of German and Conservative Catholics in America, 1871-1934 (1998) Many powerful Vatican authorities also opposed the \\"Americanist\\" tendency. But Pope Leo XIII was reluctant to chastise the American Catholics, whom he had often praised for their loyalty and faith. In 1899 he wrote Cardinal Gibbons, \\"It is clear...that those opinions that, taken as a whole, some designate as 'Americanism' cannot have our approval.\\"Russell Shaw, \\"'Americanism': Phantom Heresy or Fact?\\" National Catholic Register 10 May, 2013 Suppression Pope Leo XIII In the encyclical Longinqua oceani (1895; \\"Wide Expanse of the Ocean\\"), Pope Leo XIII indicated a generally positive view of the American Church, commenting mostly on the success of Catholicism in the US but also noting the view that the Church \\"would bring forth more abundant fruits if, in addition to liberty, she enjoyed the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority.\\" Leo warned the American church hierarchy not to support this unique system of separation of church and state.Thomas E. Woods, The church confronts modernity (2007) p. 179 In 1898, Leo lamented an America where church and state are \\"dissevered and divorced\\", and wrote of his preference for a closer relationship between the Catholic Church and the State, along European lines.Flinn and Melton, Encyclopedia of Catholicism (2007) p. 19 Finally, in his letter Testem benevolentiae nostrae (January 22, 1899; \\"Witness to Our Benevolence\\") addressed to Cardinal James Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore, Leo condemned other forms of Americanism. Catholicism had long allowed nations to tolerate other religions, but the Church believes that the Catholic Faith must be favored when possible. Pope Leo XIII also expressed concerns about the Cultural liberalism of some American Catholics: he pointed out that the faithful could not decide doctrine for themselves (see Cafeteria Catholic). He emphasized that Catholics should obey the magisterial teaching authority of the Church. In general, he deemed it dangerous to expose children to schools that would prove to be detrimental to their Christian upbringing.Leo XIII, Sapientiae Christianae(1890) art. 42 The Pope derided the idea that all opinions should be aired publicly, as he felt certain speech could harm general morality. He also condemned the biography of Hecker and Americanism.Gerald P. Fogarty, The Vatican and the American hierarchy from 1870 to 1965 (1985) p 177 This document condemned the following doctrines or tendencies: #undue insistence on interior initiative in the spiritual life, as leading to disobedience #attacks on religious vows, and disparagement of the value of religious orders in the modern world #minimizing Catholic doctrine #minimizing the importance of spiritual direction The brief did not assert that Hecker and the Americans had held any unsound doctrine on the above points. Instead, it merely stated that if such opinions did exist, the local hierarchy was to eradicate them. The American response James Gibbons, cardinal archbishop of Baltimore In response to Testem benevolentiae, Cardinal Gibbons and many other American prelates replied to Rome with a near-unanimous voice, denying that American Catholics held any of the condemned views. They asserted that Hecker had never countenanced the slightest departure from Catholic principles in their fullest and most strict application.John Tracy Ellis, The life of James Cardinal Gibbons (1963) pp 147-8 The disturbance caused by the condemnation was slight; almost the entire laity and a considerable part of the clergy were unaware of this affair. However, the pope's brief did end up strengthening the position of the conservatives in France. Leo's pronouncements effectively ended the Americanist movement and curtailed the activities of American progressive Catholics. Historian Thomas McAvoy argues there were grave long-term negative effects on the intellectual life of American Catholics.McAvoy, 1959 John Ireland, archbishop of Saint Paul, Minnesota and a foremost modernizer, had to walk on eggshells to avoid condemnation for his views. Ireland sought to adapt the social and religious values of the Catholic Church to American political and cultural, especially religious liberty, separation of church and state, cooperation with non- Catholics, and lay participation in ecclesiastical decisionmaking. Many of his ideas were implicitly condemned by Pope Leo XIII's Testem benevolentiae (1899) as a heresy and Americanism. Nevertheless, Ireland continued to promote his views. When similar European views were condemned by Pope Pius X's 'Pascendi Dominici gregis' (1907), Ireland actively campaigned against what the pope declared the heresy of modernism. This apparently inconsistent behavior stemmed from Ireland's concept of a \\"golden mean\\" between \\"ultraconservatism\\", rendering the Church irrelevant, and \\"ultraliberalism,\\" discarding the Church's message.Neil T. Storch, John Ireland And The Modernist Controversy. Church History (1985) 54#3 pp 353-365. in JSTOR \\"Americanization\\" At the same time, there was a strong difference of opinion among the bishops of the United States as to how best to serve and counsel their largely immigrant parishioners. Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore and Archbishop John J. Keane of Dubuque were among those who favored encouraging Catholics to become assimilated and take an active part in American society. To this end, they tended to be strong supporters of Catholic higher education. More conservative bishops, such as Archbishop Michael Corrigan of New York, were concerned that the more that Catholics adapted to the Protestant culture, the more likely they were to lose their culture, heritage and religion. Corrigan was a strong supporter of national parishes to serve Catholics of a particular shared ethnicity.

Known as the Bard of Dundee, Marra was a solo performer who toured the UK and performed in arts centres, theatres, folk clubs and village halls. While mainly known as a songwriter, he also worked extensively in theatre, radio and television. His songwriting was rooted in Scottish life and he found an audience within and beyond the folk music scene, which led to him working as a support musician for performers including Van Morrison, The Proclaimers, Barbara Dickson and Deacon Blue. His song \\"Hermless\\" was somewhat humorously suggested as a potential Scottish national anthem. Origins Marra was brought up in the Lochee district of Dundee, the son of a printer and a schoolteacher. His first public performance, in the 1950s, was at a Christmas party given by NCR, formerly a major employer in the city, with a large factory there. Musical career Marra attended Lawside Academy, leaving school at 15 and trying a variety of trades – electrician, baker and builder – before heading for the folk clubs of London. There he played in the band Hen's Teeth with fellow Scottish songwriter Dougie MacLean, before forming the band Skeets Boliver with his brother Chris. Marra played with Skeets Boliver in the mid-1970s, alongside drummer Brian McDermott, saxman Peter McGlone, Gus Foy, Stewart Ivins, and Chris Marra. Signed to Thunderbird Records at an inopportune time, when punk was gaining popularity, the band released two singles, \\"Streethouse Door\\" and \\"Moonlight in Jeopardy\\", to critical success. They also featured in an edition of the BBC Everyman religious programme, \\"I Can't See the Light.\\" In September 2007 Marra released the CD Quintet, featuring five songs about five musicians – Peerie Willie Johnson, Peter McGlone, Thomas Fraser, Martin Carthy and Dr. John. In November 2007, he appeared in a new production of The Demon Barber at Perth Theatre in Scotland where he performed all his music live on stage. Marra also created the opera Nan Garland, which was performed at Dundee Rep in 2004. Three years later, in September 2010, the album Michael Marra, recorded live on tour in 2010 with Mr McFall's Chamber, was released on Delphian Records. Marra performed original songs with the Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Scottish National Orchestra, Concerto Caledonia, Mr McFall's Chamber, and his own quintet. He sang duets with Patti Smith, Eddi Reader, Karen Matheson and Karine Polwart. In 2003 Marra collaborated with Martyn Bennett for his final album Grit (Martyn Bennett album), contributing a spoken passage for the song \\"Liberation\\". In an interview Marra stated, \\"When I first heard it, I thought I sounded like a minister, and that came as a surprise to me. But I think that's what he was after to tell the truth\\", later joking: \\"I might become a minister\\". His songs have been covered by a wide range of artists, including Sylvia Rae Tracey, Coope Boyes and Simpson, Alan Cumming, Leo Sayer and Rab Noakes. Marra's live CD, Recorded Live on Tour with Mr McFall's Chamber was released on Delphian Records in 2007. In 2012 he released Houseroom, a six-track collaboration CD with The Hazey Janes, on Tob Records. An exhibition of his portraiture prints was shown at Dundee's Bank Street Gallery. Musical theatre Marra wrote original music and worked both as an actor and musical director in theatre. He wrote and performed in the show In Flagrant Delicht which was written in collaboration with Scottish Makar and playwright Liz Lochhead. The show was performed in Washington DC and Melbourne, Australia. Marra's operetta If The Moon Can Be Believed was performed at the Dundee Rep to sell out audiences. He collaborated with Graham McLaren of Theatre Babel on a new production of The Demon Barber for Perth Theatre having previously worked with him on Liz Lochead's Beauty and The Beast. His play St Catherines Day played to full houses at the Oran Mor Glasgow and the Dundee Repertory Theatre. He also collaborated with award winning choreographer Frank McConnell and his dance company Plan B on \\"Love and Pocket Money\\", parallel|parallels and A Wee Home From Home. Songwriting In April 2006, having his fingerprints routinely taken by Customs in Washington D.C. – where he was performing as part of Tartan Week – Marra was inspired to write a protest song about Scottish police detective Shirley McKie, who had been wrongly accused of leaving her thumbprint at a murder scene in 1997. When she denied the print was hers, she was arrested and charged with perjury but acquitted in 1999. In February 2006, McKie received an out-of-court settlement of £750,000 from the Scottish Executive, which first minister Jack McConnell described as a result of an honest mistake. In the song, Marra wrote: > :\\"We lecture children if they're telling lies :They will not prosper and > they will not thrive... :And even the First Minister must sometimes stand > naked.\\" Marra's work, though often humorous, tackled a range of social and political issues. His song \\"Lieblings in The Absence of Love\\", was written in response to the tension he had witnessed during riots in Bonn, and the treatment of the refugees thereafter. His song \\"Chain Up The Swings\\" discusses the practice of some Scottish Christian communities who would chain up the swings on a Sunday, so the children would be prevented from playing on the sabbath. Tackling literary adaption, \\"Happed in Mist\\" revolves around the executed deserter from the famous Scottish novel Sunset Song. He proposed his work \\"Hermless\\" as an alternative national anthem. The song is intended as a contrast to typical militaristic and imperialist national anthems, and describes the day-to-day life of an innocent meek character who claims, :\\"Ma feet micht be big but the insects are safe :They'll never get stood on by me\\" concluding, :\\"Naeb'dy would notice that I wasnae there :If I didnae come hame for ma tea...\\" Personal life Marra was married to Peggy, and their children, Alice and Matthew, are also musicians and members of the Dundee-based group, The Hazey Janes. Labour MSP Jenny Marra is his niece. Marra was a supporter of Dundee F.C.. Death Michael Marra died on 23 October 2012, aged 60, of throat cancer.Report of Marra's death, BBC News Online Awards In 2007 Marra was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Dundee University in recognition of his contribution to the cultural profile of his home town, and in 2011 he was made an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Glasgow Caledonian University. He also won the Herald Angel Award in 2010 for his performance at The Acoustic Music Centre during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Early career  Vogel was born in Krefeld. He studied mathematics, botany and astronomy at Leipzig and Berlin, studying with Encke at the latter institution. In 1851, he was engaged as assistant astronomer to director John Russel Hind at George Bishop's private observatory in London. That year August Heinrich Petermann introduced Vogel to the Royal Geographical Society.  Africa commission  In 1853 Petermann arranged for Vogel to be chosen by the British government to join the Richardson, Overweg and Barth expedition with supplies. That expedition had been sent to Africa in 1849 to find a trade route that bypassed the Arabs. Vogel was to be a replacement for Richardson who had died two years earlier and was tasked to make geographical and meteorological observations and to collect botanical specimens. In 1853, the expedition was in the western Sudan. Vogel sailed from England on 20 February 1853. The day Vogel left London, news had arrived that Overweg had also died, leaving Barth on his own.  Meeting Barth  On 25 July, Vogel left Tripoli with a caravan to catch up with Barth. Vogel arrived at the end of the Trans-Saharan trade route, Kuka, the capital of Bornu on 13 January 1854. Vogel's specimens, and the fact that both expedition engineers were soldiers, made the king there suspicious of his intentions, and Vogel's movements were severely restricted. Instead of waiting for Barth to return, on 19 July, Vogel joined a steamboat expedition heading up the Niger and Benue Rivers to the Mandara Mountains where he was imprisoned by the king of Mora who had received a message about the suspicious stranger from Bornu. Vogel eventually escaped to Marghi in Nigeria where he waited for news of Barth. Upon hearing of a change of king in Bornu, Vogel returned to wait for Barth, whom he met December 1854. By some accounts Vogel was disliked by the other members of the expedition due to his poor attitude, difficult personality and unwillingness to learn Arabic, the lingua franca of north Africa. The arrival of Barth helped defuse some of the conflict, although one of the two engineers refused to travel any further while Vogel was part of the expedition. Barth himself contemplated getting rid of Vogel and stealing his equipment.  Further exploration  Vogel left Barth, and taking one engineer and four servants headed for Bauchi where he ingratiated himself with the Emir by killing a man the Emir disliked. He then became the first European to cross the Muri mountains angering the Tangale people in the process as he desecrated their shrines by sleeping in them during the journey. He penetrated south to the upper course of the Benue, returning to Kuka 1 December 1855. From this date, the notes of his expedition cease.  Death  Vogel left Kuka for the Nile Valley, leaving his engineer, MacGuire, with his notes and specimen collections. Vogel got as far as Wadai (also spelled Ouaddai) in southern Sudan. MacGuire may have known of Vogel's fate but was killed by brigands while returning to Tripoli. Several search expeditions were organized to ascertain Vogel's fate and to recover his papers, but it was not until 1873 that Gustav Nachtigal, on reaching Wadai, learnt of the circumstances of Vogel's February 1856 death in Wara, the capital of Wadai. Nachtigal's account was that Vogel's odd habit of existing almost solely on eggs and writing with a pencil rather than the expected ink was of concern to the Sultan's advisors who had advised the Sultan to kill him \\"just in case\\". The sultan was hesitant but Vogel then climbed Mount Treya which was sacred and off limits to all but the highest officials. Vogel was beaten to death by Kubartu with iron tipped cudgels. According to Nachtigal, Kubartu were a Wadai clan consisting of musicians and executioners. Family His sister Elise Vogel Polko was a popular German novelist. She published his notes in her Erinnerungen an einen Verschollenen (1863). Another resource is Adolf Pahde's Der Afrikaforscher Eduard Vogel. Hamburg, 1889 (first published Krefeld, 1886).

A right-handed pitcher, Pavano played in Major League Baseball from 1998 to 2012 for the Montreal Expos, Florida Marlins, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, and Minnesota Twins. He was a member of the 2003 World Series champions and appeared in the 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He signed with the Yankees in 2005, where he became known for his frequent injuries during his four years with the team. Amateur career Born in New Britain, Connecticut, Pavano graduated from Southington High School in Southington, Connecticut, the alma mater of former major league pitcher Rob Dibble. Pavano's retired jersey (14) still hangs (unretired as of 2011). At Southington, Pavano led the baseball team to a state championship in 1994. Pavano initially committed to play college baseball at Louisiana State. Professional career Boston Red Sox Pavano was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the 13th round of the amateur draft. In 1996, with the A level Michigan Battle Cats, he was 6–6 with a 3.44 ERA in 22 starts. This earned him a number of honors including Baseball America first team Minor League All- Star, Double-A All-Star, Eastern League All-Star & Pitcher of the Year and Red Sox minor league player of the year. In 1997, with the AA Trenton Thunder, he was 16–5 with a 2.63 ERA in 26 starts and was selected as a Triple-A All-Star. Montreal Expos In November , he was sent to Montreal, along with pitcher Tony Armas, Jr., in a trade that brought Pedro Martínez to Boston. Pavano made his Major League debut on May 23, 1998 by starting and pitching seven strong innings against the Philadelphia Phillies. He allowed one run and struck out six while allowing no walks. He recorded his first win on June 2, 1998 when he pitched 7.1 innings, also against the Phillies. Pavano is well known for giving up Mark McGwire's 70th home run in the 1998 season. He pitched four and one-half seasons for the Expos, making 78 starts and had a record of 24–35 and an ERA of 4.83. Florida Marlins Pavano was traded to the Florida Marlins in the middle of the season (with Graeme Lloyd, Mike Mordecai and Justin Wayne) for Cliff Floyd, Wilton Guerrero and Claudio Vargas. Despite having been plagued by injuries, Pavano became an important part of Florida's starting rotation and had a highly successful postseason in for the World Series champion Marlins. He started Game 4 of the Series against the Yankees, holding New York to one run over eight innings in a game the Marlins would go on to win, 4–3, in extra innings. Pavano followed up his playoff exploits with his best season to date in , posting an 18–8 record and a 3.00 ERA. New York Yankees Pavano became a free agent following the season and, despite receiving bigger offers from Boston, Detroit, and Cincinnati, chose to accept a four-year contract worth $39.95 million with the New York Yankees on December 20, 2004. Pavano during his tenure with the New York Yankees in . Pavano began the 2005 season with quality starts in seven of his first 10 appearances, compiling a 4–2 record and a 3.69 ERA. However, in June of that year, he injured his right shoulder and went on the disabled list. Pavano made 17 starts and finished 4–6 with a 4.77 ERA. The Yankees expected him to be healthy for the 2006 season, but Pavano began the season on the disabled list after bruising his buttocks in a spring training game. He did not pitch at all in the Majors in 2006, making only minor league rehab starts. On August 15, 2006, Pavano broke two ribs in an automobile accident after he hit another vehicle with his Porsche in West Palm Beach, Florida. Also involved in the wreck was Gia Allemand, who Pavano was dating at the time. However, he did not tell the Yankees about the incident until August 28, the day they informed him that they planned for him to come off the disabled list to play that Thursday. In spring training in 2007, Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina said that Pavano needed to prove that he wanted to pitch for the team. Mussina said he did not believe he was the only Yankee who felt this way. \\"It didn't look good from a player's and teammate's standpoint,\\" Mussina said of Pavano's injuries. \\"Was everything just coincidence? Over and over again? I don't know.\\" Manager Joe Torre explained that the amount of work Pavano needed to do in repairing his clubhouse image was \\"sizable.\\" Later that season, after ace Chien-Ming Wang injured his right hamstring late in spring training, the Yankees chose Pavano to start on Opening Day against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Yankee Stadium. On April 15, 2007, Pavano was placed on the 15-day DL with what was described as an \\"elbow strain\\". On May 23, 2007, it was reported that Pavano would opt for Tommy John surgery in his elbow. In December 2007, the Yankee organization asked Pavano to accept a minor league contract to clear space on their 40-man roster, Pavano's agent, Tom O'Connell, stated that he would consider the request, but he later turned it down. O'Connell also stated that Pavano's rehabilitation was going faster than expected and he might be available to pitch at the Major League level by mid-summer 2008. On July 29, 2008, Pavano made his first rehab start since his Tommy John surgery for the Charleston RiverDogs, allowing one hit and one walk in two scoreless innings. Pavano made his first start of the season during the Yankees series against the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday August 23, 2008, pitching 5 innings, giving up 3 earned runs on 7 hits, 1 walk and 5 strikeouts in the Yankees 5–3 win. He made his second start of the season against the Toronto Blue Jays on August 29 and was victorious pitching 6 innings in the Yankees 2–1 win. Since his first stint on the disabled list, Pavano did not endear himself to his Yankee teammates, and he stated that he would not visit the team when they played in Tampa Bay, near where he was rehabilitating. Meanwhile, Pavano's agent Tom O'Connell – the fourth agent the right-hander has gone through in his career – believed that Pavano would still be a desired commodity on the free-agent market that winter, even with his injury history. \\"Carl's a 1–2 starter. Those guys don't grow on trees. Those guys are very rare, 200-inning guys are very rare in this game, and they're the ones that make the money. And he did it two years in a row, before he got hurt, and I'm sure he's going to do it again,\\" O'Connell said. During a game Pavano started on September 14, he allowed three earned runs and five hits before he left the mound in the sixth inning following a visit by the trainer and manager Joe Girardi. Pavano was pitching to Eric Hinske with one out and a runner on first when he got the mound visit. After a short discussion, Pavano walked off the field as the sellout crowd showered him with boos. It was reported as a \\"left hip injury.\\" During his final season with the Yankees, following the spate of injuries that landed him repeatedly on the disabled list, Pavano came to be referred to derisively by the New York media as \\"American Idle.\\" During his time with the Yankees, he pitched a combined 26 MLB games over four seasons, compared to 31 with the Marlins in 2004. Cleveland Indians On January 6, 2009, Pavano signed a one-year deal with the Cleveland Indians worth $1.5 million with a possible $5.3 million in incentives. Minnesota Twins On August 7, 2009, Pavano was traded to the Minnesota Twins, for whom he started the crucial third game against the Yankees in the 2009 American League Division Series (ALDS). Following the season, Pavano filed for free agency, but later accepted the Twins' offer of salary arbitration.Rosenthal, Ken. Pavano accepts arbitration from Twins , FOX Sports. Published December 7, 2009. Retrieved December 8, 2009. He ended up having his best season since 2004. During the stretch from May 29 to August 13, Pavano compiled a record of 11–2 with an ERA of 2.79, including twice throwing back-to-back complete games in which one was also a shutout. He went 17-11 with an ERA of 3.75 over the course of the season (in which he also threw 221 innings) and helped the Twins runaway with the Central Division title. However, in the playoffs Pavano lost Game 2 of the 2010 ALDS to the Yankees at Target Field 5–2, and the Twins were swept in three games to end the season. For 2010, Pavano was named the Twins' Pitcher of the Year, receiving the Joseph W. Haynes Award. On January 19, 2011, Pavano agreed to a 2-year contract with the Twins. He was paid $8 million in 2011 and $8.5 million in 2012, along with up to $500,000 in incentives. Pavano was the opening day starter for the Twins on April 1. He gave up 7 earned runs over 4+ innings to the Toronto Blue Jays. On May 1, 2011, after performing poorly against the Kansas City Royals, Pavano took a bat to a trashcan in the Minnesota Twins dugout after being removed in the sixth inning of a 10-3 loss. Pavano responded by saying \\"That's as frustrated as I can get. It actually felt pretty good. I just kept whaling away with it. The (bat) wouldn't break. I couldn't break a bat in the dugout and I couldn't break any out there (on the mound). It was embarrassing.\\" Pavano's stats as of his May 8 start were 2–4 and an ERA of 6.64, the highest of any Twins pitcher at this point in the season. However, on May 13, 2011, Pavano threw 5 1/3 scoreless innings against the Blue Jays but got the no decision in the Twins 2–0 loss. His pitching continued to improve through late May and early June. Pavano recorded his 100th win in a complete game 2-run performance on June 3 against Kansas City, and he pitched another complete game win 12 days later against the White Sox. Pavano continued the season with mixed success. He finished with a 9–13 record and a 4.30 ERA, closing out the Twins' season with a shutout of Kansas City Royals. Of the five starting pitchers for the Twins in 2011, Pavano was the only one who remained in the rotation for the entire season. Francisco Liriano, Brian Duensing, Nick Blackburn, and Scott Baker all missed starts due to injuries. Pavano was again the opening day starter for the Twins in 2012. He announced his retirement from baseball on February 26, 2014. Analyst Pavano served as an analyst for Fox Sports Florida for Miami Marlins pre- and postgame shows starting with the 2014 season. He was dropped in 2017. Pitching style Pavano was a sinkerballer. He threw his sinker and less- used four-seam fastball in the mid-to-upper 80s. He also had a slider and changeup, the former primarily used against right-handed hitters and the latter primarily against lefties.

Baseline runs from Richmond Road (almost directly over Highway 416) east in a straight line until it ends at the Heron Road Bridge over the Rideau River and Rideau Canal when it becomes Heron Road. Before the 2001 City of Ottawa amalgamation, Baseline formed the border of the city of Ottawa and Nepean. The street is named for its location as the baseline for Nepean Township. When Nepean Township was surveyed, Baseline formed the northern boundary of Nepean's six north–south concessions. Currently, Baseline is a major east–west street, and in the late 1990s it became so busy that Hunt Club Road had to be extended west of the Rideau River to alleviate pressure.

Baseline Road is a four-lane principal arterial road for its entire length, except between Centrepointe Drive and Navaho Drive, where it is a five-lane/six-lane arterial (three eastbound lanes and three westbound lanes - a bus lane is present from Constellation west to Centrepointe in lieu of the third westbound lane). The speed limit is for most of its length except a short section west of Greenbank Road, where it is . Ramsayville Road in southeast Ottawa used to be called Base Line Road before 2003. The name had to be changed when the former city of Gloucester amalgamated with the city of Ottawa, to avoid confusion. In the future, Baseline Road will have bus lanes between Navaho Drive and Prince of Wales Drive to speed up transit service in this stretch (OC Transpo bus route 88) due to consistent heavy traffic.

Gale, 2011. Biography In Context. Web. 27 Feb. 2013. was an American photojournalist known for her work as a war correspondent from World War II through the Vietnam War.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/chapelle Early life Chapelle was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and attended Shorewood High School. By the age of sixteen, she was attending aeronautical design classes at MIT. She soon returned home, where she worked at a local airfield, hoping to learn to pilot airplanes instead of designing them. However, when her mother learned that she was also having an affair with one of the pilots, Chapelle was forced to live with her grandparents in Coral Gables, Florida. There, she wrote press releases for an air show, which led to an assignment in Havana, Cuba. A story on a Cuban air show disaster that Chapelle submitted to the New York Times got her noticed by an editor at Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA), which prompted her to move to New York City. Working at the TWA publicity bureau, she began to take weekly photography classes with Tony Chapelle, who became her husband in October 1940. She eventually quit her job at TWA to compile a portfolio, which she sold to Look magazine in 1941. Later, after fifteen years of marriage, she divorced Tony, and changed her first name to Dickey. Breakthrough Despite limited photographic credentials Chapelle managed to become a war correspondent photojournalist during World War II for National Geographic, and with one of her first assignments, was posted with the Marines during the battle of Iwo Jima. She covered the battle of Okinawa as well. After the war, she traveled all around the world, often going to extraordinary lengths to cover a story in any war zone. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Chapelle was captured and jailed for over seven weeks. She later learned to jump with paratroopers, and usually travelled with troops. This led to frequent awards, and earned the respect of both the military and journalistic community. Chapelle \\"was a tiny woman known for her refusal to kowtow to authority and her signature uniform: fatigues, an Australian bush hat, dramatic Harlequin glasses, and pearl earrings.\\" Henri Huet's photograph of Chapelle receiving the last rites in Vietnam. Later life Despite early support for Fidel Castro, Chapelle was an outspoken anti-Communist, and loudly expressed these views at the beginning of the Vietnam War. Her stories in the early 1960s extolled the American military advisors who were already fighting and dying in South Vietnam, and the Sea Swallows, the anticommunist militia led by Father Nguyen Lac Hoa. Chapelle was killed in Vietnam on November 4, 1965 while on patrol with a Marine platoon during Operation Black Ferret, a search and destroy operation 16 km south of Chu Lai, Quang Ngai Province, I Corps. The lieutenant in front of her kicked a tripwire boobytrap, consisting of a mortar shell with a hand grenade attached to the top of it. Chapelle was hit in the neck by a piece of shrapnel which severed her carotid artery and she died soon afterwards. Her last moments were captured in a photograph by Henri Huet. Her body was repatriated with an honor guard consisting of six Marines, and she was given a full Marine burial. She became the first female war correspondent to be killed in Vietnam, as well as the first American female reporter to be killed in action.

Dutch conquest exerted colonial control across the archipelago in the 19th century, establishing a unitary administration. The borders of present- day Indonesia were formed through colonial expansion finalised in the 20th century. After the occupation by the Japanese Empire during World War II ended in 1945, nationalist leaders on Java unilaterally declared Indonesian independence. Early organised indigenous resistance came from the South Moluccas with support and aid from the Dutch government and military. The South Moluccan rebels initially clung on to an early post-colonial treaty prescribing a federal form of statehood. When that treaty, agreed between the Dutch government and the Indonesian government in December 1949, was broken, they unilaterally declared a fully independent Republic of South Maluku (RMS) in April 1950. The South Moluccan leaders based their decision on the treaty, which stipulated autonomy for each of the states of the federation. After the defeat of the RMS on Ambon by Indonesian forces in November 1950, the self- declared government withdrew to Seram, where an armed struggle continued on until December 1963. The government in exile moved to the Netherlands in 1966, following resistance leader and president Chris Soumokil's capture and execution by Indonesian authorities. The exiled government continues to exist, with John Wattilete as its incumbent president since April 2010. The Republic of South Maluku has been a member state of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 1991. History European conquest of the South Moluccas The Maluku Islands were the only place in the world that grew the prized spices of clove and nutmeg, making it a prime destination for European traders during the Age of Exploration. At one point, cloves were worth their weight in gold and Portuguese, Spanish, British and Dutch traders all fought to control the incredibly profitable spice trade monopoly. Eventually, the traders of the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) emerged as the dominant merchant power in Maluku. Through an effective combination of force and diplomacy, the VOC achieved a structure of indirect rule in northern Maluku and direct rule in southern Maluku.Widjojo, Muridan S. \\"Cross-Cultural Alliance-Making and Local Resistance in the Moluccas during the Revolt of Prince Nuku, c. 1780–1810\\" PhD Dissertation, Leiden University, 2007 (Publisher: KITLV, Journal of Indonesian Social Sciences and Humanities Vol. 1, 2008) Pp. 141–149 South Moluccan warriors from Tanimbar Throughout much of the VOC era (17th and 18th centuries), the south Moluccans resisted Dutch dominance. The Banda Islands were only subdued after the indigenous power structure and organisation of trade and politics was destroyed with the extermination and eviction of the Bandanese population in 1621. To repress the autonomous traders of East Seram, the VOC organised ‘Hongi’ raiding expeditions with warrior bands from other south Maluku islands. During ‘Hongi’ raids, houses and vessels were burnt, cash crops were uprooted and most wealth was looted by the ‘Hongi’ warriors. Survivors who escaped had to start from scratch and, during two centuries of resistance, the East Seramese increasingly suffered impoverishment. However, their independent trading network was never completely destroyed. From 1780 to 1802, the people of Seram joined an alliance of North Moluccan, Papuan and British forces in a combined revolt. Resistance leader prince Nuku (the exiled Sultan of Tidore) established himself on Seram and aimed at uniting the North and South Moluccas under his leadership. His raiders targeted South Moluccan islands under the Dutch sphere of influence.Note: Both the Hongi and Nuku raiding tactics were based on the common practice of slave raiders that existed well before the arrival of European traders. Widjojo, Muridan S. \\"Cross-Cultural Alliance- Making and Local Resistance in the Moluccas during the Revolt of Prince Nuku, c. 1780–1810\\" PhD Dissertation, Leiden University, 2007 (Publisher: KITLV, Journal of Indonesian Social Sciences and Humanities Vol. 1, 2008) Pp. 141–149 When the British left the arena in 1802 his plans were foiled and the Dutch restored their dominance. Maluku islanders staged various rebellions during the Dutch colonisation of the Indonesian archipelago in the 19th century following the collapse of the VOC. In a famous revolt on the south Maluku island Saparua, the Dutch fort was taken by the rebel leader Pattimura, a former sergeant in the army of Britain, who had ruled the islands for a short time before returning them to the Dutch in 1816. After reinforcements were sent from the colonial capital Batavia, the insurgents were captured and Pattimura was executed in 1817. During the independence movement of Indonesia, Indonesian republicans included South Maluku as part of the independent Indonesia they declared in 1945. Indonesia's struggle to secure its independence lasted from 1945 until 1949. After international pressure, the Dutch acknowledged a federal Indonesian republic on 27 December 1949. In the first instance, the Netherlands only acknowledged the independence of Indonesia as a federation of autonomous states, of which one was South Maluku. On 25 April 1950, demobilized ex-Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL) soldiers and other South Moluccan men who remained loyal to the Dutch crown, staged a revolt and proclaimed an independent \\"Republic of South Maluku\\" (Indonesian: Republik Maluku Selatan). On 17 August 1950, the Indonesian President, Sukarno, proclaimed the restoration of the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia. Indonesia's liberal democratic system of government, whereby the cabinet would be accountable to the House of Representatives, was retained. This was a source of political instability in the young republic, with frequent changes in government until the rise of the New Order. South Moluccan career soldiers of the colonial army Decorated KNIL soldiers, 1927 A relatively large number of the professional soldiers serving in the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL) were recruited among the population of Ambon and the surrounding South Moluccan islands. The South Moluccan islands were among the first to come under European influence in the 16th century. The Protestant mission had been more successful there than elsewhere in the East Indies; half the Ambonese population adhered to the Calvinist branch of Protestantism. As early as 1605 armed Dutch merchantmen of the VOC captured the Portuguese fort at the location of Ambon city in the South Moluccas. It was an area already strongly influenced by the Portuguese (Portuguese family names, religion and language were common) and the Dutch developed it into the first secure base of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). KNIL recruits being trained on Ambon During the era of the VOC, the Moluccans were not only forced to trade with the VOC only, but also to focus solely on the production of cloves. After the downfall of the VOC and the collapse of the trade in cloves, they were fully dependent on the colonial structure and found occupation in the colonial army. The Ambonese were regarded as fierce fighters, reliable soldiers and absolutely loyal to the Dutch Crown. It was precisely this reputation that made them unpopular with other Indonesian nationalities. The Malay nickname for them was Belanda Hitam, which translates to \\"Black Dutch\\" in English. All of this put them in a difficult position during both the Japanese occupation and the Indonesian national revolution. During the Japanese occupation in the Second World War, most of the Moluccan soldiers were only briefly interned as prisoners of war (POWs). Initially, the Japanese occupation force decided to release them from military duty and send them home. However, the Japanese quickly discovered their miscalculation when the Moluccans became among the most active in the resistance movement against them. Throughout the occupied Dutch East Indies, Moluccan soldiers created underground resistance cells aiding the Allied forces. Some of these cells were active in gathering intelligence; other sleeper cells hid weapons in strategic locations waiting to take up arms during an Allied invasion. The Japanese secret police (Kempeitai) responded by torturing and beheading any suspect, which usually did not deter the Moluccans. KNIL regiment, 1943. After the capitulation of the Imperial Japanese Army to the Allied forces, the Moluccan soldiers acted equally defiantly towards the Indonesian revolutionaries trying to fill the power vacuum left by the Japanese. Smaller scale conflicts in the Bersiap period between regrouped Moluccan fighting units and Permuda groups usually left the well-trained Moluccan fighters victorious. In their efforts to subdue the counter revolutionary RMS movement on Ambon, the newly established Tentara Nasional Indonesia (Republican Indonesian army, TNI) encountered the military prowess of the Moluccan special troops. The heavy fighting triggered them to create their own special troops.This initiative by former KNIL officer Evert Kawilarang developed into the notorious Kopassus unit. At that time the Moluccan special troops' only contemporaries were the Gurkha units of the British Indian Army. Disbanding the colonial army South Moluccan KNIL soldier During the Indonesian National Revolution, the Dutch had to disband the reinstated KNIL,De plechtigheden in Djakarta bij de opheffing van het KNIL. Video footage showing the official ceremony disbanding the KNIL. and the native soldiers had the choice of either being demobilised or joining the army of the Republic of Indonesia. Due to a deep distrust of the Republican leadership, which was predominantly Javanese Muslim, this was an extremely difficult choice for the Protestant Ambonese, and only a minority chose to serve with the Indonesian Army. Disbanding proved a complicated process and, in 1951, two years after the transfer of sovereignty, not all soldiers had been demobilised. The Dutch were under severe international pressure to disband the colonial army and temporarily made these men part of the regular Dutch army, while trying to demobilise them in Java. Herein lay the source of the discontent among the Moluccan soldiers as, according to the KNIL policy, soldiers had the right to choose the place where they were to be discharged at the end of their contract. The political situation in the new Republic of Indonesia was initially unstable and, in particular, controversy over a federal or centralised form of the state resulted in armed conflicts in which Ambonese ex-KNIL men were involved. In 1950 an independent Republic of the South Moluccas (Indonesian: RMS, Republik Maluku Selatan) was proclaimed at Ambon. The RMS had strong support among the Ambonese and former Moluccan KNIL soldiers. As a consequence the Moluccan soldiers located outside the South Moluccas demanded to be discharged at Ambon. But Indonesia refused to let the Dutch transport these soldiers to Ambon as long as the RMS was not repressed, fearing prolonged military struggle. When after heavy fighting the RMS was repressed at Ambon, the soldiers refused to be discharged there. They now demanded to be demobilised at Seram, where pockets of resistance against Indonesia still existed. This was again blocked by Indonesia. Invasion of Ambon At the time of the proclamation 1739 KNIL troops, including 1080 Ambonese were stationed at Ambon. These soldiers became the backbone of the APRMS. After a naval blockade of the Indonesian navy, an invasion of Ambon took place on 28 September 1950. The APRMS fled from the town of Ambon before the invading Indonesian troops had taken up positions in old Dutch fortifications in the hills over looking the town. From here they waged guerilla warfare. The TNI took control of northern half of the island, but were halted by fierce Ambonese resistance at the one-kilometre wide isthmus, which links the southern half. On 5 November the city of Ambon fell into the hands of the Indonesian army. The RMS government went to Ceram in December to continue the RMS battle in the form of a guerilla war. Demobilisation of the Moluccan soldiers to the Netherlands South Moluccans disembarking the ship Kota Inten, Rotterdam, 1951. The Dutch government finally decided to transport the remaining men and their families to the Netherlands. They were discharged on arrival and 'temporarily' housed in camps until it was possible for them to return to the Moluccan islands.The complicated story of the disbanding of the KNIL is set out briefly here. For a more extended analysis see Manuhutu (1987); Steylen (1996: 33-63); van Amersfoort (1982: 101-8). The psychological impact of the dissolution of the KNIL on the Ambonese servicemen is described in Wittermans (1991). In this way around 12,500 persons were settled in the Netherlands, more or less against their will and certainly also against the original plans of the Dutch government. The reaction of the Dutch government to the settlement of the Moluccan soldiers was exactly the opposite of the reaction to the Indo repatriates.The history of the Indos and their emigration from Indonesia after World War II is also reflected in interesting ways in the Dutch literature: the circumstances of the repatriation are, for instance, spiritedly evoked in the stories of Springer (2001: 179-239). Whereas the latter were defined as fellow-citizens who had to be integrated as quickly and as fully as possible, the Moluccans were considered to be temporary residents who had to be repatriated to Indonesia.In this article the words Ambonese and Moluccans are used synonymously. This is strictly speaking not correct. The Protestant Ambonese form about 90 per cent of the Moluccans in the Netherlands and have played a decisive role. There is also a small number of Muslim Ambonese and of Moluccans from the islands of Kei and Tanimbar. They were 'temporarily' housed in camps, mostly in rural areas and near small towns. A special agency was set up to manage all matters concerning these temporary residents, the 'Commissariaat Ambonezenzorg' (CAZ). the camps included the former Nazi transit camp Westerbork. To deal with all kinds of daily matters the CAZ created 'representatives' in the camps who regulated the lives of the inhabitants in accordance with the rules. These representatives were (mostly) recruited from among the non-commissioned officers, who were in this way able, to a certain extent, to re-establish their status in the new circumstances. The housing situation in the camps resembled in many ways the barracks of the colonial army, where the soldiers were housed, together with their families, under the direct supervision of non-commissioned officers. This specific housing situation contributed greatly to the isolation of the Moluccan population from Dutch society. The camps, and later the neighbourhoods, became enclaves where the schools, though officially Dutch in programme and language, became exclusively Moluccan and where access to the labour market was geographically often restricted. Even when it became more and more obvious that there was no possibility to repatriate the ex-servicemen to Indonesia, the Dutch government did not formulate a radically different policy. alt= This situation dragged on until 1970 when the CAZ was finally dissolved and normal ministerial and other agencies became responsible. The Dutch government had at last admitted that the Moluccans were not temporary residents and that their future lay in the Netherlands. Still, in 1968 more than 80 percent of the Moluccans were still without official citizenship, i.e. stateless. The ex-soldiers were deeply frustrated by the demise of the colonial army. The KNIL had offered not only an income, but also a whole way of life in which their status was secure. They had always been loyal to the Dutch Crown and had felt betrayed when their services were no longer rewarded. In response they had pinned their hopes on an independent RMS and had expected that the Dutch would help them to realise it. These feelings continued and were even strengthened in the years of isolated settlement in the Netherlands. There seemed to be only one worthwhile ideal and that was the creation of the RMS. But whatever the merits of this ideal, the Moluccans in the Netherlands could do nothing to bring its realisation any nearer. Moreover, the isolated situation in the camps and neighbourhoods had given rise to a type of expressive leadership that could only manifest itself in opposing and confronting the CAZ and the Dutch in general. South Moluccan terrorist action in the Netherlands This situation led to growing tension and to splits within the RMS movement. The older generation of leaders of the RMS movement saw their authority challenged. Finally the crisis in the Ambonese communities exploded in a decade of violence against internal rivals and Dutch society. A series of terrorist attacks started in 1970 with a raid on the residence of the Indonesian ambassador in Wassenaar. The Dutch reaction to this attack was restrained. The attackers received mild sentences and were still seen as misguided idealists. Within the Moluccan community the 'boys of action' gained great prestige. This fueled further terrorist actions in 1975 and 1977. As with the attack in Wassenaar, the aims of these actions were not very clear; apart from restoring unity within the RMS movement, it is difficult to see any concrete objectives in the vague rhetoric and impossible political demands made by the attackers.Siahaya (1972) paints a good picture of the mind of a Moluccan terrorist. Attacks on a train and on a village school in 1977 led to a final escalation of the violence. The Dutch government saw no other way out than to use military force to end the action. Meanwhile, support for this kind of action within the Moluccan community was ebbing. Instead of reuniting the Moluccans in the Netherlands, this radicalism threatened to lead to more division. When, in 1978, a group of youngsters raided the seat of the provincial government in Assen, they received not the slightest support. Second and third generation Moluccans in the Netherlands Giovanni van Bronckhorst playing for the National Team of the Netherlands Towards the end of this period of terrorist violence, the Dutch government had already dropped the idea that the Moluccans were temporary residents, but had not been able to create a channel of communication through which to discuss and implement policy measures that opened a way to the future. The social situation left much to be desired; school attainment was low and unemployment high. Earlier attempts to set up a communal platform for the government and Moluccan representatives had not been successful, because of antagonism within the Moluccan communities and impossible political demands made at the outset by the Moluccans. In 1976 a platform was formed where government policy measures could be discussed with representatives of the Moluccan community, the IWM (Dutch abbreviation for: Inspraakorgaan Welzijn Molukkers). In 1978 a substantial White Paper (De Problematiek van de Molukkers in Nederland) was sent by the government to parliament. It offered measures to enhance Moluccan participation in Dutch society, in particular in the fields of education and the labour market. The IWM has proved a valuable communication channel for communal projects. A case in point was the plan to create thousands of jobs for Moluccans in government service. The primary goal was to combat high unemployment, but a secondary goal was to open up a particular section of the labour market where Moluccans were significantly underrepresented. The recognition that employment, education and social welfare in general were important fields where the situation of the Moluccan population, and especially of the new generation, had to be improved, was a positive development. Partly because the second generation was already much more oriented to Dutch society, partly as a result of the policy of affirmative action, participation in the labour market and in the school system developed positively after 1980. Levels of educational attainment rose, unemployment levels were lower and the jobs fulfilled were also somewhat higher in scale. In general the second-generation Moluccans made a great leap forward in this period, compared to the first 'soldier generation'.Smeets, H. and Veenman, J. (2000) three generations of Moluccans in the Netherlands', in Vermeulen, H. and Penninx, R. (eds) Immigrant Integration. The Dutch Case. Amsterdam: Het Spinhuis, 36-63. The situation of the Moluccans in the Netherlands is at present remarkably different from that in 1970. Practically all Moluccans are now Dutch citizens. This makes it more difficult to give the precise number of Moluccans in the Netherlands, though research shows that there are to date about 40,000 persons who can be classified as Moluccan.Beets, G., Walhout, E. and Koesoebjono, S. (2002) 'Demografische ontwikkeling van de Molukse bevolkingsgroep in Nederland; Maandstatistiek van de bevolking, 50(6): 13-17. A majority of this population identifies itself to a certain extent with the Moluccan islands where their families once came from, but this identification seems less and less an impediment to integration in Dutch society. In this sense the Moluccans have at last become 'normal immigrants'.van Amersfoort, H. (2004) 'The waxing and waning of a diaspora: Moluccans in the Netherlands, 1950-2002', Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 30(1): 151-74. Notwithstanding Moluccan integration into modern Dutch society has halted terrorist radicalisation, up to the 1990s the Netherlands were reminded yearly of the traumatic side of their colonial past, when celebrations of the RMS independence declaration frequently resulted in angry sentiments or even serious rioting in the streets of the capital. Image showing traditional cakalele dance performance; nowadays Moluccans are rediscovering their ancient cultural traditions. In the 1950s and 1960s Moluccan musicians made their mark together with artists from the Indo community. In the 1980s, bands like MassadaOfficial website Massada were popular. Massada's hitsong \\"Sajang e\\" is the only song in the Malay language to reach number one in the Netherlands. Also from the South Moluccan community in the Netherlands is the singer songwriter Daniel Sahuleka. In Indonesia, many famous musicians are ethnic Moluccans, like popstar Glenn Fredly, who toured the Netherlands in 2008 and acknowledged Daniel Sahuleka as one of his main inspirations. In the 21st century new generations of South Moluccans in the Netherlands have chosen ways to manifest their heritage and express themselves, by performing traditional Tifa music and Cakalele dances, but also by expressing themselves with contemporary music like hip-hop. In addition, in Dutch football many South Moluccans in the Netherlands have made a name for themselves, including Simon Tahamata and Bobby Petta as well as Denny Landzaat and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, whose mothers are Moluccan. Exile The main stronghold of the rebellious RMS group on Ambon was defeated by Indonesian forces in November 1950, while a smaller scale guerilla struggle continued on Ceram until 1962. The defeat on Ambon however resulted in the flight of the self-declared RMS government from the islands, and the formation of a government in exile in the Netherlands.Note that its head of state remained C.Soumokil who continued to lead the armed struggle on Ceram. The following year some 12,000 Moluccan soldiers accompanied by their families went to the Netherlands, where they established a \\"Republic of the South Moluccas\\" government-in-exile. During their exile parts of the RMS movement have committed terror attacks in the Netherlands. Most research argues that the attacks were caused by frustration over the lack of support from the Dutch government. The first attack took place in 1970 at the Indonesian Ambassador's house at Wassenaar, during which a Dutch policeman was shot and killed. This attack was followed up in 1975 with the hijacking of a train at Wijster which was spontaneously supported by another, improvised, attack on the Indonesian consulate in Amsterdam. Three hostages were executed in the train and one Indonesian man was mortally wounded while trying to escape the consulate. In 1977 another train was hijacked, this time at De Punt, supported by a primary school hijack at Bovensmilde. These actions were ended with force by marines of the Bijzondere Bijstands Eenheid (BBE) in which six hijackers and two hostages died. The last action took place in 1978 when the provincial building in Assen was occupied. This action too was ended by BBE marines. From the 1980s to the present day no such actions re-occurred. Junus Effendi Habibie, A previous Indonesian ambassador to the Netherlands and brother to the third president of Indonesia, has said that he would do all he can to facilitate the repatriation of first generation Moluccans to their homeland, if they would stop aiming at an independent state.Dutch television interview with Junus Habibie Presidents Dr. Chris Soumokil J.D. was the RMS president in 1954 who went into hiding and led the armed guerilla struggle on Ceram island. He was only captured by the Indonesian Army in Ceram on 2 December 1962. Brought to trial before a military tribunal in Jakarta, he was sentenced to death and executed under President Suharto's rule on 12 April 1966. The first president in exile was Prof. Johan Manusama (1966–1993). The government-in-exile continues to exist, with Frans Tutuhatunewa M.D. as head of state (1993–2010). However it no longer advocates violent action towards either the Netherlands or Indonesia. The president in exile has said that the young generations should focus on their education and development opportunities in the Netherlands if they want to potentially support and develop the South Moluccas. John Wattilete became RMS president in April 2010. He is the first to come from the second generation of Moluccans in the Netherlands and is regarded as more pragmatic than previous leaders. State Symbols Flag The RMS flag is vertical blue, white, green, red (1:1:1:6) and has proportions 2:3. It was first hoisted 2 May 1950 at 10.00 AM. Two days later the government gave the explanation of the flag. Blue symbolises the sea and loyalty, white stands for purity, peace and the white beaches, green the vegetation, and red the ancestors and blood of the people. Coat of Arms of the Republic of South Maluku Coat of arms The RMS coat of arms depicts the white Moluccan dove called 'Pombo'. The white dove is seen as a symbol of positivity and a good omen. The 'Pombo' is shown, about to start flying, the wings half opened and in its beak a peace branch, the chest tattooed with a crossed 'parang', 'salawaku' and spear. The blazon of the RMS coat of arms state the words 'Mena - Moeria'. This slogan is derived from the original Melanesian Moluccan language. Since ancient times it is yelled by the steerer and paddlers of the traditional Moluccan rowing boats called 'Kora Kora', to synchronise their strokes during off shore expeditions. It literally means 'Front - Back', but is also translated as 'I go - We follow' or 'One for all - All for One'. Anthem The RMS anthem is called \\"Maluku tanah airku\\", which translates to English as \\"Maluku my homeland,\\" and was written by Chris Soumokil and O. Sahalessy in the Malay language, with Melanesian Moluccan words mixed in. Original text Oh Maluku, tanah airku, Tanah tumpah darahku. Ku berbakti kepadamu Slama hari hidupku. Engkaulah pusaka raya Yang leluhur dan teguh. Aku junjung selamanya Hingga sampai ajalku. Aku ingat terlebih Sejarahmu yang pedih. Oh Maluku, tanah airku, Tanah datuk-datukku. Atas via dolorosa Engkau hidup merdeka. Putra-putri yang sejati Tumpah darah bagimu. Ku bersumpah trus berbakti Serta tanggung nasibmu. Aku lindung terlebih Sejarahmu yang pedih. Mena-Muria, printah leluhur Segenap jiwaku seru. Bersegralah membelamu Seperti laskar yang jujur. Dengan prisai dan imanku Behkan harap yang teguh. Ku berkurban dan berasa Karena dikaa ibuku Ku doakan terlebih Mena-Muria, hiduplah! English translation Maluku, my homeland, My land of origin. I devote my strength to thee As long as I may live. Thou art my great heritage Uplifted above all. I will always honor thee Until my dying day. I will recall in memory Above all thy harrowing history. Maluku, my homeland, Land of my ancestors. Through this road of suffering Will we reach liberty. Thy true sons and daughters Have shed their blood for thee. I am sworn to dedication To keep thy future safe. Above all I will protect thee And thy harrowing history. Onwards without fear, the higher call I yell wholeheartedly. I hasten to defend thee As an army just and true. With shield and faith And above all in great resilience I will sacrifice and struggle. For thou art my cradle And above all I will pray That our sacred call may forever live. Contemporary developments Recent political developments in the Netherlands The Indonesian ambassador to the Netherlands, Yunus Effendi Habibie, told Radio Netherlands Worldwide in 2009 that Indonesia was pleased that the exiled Moluccan government is no longer striving for an independent state. According to the ambassador, Moluccans already have autonomy, so the present situation need not be changed. He rejects full Moluccan independence. Habibie's comments come in response to a decision by the designated new president of the Moluccan government-in-exile, John Wattilete's words that an independent Moluccan state is no longer its absolute priority. Although independence is still the ultimate goal, he says he would be satisfied with a form of autonomy similar to that introduced in Aceh. \\"The most important thing is that Moluccans themselves are in charge.\\" John Wattilete became RMS president in April 2010. He is the first to come from the second generation of Moluccans in the Netherlands and is regarded as more pragmatic than previous leaders. However one day before Indonesian President Yudhoyono's planned state visit to the Netherlands, the first such visit since 1970,Images of 1970 state visit by former President Suharto. . Wattilete issued legal proceedings to have him arrested upon entering the country. Although legal experts called this action senseless and without much chance of success, Yudhoyono canceled his visit the next day.Newspaper article. Retrieved 5 October 2010. Recent political developments in Indonesia The South Moluccan people are predominantly Christian, unlike most regions in Indonesia which are overwhelmingly Muslim. The South Moluccan Republic, however, was also supported by some Moluccan Muslims in the region at that time. Today, while the majority of Christians on the Moluccas do not support separatism, the memory of the RMS and its separatist objectives still resonates in Indonesia. Moluccan Christians, during the sectarian violence of 1999-2002 in the Moluccas, were accused by Muslim groups of having independence as their goal. This accusation has been useful in galvanizing Muslims to fight (Laskar Jihad), and the situation has not been aided by the fact that some diaspora Moluccan Christian groups have taken up the RMS banner. In the Moluccas, the Malino II Accord was signed to end conflict and create peace in the Moluccas, asking Moluccans \\"to reject and oppose all kinds of separatist movements, among others the Republic of South Moluccas (RMS), that threaten the unity and sovereignty of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia\\". However, during the visit to Ambon of the Indonesian president in the summer of 2007, RMS sympathisers disturbed ceremonies by performing the Moluccan war dance and hoisting the RMS flag.Dutch television report Since 1999, a new organization known as the Maluku Sovereignty Front (FKM) has operated in Ambon, stockpiling weapons and flying the RMS flag in public places. The leader of the FKM organisation, Alex Manuputty, has fled to the United States, but continues to support independence.Live video footage interview with Alex Manuputty in exile, in the USA.

Curdling is intentional and desirable in making cheese and tofu; unintentional and undesirable in making a sauce or a custard. Curdling occurs naturally in cows' milk, if it is left open to air for a few days in a warm environment. Looking particularly at the food preparation aspect of curdling rather than scientific, curdling is used to clump proteins in different types of milk. This occurs due to the protein molecules joining together after a change in pH. These clumps help form cheese curds, however this can also occur in non-cheese making procedures, being sauces or cheesecakes.  Cheese and tofu  Cheese curds prior to pressing Milk and soy milk are curdled intentionally to make cheese and tofu by the addition of enzymes (typically rennet), acids (including lemon juice), or various salts (magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, or gypsum); the curds are then pressed.  Egg sauces  In hot preparations emulsified with eggs like hollandaise and custard, curdling is the undesirable result of overheating the sauce. Sauces which contain starch curdle with more difficulty. In cold sauces like mayonnaise as well as in hot sauces, too large a ratio of fat to egg may also cause curdling.  Milk sauces  In sauces which include milk or yogurt, overheating often causes curdling. The higher the fat content, the less likely curdling is. Strained yogurt used in sauces also curdles only with difficulty.  Cooking  Curdling can occur in different cooking processes. Cheesecake is one such process. If water is added to the cream cheese during the combining period, it will curdle.

It was proclaimed in 1797 on the Left Bank of the Rhine under French occupation. History At the beginning of the War of the First Coalition, in 1792, French revolutionary troops conquered the Palatinate region and occupied the cities of Mainz, Speyer, and Worms. They terminated the centuries-long reign of the local nobility and clergy, which met with approval among broad sections of the public. A German Jacobin Club was established at Mainz in October to promote the export of revolution in the lands of the Holy Roman Empire together with the occupying forces. The short- lived Republic of Mainz, established in March 1793, was the first attempt to implement a democratic state on current German territory. The Republic ended after Prussian and Austrian coalition troops started the Siege of Mainz and forced the surrender of the city. Lazare Hoche in 1793 After the ' from August 1793, French forces were able to conquer vast territories on the Left Bank of the Rhine up to the 'natural Rhine border' proclaimed by Georges Danton in the National Convention. Under the terms of the 1795 Peace of Basel, the Kingdom of Prussia had been compelled to cede all her territories west of the Rhine river, but the French forces initially failed to coordinate a civil administration or to establish a Rhenish buffer state, and the ongoing occupation at the expense of the civilian population met with growing rejection. The situation did not improve until, in early 1797, the French Directory delegated General Louis Lazare Hoche to build up an orderly public administration based on the French model. On 13 April 1797, at the suggestion of General Hoche, the Directory resolved upon the establishment of a ' on the west-Rhenish territories of the Electorates of Trier, Mainz and Cologne, of the Electoral Palatinate, the duchies of Arenberg and Jülich-Berg, the free cities of Aachen and Cologne, and several smaller counties and lordships. Together the Rhenish lands from Cleves up to Bingen were combined into the short-lived Cisrhenian Republic under the rule of General Hoche as 'Protector'. The republican movement was again gaining a substantial following, at least in Rhenish cities such as Bonn or Koblenz. Joseph Görres, painting by Joseph Anton Settegast, 1838 In view of Napoleon's Italian campaign and the creation of the Cisalpine Republic in June 1797, German democrats like Joseph Görres urged the proclamation of the Cisrhenian Republic, which took place on 28 August with the first hoisting of a green, white and red tricolour flag in Cologne. Similar ceremonies were also held in Rheinbach, Koblenz and Bonn, accompanied by the planting of \\"liberty trees\\" throughout the country. The number of supporters of the Republic among the population is difficult to assess from today's perspective. In any case, the strong presence of occupying troops, entailing taxes and contributions, persisted. Meanwhile, the Coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797) in Paris boosted radical forces demanding an annexation of the Left Bank by the French motherland. When General Hoche died unexpectedly on September 18 at the age of 29, the Cisrhenian Republic lost her strongest advocate. By the Treaty of Campo Formio on 18 October 1797, Emperor Francis II accepted the Rhine border and the administration of the region was officially assigned to France. By 1798 the lands west of the Rhine were organized by French Commissioner François Joseph Rudler into the ' of , , and . Rudler also had the French ' implemented, what de facto marked the end of the planned autonomous Republic. The French annexation was internationally accepted in the 1801 Treaty of Lunéville.

Telkom is listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The government of Indonesia owns over half of Telkom's shares outstanding. Telkom has major businesses in fixed line telephony, internet and data communications. It is operated as the parent company of the Telkom Group, which is engaged in a broad range of businesses that consist of telecommunication, multimedia, property and finance services. Since 2008, Telkom Indonesia began changing its business focus, infrastructure, systems, organisation and human resources, as well as the corporate culture, in their effort to face rising competition. After privatization in 1995, Telkom Indonesia's total consumer base grew by 7.8% from 2010 to 129.8 a million customers at the end of December 2011, making the company the nation's largest telecommunication service provider by subscribers. History Telkom is one of the world's oldest telecommunication companies. The company can be traced to an establishment of the first electromagnetic telegraph service in Indonesia on 23 October 1856, by the Dutch Colonial Government to connecting Batavia (Jakarta) and Buitenzorg (Bogor). In 1884, the Dutch Colonial Government founded a private company to provide postal and domestic telegraph services and, later on, international telegraph services. Early years Telephony services had been introduced to Indonesia in 1882 by privately owned companies under a 25-year government license. In 1906, all postal and telegraph services in Indonesia were taken over by the government as single, unified government agency named Posts Telegraafend Telefoon Diensts (PTT). In September 1945, roughly a month after Indonesian proclamation of independence, the agency headquarters in Bandung were taken over by Indonesian nationalists. In December 1949, after years of national revolution war, the PTT was nationalised by Indonesian Government as part of Indonesian effort to oust the remaining Dutch and nationalise Dutch corporate assets. State-owned company In 1961, PTT was converted from an official government agency into a newly established state-owned company, the Postal and Telecommunications Services company. Four years later, on 6 July 1965, Indonesian Government separated this company into two state-owned companies, PN Pos Giro responsible for providing mail services and PN Telekomunikasi as telecommunications services. The mail services PN Pos Giro developed over year, to become the Pos Indonesia in 1995, which is still state-owned today and the official postal carrier for Indonesia's 230 million people. In 1974, PN Telekomunikasi was further divided into two state-owned companies. Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi (Perumtel) provided domestic and international telecommunications services, while PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia (PT INTI) manufactured telecommunications equipment. A further division in 1980 saw the international telecommunications business taken over by the newly established PT Indonesian Satellite Corporation (Indosat). In 1991, Perumtel became a state-owned limited liability corporation and renamed to what is now Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia or Telkom. Until 1995, Telkom's operations were organized along twelve regional operating units known as Wilayah Telekomunikasi or Witel. Each Witel had full responsibility for all aspects of business and operations in their respective regions, such as telephone services, property management, and security. In 1995, Telkom reorganized the twelve Witels into seven regional divisions and one network division. Under a series of Cooperation (KSO) Agreements, Telkom transferred the right to operate five of its seven regional divisions (I, III, IV, VI, and VII) to private sector consortia. Under these agreements, the KSO partners manage and operate the regional division concerned for a fixed term, build a specified number of fixed lines and, at the end of the term, transfer the telecommunications facilities to Telkom for an agreed amount in compensation. Revenues from the KSO operations were shared between Telkom and the KSO partners. Privatization On 14 November 1995, Telkom became a privatized company when shares went on sale through an initial public offering on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the Surabaya Stock Exchange (which merged in December 2007 to become the Indonesia Stock Exchange). Telkom's shares are also listed on the NYSE and the LSE in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs), and were publicly offered without listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Telkom is now the largest company by market capitalization in Indonesia, with a market capitalization of approximately IDR 190,512 trillion as of 31 December 2009. The Government retains an aggregate interest of 51.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of Telkom. The Government also holds one Dwiwarna, or golden share. In mid-1997, Indonesia was badly affected by the Asian economic crisis. Among those impacted were certain KSO partners, who experienced difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to Telkom. Telkom eventually acquired control of its KSO partners in Regions I, III, and VI, and amended the terms of the KSO agreements with its KSO partners in Regions IV and VII to obtain legal rights to control the financial and operating decisions of those regions. Since 5 June 2014, Telkom shares are no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange (\\"LSE\\"), and since 16 May 2014, they cease to be registered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (\\"TSE\\") in Japan.http://www.telkom.co.id/assets/uploads/2013/05/telkom_20F_2014.pdf Telecommunication deregulation In 1999, Indonesia passed a deregulating telecommunication law that set in motion a sweeping array of reforms and enlivened competition policy, private investment, and long term industry direction. Among the proposed reforms was the progressive elimination of the joint ownership, by Telkom and Indosat, of most of the telecommunications companies in Indonesia. This was intended to promote a more competitive market. As a result, in 2001, Telkom acquired Indosat's 35.0% stake in Telkomsel, resulting in Telkom owning 77.7% of the shares of Telkomsel, while Indosat acquired Telkom's 22.5% interest in Satelindo and its 37.7% stake in Lintasarta. In 2002, Telkom sold 12.7% of Telkomsel to Singapore Telecom Mobile Pte Ltd (SingTel Mobile), reducing Telkom's ownership of Telkomsel to 65.0%. On 1 August 2001, the Government terminated Telkom's exclusive right to provide fixed line services in Indonesia and Indosat's right to provide international direct dial services. Subsequently, Telkom's exclusive rights to provide domestic and long-distance services were terminated in August 2002 and August 2003, respectively. On 7 June 2004, Telkom began to provide their own international direct dial fixed line services. On 16 November 2005, the Telkom-2 satellite was launched to replace all satellite transmission services that have been served by previous satellite, Palapa B-4. Transformations In 2009, Telkom started doing the business transformation of the only company in the field of telecommunications to a broader range of business, the company expanded to the telecommunications, information technology services, media and edutainment. Telkom's decision to transform its business was prompted by the shift in customer lifestyles, and supported by advances in technology and regulatory changes that enabled service providers to deliver enhanced service to customers. With this new business transformation, Telkom also plans to conduct the acquisition of several companies that are in line with Telkom's transformation of the new business. In August 2012, the Telkom-3 satellite was lost in a launch failure; being placed into an unusably low orbit following the failure of the Briz-M upper stage of the Proton-M rocket that had launched it. Its replacement, Telkom-3S successfully launched aboard an Ariane 5 rocket on 14 February 2017, 21:39 UTC. In March 2019, Telkom Indonesia was one of the first Asian telco to launch a Cloud Gaming service in coopération with Gamestream. Operations Telkom Indonesia is a dominant and largest provider of fixed line services due to owning most of Indonesia's copper network. Telkom also runs telephone exchanges, trunk network and local loop connections for its fixed-line telephones. Currently, Telkom is responsible for approximately 8.3 million telephone lines in Indonesia. And like most of the other state-ownership telecommunication companies in the world, Telkom is obliged to provide public services such as public call boxes. Telkom Indonesia businesses are operated under government regulation by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information. Telkom, as a government-owned company, is required to comply with additional obligations such as provide telecommunication services and not to discriminate. As well as providing service in those regulated areas, Telkom has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less government-owned-related regulation. Telkom Indonesia is the parent company of the Telkom Group, which is engaged in a wide range of businesses that consist of telecommunication, information, multimedia, property, and financial services. Telkom mainly operates in fixed line telephony, internet and data communications business, while other businesses are run by subsidiaries.

During the apex of the Islamic Abbasid era, he worked with a group of translators, among whom were Abū 'Uthmān al-Dimashqi, Ibn Mūsā al- Nawbakhti, and Thābit ibn Qurra, to translate books of philosophy and classical Greek and Persian texts into Arabic and Syriac. Ḥunayn ibn Isḥaq was the most productive translator of Greek medical and scientific treatises in his day. He studied Greek and became known among the Arabs as the \\"Sheikh of the translators\\". He is the father of Arab translations. He mastered four languages: Arabic, Syriac, Greek and Persian. His translations did not require corrections; Hunayn's method was widely followed by later translators. He was originally from al-Hira, the capital of a pre-Islamic cultured Arab kingdom, but he spent his working life in Baghdad, the center of the great ninth- century Greek-into-Arabic/Syriac translation movement. His fame went far beyond his own community.Seleznyov, N. \\"Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq in the Summa of al- Muʾtaman ibn al-ʿAssāl\\" in VG 16 (2012) 38–45 [In Russian]. Overview In the Abbasid era, a new interest in extending the study of Greek science had arisen. At that time, there was a vast amount of untranslated ancient Greek literature pertaining to philosophy, mathematics, natural science, and medicine.Lindberg, David C. The Beginnings of Western Science: Islamic Science. Chicago: The University of Chicago, 2007. Print. This valuable information was only accessible to a very small minority of Middle Eastern scholars who knew the Greek language; the need for an organized translation movement was urgent. In time, Hunayn ibn Ishaq became arguably the chief translator of the era, and laid the foundations of Islamic medicine. In his lifetime, ibn Ishaq translated 116 works, including Plato's Timaeus, Aristotle's Metaphysics, and the Old Testament, into Syriac and Arabic.Opth: Azmi, Khurshid. \\"Hunain bin Ishaq on Ophthalmic Surgery. \\"Bulletin of the Indian Institute of History of Medicine 26 (1996): 69–74. Web. 29 October 2009 Ibn Ishaq also produced 36 of his own books, 21 of which covered the field of medicine. His son Ishaq, and his nephew Hubaysh, worked together with him at times to help translate. Hunayn ibn Ishaq is known for his translations, his method of translation, and his contributions to medicine. He has also been suggested by François Viré to be the true identity of the Arabic falconer Moamyn, author of De Scientia Venandi per Aves.François Viré, Sur l'identité de Moamin le fauconnier. Communication à l'Académie des inscriptions et belles lettres, avril-juin 1967, Parigi, 1967, pp. 172–176 Early life Hunayn ibn Ishaq was an Arab Nestorian Christian, born in 809, during the Abbasid period, in al-Hirah, to an ethnic Arab family.Esposito, John L.

John Benjamins Publishing Company. p. 45.\\"Hunayn was most likely trilingual from his youth; Arabic was the vernacular of his native town, Persian a frequently-used tongue in his region, and Syriac the language of the liturgy and of higher Christian education.\\" As a child, he learned the Syriac and Arabic languages. Although al-Hira was known for commerce and banking, and his father was a pharmacist, Hunayn went to Baghdad in order to study medicine. In Baghdad, Hunayn had the privilege to study under renowned physician Yuhanna ibn Masawayh; however, Hunayn's countless questions irritated Yuhanna, causing him to scold Hunayn and forcing him to leave. Hunayn promised himself to return to Baghdad when he became a physician. He went abroad to master the Latin language. On his return to Baghdad, Hunayn displayed his newly acquired skills by reciting the works of Homer and Galen. In awe, ibn Masawayh reconciled with Hunayn, and the two started to work cooperatively.\\"Hunayn Ibn Ishaq\\". The Dictionary of Scientific Biography. Vol. XV. 1978. Print. Hunayn was extremely motivated in his work to master Greek studies, which enabled him to translate Greek texts into Syriac and Arabic. The Abbasid Caliph al-Mamun noticed Hunayn's talents and placed him in charge of the House of Wisdom, the Bayt al Hikmah. The House of Wisdom was an institution where Greek works were translated and made available to scholars. (Sylvain Gougenheim argued, though, that there is no evidence of Hunayn being in charge of the Bayt al HikmahS. Gougenheim: Aristote au Mont-Saint-Michel, 136–137 Nemira Publishing House, Bucharest 2011, (Romanian edition)) The caliph also gave Hunayn the opportunity to travel to Byzantium in search of additional manuscripts, such as those of Aristotle and other prominent authors. Accomplishments In Hunayn ibn Ishaq's lifetime, he devoted himself to working on a multitude of writings; both translations and original works. As a writer of original work Hunayn wrote on a variety of subjects that included philosophy, religion and medicine. In \\"How to Grasp Religion\\", Hunayn explains the truths of religion that include miracles not possibly made by humans and humans' incapacity to explain facts about some phenomena, and false notions of religion that include depression and an inclination for glory. He worked on Arabic grammar and lexicography. Ophthalmology The eye according to Hunain ibn Ishaq. From a manuscript dated circa 1200. Hunayn ibn Ishaq enriched the field of ophthalmology. His developments in the study of the human eye can be traced through his innovative book, \\"Book of the Ten Treatises of the Eye\\". This textbook is the first known systematic treatment of this field and was most likely used in medical schools at the time. Throughout the book, Hunayn explains the eye and its anatomy in minute detail; its diseases, their symptoms, their treatments. Hunain repeatedly emphasized that he believed the crystalline lens to be in the center of the eye. Hunain may have been the originator of this idea. The idea of the central crystalline lens was widely believed from Hunain's period through the late 1500s. He discusses the nature of cysts and tumors, and the swelling they cause. He discusses how to treat various corneal ulcers through surgery, and the therapy involved in repairing cataracts. \\"Ten Treatises on Ophthalmology\\" demonstrates the skills Hunayn ibn Ishaq had not just as a translator and a physician, but also as a surgeon. As a physician Hunayn ibn Ishaq's reputation as a scholar and translator, and his close relationship with Caliph al-Mutawakkil, led the caliph to name Hunayn as his personal physician, ending the exclusive use of physicians from the Bukhtishu family. Despite their relationship, the caliph became distrustful; at the time, there were fears of death from poisoning, and physicians were well aware of its synthesis procedure. The caliph tested Hunayn's ethics as a physician by asking him to formulate a poison, to be used against a foe, in exchange for a large sum. Hunayn ibn Ishaq repeatedly rejected the Caliph's generous offers, saying he would need time to develop a poison. Disappointed, the caliph imprisoned his physician for a year. When asked why he would rather be killed than make the drug, Hunayn explained the physician's oath required him to help, and not harm, his patients. As a translator Some of Hunayn's most notable translations were his translation of \\"De materia Medica,\\" which was technically a pharmaceutical handbook, and his most popular selection, \\"Questions on Medicine\\". \\"Questions on Medicine\\" was extremely beneficial to medical students because it was a good guide for beginners to become familiar with the fundamental aspects of medicine in order to understand the more difficult materials. Information was presented in the form of question and answer. The questions were taken from Galen's \\"Art of Physic\\", and the answers were based on \\"Summaria Alexandrinorum\\". For instance, Hunayn answers what the four elements and four humors are and also explains that medicine is divided into therapy and practice. He goes on later to define health, disease, neutrality, and also natural and contranatural, which associates with the six necessary causes to live healthy. Hunayn translated writings on agriculture, stones, and religion. He translated some of Plato's and Aristotle's works, and the commentaries of ancient Greeks. Additionally, Hunayn translated many medicinal texts and summaries, mainly those of Galen. He translated a countless number of Galen's works including \\"On Sects\\" and \\"On Anatomy of the Veins and Arteries\\". Many published works of R. Duval in Chemistry represent translations of Hunayn's work.Wright. Catalogue, pp. 1190–1191, MV Coll' orient, 1593 Also in Chemistry a book titled ['An Al-Asma'] meaning \\"About the Names\\", did not reach researchers but was used in \\"Dictionary of Ibn Bahlool\\" of the 10th century. Translation techniques In his efforts to translate as much Greek material as possible, Hunayn ibn Ishaq was accompanied by his son Ishaq ibn Hunayn and his nephew Hubaysh. It was quite normal at times for Hunayn to translate Greek material into Syriac, and have his nephew finish by translating the text from Syriac to Arabic. Ishaq corrected his partners' errors while translating writings in Greek and Syriac into Arabic. Unlike other translators in the Abbasid period, Hunayn opposed translating texts word for word. Instead, he would attempt to attain the meaning of the subject and the sentences, and then in a new manuscript, rewrite the piece of knowledge in Syriac or Arabic. He also corrected texts by collecting different set of books revolving around a subject and by finalizing the meaning of the subject. The method helped gather, in just 100 years, nearly all the knowledge from Greek medicine. A selected series of the translated treatises of Galen by Hunayn ibn Ishaq *\\"Kitab ila Aglooqan fi Shifa al Amraz\\" – This Arabic translation, related to Galen's Commentary, by Hunayn ibn Ishaq, is extant in the Library of Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences. It is a masterpiece of all the literary works of Galen. It is part of the Alexandrian compendium of Galen's work. This manuscript from the 10th century is in two volumes that include details regarding various types of fevers (Humyat) and different inflammatory conditions of the body. More importantly, it includes details of more than 150 single and compound formulations of both herbal and animal origin. The book also provides an insight into understanding the traditions and methods of treatment in the Greek (Unani) and Roman eras. *De sectis *Ars medica *De pulsibus ad tirones *Ad Glauconem de medendi methodo *De ossibus ad tirones *De musculorum dissectione *De nervorum dissectione *De venarum arteriumque dissectione *De elementis secundum Hippocratem *De temperamentis *De facultibus naturalibus *De causis et symptomatibus *De locis affectis De pulsibus (four treatises) *De typis (febrium) *De crisibus *De diebus decretoriis *Methodus medendi *Hippocrates and Dioscorides.

Lidge played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 2002–2012. He played for the Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington Nationals. As a relief pitcher Lidge saved 225 games during his career. He was a two-time All-Star, and in 2008 won the Delivery Man of the Year Award and the National League (NL) Rolaids Relief Man Award. Lidge is currently a host on SiriusXM's MLB Network Radio. Lidge threw a four-seam fastball that consistently reached 95–97 miles per hour, as well as a hard, sharp breaking slider that ranged from 85 to 87 mph. He also had a cutter of the variation. He sealed the Phillies' 2008 World Series championship with the final out, a strikeout of Eric Hinske in Game 5. Early life Lidge was born in Sacramento, California on December 23, 1976. His family moved to Englewood, Colorado when Lidge was very young. Growing up, Lidge played football, basketball and baseball among other sports. He attended Cherry Creek High School.\\"Cherry Creek Schools Honor Grad Brad Lidge.\\" Lidge initially played outfield but became a pitcher because Cherry Creek's outfield was populated by such draft prospects as Donzell McDonald. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 42nd round of the 1995 draft but did not sign. College career Lidge attended the University of Notre Dame, where he played college baseball for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team. He won the Big East Conference player of the year award during his junior season under coach Paul Mainieri, leading the conference with an 8–2 record and 93 strikeouts in innings. Professional career Houston Astros (2002–2007) Early career Lidge was a first round draft pick by the Houston Astros in the 1998 MLB draft, chosen 17th overall as a compensatory pick from the Colorado Rockies, who had signed Darryl Kile in the offseason. Lidge missed parts of his first four professional seasons (at Quad Cities, Kissimmee, Round Rock, and New Orleans) with injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and a broken forearm that threatened his career. He would overcome these injuries, making his MLB debut on April 26, 2002, against the Atlanta Braves, serving as a middle relief pitcher in the Astros' bullpen. He started the only game of his career in September of that year against the Milwaukee Brewers. Lidge went 2-for-2 with a double and 2 RBIs at the plate, but was pulled when he strained an intercostal muscle in his ribcage after pitching three scoreless innings with four strikeouts, two walks and a hit batsman. 2003–04 In 2003, Lidge was the winning pitcher in the Astros' historic six-pitcher tandem which no-hit the New York Yankees on June 11. That year, Lidge was voted Astros Rookie of the Year by the Houston Chapter of the BBWAA. Following the trades of Billy Wagner in the 2003 off-season and Octavio Dotel in the summer of 2004, the Astros moved Lidge from setup man to closer. He set a new National League record for strikeouts by a reliever with 157, passing Goose Gossage's total of 151 set in 1977. The mark is third all-time for relievers, behind Dick Radatz's 181 in , and Mark Eichhorn's 166 in . In the 2004 season, hitters swung and missed at Lidge's strikes almost 42% of the time; for balls out of the strike zone, batters missed more than 70% of the time. Baseball writer Joe Posnanski noted, \\"I have no doubt that Brad Lidge, that one year, was one of the most unhittable pitchers in the history of baseball.\\" 2005 Lidge (right) in 2005 with fellow Astros Chad Qualls and Dan Wheeler In his first All-Star Game appearance in 2005, Lidge pitched the bottom of the seventh, striking out all three batters he faced. He threw 11 pitches (2 balls) to Melvin Mora, Mike Sweeney, and Garret Anderson, who did not make contact with any of Lidge's pitches. Lidge became the first pitcher to strike out the side in his first All-Star appearance since Bill Caudill and Dwight Gooden in 1984. Later in 2005, Lidge finished the season with a 2.29 ERA and a career-high 42 saves. That year, Lidge ranked third in the National League in saves and became the second Houston Astros pitcher ever to record at least 40 saves in one season alongside Billy Wagner. During the 2005 NLCS, Lidge gave up a 3-run home run to Albert Pujols in Game 5 in Houston which forced a Game 6 back in St. Louis, which the Astros would win to clinch their first World Series berth in franchise history. In his very next appearance, Lidge gave up a walk off home run to Scott Podsednik in Game 2 of the 2005 World Series and the series winning run and hit in Game 4 to go 0-2 in the series and complete the White Sox sweep of the Astros. 2006–07 Lidge pitched for the United States national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, throwing two scoreless innings. Later that year, Lidge became the third pitcher in Astros history to record 100 saves with the club, after Wagner and Dave Smith, and this led the Astros to sign Lidge to a one- year, $5.35 million contract that would keep him in Houston through the 2007 season. However, Lidge was demoted from the closer's role on April 9, 2007.Wheeler to replace Lidge as closer MLB.com Lidge would later regain his role in mid-June as the closer after going 10+ scoreless innings and posting a 2.45 era. On July 17, 2007, Lidge pitched a scoreless ninth inning against the Washington Nationals, striking out two and walking one, to earn his first save of the 2007 season. Lidge finished the season 5–3 with 19 saves in 27 chances for the Astros. On November 7, 2007, Lidge was acquired by the Philadelphia Phillies along with infielder Eric Bruntlett in exchange for outfielder Michael Bourn, pitcher Geoff Geary, and Mike Costanzo. Philadelphia Phillies (2008–2011) 2008 Phillies fan on October 31, 2008 at World Series championship parade at 16th and Market Streets in Philadelphia Lidge during pregame warmups for the Phillies in 2008 In February 2008, Lidge tore the meniscus in his right knee while pitching off the mound during Spring training. To exacerbate matters, this was the same knee that he had had surgery on during the off-season. Later in the month, he had successful arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the torn meniscus. As a result, Lidge sat out until April 5 to start the season. During the early 2008 season, Lidge showed signs that he regained the dominant form he displayed in his earlier career. In the opening two months of the season, he converted 12 save opportunities and allowed just two earned runs. In May, Lidge returned to Minute Maid Park, where he was greeted by a mixed reaction from Astros fans, but he recorded his 12th save of the season against his former team. He opened the month of June, usually the start of the summer's heavy-hitting season, with three saves earned in three straight games versus the Florida Marlins and the Cincinnati Reds. In July 2008, Lidge signed a 3-year contract extension with the Phillies. Lidge also set new Phillies records by converting his first 19 save opportunities and 35 straight saves. Lidge was named to the roster of the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was announced before the game as the closer. After warming up six separate times, he ended up the final pitcher available in the game, and pitched in the 15th inning. He allowed a game-winning sacrifice fly in the bottom half of the inning, as the American League won the game, 4–3. On September 27, 2008, Lidge became the first closer in Phillies history to be perfect in regular season saves, converting 41 in as many opportunities, as he secured the National League East division title for the Phillies. He is the first closer since Éric Gagné in 2003 to have a perfect conversion rate and 30+ saves. Lidge finished the 2008 season with 41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games. He saved the decisive Game 5 of the 2008 World Series in Philadelphia on October 29, 2008 over the Tampa Bay Rays with a strikeout, to make him 7 for 7 in postseason saves, thus completing his perfect season (a record he shares with John Wetteland, Troy Percival, Koji Uehara, Zach Britton and Greg Holland; Robb Nen was also 7 for 7 in 2002 before he blew one on the 8th opportunity). Lidge was eighth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, Ryan Braun, Manny Ramirez, Lance Berkman, CC Sabathia, and David Wright, and was the only player other than Pujols or Howard to receive first place votes. He received the MLB Comeback Player of the Year and DHL Delivery Man of the Year awards.

PSWA Dinner official website. Retrieved 2010-12-13. He was named the inaugural recipient of the Daily News Sportsperson of the Year award. Lidge gave twelve customized Rolex Submariners to the members of the Phillies bullpen to commemorate his perfect season.https://goldinauctions.com/Brad_Lidge_Personalized_Rolex_Submariner__Perfect_- LOT15909.aspxhttps://goldinauctions.com/Roy_Halladay_2010_Perfect_Game_Personalized_Baume_- LOT15908.aspx 2009 Lidge's 2009 season was a complete reversal of fortune from the prior year, in which he was perfect in save opportunities. Through the month of June, Lidge had an ERA of 7.57 in innings pitched, while he converted only 14 of 20 save opportunities. Lidge missed most of June due to injury, as he was placed on the disabled list due to a sprained right knee. After returning to the Phillies, Lidge's performance did not improve and he continued to blow leads and save opportunities, but Phillies manager Charlie Manuel continued to support Lidge and reiterate that he was the team's closer. By September, though, Lidge had struggled long enough that Manuel began using other relievers to close games. Lidge was used in different situations out of the bullpen, but did not find a role where he pitched consistently well. Lidge finished the season with a win-loss record of 0–8, an ERA of 7.21, and 31 saves in 42 opportunities, and he allowed an average of 1.81 walks plus hits per inning pitched. For closers with at least 20 saves in a season, Lidge's 2009 ERA is the worst in MLB history. Lidge's best month of the season was July, when his ERA was 5.91, and his best save streak stretched only 8 consecutive saves. In the National League Division Series against the Colorado Rockies, Lidge appeared in Games 3 and 4 in save situations, earning the save in both games. In Game 1 of the 2009 National League Championship Series, Lidge secured his 3rd save helping the Phillies win 8–6. In Game 4 of the series, Lidge pitched in relief of Scott Eyre to retire the last two batters with the Phillies trailing 4–3 in the ninth inning. He eventually got his first win of 2009 after Jimmy Rollins hit a game-winning double to give the Phillies a 5–4 victory. Entering the 2009 World Series, Lidge and the New York Yankees' Mariano Rivera were the only closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason. In Game 4 which would be Lidge's only appearance in that World Series, he gave up three runs in the ninth inning, giving the Yankees a 7–4 win and a 3-1 lead in the series. The Yankees went on to win the series in six games. 2010 Lidge underwent elbow surgery in January 2010,Lidge has successful elbow surgery MLB.com and he pitched in rehabilitation games with the Phillies' minor league teams (Clearwater, Reading, & Lehigh Valley) during the beginning of the 2010 season.Lidge hurls scoreless inning at Triple-A MLB.com He made his first major league appearance of the season on April 30 against the New York Mets, surrendering a home run to the first batter he faced and recording one out before being removed from the game. On June 22, 2010, Lidge recorded his 200th save against the Cleveland Indians. After spending most of the first half on the disabled list, Lidge rebounded from the previous season. He converted 17 of his last 18 save opportunities during the regular season and recorded two saves during a 2010 postseason in which he did not allow a run. Lidge finished 2010 with a 2.96 ERA and 27 saves in 32 opportunities. 2011 Lidge started the year on the 60-day disabled list. He returned in late July 2011, losing his spot as the closer to teammate Ryan Madson. He took on a long reliever's role and at the end of the season, the Phillies declined his 2012 option, making him a free agent. Washington Nationals 2012 Lidge with the Nationals in 2012, his final MLB season On January 27, 2012, Lidge signed a one-year contract with the Washington Nationals worth $1 million. Lidge was initially expected to be the setup man for Washington, but late in spring training it was expected that Lidge could become the closer after Drew Storen was sidelined with elbow inflammation. After converting only 2 of 4 save opportunities and accruing a 5.14 ERA over seven single-inning appearances through April 21, Lidge was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 27 (retroactive to April 22) with an abdominal wall strain. He was replaced on the roster by Ryan Perry and as closer by Henry Rodriguez. Lidge returned to the active roster on June 7. However, after a number of poor performances, Lidge was designated for assignment on June 17.RHP Brad Lidge designated for assignment MLB.com Retirement After a troubled 2012 season, Lidge retired from Major League Baseball on December 2, 2012.

The corundum is blue, or sapphire. Wet slab, wide. Emery, or corundite, is a dark granular rock used to make abrasive powder. It largely consists of corundum (aluminium oxide), mixed with other minerals such as the iron-bearing spinels, hercynite, and magnetite, and also rutile (titania). Industrial emery may contain a variety of other minerals and synthetic compounds such as magnesia, mullite, and silica. It is black or dark grey in colour, less dense than translucent-brown corundum with a specific gravity of between 3.5 and 3.8. Because it can be a mixture of minerals, no definite Mohs hardness can be assigned: the hardness of corundum is 9 and that of some spinel-group minerals is near 8, but the hardness of others such as magnetite is near 6. Crushed or naturally eroded emery (known as black sand) is used as an abrasive—for example, on emery boards and emery cloth. It is also used as a traction enhancer in asphalt and tarmac mixtures. Turkey and Greece are the main suppliers of the world's emery. These two countries produced about 17,500 tons of the mineral in 1987. The Greek island of Naxos used to be the main source of this industrially important rock type. It has been mined on the eastern side of Naxos for well over two thousand years. However, demand for emery has decreased with the development of sintered carbide and oxide materials as abrasives. A small quantity of emery is used in coated abrasive products, but its main use in the United States is wear-resistant floors and pavements. Many tons are shipped to Asia to be used in grinding rice. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set permissible exposure limits for emery in the workplace: TWA 15 mg/m3 total exposure and TWA 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure.

Performances may appear to include hypnosis, telepathy, clairvoyance, divination, precognition, psychokinesis, mediumship, mind control, memory feats, deduction, and rapid mathematics. Mentalists are sometimes categorized as psychic entertainers, although that category also contains non-mentalist performers such as psychic readers and bizarrists. Background Much of what modern mentalists perform in their acts can be traced back directly to \\"tests\\" of supernatural power that were carried out by mediums, spiritualists, and psychics in the 19th century.Cassidy, Bob: \\"Fundamentals of Professional Mentalism\\". Lybrary, 2007. pp. 7-9. However, the history of mentalism goes back even further. Accounts of seers and oracles can be found in works by the ancient Greeks and in the Old Testament of the Bible. Among magicians, the mentalism performance generally cited as one of the earliest on record was by diplomat and pioneering sleight- of-hand magician Girolamo Scotto in 1572. The performance of mentalism may utilize these principles along with sleights, feints, misdirection, and other skills of street or stage magic. Performance approaches Styles of presentation can vary greatly. Traditional performers such as Dunninger and Annemann attributed their results to supernatural or psychic skills . Some contemporary performers, such as Derren Brown, attribute their results to natural skills, such as the ability to read body language or to manipulate the subject subliminally through psychological suggestion. Others, including Chan Canasta and David Berglas would make no specific claims but leave it up to the audience to decide. Contemporary mentalists often take their shows onto the streets and perform tricks to a live, unsuspecting audience. They do this by approaching random members of the public and ask to demonstrate their supernatural powers. Performers such as Derren Brown who often adopt this method of performance tell their audience before the trick starts that everything they see is an illusion and that they are not really \\"having their mind read.\\" This has been the cause of a lot of controversy in the sphere of magic as some mentalists want their audience to believe that this type of magic is \\"real\\" while others think that it is morally wrong to lie to a spectator. Mentalist or magician Mentalists generally do not mix \\"standard\\" magic tricks with their mental feats. Doing so associates mentalism too closely with the theatrical trickery employed by stage magicians. Many mentalists claim not to be magicians at all, arguing that it is a different art form altogether. The argument is that mentalism invokes belief and when presented properly, is offered as being \\"real\\"—be it a claim of psychic ability, or proof that supports other claims such as a photographic memory, being a \\"human calculator\\", the power of suggestion, NLP, or other skills. Mentalism plays on the senses and a spectator's perception of tricks. Magicians ask the audience to suspend their disbelief and allow their imagination to play with the various tricks they present. They admit that they are tricksters and entertainers, and know the audience understands it's an illusion and the magician cannot really achieve the impossible feats shown, such as sawing a person in half and putting them back together without injury. However, many magicians mix mentally-themed performance with magic illusions. For example, a mind-reading stunt might also involve the magical transposition of two different objects. Such hybrid feats of magic are often called mental magic by performers. Magicians who routinely mix magic with mental magic include David Copperfield, David Blaine, The Amazing Kreskin, and Dynamo. Notable mentalists who mix magic with mentalism include The Amazing Kreskin, Richard Osterlind, David Berglas, Derren Brown, and Joseph Dunninger.

The Tudor rose (sometimes called the Union rose) is the traditional floral heraldic emblem of England and takes its name and origins from the House of Tudor, which united the House of Lancaster and the House of York. The Tudor rose consists of five white inner petals, representing the House of York, and five red outer petals to represent the House of Lancaster. Origins In the Battle of Bosworth Field (1485), Henry VII, of the House of Lancaster, took the crown of England from Richard III, of the House of York. He thus brought to an end the retrospectively dubbed \\"Wars of the Roses.\\" Kings of the House of Lancaster had sometimes used a red or gold rose as a badge; and the House of York had lately used a white rose as a badge. Henry's father was Edmund Tudor, and his mother was Margaret Beaufort from the House of Lancaster; in January 1486 he married Elizabeth of York to bring all factions together. (In battle, Richard III fought under the banner of the boar, and Henry under the banner of the dragon of his native Wales.) The white rose versus red rose juxtaposition was Henry's invention.Penn, Thomas. \\"How Henry VII branded the Tudors\\", The Guardian, 2 March 2012 The historian Thomas Penn writes: On his marriage, Henry VII adopted the Tudor rose badge conjoining the White Rose of York and the Red Rose of Lancaster. The Tudor rose is occasionally seen divided in quarters (heraldically as \\"quartered\\") and vertically (in heraldic terms per pale) red and white.Wise, p. 22 More often, the Tudor rose is depicted as a double rose,Fox-Davies, The Complete Guide to Heraldry, p. 270 white on red and is always described, heraldically, as \\"proper\\" (that is, naturally-coloured, despite not actually existing in nature). 16th-century woodcut of the coronation of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon showing them with their respective badges: the Tudor rose and the Spanish pomegranate Elizabeth I. Historical uses Henry VII was reserved in his usage of the Tudor rose. He regularly used the Lancastrian rose by itself, being the house to which he belonged. His successor Henry VIII, descended from both houses, would use the rose more often. When Arthur, Prince of Wales, died in 1502, his tomb in Worcester Cathedral used both roses; thereby asserting his royal descent from both the houses of Lancaster and York. During his reign, Henry VIII had the legendary \\"Round Table\\" at Winchester Castle – then believed to be genuine – repainted.Starkey, p. 41 The new paint scheme included a Tudor rose in the centre. Previous to this, his father Henry VII had built the Henry VII Chapel at Westminster Abbey (it was later used for the site of his tomb) and it was decorated principally with the Tudor rose and the Beaufort portcullis – as a form of propaganda to define his claim to the throne. The Tudor rose badge may appear slipped and crowned: shown as a cutting with a stem and leaves beneath a crown; this badge appears in Nicholas Hilliard's \\"Pelican Portrait\\" of Elizabeth I and since an Order in Council (dated 5 November 1800), has served as the royal floral emblem of England. The Tudor rose may also appear dimidiated (cut in half and combined with half another emblem) to form a compound badge. The Westminster Tournament Roll includes a badge of Henry and his first wife Catherine of Aragon with a slipped Tudor rose conjoined with Catherine's personal badge, the Spanish pomegranate;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 276 their daughter Mary I bore the same badge.Boutell, p. 229 Following his ascent to the English throne, James VI of Scotland and I of England used a badge consisting of a Tudor rose dimidiated with a Scottish thistle and surmounted by a royal crown.Fox-Davies (1907), p. 117. The Tudor rose was also used in the coat of arms of William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe. Contemporary uses The crowned and slipped Tudor rose is used as the plant badge of England, as Scotland uses the thistle, Wales uses the leek, and Ireland uses the shamrock (Northern Ireland sometimes using flax instead). As such, it is seen on the dress uniforms of the Yeomen Warders at the Tower of London, and of the Yeomen of the Guard. It features in the design of the 20-pence coin minted between 1982 and 2008, and in the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. It also features on the coat of arms of Canada. As part of the badge of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Tudor rose represents England alongside the floral badges of the other constituent parts of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The heraldic badge of the Royal Navy's future flagship aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth uses a Tudor rose with colours divided vertically (per pale), inheriting the heraldry of the early twentieth century super-dreadnought oil-fired fast battleship HMS Queen Elizabeth. The Tudor rose makes up part of the cap badge of the Intelligence Corps of the British Army. The Tudor rose is used as the emblem of The Nautical Training Corps, a uniformed youth organisation founded in Brighton in 1944 with 20 units in South East England. The corps badge has the Tudor Rose on the shank of an anchor with the motto \\"For God, Queen and Country\\". It is also used as part of the Corps' cap badge. The Tudor rose is also prominent in a number of towns and cities. The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, uses the emblem frequently, due to the town being given Royal Town status by Henry VIII. The Tudor rose appears on the coat of arms of Oxford. It is also notably used (albeit in a monochromatic form) as the symbol of the VisitEngland, England's tourist board. The borough and county of Queens in New York City uses a Tudor rose on its flag and seal. The flag and seal of Annapolis, Maryland, features a Tudor rose and a thistle surmounted with a crown. The city of York, South Carolina is nicknamed \\"The White Rose City\\", and the nearby city of Lancaster, South Carolina is nicknamed \\"The Red Rose City\\".

Apostleship of Prayer In November 1887, Cullen was appointed director for Ireland of the Apostleship of Prayer, to spread devotion to the Sacred Heart. To that end, in 1888, he founded the Irish Messenger of the Sacred Heart which he saw as a means to promote temperance, by presenting temperance as an expression of one’s devotion to the Sacred Heart. Though primarily a vehicle for the promotion of devotion to the Sacred Heart, Cullen also utilized the Messenger for the propagation of devotion to Mary.Jesuit Sodalities in Dublin In February 1892, Cullen travelled to the Cape Colony of South Africa and kept a lengthy diary with a view to future articles in the Messenger.

Infoseek was originally operated by the Infoseek Corporation, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.\\"Contacting Infoseek.\\" Infoseek. July 2, 1997. Retrieved on January 20, 2010. Infoseek was bought by The Walt Disney Company in 1999, and the technology was merged with that of the Disney-acquired Starwave to form the Go.com network. History Infoseek launched in January 1994 as a pay-for-use service. The service was dropped in August 1994 and Infoseek was relaunched as Infoseek search in February 1995. In 1995, Infoseek struck a deal with Netscape to become the default search engine on Netscape Navigator. On June 11, 1996, Infoseek's initial public offering started trading on Nasdaq (under the name SEEK) at $12 per share. By September 1997, Infoseek had 7.3 million visitors per month. It was the 7th most visited website that year (5th in 1996) and 10th in 1998. Infoseek acquired the WebChat Broadcasting System in April 1998. In 1998, Disney purchased a 43% stake of Infoseek, and incorporated the site into its various media businesses. Around the same time, Disney acquired the Starwave Corporation, which included ESPN.com and ABCNews.com. In 1999, Disney acquired the remaining Infoseek stock it didn't own. Disney bundled its Starwave properties and Infoseek and formed the GO.com portal. Infoseek was among the first search engines to sell advertising on a CPM, Cost Per Thousand Impressions, basis. In 1997, the first Cost Per Click programs, as well as the precursor to pop-ups called daughter windows, was sold by east coast sales executive Robert Formentin to Grey Advertising for a Procter & Gamble Pampers campaign. In 1998, Infoseek was the first internet company to develop and launch behavioral targeting via its UltraMatch targeting algorithms. In 1999, Infoseek engineer Li Yanhong moved to Beijing, China and co-founded the search engine Baidu. In February 2001, Disney decided to cancel the service and lay off all staff. Also in 2001, Bernt Wahl, Andy Bensky and 15 software engineers, all Infoseek employees, led a management buyout attempt from Disney but were ultimately rebuffed. Post-demise Infoseek's Ultraseek Server software technology, an enterprise search engine product, was sold in 2000 to Inktomi. Under Inktomi, Ultraseek Server was renamed \\"Inktomi Enterprise Search\\". In December 2002 (prior to the Yahoo! acquisition of Inktomi), the Ultraseek product suite was sold to a competitor Verity Inc, who re- established the Ultraseek brand name and continued development of the product. Rakuten agreed in November 2000 to acquire Infoseek Japan for $81 million. In December 2005, Verity was acquired by Autonomy PLC. Under Autonomy, Ultraseek ceased to be a stand-alone product and became a modular component under the IDOL platform. It continued to be developed and marketed as Autonomy's entry- level keyword-based site search offering until after Autonomy was acquired by Hewlett-Packard (HP) in October 2011.

He was born in Mitimiti, Northland and is widely regarded as one of New Zealand's most important artists. In 1994 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Otago and in 2003 received an Icon Award from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand. In the 2012 New Year Honours, Hotere was appointed to the Order of New Zealand for services to New Zealand.\\"New Year Honours 2012\\" (27 January 2012) 8 The New Zealand Gazette 215. Early history Hotere was born in Mitimiti, close to the Hokianga Harbour in the Northland Region, one of 15 children. When Hotere was 9, his older brother Jack enlisted in the army. Jack was killed in action in Italy in 1943. Hotere received his secondary education at Hato Petera College, Auckland, where he studied from 1946 to 1949. After early art training at the Auckland Teachers' Training College under the tutelage of J. D. Charlton Edgar, he moved to Dunedin in 1952, where he studied at Dunedin School of Art, part of King Edward Technical College. During the later 1950s, he worked as a schools art advisor for the Education Department in the Bay of Islands. In 1961 Hotere gained a New Zealand Art Societies Fellowship and travelled to England where he studied at the Central School of Art and Design in London. During 1962–1964 he studied in France and travelled around Europe, during which time he witnessed the development of the Pop Art and Op Art movements. His travels took him, among other places, to the war cemetery in Italy where his brother was buried. This event, and the politics of Europe during the 1960s, had a profound effect on Hotere’s work, notably in the Sangro and Polaris series of paintings. Return to New Zealand Hotere returned to New Zealand and exhibited in Dunedin in 1965, and returned to the city in 1969 when he became the University of Otago's Frances Hodgkins Fellow. At about that time he began to introduce literary elements to his work. He worked with poets such as Hone Tuwhare and Bill Manhire to produce several strong paintings, and produced other works specifically for the New Zealand literary journal Landfall. Hotere also worked in collaboration with other prominent artists, notably Bill Culbert. From the 1970s onward, Hotere was noted for his use of unusual tools and materials in creating his work, notably the use of power tools on corrugated iron and steel within the context of two-dimensional art. Black paintings Black Phoenix (1984–88), a major installation now in the collection of Te Papa Tongarewa. From 1968, Hotere began the series of works with which he is perhaps best known, the Black Paintings. In these works, black is used almost exclusively. In some works, strips of colour are placed against stark black backgrounds in a style reminiscent of Barnett Newman. In other black paintings, stark simple crosses appear in the gloom, black on black. Though minimalist, the works, as with those of most good abstractionists, have a redolent poetry of their own. The simple markings speak of transcendence, of religion, or peace. Black Phoenix The themes of the black paintings extended to later works, notably the colossal Black Phoenix (1984–88), constructed out of the burnt remains of a fishing boat. This major installation incorporates the prow of the boat flanked by burnt planks of wood. Other planks form a pathway leading the prow. Each plank has had a strip laid bare to reveal the natural wood underneath beneath. Several of the boards are inscribed with a traditional Maori proverb, Ka hinga atu he tete-kura haramai he tete-kura (\\"As one fern frond (person) dies - one is born to take its place\\"). A slight change has been made in the wording of the proverb, replacing haramai (transfer, pass over) to ara mai (the path forward), possibly indicating the cleared pathway of bare wood in front of the boat's burnt prow. The work measures 5m by 13m by 5.5m. Political art Politics were entwined in the subject matter of Hotere's art from an early stage. Alongside the Black Paintings series, which continued until not long before his death. Hotere's political works also continued. When Aramoana, a wetland near his Port Chalmers home, was proposed as the site for an aluminium smelter, Hotere was vocal in his opposition, and produced the Aramoana series of paintings. Similarly, he produced series protesting against a controversial rugby tour by New Zealand of apartheid-era South Africa (Black Union Jack) in 1981, and the sinking of the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior (Black rainbow) in 1985. Later, his reactions to Middle East politics resulted in works such as Jerusalem, Jerusalem and This might be a double cross jack. Hotere's work was slowed by a stroke in 2001, but he continued to create and exhibit regularly until his death in February 2013. A documentary film of the artist's life and work, Hotere, was released by Paradise Films in 2001, in association with Creative New Zealand and the New Zealand Film Commission. Written and directed by Merata Mita, the documentary made its overseas debut at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. Personal life Hotere was married three times, with two of his wives also being artists. His second wife was artist and poet Cilla McQueen, whom he married in 1973, and with whom he moved to Careys Bay near Port Chalmers in 1974. The two separated amicably during the 1990s. Hotere later married Mary McFarlane, another notable artist, in February 2002.Cook, M. \\"Dunedin artists confirm February wedding,\\" Otago Daily Times, 11 May 2002, p. 2 Hotere died on 24 February 2013, aged 81 and was survived by his daughter Andrea, three mokopuna (grandchildren) and also his third wife Mary. He was buried at Mitimiti. Hotere Garden Oputae Hotere's former studio was on land at the tip of Observation Point, the large bluff overlooking the Port Chalmers container terminal. When the port's facilities were expanded, part of the bluff was removed, including the area of Hotere's studio (after strenuous objection from many of the town's residents). Part of the bluff close to the removed portion is now an award-winning sculpture garden, the Hotere Garden Oputae, organised in 2005 by Hotere and featuring works by both him and by other noted New Zealand modern sculptors.\\"Design award for Hotere garden.\\" Otago Daily Times, 20 August 2008.

The traditional chronological order attributed to Ibn Abbās became widely accepted following its adoption by the 1924 Egyptian standard edition.Gerhard Böwering, \\"Chronology and the Quran\\", Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an, Vol. 1, Brill The Meccan chapters are believed to have been revealed anytime before the migration of the Islamic prophet Muhammed and his followers from Mecca to Medina (Hijra). The Medinan surahs are those supposed revelations that occurred after the move. Meccan surahs are typically shorter than Medinan surahs, with relatively short verses (āyāt), and mostly come near the end of the Qur'an. (As a general rule, the chapters of the Qur'an are ordered from longest to shortest.) Most of the chapters containing Muqatta'at are Meccan.http://textminingthequran.com/wiki/Makki_and_Madani_Surahs The division of chapters into 'Meccan' and 'Medinan' is primarily a consequence of stylistic and thematic considerations. Classification of the chapters into these periods is based upon factors such as the length of the verse and the presence or absence of certain key concepts or words (e.g. al-Rahman as name of God).(in Reviews) Studie zur Komposition der mekkanischen Suren by Angelika Neuwirth, Review author[s]: A.

The First Meccan surahs are chapters that have been revealed throughout that period. They reflect the public setting in which they seem to have been shared and due to their structure and length, they seem to be presented in a manner that would be very easy to memorize and pass along orally,McAuliffe, Jane Dammen. \\"The Cambridge Companion to the Quran\\". Cambridge: 2006. 110 not to mention that many of the surahs seem to be used during early liturgies. They are relatively shorter than other chapters in the Quran but are more diverse in terms of structure. Compared to other later surahs, the surahs of the First Meccan Period employ more rhymes despite their shorter length.How to Read the Quran by Ernst, page 76 They rank from being very short, a paragraph of less than 5 verses (for example surah 97, 103, 105, 108 and 111) to being organized in clusters of two (surahs 81, 91), three (surahs 82, 84, 86, 90, 92) or four verses (surahs 85, 89). Some of these surahs also take on a balanced tripartite structure that begin and conclude with. The major theme of these surahs revolves around presenting to humanity how obvious the existence of God is through the use of oath formulas involving the power of nature in an emphatic tone.How to Read the Quran by Ernst, page 77 We especially see the surahs reference destroyed civilizations, declaring their destruction to be the will of God. A huge stress is put on God being the creator of Earth and Heaven and everything that lies in between and also His unreachable generosity. In addition, certain surahs generally talk about ethics and values human beings should have, specially the fact that human beings should be humbled by God's power, they should not pursue an extravagant life, be loving and sharing, most particularly with the poorer. Last but not least these surahs contains eschatological prophecies.McAuliffe, 108 Although not as elaborated as in later surahs, these prophecies appear with a threatening tone to make people generally know about the existence of the Day of Judgement and all what it encompasses (surah 103, 68, etc.), but also, they contain some of the more visual explanations of Heaven..  Second Meccan surahs  There are 21 surahs in the second Meccan period. These surahs have, on average, ayah between twelve and twenty syllables in length. Some surahs have fewer than fifty ayah, while others, such as surah 20, “Ta-Ha,” have well over 100 verses.Robinson, Neal. Discovering the Qurʼan: A Contemporary Approach to a Veiled Text. Washington, D.C.: Georgetown UP, 2003. Print. These surahs do not necessarily have distinct features, as the surahs of the first and third Meccan periods do, but instead display a blend of features from both earlier and later Meccan surahs. These middle surahs keep and expand upon the tripartite structure of the verse. According to Ernst, surahs that adhere to this structure (common in pre-Islamic Arab poetry) will have shorter first and third sections that parallel each other in scope and audience. The third section will “normally conclude with a flourish.” These parts bookend a somewhat larger middle section, which is “typically a narrative of prophecy and struggle”.Ernst, 105 These surahs also tend to use fewer oaths than earlier Meccan surahs, but take a much more confrontational approach in regards to the disbelievers. Some surahs in this period adopt a form resembling a monotheistic service, as is often seen in later Meccan surahs.McAuliffe For example, surah 20 begins with a section proclaiming the greatness of God, and then transitions immediately into a story about Moses. After the lengthy story concludes, several verses are devoted to explaining the meaning of the story, especially as it relates to the disbelievers.Haleem, Abdel. The Qur'an. New York: Oxford UP, 2010. Print. Due to the presence of elements from earlier and later Meccan surahs, surahs of the middle Meccan period exemplify the gradual development of the Qur'anic revelations over time, as Muhammad’s community slowly grew and changed. This is manifest in the fact that surahs of the second Meccan period tend toward self-referentiality, wherein the Qur'an uses \\"qur'an\\" (recitation or the Qu'ran) and \\"kitaab\\" (book) to make mention to its own existence (surahs 54, 37, 15, et al.), noting that indeed there is a holy message coming from God. Controversy from these verses have sprung up, wherein the question of the Word's existence is debated. Some believe that the Qur'an existed/exists for all time with God, while others believe that the Qur'an was simply the Word for the Arab peoples of Muhammad from his prophecy onward. Third Meccan surahs This period is marked from the beginning of Muhammad's public ministry to the Hijra, or the Abyssinian emigration. According to the Yusuf Ali translation, the Third Meccan period refers to the time period from the seventh year to the Hijra, approximately 619-622 A.D. This period is characterized by the persecution of Muhammad and the Muslims by the Quraysh as it expanded to his clan, the Hashem. To persuade the clan to relent their protection of Muhammad, the Quraysh boycotted the Hashem.\\"Chronological Koran Part III: Late Meccan Period: A.D. 619-622.\\" Wolf Pangloss. N.p., n.d. Web. 31 Oct. 2013. Revelations from this period are characterized by descriptions of the resurrection, paradise, and Judgment Day.\\"Koran.\\" - Original Catholic Encyclopedia. N.p., n.d. Web. 31 Oct. 2013. In this period, the tripartite structure is abandoned for longer and less complex structure, showing a form of collection that still remains a mystery to scholars. They contain mostly long addresses to the community of the believers (much larger by this time). Also Muhammad begins to be addressed directly by God instead of being used as merely the medium by which God's message is transmitted.McAuliffe, 111 surahs of this period show the ways in which believers should act even when they face opposition and difficulties. By the third Meccan period, sensuous imagery of full-bosomed, wide-eyed and virginal maidens have been replaced by references to spouses.Robinson, Neal. Discovering the Qurʼan: A Contemporary Approach to a Veiled Text. Washington, D.C.: Georgetown UP, 2003. 88-92. N78/E6o of the Third Meccan Period: 'whoever of their fathers, their spouses and offspring have acted honourably' By the Third Meccan period, Muhammad and the Muslims had gained sufficient support. In the early Meccan periods, these sensuous descriptions and temptations of voluptuous virgins were used to attract the attention of the Meccan pagans however by the Third Meccan period goals had been realigned not to attract pagans but to encourage and foster a law-abiding community centered around worshipping the Word of God.

Its members are commonly called Pioneers. While the PTAA does not advocate prohibition, it does require of its members complete abstinence from alcoholic drink. It also encourages devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus as an aid to resisting the temptation of alcohol. Pioneers wear a lapel pin called a Pioneer pin with an image of the Sacred Heart, both to advertise the organisation and to alert others not to offer them alcohol. The association publishes a monthly magazine, The Pioneer. History The PTAA was founded in 1898 by James Cullen, in response to widespread alcoholism among Irish Catholics as the earlier temperance movement of Father Mathew was fading from memory. In the 20th Century, the term Pioneer became synonymous with teetotalism among Irish Catholics, and the PTAA influenced public policy. In 1923, Eoin O'Duffy as Commissioner of the Garda Síochána (Civic Guard) encouraged members to join the PTAA, and allowed Gardaí to wear the Pioneer pin on their uniforms, in exemption to a general ban on symbols and adornments. The Irish Defence Forces also allow its personnel to wear the Pioneer pin on their uniforms, one of only two civilian symbols allowed to be worn in uniform, the other being the Fáinne. By 1948, the PTAA claimed 360,000 members. In 1956, a Commission of Enquiry into the licensing laws in the Republic of Ireland was appointed by the Minister for Justice, James Everett; the PTAA nominated one of the 22 members, John K. Clear.Butler, op. cit., pg 30. Clear assented to the majority report of the Commission, which favoured easing the (widely disregarded) restrictions on opening hours of public houses introduced in 1925, although the Catholic hierarchy subsequently opposed the resulting Act.Butler, op. cit., pg 31. Activity Roman Catholic children in Ireland who make their Confirmation (typically at the age of 11–12) are encouraged to promise, or \\"take the pledge\\", not to drink alcohol until they are at least 18 (the legal drinking age in Ireland). The PTAA is active in this drive, and encourages teenagers, particularly in religious-run secondary schools, to join the PTAA and \\"keep the pledge\\". In spite of these efforts, underage drinking is widespread in Ireland. In train with the growing secularization of Irish society, members of the association are increasingly older people. Younger Catholics who choose not to drink alcohol are unlikely to belong to the PTAA. The PTAA does not strive to simply stop people from drinking. It also aims to create opportunities for fun and social activities without the need for the presence of alcohol. It organises many competitions, such as table quizzes, Réadóirí (a talent competition; Réadóirí is the Irish word for Pioneers), and sports. Local centres (parishes or schools) compete in these competitions at regional (against local parishes), diocesan, provincial and all-Ireland level. The Pioneers also run two annual seminars, one for young pioneers (13-18), and one for older Pioneers (18+). The Association issued an appeal for funds from its website in April 2011 in an effort to prevent closure because of the organization's indebtedness.PTAA 2011 Fundraising Appeal Pioneer Association.

Flags may have individual significance as signals, or two or more flags may be manipulated so that their relative positions convey symbols. Flag signals allowed communication at a distance before the invention of radio and are still used especially in connection with ships. Flaghoist signalling Hurricane warning Flaghoist signalling is one or more flags (or pennants) simultaneously flying from a fixed halyard, and generally any method of signaling by such means. Each of the flags has a distinct shape and color combination. Each flag or combination of flags has a preassigned meaning or \\"code\\". The International Code of Signals defines a standard set of flags and associated alphabet suitable for international use, as well as a set of standard codes. Flaghoist is also used in boat racing, to warn of impending severe weather, and other specialized applications. Maritime flag signalling has a long history, especially prior to the advent of radio, and remains the preferred means of signaling in many situations. In naval flag signalling, additional flags and an expanded list of signals are used for identification and commands, as well as the mercantile uses. Many navies have their own proprietary or secret codes, and use additional flags. A designator flag is used to indicate if a flaghoist signal is meant to be interpreted as an ICS signal or as a naval signal. The U.S. Navy uses a set of 68 flags, including flags for each letter of the alphabet and each numeral to convey messages of tactical or administrative nature. Semaphore Flag semaphore signalling uses two flags, held in specific positions to signify letters. This method requires simple equipment but can be obscured by bad weather. A permanently installed chain of semaphore stations is a semaphore line and before the invention of the electric telegraph, was the fastest means of communication over moderately long distances. Wig-wag flags US Signal Corps guidon features wig-wag flags In the 1850s, U.S. Army Major Albert J. Myer, a surgeon by training, developed a system using left or right movements of a flag (or torch or lantern at night). Myer's system used a single flag, waved back and forth in a binary code conceptually similar to the Morse code of dots and dashes. This is sometimes called the wig-wag method of signaling, or \\"wig- wagging\\". More mobile than previous means of optical telegraphy, as it only required one flag, this code was used extensively by Signal Corps troops on both sides in the American Civil War. (Its first use in battle was by Confederate Lieutenant Edward Porter Alexander at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861. In this code, alphabet letters were equated with three positions of a single flag, disk, or light. The flags measured two, four, or six feet (60, 120 or 180 cm) square and were generally either red or black banners with white square centers or white banners with red square centers. The disks were 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) in diameter and were made of metal or wood frames with canvas surfaces. Somewhat easier to handle than the flags, they provided a different method for daylight communications. The lights were kerosene lanterns attached to a staff. A second \\"foot torch\\" was placed on the ground before the signalman as a fixed point of reference, making it easier for the recipient to follow the lantern's movements. Myer's code was ternary (three symbols). However, only two of these symbols were used for letters, making it largely binary. The third symbol only appeared in control characters. Each character consisted of a combination of three basic motions (elements). The neutral position was the flagman holding his device vertically and motionless above his head. The first motion was initiated by bringing the device downward on the signalman's right side and then quickly returning it to its upright position. The second motion brought the device down on the left side and then returned it to the starting position. The third motion lowered the device in front of the signalman, then restored it to its vertical position. Like Morse code, but unlike Myer's original code, this binary code did not have a fixed length for each character. For instance, i was coded as \\"2\\", but d was coded as \\"222\\". Myer's 1866 manual also includes a 3-element fixed length code using four elements, and the 1872 manual has a 3-element fixed length code using three elements. There is little sign that these codes were widely used. The 1872 manual includes a variable length code using four elements which Myer says was used by the Army, but is superseded.

Examples of such strategies today have revolved around an Integrated Marketing Communications approach whereby multiple channels of media are used i.e. advertising, public relations, events, direct response media, etc. This concept has been used among proponents of entertainment-education programming where pro-social messages are embedded into dramatic episodic programs to change the audiences attitudes and behaviors in such areas as family planning, literacy, nutrition, smoking, etc. See also * Microphone gaffe * Propaganda * Public Relations References Category:Mass media Category:Marketing strategy Category:Promotion and marketing communications Category:Types of marketing ","title":"Media strategy"},{"id":"1101558","text":"Refugee law is the branch of international law which deals with the rights and duties States have vis-a-vis refugees. There are differences of opinion among international law scholars as to the relationship between refugee law and international human rights law or humanitarian law. The discussion forms part of a larger debate on the fragmentation of international law. While some scholars conceive each branch as a self-contained regime distinct from other branches, others regard the three branches as forming a larger normative system that seeks to protect the rights of all human beings at all time. The proponents of the latter conception view this holistic regime as including norms only applicable to certain situations such as armed conflict and military occupation (IHL) or to certain groups of people including refugees (refugee law), children (the Convention on the Rights of the Child), and prisoners of war (the 1949 Geneva Convention III). Definition of refugee According to the original 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol, refugee children were legally indistinguishable from adult refugees. Although the Convention on the Rights of the Child was not specific to the rights of refugee minors, it was used as the legal blueprint for handling refugee minor cases, where a minor was defined as any person under the age of 18. In 1988, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Guidelines on Refugee Children were published, specifically designed to address the needs of refugee children, officially granting them internationally recognized human rights.Refugee Children: Guidelines on Protection and Care In 1989, however, the UN signed an additional treaty, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which defined the rights of children and bound its signatories to upholding those rights by international law.UN General Assembly, Convention on the Rights of the Child, 20 November 1989, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1577, p. 3 Although the treaty is not specific to the rights of refugee minors, in particular, it was used as the legal blueprint for handling refugee minor cases, where a minor was defined as any person under the age of 18. In particular, it extends the protection of refugee children by allowing participating nations the capacity to recognize children who do not fall under the strict guidelines of the Convention definition but still should not be sent back to their countries of origin. It also extends the principle of nonrefoulement to prohibit the return of a child to their country \\"where there are grounds for believing that there is a real risk of irreparable harm to the child.\\"UN General Assembly, Convention on the Rights of the Child, 20 November 1989, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1577, p. 3, available at: http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b38f0.html [accessed 10 May 2018] There is a variety of definitions as to who is regarded as a refugee, usually defined for the purpose of a particular instrument. The variation of definitions regarding refugees has made it difficult to create a concrete and single vision of what constitutes a refugee following the original refugee convention. Article 1 of the Convention as amended by the 1967 Protocol defines a refugee as: > \\"A person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons > of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or > political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable > or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of > that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country > of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, > owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.\\" The 1967 Protocol removed the temporal restrictions, which restricted refugee status to those whose circumstances had come about \\"as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951\\", and the geographic restrictions which gave States party to the Convention the option of interpreting this as \\"events occurring in Europe\\" or \\"events occurring in Europe or elsewhere\\". However, it also gave those States which had previously ratified the 1951 Convention and chosen to use the geographically restricted definition the option to retain that restriction. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa adopted a regional treaty based on the Convention, adding to the definition that a refugee is > Any person compelled to leave his/her country owing to external aggression, > occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order > in either part or the whole of his country of origin or nationality In 1984, a group of Latin American governments adopted the Cartagena Declaration, which like the OAU Convention, added more objectivity based on significant consideration to the 1951 Convention. The Cartegena Declaration determine that a 'refugee' includes: > Persons who flee their countries because their lives, safety or freedom have > been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal > conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other circumstances which > have seriously disturbed public order. Additionally, US Law draws an important distinction between \\"refugees\\" and \\"asylees\\". A refugee must meet the definition of a refugee, as outlined in the 1951 Convention and be of \\"special humanitarian concern to the United States.\\" Refugee status can only be obtained from outside the US. If an individual who meets the definition of a refugee, and is seeking admission in a port of entry is already in the US, they are eligible to apply for asylum status. The term displaced person has come to be synonymous with refugees due to a substantial amount of overlap in their legal definitions. However, they are legally distinct, and convey subtle differences. In general, a displaced person refers to \\"one who has not crossed a national border and thus does not qualify for formal refugee status.\\" Sources Refugee law encompasses both customary law, peremptory norms, and international legal instruments. The only international instruments directly applying to refugees are the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Both the Convention and the Protocol are open to states, but each may be signed separately. 145 states have ratified the Convention, and 146 have ratified the Protocol. These instruments only apply in the countries that have ratified an instrument, and some countries have ratified these instruments subject to various reservations. * The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights * The 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees * The 1966 Bangkok Principles on Status and Treatment of Refugees adopted at the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee in 1966 * The 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees * The 1967 UN General Assembly Declaration on Territorial Asylum * The 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in AfricaThe 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa * The 1974 United Nations Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict * The 1976 Council of Europe's Recommendation 773 (1976) on the Situation of de facto RefugeesRecommendation 773 (1976) on the Situation of de facto Refugee * The 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees for Latin America and its three successors: ** The 1994 Declaration of San José ** The 2004 Mexico Declaration ** The 2014 Brazil Declaration * The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child * The 1998 Conclusion on International Protection by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme * The 2001 Declaration by States Parties to the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees2001 Declaration by States Parties to the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees * The 2003 Convention Plus, in which refugee resettlement was decided to be of central concern of UNHCRhttps://www.unhcr.org/convention-plus.html * The 2004 European Union's Council Directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and content of the protection granted * The 2016 New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants U.S. refugee law Various regions and countries have different variations of refugee law. They all stem from the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol which relates to refugee status. The United States became a party to this protocol in 1968. Despite playing an active role in the drafting of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United States has yet to ratify the treaty, making it the only nation in the UN that is not party to it. See also: U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child Although the aftermath of World War II brought forth a refugee crisis, the large influx and resettlement of Indochinese refugees led to the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980. This law incorporated the International Convention's definitions of a refugee into U.S. law. The law also created the legal basis for the admission of refugees into the U.S. An important aspect of this law is how an individual goes about applying for status. A person may meet the definition of refugee but may not be granted refugee status. If the individual is inside of the U.S. with a different status or no status, they are granted the status of asylee but not refugee. In order to be considered a refugee in the U.S., an individual must: *be located outside of the U.S. *be of specific humanitarian apprehension for the U.S. *be able to validate previous persecution or feared approaching persecution based on the individual's race, religion, nationality, social class, or political outlook *not be currently settled in another country *be admissible to the U.S. The first step of being granted this status is to receive a referral to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). The person is allowed to include their spouse, child, or other family members (only in specific circumstances) when applying for refugee status. After the person is referred, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officer located abroad will conduct an interview to determine refugee resettlement eligibility inside the U.S. If the person is approved as a refugee, they will then be provided with many forms of assistance. These include a loan for travel, advice for travel, a medical exam, and a culture orientation. After the refugee is resettled, they are eligible for medical and cash assistance. The Office of Refugee Resettlement has a program called the Cash and Medical Assistance Program which completely reimburses the assistance in which states provide refugees. The refugee is eligible for this cash and medical assistance up to eight months after their arrival date.  Refugee status determination  The burden of refugee status determination (RSD) falls primarily on the state. However, in cases where states are either unwilling or unable, the UNHCR assumes responsibility. In 2013, the UNHCR managed RSD in over 50 countries and worked in parallel with national governments in 20 countries. In the period from 1997 to 2001, the number of RSD applications submitted to the UNHCR nearly doubled. RSD provides protection for refugees through promoting non-refoulement, resettlement assistance, and direct assistance. Human rights and refugee law Human rights are rights a person is guaranteed on the basis only that they were born as a human being. The following are universal human rights that are most relevant to refugees: *the right to freedom from torture or degrading treatment *the right to freedom of opinion and expression *the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion *the right to life, liberty, and security *freedom from discrimination *right to asylum Refugee law and international human rights law are closely connected in content but differ in their function. The main difference of their function is the way in which international refugee law considers state sovereignty while international human rights law do not. One of the main aspects of international refugee law is non-refoulement which is the basic idea that a country cannot send back a person to their country of origin if they will face endangerment upon return. In this case, a certain level of sovereignty is taken away from a country. This basic right of non-refoulement conflicts with the basic right of sovereign state to expel any undocumented aliens.

In the Middle Ages in Europe, the behaviour expected of the nobility was compiled in courtesy books. History The apex of European courtly culture was reached in the Late Middle Ages and the Baroque period (i.e. roughly the four centuries spanning 1300–1700). The oldest courtesy books date to the 13th century, but they become an influential genre in the 16th, the most influential of them being Il Cortegiano (1508), which not only covered basic etiquette and decorum but also provided models of sophisticated conversation and intellectual skill. The royal courts of Europe did, of course, persist well into the 18th century (and to some limited extent to the present day), but in the 18th century, the notion of courtesy was replaced by that of gallantry, referring to an ideal emphasizing the display of affected sensitivity in direct contrast with the ideals of self-denial and dignified seriousness that were the Baroque norm. During the late medieval and early modern period, the bourgeois class tended to emulate the courtly etiquette of their betters. This changed in the 19th century, after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, with the emergence of a middle class with its own set of bourgeois etiquette, which in turn was mocked in the classist theory of Marxism as petite bourgeoisie. The analogue concept in the court culture of medieval India was known by the Sanskrit term dakṣiṇya, literally meaning \\"right-handedness\\", but as in English dexterity having a figurative meaning of \\"apt, clever, appropriate\\", glossed as \\"kindness and consideration expressed in a sophisticated and elegant way\\".

He was the commander of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army in World War II. Ter Poorten was also Allied land forces commander in the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command on Java during early 1942. Early life Hein ter Poorten was born on 21 November 1887 in Buitenzorg (now Bogor) on Java, which was at the time part of the Dutch East Indies. He was the son of Franciscus Hendricus ter Poorten, a chief mate in the Government Navy, and of Clasina Ambrosina Kater. After having been sworn in as an artillery officer in 1911, he helped to found the army air force, and in 1919 began a course at the Hogere Krijgsschool staff college in the Netherlands. He was invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau with swords for his part in the development of military aviation in 1911.  World War II  He steadily rose up the ranks upon his return to the East Indies, and by July 1939, was the Royal Netherlands Indies Army (KNIL) chief of the general staff. Lieutenant General Gerardus Johannes Berenschot's death in a flying accident in October 1941 saw Ter Poorten, by now also a lieutenant general, promoted to commander in chief of the KNIL. Ter Poorten was regarded by his contemporaries in the army as a skilled commander with a firm understanding of military affairs in the East Indies, and thus was able to get on well with his subordinates and fellow officers; his relations with the civilian administration were less successful. In January 1942, following the outbreak of war with Japan, Ter Poorten was appointed commander of land forces in the American-British-Dutch- Australian Command, a short-lived unified command of all Allied forces in South East Asia. By March, Ter Poorten became the de facto head of all Allied forces on Java, following rapid Japanese advances and the break-up of ABDACOM. It was left to him to unconditionally surrender the island to the Japanese on 8 March 1942. He spent the rest of the war in various prisoner of war camps.  After the war  After his liberation in August 1945, Ter Poorten moved to the Netherlands. He requested his resignation as commander of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and head of the Department of War in November 1945. His request was not granted right away, but he was eventually honorably discharged on 28 February 1946. Despite these honors, Ter Poorten believed that he was being scapegoated for the defeat in the Dutch East Indies. Ter Poorten died on 15 January 1968 in The Hague, at the age of 80.

The Expert Software's Pinball 2000 port of the game renamed this table \\"Rocket\\". *\\"Steel Wheel\\", themed around steam trains and the Old West. *\\"Beat Box\\", themed around the music industry, charts, bands and tours. *\\"Nightmare\\", themed around a graveyard, ghosts, demons, nightmares and generally evil things. Unlike the other tables in the game, the name of the table in the menu did not reflect the name displayed on the table itself--\\"Graveyard\\". Some ports of the game (notably the GameTek port to the Game Boy) name this table \\"Graveyard\\" in the menu as well. Development The ball moves according to reasonably realistic physics, and the game was restricted to using table elements which would also be possible to build in reality.
