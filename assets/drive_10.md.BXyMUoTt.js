After retiring as President, Cross wrote several books, the first of which, Blacks in White Colleges, described his personal experiences during the constitutional desegregation litigation that arose almost immediately after he became the university's young president. George Lynn Cross, President University of Oklahoma 1943-1968. Early life Cross was born to a poor family in Woonsocket, South Dakota. Several of his half siblings had been afflicted with the debilitating condition Huntington's Corea and this, and its humble situation, cast his family into disrepute in the small community. Cross concluded it was not feasible to attend college. It was out of reach, and instead, he aimed at becoming a high school science teacher. But Cross' prowess in athletics, particularly football, attracted the attention of the football program at South Dakota State College. The program helped arrange a dishwashing job for Cross in the women's dormitory on campus, thus enabling Cross to finance his education there. On the first day of school, Cross met Cleo Sikkink of Waubay, South Dakota and the two began a romance. Her family, however, did not approve of the relationship because of Cross' poor prospects and his abject family background. Cleo's family forced her to leave school so as to separate her from Cross, which decision ultimately resulted in the couple's elopement a few months later. Cross then decided football was causing his body too much damage and that it held a limited future, and accordingly, he decided to concentrate on academics as a future livelihood. He studied botany and earned a master's degree in 1927. He then attended the University of Chicago, where he earned his Ph.D. in Botany at the age of 23.  Cross as Teacher and Naturalist  Cross began his teaching career in South Dakota in the early 1930s. In the summer of 1934 at a biological station in Gothic, Colorado, Cross met and befriended one of the deans of ecology and conservation biology, Paul B. Sears, who was at that time teaching at the University of Oklahoma. Sears offered Cross a job and Cross, his wife Cleo and daughter Mary-Lynn moved to Norman, Oklahoma in 1934. Cross was offered a job as an associate professor. Before his death, Cross remarked that he largely took over Sears' teaching responsibilities, so that Sears could finish his watershed work, Deserts on the March, which is considered a classic of conservation biology. Cross's academic specialty was botany, and George Lynn Cross Hall, which houses OU's department of botany and microbiology, was named in his honor and in tribute to this fact. While president, Cross prepared specimen slides that are still used in botany classes. Presidency Cross's popularity quickly grew amongst the faculty and staff, and when the university president at the time stepped down, he was named interim president while the board of regents searched for a new candidate. They eventually realized no better candidate existed and he remained president for 24 years. Cross oversaw the college through a period of skyrocketing enrollment following World War II as thousands of veterans attended under the GI Bill. He saw the construction of 37 new buildings and the donation by the U.S. Navy, in May 1946, of to the campus. Cross also oversaw the integration of the University of Oklahoma and the student protests of the 1960s. Cross was known for his public speaking ability and quick wit. His most famous quote came at a budget meeting with state legislators. After a long presentation and 45 minute justification of the OU budget, a legislator asked him why the university needed more money. A frustrated Cross replied, \\"I would like to build a University of which the football team could be proud.\\" David L. Boren, who served as the university's president from 1994 to 2018, proclaimed that he wanted his time as president of the university to parallel that of Cross's.

Background  The concept of neuronal ensemble dates back to the work of Charles Sherrington who described the functioning of the CNS as the system of reflex arcs, each composed of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In Sherrington's scheme, Œ±-motoneurons are the final common path of a number of neural circuits of different complexity: motoneurons integrate a large number of inputs and send their final output to muscles. Donald Hebb theoretically developed the concept of neuronal ensemble in his famous book \\"The Organization of Behavior\\" (1949). He defined \\"cell assembly\\" as \\"a diffuse structure comprising cells in the cortex and diencephalon, capable of acting briefly as a closed system, delivering facilitation to other such systems\\". Hebb suggested that, depending on functional requirements, individual brain cells could participate in different cell assemblies and be involved in multiple computations. In the 1980s, Apostolos Georgopoulos and his colleagues Ron Kettner, Andrew Schwartz, and Kenneth Johnson formulated a population vector hypothesis to explain how populations of motor cortex neurons encode movement direction. This hypothesis was based on the observation that individual neurons tended to discharge more for movements in particular directions, the so-called preferred directions for individual neurons. In the population vector model, individual neurons 'vote' for their preferred directions using their firing rate. The final vote is calculated by vectorial summation of individual preferred directions weighted by neuronal rates. This model proved to be successful in description of motor- cortex encoding of reach direction, and it was also capable to predict new effects. For example, Georgopoulos' population vector accurately described mental rotations made by the monkeys that were trained to translate locations of visual stimuli into spatially shifted locations of reach targets.  Encoding  Neuronal ensembles encode information in a way somewhat similar to the principle of Wikipedia operation ‚Äì multiple edits by many participants. Neuroscientists have discovered that individual neurons are very noisy. For example, by examining the activity of only a single neuron in the visual cortex, it is very difficult to reconstruct the visual scene that the owner of the brain is looking at. Like a single Wikipedia participant, an individual neuron does not 'know' everything and is likely to make mistakes. This problem is solved by the brain having billions of neurons. Information processing by the brain is population processing, and it is also distributed ‚Äì in many cases each neuron knows a little bit about everything, and the more neurons participate in a job, the more precise the information encoding. In the distributed processing scheme, individual neurons may exhibit neuronal noise, but the population as a whole averages this noise out. An alternative to the ensemble hypothesis is the theory that there exist highly specialized neurons that serve as the mechanism of neuronal encoding. In the visual system, such cells are often referred to as grandmother cells because they would respond in very specific circumstances‚Äîsuch as when a person gazes at a photo of their grandmother. Neuroscientists have indeed found that some neurons provide better information than the others, and a population of such expert neurons has an improved signal to noise ratio . However, the basic principle of ensemble encoding holds: large neuronal populations do better than single neurons. The emergence of specific neural assemblies is thought to provide the functional elements of brain activity that execute the basic operations of informational processing (see Fingelkurts An.A. and Fingelkurts Al.A., 2004; 2005). Neuronal code or the 'language' that neuronal ensembles speak is very far from being understood. Currently, there are two main theories about neuronal code. The rate encoding theory states that individual neurons encode behaviorally significant parameters by their average firing rates, and the precise time of the occurrences of neuronal spikes is not important. The temporal encoding theory, on the contrary, states that precise timing of neuronal spikes is an important encoding mechanism. Neuronal oscillations that synchronize activity of the neurons in an ensemble appear to be an important encoding mechanism. For example, oscillations have been suggested to underlie visual feature binding (Gray, Singer and others). In addition, sleep stages and waking are associated with distinct oscillatory patterns.  Location and function  Relatively simple neuronal ensembles operate in the spinal cord where they control basic automatisms such as monosynaptic tendon reflex and reciprocal innervation of muscles. These include both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Central pattern generations that reside in the spinal cord are more complex ensembles for coordination of limb movements during locomotion. Neuronal ensembles of the higher brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum are not completely understood, despite the vast literature on the neuroanatomy of these regions.  Real-time decoding  After the techniques of multielectrode recordings were introduced, the task of real-time decoding of information from large neuronal ensembles became feasible. If, as Georgopoulos showed, just a few primary motor neurons could accurately predict hand motion in two planes, reconstruction of the movement of an entire limb should be possible with enough simultaneous recordings. In parallel, with the introduction of an enormous Neuroscience boost from DARPA, several lab groups used millions of dollars to make brain- machine interfaces. Of these groups, two were successful in experiments showing that animals could control external interfaces with models based on their neural activity, and that once control was shifted from the hand to the brain-model, animals could learn to control it better. These two groups are led by John Donoghue and Miguel Nicolelis, and both are involved in towards human trials with their methods. John Donoghue formed the company Cyberkinetics to facilitate commercialization of brain-machine interfaces. They bought the Utah array from Richard A. Normann. Along with colleagues Hatsopoulos, Paninski, Fellows and Serruya, they first showed that neuronal ensembles could be used to control external interfaces by having a monkey control a cursor on a computer screen with its mind (2002). Miguel Nicolelis worked with John Chapin, Johan Wessberg, Mark Laubach, Jose Carmena, Mikhail Lebedev and other colleagues showed that activity of large neuronal ensembles can predict arm position. This work made possible creation of brain-machine interfaces ‚Äì electronic devices that read arm movement intentions and translate them into movements of artificial actuators. Carmena et al. (2003) programmed the neural coding in a brain-machine interface allowed a monkey to control reaching and grasping movements by a robotic arm, and Lebedev et al. (2005) argued that brain networks reorganize to create a new representation of the robotic appendage in addition to the representation of the animal's own limbs. In addition to the studies by Nicolelis and Donoghue, the groups of Andrew Schwartz and Richard Andersen are developing decoding algorithms that reconstruct behavioral parameters from neuronal ensemble activity. For example, Andrew Schwartz uses population vector algorithms that he previously developed with Apostolos Georgopoulos. Demonstrations of decoding of neuronal ensemble activity can be subdivided into two major classes: off-line decoding and on-line (real time) decoding. In the off-line decoding, investigators apply different algorithms to previously recorded data. Time considerations are usually not an issue in these studies: a sophisticated decoding algorithm can run for many hours on a computer cluster to reconstruct a 10-minute data piece. On-line algorithms decode (and, importantly, predict) behavioral parameters in real time. Moreover, the subject may receive a feedback about the results of decoding ‚Äî the so-called closed-loop mode as opposed to the open-loop mode in which the subject does not receive any feedback. As Hebb predicted, individual neurons in the population can contribute information about different parameters. For example, Miguel Nicolelis and colleagues reported that individual neurons simultaneously encoded arm position, velocity and hand gripping force when the monkeys performed reaching and grasping movements. Mikhail Lebedev, Steven Wise and their colleagues reported prefrontal cortex neurons that simultaneously encoded spatial locations that the monkeys attended to and those that they stored in short-term memory. Both attended and remembered locations could be decoded when these neurons were considered as population. To address the question of how many neurons are needed to obtain an accurate read-out from the population activity, Mark Laubach in Nicolelis lab used neuron-dropping analysis. In this analysis, he measured neuronal read-out quality as a function of the number of neurons in the population. Read-out quality increased with the number of neurons‚Äîinitially very notably, but then substantially larger neuronal quantities were needed to improve the read-out. Luis Carrillo-Reid and colleagues has demonstrated that external activation of as few as two neurons in an ensemble could trigger resonant activation of a whole ensemble and cause the ensemble-related behavioral response in the absence of a sensory stimulus.

Plot summary Michael Havelock (an anglicized version of Michal Havl√≠ƒçek) is an intelligence officer working for the US State Departments black operation division \\"Consular Ops\\". At the beginning of the novel he believes he has just witnessed the execution of his partner and the love of his life, Jenna Karas (anglicized version of Jana Karasova), along an isolated stretch of the Costa Brava. Jenna had been marked for execution because she was proved to be a KGB double agent. He immediately leaves the intelligence world, something he had been considering doing for some time and goes sightseeing in areas he had previously visited. In Athens, Pyotr Rostov, a senior director of the KGB forces a meeting with Havelock. Rostov denies that Karas is an agent of theirs. Later, in Rome, Havelock sees Jenna alive at a train station. She flees him, frightened, and he pursues her. He makes contact with a former source at the US Consulate called Colonel Baylor, and begins his search for Jenna throughout several countries. Meanwhile, strategists for Consular Operations in the US government decide that he is a paranoid schizophrenic and must be terminated, lest he compromise entire networks across Europe. All the evidence available to them indicates that Karas was a double agent, and was successfully terminated on the Costa Brava. So one of them, \\"Red\\" Ogivile sets up an ambush on the Palatine Hill in Rome with the intention of taking Michael in. However, the two mercenaries he hired are taken out by Michael, the gas grenade he uses only affects him when Michael lashes out, and after being convinced of Havelock's innocence, he ends up taking an accidental bullet from Colonel Baylor who was sent to kill Havelock. Back in the United States, however, the US government has a problem of its own: Anton Matthias, Secretary of State, acknowledged by the entire world as a genius and trusted with powers far beyond those his office allow him, has gone completely insane. Before anybody realized that he was insane, he negotiated treaties with parties he believed to be representing the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China, each agreeing to a nuclear strike against the third party, but in fact with a man who identified himself as Parsifal. Parsifal demands a huge ransom to keep the documents from being released, thereby triggering a nuclear war. Once the ransom is paid, however, he does not touch it, having confirmed how desperate Washington is. Havelock, who as a child had been one of the few survivors of the massacre at Lidice, has a special bond with Matthias, a fellow Czech who had advised him in graduate school. Somehow Matthias's insanity is linked to the order to terminate Jenna Karas. For her part, Karas has been told that Michael is a Russian spy and that he is trying to kill her. Consequently, she is not especially eager to meet him. When Michael finally traces Jenna to an isolated farm in Pennsylvania, they realize that they were both deceived and that each had been told that the other was an enemy. They then work together with the President of the United States, Charles Berquist, and several trusted advisors to find Parsifal and stop him. They are opposed by Arthur Pierce, a brilliant and murderous Soviet mole highly placed in the State Department. Pierce has ordered the murders of the strategists of Consular Operations ( two of them are crushed by a bulldozer in their car and driven off a cliff and another is shot), and then a string of successive killings - all in his own quest to gain evidence of Matthias's insanity. Pierce is working not for the regular KGB, but the VKR (Voennaya Kontra Razvedka), a fanatical branch of Russian intelligence identified as an offshoot of the OGPU. He is also, for that matter, a paminyatchik - an agent under deep cover, who has lived in the United States since infancy. For much of the novel, Pierce's true loyalties lie undiscovered. One of Havelock's allies, Undersecretary of State Emory Bradford, realizes that Pierce works for the VKR, but he is murdered by the ever-alert Pierce before he can warn anyone else. Pierce also solicits the murder of Rostov, who loathes the VKR and has tried to help Havelock. When Michael finally finds Parsifal, a friend of Anton and a Paminyatchik who is less fanatical than Arthur Pierce, he finds out that the documents were not produced to provoke nuclear war, but rather to demonstrate that no one man could be trusted with vast amounts of power. Pierce, however, has had his operatives murder Michael's bodyguards and breaks into Parsifal's house just as he agrees to burn the documents. However hearing that Rostov has been murdered, Parsifal decides to sacrifice himself by using his body to block Pierce's gun allowing Michael and Jenna time to get out. Michael and Jenna then kill Pierce's operatives by stabbing them and Michael then flanks Pierce and guns him down. They conclude that the documentary evidence of Matthias's insanity is best destroyed. Havelock tells Berquist of this; he is informed, in turn, that Matthias has just died. Finally safe, he and Jenna move to New England, where Havelock accepts an academic position. Characters in The Parsifal Mosaic * Michael Havelock (b. Michal Havl√≠ƒçek), an exhausted and embittered veteran operative of Consular Operations. Born in interwar Czechoslovakia, Havlicek witnessed the murder of his entire village of Lidice by the Nazis. His father survived the war, only to disappear at the hands of the Soviets in 1948. Brought over to the United States, he proved an invaluable operative for US intelligence. * Jenna Karas (b. Jana Karasov√°), Havelock's faithful partner and lover, and a capable agent in her own right. Her apparent death on the Costa Brava sets Havelock off; the revelation that she is still alive causes him to go rogue. * Anthony Matthias (b. Anton Matthias), the brilliant, beloved American Secretary of State. Matthias has a close bond to Havelock, who was once his graduate student. The strain of his exalted status, as well as his own ego, drive Matthias over the edge. * Pyotr Rostov, the KGB's Director of External Strategies. Rostov is a dedicated director of the KGB, but despises the fanatical VKR. He first seeks to investigate Havelock's departure from Consular Operations and then offers him the opportunity to defect. * Emory Bradford, a controversial but brilliant Undersecretary of State. Bradford, once a renowned hawk in the Kennedy and Johnson years, became a convinced dove once he realized the damage caused by Vietnam. When the President was faced with Parsifal's demands, he turned to Bradford as an invaluable counsellor. * President Charles Berquist. Berquist, who hails from rural Minnesota is a deeply intelligent man, but nonetheless is caught off guard by Matthias's actions and the presence of a mole in the State Department. * Arthur Pierce (b. Nikolai Petrovich Malyekov), the highest ranking paminyatchik in the State Department. Utterly fanatical and utterly ruthless, Pierce has an outwardly impeccable record, including valiant service in Vietnam. He is dead set on obtaining Parsifal's evidence and using it to bring America to its knees. His strategic cunning and the assistance of fellow paminyatchiki make him one of Ludlum's most fearsome villains. * Parsifal, a mysterious figure who has somehow collaborated with Anton Matthias to bring the world to the edge of catastrophe. Major themes *The Parsifal Mosaic is the one Ludlum novel focused entirely upon the Cold War, and upon the possibility of nuclear war. Other novels such as The Matarese Circle and The Aquitaine Progression use the Cold War as a backdrop, but do not focus on it to the same degree. *Anton Matthias, the much revered Secretary of State, bears some resemblance to Henry Kissinger. Both men are immigrants to the United States, and both have an advanced academic background. While Kissinger was not nearly this revered, he did accumulate great amounts of unchecked power. Like Parsifal, Ludlum was deeply fearful of the concentration of power. *The Parsifal Mosaic conveys Ludlum's general loathing of fanaticism. Havelock's life journey is haunted by the actions of fanatics, from the village of Lidice, to the Costa Brava. The novel frequently reminds readers of this early part of his life: while searching for Jenna he encounters first an escaped Nazi war criminal, and then a man who has constructed a concentration camp in rural Pennsylvania. As he dispatches Arthur Pierce, Havelock remarks that it was people like him who forced him to live in the forest.

From the beginning, craftsmen from all over Al-Andalus and the Maghrib were enlisted in the mosque's planning, construction, and decoration, and the caliph himself was highly invested in the process and was said to have visited the site daily. By 1176, the mosque was complete, save for the minaret; however, Friday prayer was not held there until 1182, and it was not until 1184 when construction even began on the minaret. = Building of the Minaret = Construction stalled once again in 1184 with the death of the architect, and a month and a half later, the caliph, who died while commanding the Siege of Santar√©m. It was picked up four years later by the caliph's son, Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur, aided by a group of architects and designers, including Sevillan architect Ahmad ibn Basuh and Sicilian architect Abu Layth Al-Siqilli. The minaret was built using both local bricks and recycled marble from old Umayyad monuments. On 10 March 1198, the tower was completed with the addition of four precious metal spheres (either gold or bronze) at the tower's peak to commemorate al- Mansur's victory over Alfonso VIII of Castile, which had taken place four years prior.Corfis, Ivy A. (2010). Al-Andalus, Sepharad and Medieval Iberia : Cultural Contact and Diffusion. Leiden, Netherlands: Brill. p. 14. .  Structure and decoration  = Mosque interior = Before its partial destruction in a 1356 earthquake, the mosque was comparable in size to the great mosque of Cordoba and its walls faced the cardinal directions with mathematical preciseness.RUIZ, BEGO√ëA ALONSO, and ALFONSO JIM√âNEZ MART√çN. ‚ÄúA Fifteenth-Century Plan of the Cathedral of Seville.‚Äù Architectural History, vol. 55, 2012, pp. 57‚Äì77. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/43489715. The prayer hall was symmetrical and airy, with a still-extant courtyard, the Patio de los Naranjos, or \\"Courtyard of Orange Trees.\\" Its interior had a stucco- carved dome over the mihrab, as well as several matching carvings over the arched doorways. The minbar was decorated in a Cordoban style, constructed from expensive wood and embellished with sandalwood, ivory, ebony, gold, and silver. = The Giralda = The minaret, which still stands as the Giralda, contains a series of ramps winding around the perimeter of several vaulted chambers at the tower's core. These ramps were designed with enough width and height to accommodate \\"beasts of burden, people, and the custodians,\\" according to one chronicler from the era. The decorated facades and windows on the tower are stepped to match the ramps in order to maximize light to the chambers inside. This exterior brick decoration was mainly done by 'Ali al- Ghumari, a Berber craftsman who also did repair work on the interior. The facades of the tower did contain some plaster embellishment, but they were removed during a modern restoration. The main gateway, still in existence, contains a metal-plated door with geometric decoration and floral knockers.  Post-Al-Andalus  View of Giralda from cathedral. = Conversion to cathedral = After Seville was recovered by the Christians in 1248 during the Reconquista, the city's mosque was symbolically converted into a cathedral. This involved changing the liturgical orientation, closing and screening off exits and archways, and creating several small family chapels. The former mosque was not well-maintained by any of the groups inhabiting their own sections of the building during this period, and most of the records from the 13th and early 14th centuries describe its neglect, damage, and consequent destruction to make way for a new cathedral. This structure was badly damaged in a 1356 earthquake, and by 1433 the city began building the current cathedral. Local stone to build with was scarce, and there were few skilled stonemasons in the area, so timber and stone had to be shipped from overseas, and like its earlier incarnation, the construction of the cathedral brought together artisans from all over its respective empire, this time as far away as Germany and the Netherlands. Construction took 73 years and was completed in 1506. = Addition to tower = Today, the Giralda stands as one of the largest churches in the world and an example of the Gothic and Baroque architectural styles. The metal spheres that originally topped the tower fell during the earthquake, and the spheres were replaced with a cross and bell. The new cathedral incorporated the tower as a bell tower and eventually built it higher during the Renaissance under architect Hern√°n Ruiz the Younger, who was commissioned to work on the tower in 1568. This newer section of the tower contains a large inscription of Seville's motto, NO8DO, spoken No me ha dejado, meaning \\"[Seville] has not abandoned me.\\" Alfonso X of Castile gave the motto to the city when it continued to support his rule during an insurrection. Covering the top of the tower is the \\"Lily section\\" which surrounds the enclosure with the bell. The statue stands 4 m (13 feet) in height - 7 m (23 ft) with the pedestal - and sit on top of the tower from its installation in 1568. Dimensions The base at street level is a square of 13.6 m on the side and which sits on a solid foundation which is a bit wider, 15~16 m and about 5 m deep. The foundation is built with solid, rectangular stones, some taken and reused from the Roman wall nearby.https://labelleseville.com/tours- seville/Informes_de_la_Construcci%C3%B3n_Vol_49_452.pdf  PDF INFORMES PUBLICO GIRALDA The part which corresponds to the original Moorish minaret is about 51 m high, with the Christian addition it is 98.5 m high and taking into account the wind vane it is 104 m high. The weather vane (giralda), which gives its name to the building, is over 4 m tall, 7 m including the base. The tower has a ramp with 35 segments wide and tall enough to allow a person to ride on horseback to the top of the Moorish tower. The Christian addition has a final stair with 17 steps leading up to the bells.  Buildings inspired by the Giralda  Replica of the Giralda, in Kansas City, Missouri, twinned with Seville. Many towers have borrowed from the Giralda's design throughout history. Several church towers in the province of Seville also bear a resemblance to the tower, and may have been inspired by the Giralda. These towers, most notably those in Lebrija and Carmona, are popularly known as Giraldillas. Numerous replicas of the Giralda have been built in the United States, mostly between 1890 and 1937: * The second Madison Square Garden in New York City, designed by Stanford White, built in 1890 * A replica in the Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri * The clock tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco, completed in 1898 * The clock tower of the Railroad Depot in Minneapolis, destroyed by wind in 1941 * The Freedom Tower in Miami, Florida, built in 1925 * The Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, Florida, built in 1926 * The Wrigley Building in Chicago, built in 1920 * The Terminal Tower in Cleveland, built in 1930 * The clock tower at the University of Puerto Rico's R√≠o Piedras campus, built in 1937 The building has also inspired buildings outside the US and Spain, such as: *Seven Sisters (Moscow), seven Soviet-era skyscrapers in Moscow, Russia *Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, Poland References Other photos Giralda, Sevilla, Espa√±a, 2015-12-06, DD 131.JPGView from the bottom.

It is the home of the federally recognized Sicangu Oyate (the Upper Brul√© Sioux Nation) ‚Äì also known as Sicangu Lakota, and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe (RST), a branch of the Lakota people. The Lakota name Sicangu Oyate translates into English as \\"Burnt Thigh Nation\\"; the French term \\"Brul√© Sioux\\" is also used. The Rosebud Indian Reservation was established in 1889 after the United States' partition of the Great Sioux Reservation. Created in 1868 by the Treaty of Fort Laramie, the Great Sioux Reservation originally covered all of West River, South Dakota (the area west of the Missouri River), as well as part of northern Nebraska and eastern Montana. The reservation includes all of Todd County, South Dakota, and communities and lands in the four adjacent counties. Geography and population The RIR is located in south central South Dakota, and presently includes within its recognized border all of Todd County, an unincorporated county of South Dakota. However, the Oyate also has communities and extensive lands and populations in the four adjacent counties, which were once within the Rosebud Sioux Tribe (RST) boundaries: Tripp, Lyman, Mellette, and Gregory counties, all in South Dakota. Mellette County, especially, has extensive off-reservation trust land, comprising 33.35 percent of its land area, where 40.23 percent of the Sicangu Oyate population lives. The total land area of the reservation and its trust lands is 1,970.362 sq mi (5,103.214 km¬≤) with a population of 10,469 in the 2000 census.Rosebud Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land, South Dakota . United States Census Bureau. The main reservation (Todd County) has a land area of 1,388.124 sq mi (3,595.225 km¬≤) and a population of 9,050. The RIR is bounded on the south by Cherry County, Nebraska, on the west by the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, on the north by the White River, and originally, on the east by the Missouri River. The Oyate capital is the unincorporated town of Rosebud, established when the Spotted Tail Indian Agency (named after the 19th-century war chief, whose Lakota name was Sinte Gleska) to the banks of Rosebud Creek near its confluence with the Little White River. It was previously located in northwestern Nebraska. The largest town on the reservation is Mission, served by the intersections of US Highways 18 and 83. Mission's near neighbor of Antelope is one of the many tribal band communities established in the late 1870s. It has grown since then. Other major towns in the reservation are Saint Francis, located southwest of Rosebud. It is the home of Saint Francis Indian School, a private Catholic institution first established as a mission school. Saint Francis, with a current population of about 2000, is the largest incorporated town in South Dakota without a state highway for access. Located on the Great Plains, just north of the Nebraska Sandhills, Rosebud Indian Reservation has large areas of Ponderosa Pine forest scattered in its grasslands. Deep valleys are defined by steep hills and ravines, often with lakes dotting the deeper valleys. Economy and services The RST owns and operates Rosebud Casino, located on U.S. Route 83 just north of the Nebraska border. Nearby is a fuel plaza, featuring truck parking and a convenience store. Power for the casino is furnished in part by one of the nation's first tribally owned electricity-generating wind turbines. In the early 21st century, the tribe built a new residential development, Sicangu Village, along Highway 83 near the casino and the state line. Like numerous other Native American tribes, the Rosebud government decided to legalize alcohol sales on the reservation. This enables it to use sales taxes and other revenues generated for the welfare and health of the tribe. It directly polices and regulates the use of alcohol in an effort to reduce abuses. The RST population is estimated at 25,000 (2005). It is served by the Oyate administration and agencies. In addition, the tribe is served by the BIA Rosebud Agency, Todd County School District, Saint Francis Indian School, Saint Joseph's Indian School in Chamberlain, South Dakota; and the Rosebud Indian Health Service Hospital. It has developed Sinte Gleska University on the reservation. The tribal university is named after the 19th-century Sioux war chief and statesman, whose name in English was Spotted Tail. The tribe has suffered from terrible conditions at the IHS hospital. Because the IHS did not maintain standards, in November 2015 the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said it would no longer reimburse for services at the ER, as conditions were so poor. The ER was closed. For seven months, citizens on the reservation had no access to ER services. Five babies were born in ambulances en route to the nearest hospitals -50 miles away- and nine people died during emergency transport to other health facilities. CMS announced on July 14, 2016 that the emergency department would re-open the next day.Tanya H. Lee, \\" 'Where you can legally kill Indians': Winnebago treasurer on IHS hospitals\\" , Indian Country News, 15 July 2016; accessed 16 July 2016 Representative Kristi Noem, R-South Dakota, has authored legislation to improve conditions and staff at IHS facilities. She has testified before Congress to gain support for the legislation. The Tribe also owns QCredit, an online financial services company. The Tribe currently works with financial technology vendor Think Finance for assistance with compliance management, risk management, and loan services.

It adopted a constitution and bylaws, to take back many responsibilities for internal management from the BIA. It followed the model of elected government: president, vice-president, and representative council, adopted by many Native American nations. At the time and since then, many tribal members opposed the elected government, preferring their traditional form of hereditary clan chiefs selected for life, contingent on approval by women elders, and a tribal council that operated by consensus. Both women and male elders have continued to have influence within the nation, particularly among those who have followed more traditional lives. At times the political factions have developed and continued along ethnic and cultural lines, with full-blood Sioux following traditional ways. Others, sometimes of mixed-blood or having had more urban or European-American experiences, support the elected government. The short two-year terms of office can make it difficult for elected officials to carry out projects over the long term.

Legal cases In United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians, the people of the Rosebud Sioux Reservation joined the Oglala Lakota and other Sioux nations in suing the federal government in a land claim for its taking of the Black Hills in the late 19th century. In 1980 the case was heard by the United States Supreme Court, which agreed with the nations that the US had acted illegally in 1877. The US government offered financial compensation, which the Sioux have refused. They still demand the return of the land to their nation. The compensation fund is earning interest and has increased in value.

Gentry, Jr. (3 May 1950) is a Reformed theologian, and an ordained minister in the Reformed Presbyterian Church General Assembly. He is particularly known for his support for and publication on the topics of orthodox preterism and postmillennialism in Christian eschatology, as well as for theonomy and Young Earth creationism. He holds that each of these theological distinctives are logical and theological extensions of his foundational theology, which is Calvinistic and Reformed. Biography Gentry was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He is married (since July 1971) and has three children and six grandchildren. He received his B.A. in Biblical Studies from Tennessee Temple University (1973, cum laude). After graduating he enrolled at Grace Theological Seminary in Winona Lake, Indiana. After two years at Grace Seminary (1973‚Äì1975) he left dispensationalism, having become convinced of a covenant and Reformed theology. He transferred to Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi (1975‚Äì1977). Upon completing studies at Reformed Theological Seminary he was awarded the M.Div. in 1977. After several years of pastoral ministry, he earned a Th.M. (1986) and a Th.D. (1987, magna cum laude) from Whitefield Theological Seminary, both in the field of New Testament. While at Reformed Theological Seminary he studied under Greg L. Bahnsen, a leading presuppositional apologist. Though Gentry initially resisted the distinctive ethical and eschatological views of Bahnsen, he was eventually persuaded of both theonomic ethics and postmillennial eschatology and became a staunch co-defender of them with Bahnsen. Over the years he developed a close friendship with Bahnsen, often lecturing with him in conferences, co-writing a book with him (House Divided: The Break-up of Dispensational Theology), eventually joining the staff of Bahnsen's Southern California Center for Christian Studies, and finally contributing to the festschrift in honor of Bahnsen, titled: The Standard Bearer. Gentry retired from full-time pastoral ministry in 2016 after serving more than thirty-five years in three conservative and Reformed denominations: The Presbyterian Church in America, The Orthodox Presbyterian Church, and The Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Assembly. He is the Director of GoodBirth Ministries, a non-profit religious educational ministry, \\"committed to sponsoring, subsidizing, and advancing serious Christian scholarship and education\\" (GoodBirth website: www.GoodBirthMinistries.com). Writings Gentry is the leading contemporary theological expositor of the early-date of Revelation (prior to A.D. 70) by the Apostle John. The first-century Great Tribulation paradigm is a profoundly different eschatology than that held by most American evangelical Christians that the Great Tribulation hasn't yet occurred. Kenneth Gentry's works The Beast of Revelation and He Shall Have Dominion attempt to explain the identity of the Beast and what God's true redemptive plan for humanity are. Gentry's work is considered by his followers to be important for soteriological reasons. Gentry's work enfilades the error of much contemporary Christian pre-trib eschatology, also serving to argue that incorrect interpretation of the Bible is possible even by sincere experts. Gentry is perhaps best known for his book Before Jerusalem Fell, which argues that the Book of Revelation was written before the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. He holds that many of the dramatic events in Revelation correspond to the persecution of Christians under the Roman imperium as well as to the Jewish War against Rome which resulted in the destruction of Jewish temple. This book is the published version of his doctoral dissertation in 1986 under the title \\"The Dating of the Book of Revelation: An Exegetical, Theological and Historical Argument for a Pre-A.D. 70 Composition.\\" =Revelation commentary= Gentry has completed a two-volume academic commentary on Revelation titled: The Divorce of Israel: A Redemptive- Historical Interpretation. It is currently being proofed and typeset by Tolle Lege Press and is scheduled for release in 2020. According to preliminary studies he has released (\\"The Wrath of God and Israel\\", Fountain Inn, SC: 2007), he will be presenting evidence that \\"Babylon\\" () is a metaphor for 1st century Jerusalem, and that the book's author John is following the pattern of the Old Testament prophets in denouncing Jerusalem's unfaithfulness by such images (see especially and ). Gentry holds that the theme of Revelation is Christ's judgment-coming against those who pierced him (), and presents the \\"slain Lamb\\" (; etc.) as wreaking vengeance upon 1st-century Jerusalem. He argues that the seven-sealed scroll is God's divorce decree against his unfaithful Old Testament wife (Israel) so that he might take a new bride, the Church (Rev. 21-22). Thus, Revelation dramatizes the transition from the old covenant, Temple-based, Judaic economy to the New Covenant, spiritual economy that includes all ethnicities, not just Jews (compare supersessionism). According to his research updates, Gentry sees strong similarities between Revelation and the Epistle to the Hebrews. Both works seek to demonstrate Christianity's superiority to Judaism by showing New Covenant Christianity fulfilling Old Covenant Judaism (Heb. 8:13; Rev. 2:9; 3:9; 11:1-2). He notes that both documents even end up pointing the reader to the New Jerusalem from heaven (Heb.12:22; Rev. 21:2), which represents Christianity. He also draws parallels in thought between the Gospel of Matthew and Revelation.

It is a special case of a right prism with a pentagram as base, which in general has rectangular non-base faces. The pentagram face has an ambiguous interior because it is self-intersecting.

History The area began to be inhabited in 1871 following the discovery of alluvial gold, although access was made difficult by the rugged terrain and the harsh winters, with sub-zero temperatures and much snow. Aberfeldy Land Sale 1877, courtesy Public Records Office Victoria The first Aberfeldy Post Office opened on 1 January 1872. It finally closed permanently in 1967. The postmaster from 1880 to 1884 was Henry Donaldson, whose sister, Elizabeth Donaldson had married the Aberfeldy butcher Thomas Dwyer, originally from Tipperary, Ireland. The eldest of the three Dwyer children was John Patrick, born in Aberfeldy in 1879. His parents both died in 1884, so the children were taken in by their Scottish grandparents David and Annie Donaldson, who ran the general store in nearby Morwell.Madden, IT 1973, Morwell historical society news, vol. 12, no. 5, 15 November, p. 20 & p. 39, viewed 30 Aug 2018, http://www.morwellhistoricalsociety.org.au/newsletters/Vol121973.pdf.

John Partick Dwyer was a child prodigy and after qualifying as a solicitor in Melbourne he was called to the Bar at the age of 23. He moved to Western Australia in 1904 where he stood out as the possessor of a brilliant legal mind. He was appointed Chief Justice of Western Australia and was knighted in 1946, and then distinguished with a KCMG in 1949.'The Old Boys', Pegasus, Geelong College, June 1959, viewed 28 Sep 2018, He and his wife are buried together in a simple grave in Karrakatta Cemetery in Perth.Mather, K 2020, 'Tipperary meets Lanarkshire in Australia: the kith and kin of Sir John Dwyer KCMG', Journal of the Genealogical Society of Ireland, vol. 21, pp. 5‚Äì15. Aberfeldy was surveyed and proclaimed in 1885. It was initially known as Mount Lookout but was eventually renamed after the Scottish town of Aberfeldy.Kennedy, B: Australian Place Names, page 1. ABC Books, 2006 At its peak, the township had a population of around 500. After the end of the gold rush the townsfolk depended for their livelihood upon sheep and cattle grazing and the production of potatoes and other crops.Steenhuis, L: Ghost Towns of the Mountain Goldfields, page 6. Research Publications, 1999. Following the First World War, the population diminished, although the town managed to survive. The town hotel was burned down in 1938 and the Black Friday bush-fires of 1939 destroyed many of the buildings in the town.Tomlin, O F 1979, Gold for the finding: a pictorial history of Gippsland's Jordan goldfield, Hill of Content, Melbourne, p. 133.

A road was built to the town of Matlock by 1950, but it was not maintained and became unusable. Apart from John Patrick Dwyer, the town's most well-known inhabitant was Kitty Cane, a former dancer and mining investor who owned a successful roadside tavern. Legend has it that when Cane died, her loyal customers and the local miners decided to carry her coffin to the Aberfeldy cemetery. However, since Cane was unusually heavy, weighing 22 stone (140 kilos) and because the miners were intoxicated, the coffin never made it to the cemetery. Instead the miners buried her beside the road. When travelling from The Thomson Dam to Aberfeldy, Kitty Cane's grave is about a kilometre (0.6 miles) after the Cast Iron Point lookout and on the left hand side of the Walhalla- Woods Point Road, Thompson. It is recorded in the Victorian Heritage Inventory: H8122-0102. Today (2011) there is only one permanent resident, the historian Grahame Code (who has lived in the area for 50 years), and his family. There is several holiday homes which are occupied occasionally. Land was released for public sale in 1999. Remains of some of the former gold-rush era buildings are still visible. Climate Aberfeldy yields a cold oceanic climate (Cfb), owing to its elevation and southerly latitude, as well as its windward position astride the ranges. Aberfeldy receives an average of 32.5 snowy days annually; by comparison, Island Bend Dam (1,275 m) and Kiandra Chalet (1,395 m) receive 36.7 and 47.5 snowy days, respectively.http://www.australianweathernews.com/snow/Snow%20days%20VIC.htm  References  External links *Australian Places - Aberfeldy Towns in Victoria (Australia) Gippsland Ghost towns in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Aberfeldy, Victoria"},{"id":"2860539","text":"An Indian Wells California Historical Landmark was erected near the Indian Wells Lodge, 4.9 miles north of Freeman Junction on Highway 14 where William L.

It is located on U.S. Highway 70, southwest of Portales. The settlement was originally known as Urton, probably named for two brothers who came to the region from the state of Missouri in 1884. A contractor by the name of Kenna camped in Urton during the construction of a roadbed for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Kenna's camp served as a stopping place for stagecoaches to exchange mail as well as passengers. In 1899, when the railroad was completed, the name Kenna remained for the camp. Established first as Urton in 1902 by the opening of a post office, the name was changed back to Kenna in 1906. E.D. Kenna, the vice president of the railroad, may have contributed to the final choice of a name. Kenna was one of the largest cattle shipping points in the state by 1909. At the peak of its development, the town could boast a bank, two hotels, several stores, a post office, as well as several saloons. By 1912, many homesteaders relinquished their claims due to the drought, and Kenna dropped both in size and importance.

His themes include Greek history, religious symbolism as well as universal harmony in poems such as The Moonstruck, Prologue to Life, Mother of God, and Delphic Utterance. His plays include Sibylla, Daedalus in Crete, Christ in Rome, The Death of Digenis, The Dithyramb of the Rose and Asklepius. Although occasionally his grandiloquence blunts the poetic effect of his work, some of Sikelianos finer lyrics are among the best in Western literature.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Angelos Sikelianos biography, Britannica.com From 1946 until 1951, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. Biography Sikelianos was born in Lefkada where he spent his childhood. In 1900, he registered to the Athens Law School but never graduated. In the course of the following years, he traveled extensively and devoted himself to poetry. In 1907, he married the American Eva Palmer in the United States; the couple moved to Athens in 1908. During that period, Sikelianos came in contact with Greek intellectuals, and in 1909 he published his first collection of poems, Alafro√≠sk√Øotos (The Moonstruck), which had an immediate impact and was recognized by critics as an important work. He also befriended fellow writer Nikos Kazantzakis, and in 1914 they spent forty days on Mount Athos, visiting most of the monasteries there and living the life of ascetics. The following year, they embarked on a pilgrimage through Greece. The two writers were kindred spirits, but also very different in their respective views on life. Sikelianos was a man of the world, full of optimism, and with a steadfast faith in his abilities as a writer. Kazantzakis was the taciturn and reclusive counterpart who was doubt- ridden, and had, as he himself admitted, a tendency to focus on the skull behind the face. Together, however, they shared the mutual concern of attempting to refine and elevate the human spirit through artistic pursuits. The Delphic Festivals The house of Sikelianos in Delphi. Sikelianos (at the front) during the Delphic Festival of 1930. In May 1927, in collaboration with his wife, Eva Palmer-Sikelianos, Sikelianos held the Delphic Festival as part of his general effort towards a revival of the \\"Delphic Idea\\". Sikelianos believed that the principles which had shaped classical civilisation, if reexamined, could offer spiritual independence and serve as a mean of communication among people. The event consisted of athletic contests (in classical fashion, reminiscent of the Pythian Games) a concert of Byzantine music, an exhibition of folk art as well as a performance of Prometheus Bound. The Delphic Festivals were acclaimed by critics (many of them invited to attend) and despite a lack of state assistance, they were repeated three years later. The revival was then permanently abandoned due to the excessive organization costs. In honor of the memory of Angelos and Eva Sikelianos, the European Cultural Centre of Delphi bought and restored their house in Delphi, which is today the Museum of Delphic Festivals. Later, Eva Palmer-Sikelianos left for the United States, and Sikelianos married Anna Karamani. During the German occupation (1941‚Äì44), he became a source of inspiration to the Greek people, especially through his speech and poem that he recited at the funeral of the poet Kostis Palamas. It was he who composed the letter which was spearheaded by Archbishop Damaskinos to save the lives of Greek Jews by appealing directly to the Germans. The letter was signed by many prominent Greek citizens in defense of the Jews who were being persecuted. There is no similar document of protest against Nazi occupiers during World War II that has come to light in any other European country.Margie Burns \\"Archbishop Damaskinos\\" The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation In 1945 he was a founding member of the Greek-Soviet friendship union (among Nikos Kazantzakis, Nicolas Kitsikis, Yanis Kordatos, Aimilios Veakis, Ilias Iliou, Patroklos Karantinos, Athanase Apartis, George Zongolopoulos and others). Sikelianos suffered from a chronic disease for several years; he died accidentally on 19 June 1951 in Athens from inadvertently drinking Lysol after having requested Nujol (a medicine). He was buried in the First Cemetery of Athens. Work Sikelianos published his poetic work in three volumes in 1946 and 1947. The collection's title was \\"Lyric Life\\". He left, however, several poems unpublished. In 1965 G.P. Savvides, a leading Greek philologist, started to publish the entire poetic work of Sikelianos, which finally comprised five volumes.

It is used for military and paramilitary communications, broadcasting,Broadcasting in Band 7 (HF) in the Tropical Zone, International Radio Consultative Committee, International Telecommunications Union, Geneva, 1969 especially in the tropics, and by radio amateurs for nearby contacts circumventing line-of-sight barriers. The radio waves travel near-vertically upwards into the ionosphere, where they are refracted back down and can be received within a circular region up to 650 km (400 miles) from the transmitter.The Emergency Communications Antenna, By Stephen C. Finch, AI√òW http://www.w8ne.com/Files/NVIS%20nvis_AI0W.pdf If the frequency is too high (that is, above the critical frequency of the ionospheric F layer), refraction fails to occur and if it is too low, absorption in the ionospheric D layer may reduce the signal strength. There is no fundamental difference between NVIS and conventional skywave propagation; the practical distinction arises solely from different desirable radiation patterns of the antennas (near vertical for NVIS, near horizontal for conventional long-range skywave propagation).  Frequencies and propagation  NVIS radiation pattern While the groundwave (blue) cannot propagate, the refracted skywaves (red) achieve HF coverage within the common first hop (~500km). The most reliable frequencies for NVIS communications are between 1.8 MHz and 8 MHz. Above 8 MHz, the probability of success begins to decrease, dropping to near zero at 30 MHz. Usable frequencies are dictated by local ionospheric conditions, which have a strong systematic dependence on geographical location. Common bands used in amateur radio at mid-latitudes are 3.5 MHz at night and 7 MHz during daylight, with experimental use of 5 MHz (60 meters) frequencies. During winter nights at the bottom of the sunspot cycle, the 1.8 MHz band may be required. http://hamwaves.com/nvis/en/index.html Broadcasting uses the tropical broadcast bands between 2.3 and 5.06 MHz, and the international broadcast bands between 3.9 and 6.2 MHz. Military NVIS communications mostly take place on 2‚Äì4 MHz at night and on 5‚Äì7 MHz during daylight. Optimum NVIS frequencies tend to be higher towards the tropics and lower towards the arctic regions. They are also higher during high sunspot activity years. The usable frequencies change from day to night, because sunlight causes the lowest layer of the ionosphere, called the D layer, to increase, causing attenuation of low frequencies during the day while the maximum usable frequency (MUF) which is the critical frequency of the F layer rises with greater sunlight. Real time maps of the critical frequency are available. Use of a frequency about 15% below the critical frequency should provide reliable NVIS service. This is sometimes referred to as the optimum working frequency or FOT. NVIS is most useful in mountainous areas where line-of-sight propagation is ineffective, or when the communication distance is beyond the 50 mile (80 km) range of groundwave (or the terrain is so rugged and barren that groundwave is not effective), and less than the 300‚Äì1500 mile (500‚Äì2500 km) range of lower-angle sky-wave propagation. Another interesting aspect of NVIS communication is that direction finding of the sender is more difficult than for ground-wave communication (i.e. VHF or UHF). For broadcasters, NVIS allows coverage of an entire medium-sized country at much lower cost than with VHF (FM), and daytime coverage, similar to mediumwave (AM broadcast) nighttime coverage at lower cost and often with less interference.  Antennas  An NVIS antenna configuration is a horizontally polarized (parallel with the surface of the earth) radiating element that is from 1/20th wavelength (Œª) to 1/4 wavelength above the ground. Optimum height is about 1/4 wavelength, and high angle radiation declines only slightly for heights up to about 3/8 wavelength. That proximity to the ground forces the majority of the radiation to go straight up. Overall efficiency of the antenna can be increased by placing a ground wire slightly longer than the antenna parallel to and directly underneath the antenna. One source says that a single ground wire can provide antenna gain in the 3‚Äì6 dB range.Hawker (2005), pp. 89 Another source indicates 2 dB for a single wire and nearly 4 dB for multiple ground wires.http://www.w8ji.com/nvis_n_v_i_s_antenna.htm NVIS Antennas Ground wires are more necessary when using lower dipoles over poor soils as without them considerable energy goes into heating the ground. Depending on the specific requirements, various antennas (i.e. Sloper, T2FD, Dipole) can be used for NVIS communication, with horizontal dipoles or inverted V dipoles at about 0.2 wavelengths above ground giving the best results on transmit and at about 0.16 wavelengths on receive, according to military sources and an extensive study by Dutch researchers. G. E. Barker, J. Taylor, and G. H. Hagn, ‚ÄúSummary of measurements and modeling of the radiation patterns of simple field antennas in open (level) terrain, mountains and forests,‚Äù U.S. Army Electronic Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, USA, Spec. Tech. Rep. 45, December 1971. Very low antennas are much inferior on transmit, less so on receive, where both noise and signal are attenuated. Significant increases in communication will obviously be realized when both the transmitting station and the receiving station use NVIS configuration for their antennas. In particular for low profile operations NVIS antennas are a good option.Space Challenged NVIS Antenna http://harriscountyares.org/training/KNW/KNW-119.pdf For broadcasting, typical antennas consist of a dipole about 1/4 wavelength above ground, or arrays of such dipoles.Broadcasting in Band 7, page 39 Up to 16 dipoles can be used, allowing strong signals with relatively low power by concentrating the signal in a smaller area. Limiting the coverage may be dictated by licensing, language or political considerations. Arrays of dipoles can be used to \\"slew\\" the pattern, so that the transmitter need not be in the center of the coverage footprint. Broadcast NVIS antennas usually use an extensive ground screen to increase gain and stabilize the pattern and feed impedance with changing ground moisture. = AS-2259 antenna= AS-2259 NVIS Antenna A military NVIS antenna is the AS-2259 Antenna,AS-2259 Antenna Manual http://www.radiomanual.info/schemi/Surplus_Accessories/AS-2259_antenna_serv_user_TM11-5985-379-14P_1986.pdf which consists of two V-shaped dipoles: The four dipole wires also serve as guy rope for the antenna mast.

In the most basic form, the pinyin method allows a user to input Chinese characters by entering the pinyin of a Chinese character and then presenting the user with a list of possible characters with that pronunciation. However, there are a number of slightly different such systems in use, and modern pinyin methods provide a number of convenient features. Advantages and disadvantages The obvious advantage of pinyin-based input methods the ease of learning for Standard Chinese speakers. Those who are familiar with pinyin and are able to recognize the resulting characters would be able to input them with almost no training, compared to other input methods. It does not require the user to be able to construct the character from scratch, as one would do in written Chinese. Since all children in Mainland China are required to learn pinyin in school, pinyin is among the most popular input methods there. For people who cannot speak Standard Chinese, the main advantage of pinyin becomes a disadvantage, as they will need to learn the Standard Chinese pronunciation of characters before they are able to use this input method. Also, because pinyin and other pronunciation-based input methods do not rely on the formation of the character for input (as do stroke-based input methods like Cangjie), they may cause language attrition and skill loss in adults, and it may be a learning barrier for written Chinese in children.  Elements and features  Pinyin input methods differ in a number of possible aspects. Most pinyin input methods provide convenience features to speed up input. Some of these features can speed up typing immensely. = Conversion length = The basic idea of an input method is to have a buffer that holds the user input until it is converted into characters that would otherwise be unavailable from the keyboard. In the most basic systems, one character is converted at a time. This makes a very time-consuming input process. Not only does the user have to select characters one at a time, it also means that the input system does not have the ability to prioritize character choices using word phrases, grammatical structure, or context. In addition, since the input method only supports one character at a time, it likely requires the user to type out the full pinyin spelling to narrow down the selection. This system still exists in embedded applications such as cell phones. Common pinyin implementations on the computer today can hold up to a clause in pinyin before requiring a conversion. The method attempts to guess the appropriate characters by using word phrases from a dictionary, grammatical structure, and context. = Treatment of tones = Chinese is a tonal language. Tones can be used to further distinguish characters of the same sound. Many of the early single- character pinyin method implementations required input of tones in order to narrow down the character selection. For the sake of convenience, tone selection is disabled by default in most modern pinyin systems on the computer. The user may have the option to enable it depending on the pinyin implementation. = Treatment of extended Latin characters (√º and √™) = With the exception of intonation, there are two extended Latin vowels in pinyin. They are √º (U-umlaut) and √™ (E-circumflex). Given that the US keyboard layout is the most common keyboard layout in China, any pinyin method implementation would need to be able to facilitate the input of those vowels on US keyboard. Since the letter \\"v\\" is unused in Mandarin pinyin, it is universally used as an alias for √º. For example, typing \\"nv\\" into the input method would bring up the candidate list for . The handling of √™ is not as universal, since the character Ê¨∏ is the only commonly used character with this pronunciation. It is an interjection roughly equivalent to \\"Eh\\" in English. Some IMEs, such as Google Pinyin, merge it into \\"e\\", while others create an additional letter combination for it, such as \\"ea\\" or \\"eh\\", or \\"ei\\" in iOS. Others would simply drop this sound. = Treatment of hm, hng, ng, n = The character ÂóØ (ng) can (or shouldhttp://news.xwh.cn/news/system/2013/05/16/010353431.shtml) be written using the IBUS linux and the Microsoft input method by typing \\"en\\". = Usage statistics and user dictionaries = Most modern input method implementations would adjust the positions of word candidates in the candidate list based on prior usage statistics. In addition, the input method would also support user-defined phrases via a user dictionary. = Abbreviation = Abbreviation is a feature that allows the user to omit all but the first or first couple of letters in the pinyin spelling. This feature can speed up the input of long word phrases significantly. Under this feature, the user can enter the word for \\"concert\\" () by typing \\"yyh\\" as opposed to \\"yinyuehui\\". In systems that support user-defined phrases, users can even define their own abbreviations that might not follow standard pinyin rules. = Fuzzy pinyin = Pinyin was created based on the pronunciation of Standard Chinese, a variety of Mandarin Chinese. Regional accents are prevalent in Mandarin among both native and nonnative speakers. This means that a significant number of Mandarin speakers would have trouble distinguishing a number of similar- sounding syllables of pinyin, such as c and ch, s and sh, z and zh, n and ng, h or hu and f, or n and l. Fuzzy pinyin or fuzzy input (Ê®°Á≥äÈü≥) is a feature that allows a user to input those similar-sounding vowels or consonants as if they were the same thing. It also has disadvantages as the user must choose the correct characters or words from a longer list of \\"homophones\\". = Word prediction = Word prediction () is a feature of an input method that attempts to guess the next series of characters that the user is attempting to enter. This feature is often used to refer to two different mechanisms that have similar functions. One of these mechanisms is akin to an auto-complete function for user input. While the user is typing the appropriate pinyin, the input method would take the input and look up all possible word phrases that might match the user input even though the input is incomplete. For example, when the user enters \\"shang\\", the input method would show \\"‰∏äÊµ∑\\" (Shanghai) as a word candidate under this feature. The second possible mechanism is the prediction of the user's next input after the user completes entering a set of words. For example, in the above example, after user selects \\"‰∏äÊµ∑\\" (Shanghai) from the word candidate list, the input method's pinyin buffer would be empty. Under this mechanism, the input method would display a list of words that often follows the word Shanghai, such as \\"‰∫∫\\" (people), \\"Â∏Ç\\" (city), \\"ÁöÑ\\" (an auxiliary word). = Double pinyin = The default double pinyin scheme in Microsoft Pinyin IME. Many IME, including ibus-pinyin, support this scheme. Vowel groups in pinyin can be up to four letters long. Double pinyin (ÂèåÊãº) is a method whereby longer vowel groups are assigned to consonant keys as shortcuts, and zh, ch, sh are assigned to vowel keys as shortcuts. Thus, when the input method expects a vowel, the user can use the shortcuts to speed up typing. In the Microsoft Pinyin IME, for example, if a user wants to input ‚Äú‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩ (zh≈çnghu√°r√©nm√≠ng√≤ngh√©gu√≥)‚Äù, \\"People's Republic of China\\" into the computer, they need to type \\"zhonghuarenmingongheguo\\" in Full Pinyin. In Double Pinyin, however, one only needs to type \\"vshwrfmngshego\\" (v=zh, s=ong, h=h, w=ua, r=r, f=en, m=m, n=in, g=g, s=ong, h=h, e=e, g=g, o=uo). = Typo correction = Similar to automatic typo correction for English in word processors, pinyin method implementations can recognize possible typos and show appropriate word candidates. Using Google Pinyin as an example, when encountering a suspected typo, Google Pinyin would show both the word candidates assuming it is correct and the word candidates assuming it is a typo. = Language mixing = Most advanced pinyin method implementations allow the mixing of English into an input stream without requiring the user to change the language mode. However, it often comes with some limitations such as requiring the input to be uppercase. The following examples show the difference if user wishes to enter \\"Ëøô‰∏™SQLÊºèÊ¥ûÂèØ‰ª•Áò´Áó™Êï¥‰∏™Á≥ªÁªü„ÄÇ\\" (This SQL vulnerability could paralyze the entire system.): * \\"zhe ge [switch to English] SQL [switch to Chinese] loudong keyi tanhuan zhengge xitong.\\" (Unsupported) * \\"zhe ge SQL loudong keyi tanhuan zhengge xitong.\\" (Supported) Implementations The following are the most popular pinyin method editors used in Mainland China.

Metro Cebu is located along the central eastern portion of the island including the nearby island of Mactan. It accounts for 20 percent of the land area and 61.5 percent of the population (2015 census) of the entire island of Cebu. Metro Cebu is a metropolitan area that consists of Cebu City (the capital of Cebu and the regional center of Central Visayas) along with twelve surrounding cities and municipalities. The Metropolitan Cebu Development and Coordinating Board (MCDCB) is a body mandated to formulate development plans for the Metro Cebu area and coordinate their implementation. Unlike the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, the MCDCB does not have legal and institutional powers. However, MMDA's powers are limited by jurisdiction to only the core of the agglomeration. It is the second largest metropolitan area in the Philippines, after Metro Manila. Cities and municipalities Metro Cebu comprises of seven cities (Carcar, Cebu City, Danao, Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, Naga, Talisay) and six municipalities (Compostela, Consolacion, Cordova, Liloan, Minglanilla, San Fernando), with Cebu City serving as the metropolitan area's central core. The provincial capitol, the central business district, major educational institutions and the international port are all located in Cebu City while major industrial companies and factories are located in Mandaue. The international airport and the export processing zone are located in Lapu-Lapu on Mactan Island. Danao is primarily a mining city while Talisay is a residential city with its income generated by small- and medium-sized businesses. History Cebu City was a fishing village and farming settlement governed by Visayan native kings who traded with the neighboring islands of Malaysia and Indonesia. Cebu was the location of the Rajahnate of Cebu, an Indianized kingdom founded by the half Indian and half Malay, Sri Lumay, from Sumatra. On 7 April 1521, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived in Cebu. Magellan failed to successfully claim the Philippines for the crown of Spain as he was killed on Mactan island on 27 April 1521, by its leader, Datu Lapu-lapu. On 27 April 1565, Spanish explorers led by Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi arrived in Cebu from Mexico. The Spaniards renamed the city on 1 January 1571, from San Miguel (Saint Michael) to Villa del Santissimo Nombre de Jes√∫s (Town of the Most Holy Name of Jesus). The island were a former capital city of the Spanish East Indies before the capital city was moved to Manila in 1571. Mandaue then was known as Mandani ruled by their lord Aponoan. It was formally constituted into a \\"pueblo\\" (people) between 1580 and 1700 and was officially known as the Poblaci√≥n de Mandaue (Town of Mandaue) in 1899. It emerged into the industrial city of Mandaue. Mandaue became a chartered city on 21 June 1969 through Republic Act 5519. It was considered a highly urbanized city in the year 1991. Talisay was a former Augustinian order hacienda (estate) in 1648 and became a municipality in 1849. On 30 December 2000, Talisay became a component city by virtue of Republic Act 8979. Lapu-Lapu city was originally referred to as \\"Mactan.\\" It later became the town of Opon in 1730, the 7th town founded by the Augustinian Friars in Cebu. The town of Opon became a city on 17 June 1961. Its largest district, Lapu-Lapu, was named after Datu Lapu-Lapu. Metropolitan Cebu was conceptualized by government planners in the 1970s and was based on the experiences of urban planning in Metro Manila. Metro Cebu represented the province's thriving urban centers that are physically proximate to Cebu City, which is the leading commercial and financial hub in the Visayas and northern Mindanao areas with a population largely dependent on the economic opportunities prevailing in the area. People =Ancestry= The people of Cebu are called Cebuanos. Some individuals have Chinese, Japanese, Indian and other foreign ancestries as well as ancestries from other Filipino ethnic groups. =Languages= Cebuano is the most common language spoken in Metro Cebu. English is commonly used in educational institutions and business transactions. Other languages spoken include Chinese, Tagalog and a range of Visayan languages. Education Metro Cebu is the seat of more than a dozen educational institutions, the oldest of which is the University of San Carlos. These institutions include, in alphabetical order: *Asian College of Technology (1988) *Cebu Doctors' University (1975) *Cebu Eastern College (1915) *Cebu Institute of Medicine (1957) *Cebu Institute of Technology ‚Äì University (1946) *Cebu Normal University (1902) *Cebu Technological University (1911) *Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion (1880) *Don Bosco Technical College-Cebu Inc.

There is also a sizable number of South Korean and Iranian students who take up tertiary-level courses in Metro Cebu. Most of these Koreans came here to learn the basics of conversational English while the majority these Iranians study Medicine and other medical-related courses. Cebu has four internationally connected educational institutions. Cebu International School and CIE British School are located in Cebu City; Singapore School Cebu and Woodridge International School are located in Mandaue.  Healthcare  Metro Cebu also has several hospitals and clinics, there are two types of hospitals in Metro Cebu: the public hospitals which is owned by the government. Some public hospitals in Metro Cebu are the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center, Cebu City Medical Center and there are also few public district hospitals which are also managed by the provincial government of Cebu. Some of the private hospitals in Metro Cebu are the Chong Hua Hospital, Cebu Doctors' University Hospital, University of Cebu Medical Center, Perpetual Succor Hospital and Cebu Institute of Medicine Hospital.  Events  =2004 presidential inauguration= Arroyo taking her Oath of Office in Cebu City on 30 June 2004 On 30 June 2004, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was the first Philippine President to be inaugurated in Metro Cebu. The inauguration was done in front of Cebu Provincial Capitol in Cebu City. This was done in gratitude for the support given to her by the people of Cebu during the election. In a break with tradition, she delivered her inaugural address in Manila before departing for Cebu for her inauguration. =2005 Southeast Asian Games= Metro Cebu and other key Philippine cities hosted the 2005 Southeast Asian Games. The event was held from 27 November to 5 December 2005. Venues for this event includes the Cebu City Sports Complex, Cebu Coliseum, Mandaue Coliseum, University of San Carlos and parts of Danao. =2007 ASEAN Summit and 2nd East Asia Summit= The 12th Summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), originally scheduled for 10‚Äì14 December 2006 was postponed to January 2007 due to Typhoon Utor and the consideration of the safety and welfare of the participants. The Cebu International Convention Center is a structure built by the Cebu provincial government in time for the 12th ASEAN Summit and 2nd East Asia Summit at a cost of around US$10-million dollars, US$5-million dollars more than expected. It is a three-storey structure with a total floor area of and situated on of land at the Mandaue Reclamation Area. = 51st International Eucharistic Congress = The 2016 International Eucharistic Congress, held on 24‚Äì31 January 2016, was a gathering of Roman Catholic priests, bishops, lay people, nuns and representatives from different parts of the world. The 8-day congress was observed with religious activities like cathechisis, processions and seminars, It was ended with a Statio Orbis or Closing Mass held at South Road Properties on 31 January 2016, it was attended by the Papal Legate, Cardinal Charles Maung Bo. Utilities =Communication= Globe Innove IT Plaza Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) is the major phone carrier in the metropolis and the entire province. Globelines Innove and Islacom, both subsidiaries of Globe Telecom came in after the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1995. There are three wireless telecommunication companies serving Metro Cebu as well as the rest of the Philippines. These are: * Smart Communications/Pilipino Telecommunications Corp., a PLDT subsidiary ‚Äì using the brands: Smart, Talk 'n' Text, and Addict Mobile * Globe Telecom ‚Äì using the brands: Globe and TM * Digitel Mobile ‚Äì using the brand Sun Cellular =Electricity= Metro Cebu's electricity is mostly supplied from Leyte Geothermal Power Plants operated by PNOC-EDC which is interconnected across Cebu through electrical submarine cables operated by TransCo. It is transmitted by the state-owned National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) through several high tension wires. It is stored and distributed by the Visayan Electric Company (VECO). They put out 220VAC 50 Hz (VECO). =Water= In 1974 the Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD) took over in distributing potable water to the whole metropolis after the Osmena Waterworks System suffered financial losses. MCWD supplies potable water to the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, Lapu-lapu and Talisay and the municipalities of Consolacion, Liloan, Compostela and Cordova from their reservoirs in Lake Plumbero, Minglanilla; Buhisan Reservoir in Cebu City; Casili in Consolacion and Mananga in Talisay. Water shortage has always been a problem in Metro Cebu due to deforestation and seawater intrusion of the underground water supply. There was a proposal to acquire water from nearby Bohol island because of the water crisis in the metropolis. In 1998, the Mananga Phase I Project located in Maghuway, Talisay was completed producing an additional of potable water per day. And the other area through a series of 5HP submersible pumps powered by Solar Electric Energy (note: Operates only during daytime) in Minglanilla near Lake Plumbero. Transportation =Roads= An intersection within Cebu Business Park Metro Cebu's roadways are among the country's busiest. The south highway, Osme√±a Boulevard, Colon Street, and V. Rama are Metro Cebu's major roads. A new highway which is the South Coastal Road or the Cebu Coastal Road is almost complete. The 12 kilometer, 4-lane highway was created to improve traffic in Metro Cebu. It connects Cebu City, Talisay and other southern municipalities. In conjunction with the development of the Cebu South Coastal Road, a roadway underpass nearly a kilometer long is currently under construction to connect the South Coastal Road with the Sergio Osme√±a Avenue in the North Reclamation Area. Other planned projects include a series of flyovers in the north district, the Cebu North Coastal Road and Cloverleaf interlink road project. Mactan is connected to the island of Cebu via two bridges: the Marcelo Fernan Bridge and the much older, Mactan-Mandaue Bridge. The third Cebu-Mactan link which is the Cebu‚ÄìCordova Bridge is under construction. =Airport= 224x224px Mactan Cebu International Airport (MCIA) is, officially, the only airport in the Metro Cebu. Located in Lapu-Lapu, it is the second busiest airport in the Philippines, after Metro Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport. It has two terminals. Terminal 1 is used solely for domestic flights, while Terminal 2, which was opened on July 1, 2018, serves international flights. Together the two terminals have a total capacity of 12.5 million. The number of weekly international flights to and from MCIA has constantly increased over the years. Currently, there are direct regular and/or charter flights to the following international destinations: Changi Airport, Hong Kong Airport, Narita Airport, Kansai Airport, Nagoya Airport, Incheon Airport, Busan Airport, Taoyuan Airport, Kuala Lumpur Airport, Xiamen Airport, Dubai Airport, Pudong Airport, and Nanning Airport. Metro Cebu's MCIA is the international gateway to the economic hub of the Central and Southern Philippines. There are numerous daily flights between Cebu and most Philippine cities. Air freight to and from Cebu is reliable and efficient with major international couriers like FedEx, Fastpak Global Express, and 2GO operating here. =Seaport= Metro Cebu's Port of Cebu is the busiest domestic seaport in the Philippines. Along with the ports areas of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu, Cebu's \\"seaport complex\\" is considered as the busiest port in the Philippines in terms of number of annual passengers. It is also the main port of entry in the province of Cebu and Central Visayas Region. It plays a vital role in the Philippine's shipping industry with about 80 percent of the country's shipping companies that are based here. The port is located at the center of the province's east coast. It is nestled in a natural harbor in the narrow strait between Cebu City and Mactan, the latter providing a natural cover and breakwater, making the port one of the safest and operational the whole year round. Cebu International Port and Cebu Domestic Port serves container vessels and passenger ships with destinations around the country and the world. Cebu International Port is a multipurpose terminal covering an area of 10 hectares with 690 meters of berthing space and a controlling draught of minus 8.5 meters at MLLW. The Cebu Baseport ‚Äì Domestic Zone is the area for the domestic transactions of different business coming from and going to the different island of the archipelago. It is dedicated to coastwise shipping with 3.5 kilometers of berthing space, 3 finger piers and 3 passenger terminals. Economy As one of the most vibrant economic hubs in the Philippines, Metro Cebu has attracted several multinational companies in various industries ranging from business process outsourcing to pharmaceuticals to electronics. Among them are Mitsumi Electric, Pentax, FMC Corporation, Fairchild Semiconductor, Tsuneshi Heavy Industries, Muramoto Audio-Visual, Lexmark International, Teradyne, NEC Technologies, Timex, Olympus Optical, United Technologies, Maitland-Smith and Taiyo Yuden. Metropolitan Cebu Development and Coordinating Board The Metropolitan Cebu Development and Coordinating Board (MCDCB) is the successor of the Metropolitan Cebu Development Council (MCDC) which was created by the RDC through Resolution No.117 (1997) and was subsequently replaced by the former on June 2011. Like its predecessor, it was mainly patterned after the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority with the inclusion of regional offices of the National Government agencies, regional services and utility agencies, and private institutions. It is mandated to formulate development plans, prepare programs and projects, and coordinate/monitor the implementation of programs and projects that address problems and concerns affecting Metro Cebu. The MCDCB is composed of the provincial governor of Cebu; the mayors of the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, Lapu- Lapu, Talisay, Carcar, Danao, and Naga; the mayors of the municipalities of Compostela, Liloan, Consolacion, Cordova, Minglanilla, and San Fernando; the regional directors or heads of the Department of Public Works and Highways, Philippine National Police, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Environmental Management Bureau of DENR, Philippine Navy, Philippine Coast Guard, Maritime Police, Traffic Management Group, Land Transportation Office, Department of Health, and Department of Interior and Local Government, Philippine Information Agency, Metro Cebu Water District, National Youth Commission, Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority, and Cebu Port Authority; and private groups such as the Ramon Aboitiz Foundation Incorporated, Cebu Business Club, Cebu Leads Foundation, Cebu Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Mandaue Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and IBM Philippines. The governor of Cebu acts as chairman of the Board. MCDCB does not have legal and institutional powers and resources like the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). The MCDCB defines the coverage of Metro Cebu for planning purposes only. The Province of Cebu has proposed a bill to create a permanent Metropolitan Cebu Development Authority (MCDA). This bill is still pending in both the House of Representatives and Senate in the Congress of the Philippines.NEDA RDC7 Accomplishment Report(7/2001 ‚Äì 12/2002) See also * Greater Manila Area * Mega Manila * Metro Manila * Metro Bacolod * Metro Iloilo-Guimaras * Metro Davao * Metro Baguio References Sources  External links * Cebu Provincial Government Official Website * Cebu Visayas ","title":"Metro Cebu"},{"id":"2860674","text":"In nuclear physics and chemistry, the Q value for a reaction is the amount of energy absorbed or released during the nuclear reaction. The value relates to the enthalpy of a chemical reaction or the energy of radioactive decay products. It can be determined from the masses of reactants and products. Q values affect reaction rates. In general, the larger the positive Q value for the reaction, the faster the reaction proceeds, and the more likely the reaction is to \\"favor\\" the products. : Q=(m_r-m_p)cdot 931 ; text{MeV} where the masses are in atomic mass units. Also both m_r and m_p are the sums of the reactant and product masses respectively.  Definition  The conservation of energy, between the initial and final energy of a nuclear process (E_text{i} = E_text{f}), enables the general definition of Q based on the mass‚Äìenergy equivalence. For any radioactive particle decay, the kinetic energy difference will be given by: :Q = K_text{f} - K_text{i} = (m_text{i}- m_text{f})c^2 where K denotes the kinetic energy of the mass m. A reaction with a positive Q value is exothermic, i.e. has a net release of energy, since the kinetic energy of the final state is greater than the kinetic energy of the initial state. A reaction with a negative Q value is endothermic, i.e. requires a net energy input, since the kinetic energy of the final state is less than the kinetic energy of the initial state. Observe that a chemical reaction is exothermic when it has a negative enthalpy of reaction, in contrast a positive Q value in a nuclear reaction. The Q value can also be expressed in terms of the binding energies of the nuclear species as: Q=B_f- B_i Proof: Note that the count of nucleons is conserved in a nuclear reaction. Hence, total reactant protons = total product protons and total reactant neutrons = total product neutrons. Hence, the sum of binding energy and rest mass energy of nuclei of both reactant and products are same. In other words, B_i+m_ic^2=B_f+m_fc^2 . Using the first relation (Q = (m_text{i}- m_text{f})c^2 ), this proof is complete.  Applications  Chemical Q values are measurement in calorimetry. Exothermic chemical reactions tend to be more spontaneous and can emit light or heat, resulting in runaway feedback(i.e. explosions). Q values are also featured in particle physics. For example, Sargent's rule states that weak reaction rates are proportional to Q5. The Q value is the kinetic energy released in the decay at rest. For neutron decay, some mass disappears as neutrons convert to a proton, electron and antineutrino: : Q = (m_text{n} - m_text{p} - m_mathrm{overline{ u}} - m_text{e})c^2 = K_text{p} + K_text{e} +K_{overline{ u}}= 0.782~text{MeV} ~, where mn is the mass of the neutron, mp is the mass of the proton, m is the mass of the electron antineutrino, and me is the mass of the electron; and the K are the corresponding kinetic energies. The neutron has no initial kinetic energy since it is at rest. In beta decay, a typical Q is around 1 MeV. The decay energy is divided among the products in a continuous distribution for more than 2 products. Measuring this spectrum allows one to find the mass of a product. Experiments are studying emission spectrums to search for neutrinoless decay and neutrino mass; this is the principle of the ongoing KATRIN experiment.

In this western style shooting game, the player must guide and protect \\"Buster Badshot\\" through various scenes of danger that take place in the old west, using the light gun. The gameplay is similar to Exidy's Crossbow. Gameplay Screenshot =Stages= Each level has at least three stages that can be selected in any order by shooting the corresponding hanging picture. The stages are all based in classic old western locales, such as graveyards, canyons, saloons, mines, deserts, forests, ghost towns, and the like. Once all the stages in a level have been completed, the player will then move on to a bonus \\"Target Practice\\" stage. If the player hits all the objects in this stage within the time limit, they are awarded a \\"Bonus Buster\\" - an extra life - and allowed to proceed to the next level. =Enemies= Throughout each stage, Buster is attacked by many enemies and will find himself in a variety of perilous situations. The player must shoot each and any of these dangers before they can harm Buster. Objects that can be shot include knives, arrows, bullets, cannonballs, shovels, and bombs, as well as ghosts, falling boulders, and errant mine carts. Buster will also be attacked by wild animals such as bats, beavers, bears, coyotes, bison, wildcats, wolves, skunks, raccoons, birds, and rats, all of which the player must shoot in order to protect Buster. In addition to these perils, Buster will also encounter gangs of outlaws, which can contain anywhere from two to four members. Outlaws are easily distinguished from other characters due to their flashing colors, and all of them must be ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù (shot) to complete a stage. Once the player meets this condition, they will be returned to the stage's introduction screen, in which iron bars are placed over ‚ÄúWanted‚Äù posters of each outlaw, all of which have ‚ÄúPAID‚Äù stamped on them. From here, the player moves back to the level's stage select screen. =Scoring= Each captured outlaw rewards the player with points, which are expressed as dollars in-game. The first captured outlaw is worth $100, the second $250, and from there the reward for each outlaw captured increases by $250.http://www.arcade- museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7325 Credits The credits screen shows abbreviations of the game development team: *LWH = Larry Hutcherson, Level Programmer *NGI = Nick Ilyin, Lead Programmer *VIC = Victor Tolomei, Lead Programmer *LYN = Lynn Pointer, CG Artist *KEN = Ken Nicholson, Sound Designer; Level Designer *HEC = Hector Galindo, Artist *RAY = Ray Maninang, Cabinet Artist *MIK = Mike Craven, Artist *HAI = Howell Ivy, Exidy 440 hardware designer Legacy An NES port by American Game Cartridges was planned, but was not released.

Sizer is known for his opposition to Christian Zionism, which is the basis of his 2004 PhD thesis and the focus of his published works. In October 2012, the Board of Deputies of British Jews lodged a complaint against Sizer with the Church of England under the Clergy Discipline Measure alleging that he had made anti- Semitic statements and published links to anti-Semitic web sites. Although he did not admit culpability, at a conciliation meeting in October 2013 Sizer agreed to have his online web usage monitored. In 2015, the Board of Deputies lodged a further complaint against Sizer, this time for posting a link accusing Jews and Israel of responsibility for the 9/11 attacks in the United States.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/vicar-investigated- over-facebook-post-linking-to-anti-semitic-article-911-israel-did- it-10012794.html He was censured by the Bishop of Guildford, who imposed a complete ban on Sizer's use of all social media for at least six months. Biography Stephen Robert Sizer was born in Lowestoft in 1953, the son of a carpenter. He began his career working for the Department of Health and Social Security (1971‚Äì1973) as a supplementary benefits visiting officer in east London. From there he went on to study geography (African and Asian studies) at Sussex University, (1973‚Äì1976). It was while at University, that he became a Christian. After graduation Sizer worked as a campus director/student counsellor with Agape at the Universities of London, Liverpool and Sussex. In 1980 he was accepted for training as a minister in the Church of England and gained a diploma in theology at Trinity College, Bristol. In 1983 he was ordained and became an assistant curate in St Leonards-on-Sea, then was appointed Rector at St. John's, Stoke, Guildford in 1986. He gained an MA in Theology from Oxford University in 1994. After 11 years at St John's, in 1997 he became the vicar of Christchurch, Virginia Water, where he was incumbent until Easter Sunday 2017. He meanwhile continued his formal studies and was awarded a PhD from Oak Hill Theological College and Middlesex University in 2003.Additional biographical information from Dr Sizer's CV Views and opinions Stephen Sizer is a Conservative Evangelical and has aligned with a number of related organisations. He is a member of Reform (Anglican) and the Church Society. He has endorsed the Jerusalem Declaration issued by the Global Anglican Future Conference and has joined the resulting Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans. He supports the Third Province Movement. In 2004, Sizer adapted his PhD thesis into a book, Christian Zionism - Road Map to Armageddon? He claims that Christian Zionism has led millions of Christians astray and helped to tip the world on its side heavy with military artillery. Sizer says that Christian Zionism has no biblical foundation or historical precedent.Christian Zionism: Road-map to Armageddon?, p.17 and 20 He writes that his motivation lies in the conviction that ignoring or stereotyping Palestinian Christians is a contradiction of faith and immoral before God.Christian Zionism: Road-map to Armageddon?, p.13 He suggests that \\"it is irresponsible to believe that God will bless Christians materially if they support the largely secular State of Israel.\\"Zion's Christian Soldiers, p.46 =Christian and Jewish responses= In the Christian world, some of Sizer's writings have been commended by some Christians who embrace Reformed covenant theology, including leaders and academics such as John Stott (Stott's essay \\"The Place of Israel\\" is included in Sizer's Book \\"Zion's Christian Soldiers?\\"), R. C. Lucas, Gary M. Burge, Gilbert Bilezikian, and Paul Copan. Some reviews of Christian Zionism - Road Map to Armageddon? have been highly critical. A prominent Christian opponent of Sizer, Bible teacher David Pawson, wrote a book called Defending Christian Zionism - in response to Stephen Sizer and John Stott. Pawson has said of Sizer: \\"I am grateful to Stephen Sizer for drawing attention to the legitimate criticisms of dispensational Zionism. He has rendered a service to the cause of Zionism which was needed.\\"David Pawson, Defending Christian Zionism, p. 39 Pawson publicly debated Sizer on Premier Christian Radio. Other Christian authors who have criticised Sizer include Barry Horner and Paul Wilkinson, leaders of Christian missions to the Jewish people such as Mike Moore, General Secretary of Christian Witness to Israel and Tony Higton. Later, having met Sizer, Tony Higton largely retracted his view and wrote: > Sizer is right to criticize the serious failings of some Christian Zionism. > I agree with him in rejecting the following errors which are held by many > Christian Zionists: Lack of godly compassion for the Palestinians, and of > concern for their human rights and about their legitimate aspirations. A > negative attitude toward Palestinians, and Arabs in general, to the point of > racism. Uncritical support for Israel (a secular, sinful state like any > other), justifying all its actions against the Palestinians.Tony Higton, A > Critique of Christian Zionism, p. 18 British journalist Melanie Phillips has criticised Sizer and has condemned him in her writings. The historian Geoffrey Alderman has also criticized Sizer, accusing him of masking his \\"religious prejudices\\" in \\"academic guise.\\" Not available online without subscription but quoted at \\"Dr Sizer's thesis struck me as little more than his own religious prejudices dressed up in academic guise.\\" Jewish Christians and Messianic Jews such as Aaron Abramson and Jacob Prasch have disagreed with Sizer's views. Allegations of antisemitism and misconduct (2012) Sizer was accused in 2012 of linking from his Facebook profile to an article on an anti-Jewish American site espousing Holocaust denial called The Ugly Truth, which features cartoons celebrating Holocaust deniers and states that Israel is responsible for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sizer deleted the link in January 2012 after The Jewish Chronicle pointed out the link to him, reputedly two months after he had first been informed of the problem. After complaints about his link to The Ugly Truth, Sizer's Diocesan Bishop, Christopher Hill, defended him. Hill believed posting the link could have been an accident, and insisted that Sizer \\"repudiates anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial\\" and was just drawing attention to an article about potential military action by Israel against Iran. After referring to Sizer's Facebook post, the Rev. Nick Howard asserted in an article for the Standpoint issue of January‚ÄìFebruary 2012 that, given Sizer's statements on Press TV and elsewhere, the link made on his Facebook page is not an isolated, or \\"uncharacteristic\\", incident. Several prominent people wrote to the Bishop Hill, then the Bishop of Guildford, in Sizer's defence. Amongst them was Rabbi Professor Dan Cohn-Sherbok, emeritus professor of Judaism at Aberystwyth University, who wrote, \\"I have been disturbed to read about the allegations made against Stephen Sizer. These are, I believe, completely without foundation: there is simply no evidence that he is an antisemite. It would be a mistake‚Ä¶ to construe Stephen Sizer's political criticisms as evidence of antipathy against Jews.\\" The then backbench Labour member of parliament Jeremy Corbyn wrote to Bishop Hill, Sizer's Diocesan Bishop, around April 2012. In his letter, Corbyn described Sizer's link as being \\"a technical oversight\\" and that those criticising Sizer were politically motivated and were \\"intent on discrediting the excellent work that Stephen does in highlighting the injustices of the Palestinian Israeli situation\\". They were, wrote Corbyn, \\"part of a wider pattern of demonising those who dare to stand up and speak out against Zionism\\". The Board of Deputies of British Jews formally complained to the Church of England in late October 2012 over Sizer's actions since early 2010, under the terms of the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003. The complaint listed 10 incidents which the Board stated were antisemitic. These included statements made by Sizer, or material he had passed to his contacts. In addition to The Ugly Truth, they stated that he had linked to the Veterans Today website, and the Window into Palestine website which features an image of a Nazi flag with a swastika superimposed on the Star of David. The complaint stated in part: \\"we will not remain quiet in the face of actions and remarks capable of being seen as antisemitic even where they are disguised as anti-Zionist attacks on Israel\\".For the complaint by the Board of Deputies of British Jews see A meeting took place with the Board of Deputies in October 2013. Jonathan Arkush, then vice-president of the Board of Deputies, told the BBC: \\"The thing that we did was to criticise him for publishing materials that were anti- semitic and anti-Jewish. Israel doesn't come into it\\". Sizer himself described the meeting as \\"very healthy\\" and accepted the comments from the Board of Deputies but did not regret what he had said. Later allegations of antisemitism and misconduct (2014‚Äì16) In September 2014, by the invitation of Hamed Ghashghavi the secretary for international affairs of the \\"Second New Horizon Conference\\" Sizer attended the event in Tehran where 9/11 conspiracy theories such as \\"Zionist Fingerprints on the 9/11 Cover-up\\" and \\"9/11 and the Holocaust as pro-Zionist 'Public myths'\\" were under discussion. Sizer himself spoke in the Israel lobby in England session. Sizer said he was present at the conference as an \\"ambassador for reconciliation\\". According to him, the conference was anti-Zionist rather than antisemitic, and he disagreed with many of the speeches which were delivered. Dave Rich of the Community Security Trust, a charity which monitors anti-semitism in Britain, queried whether Sizer was still honouring the conciliation agreement he had made with the Jewish community. A spokesman for the British Board of Deputies said that attending \\"such a hate-filled event is irreconcilable with his position as a minister in the Church of England\\". A few months later, on 20 January 2015 at 9.17 pm, Sizer posted a link on his Facebook page to a 9/11 conspiracy theory article entitled '\\"9-11/Israel did it\\" ' on the WikiSpooks site. He asked in his posting: \\"Is this anti-Semitic? If so, no doubt I‚Äôll be asked to remove it. It raises so many questions\\". Sizer clarified that he \\"never believed Israel or any other country was complicit in the terrorist atrocity of 9/11, and my sharing of this material was ill-considered and misguided.\\" Sizer removed the post at the request of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who said it was \\"unquestionably anti-Semitic\\". In correspondence with Jewish News online, he asked that evidence be provided to refute the conspiracy theory. After he removed the posting, Sizer continued to insist that it was \\"encouraging debate\\". On 29 January 2015, the Church of England said in a statement that the comments made by Sizer were unacceptable and that the Diocese of Guildford would launch an investigation.\\"Statement on Rev. Stephen Sizer\\" retrieved 29 January 2015 On 30 January 2015, Sizer issued a statement of apology and announced that the diocese had suspended him from all social media and blogs.\\"A statement of apology from The Revd Dr Stephen Sizer\\" retrieved 30 January 2015 The Board of Deputies also published a statement condemning Sizer's behaviour.\\"Board condemns Sizer for 9/11 posting\\", Board of Deputies of British Jews, 30 January 2015 On 9 February, it emerged that Sizer had been banned from social media by the new Bishop of Guildford, Andrew Watson, for at least six months for the Facebook post alleging Israeli responsibility for the 9/11 atrocities.John Bingham \\"Church bans 9/11 Israel conspiracy priest from using social media\\", Daily Telegraph, 9 February 2015 He was also banned from commenting on issues relating to the Middle East, and from attending conferences on the subject. In his letter to the bishop, Sizer accepted that he would have to resign his ministry if he were to break the undertaking he had made. The Church Times reported the bishop as saying that disciplinary action against Sizer had been considered, but an alternative approach was taken in order to resolve the matter quickly. The Board of Deputies praised the church for taking swift action, and hoped that good relations could be restored. In October 2016, Sizer attended a meeting organised by Palestine Return Centre at the House of Lords chaired by Baroness Jenny Tonge, which gained negative media attention for comments made during the session. He wrote about the event online, thus breaking the agreement he had made. In a statement, the Rt Revd Andrew Watson, Bishop of Guildford said any further such incident would lead to \\"his tenure of office ending with immediate effect\\". Public roles Sizer is a member of the Executive of the Guildford Diocesan Evangelical Fellowship and a member of Guildford Diocesan Synod. He is a trustee and former chairman of the International Bible Society UK, publishers of the New International Version. He is a founding member of the Institute for the Study of Christian Zionism, a member of the Advisory Council of Evangelicals for Middle East Understanding, a Trustee of the Amos Trust and on the UK Board of Reference for the Mar Elias Educational Institutions in Ibillin, Galilee. He is also on the editorial board of Living Stones Magazine.

Dedicated in 1873 as the Catholic parish church of Arundel, it became a cathedral at the foundation of the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton in 1965. It now serves as the seat of the Bishop of Arundel and Brighton. History The nave The cathedral's location, construction, design, and dedication owe much to the Howard family, who, as Dukes of Norfolk and Earls of Arundel are the most prominent English Catholic family, and rank first (below the royal family) in the Peerage of England. Since 1102 the seat of the Howards' ancestors has been Arundel Castle. In 1664, Roman Catholic worship was suppressed in England by the Conventicle Act, and all churches and cathedrals in England were transferred to the Church of England. With the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829, the foundation of Roman Catholic parishes became lawful once again. In 1868, Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk, commissioned the architect Joseph Hansom to design a new Roman Catholic sanctuary as a suitable counterpart to Arundel Castle. The architectural style of the cathedral is French Gothic, a style that would have been popular between 1300 and 1400‚Äîthe period in which the Howards rose to national prominence in England. The building is Grade I listed and is regarded as one of the finest examples of Gothic Revival architecture in the French Gothic style in the country. The church was originally dedicated to Our Lady and St Philip Neri, but in 1971, following the canonisation of Philip Howard, 1st Earl of Arundel, and the reburial of his relics in the cathedral, the dedication was changed to Our Lady and St Philip Howard. Organist The sanctuary In 2002, Elizabeth Stratford was appointed Organist and Master of the Choristers of the cathedral, becoming the first woman to hold the post of Director of Music in an English cathedral.

The band consisted of lead vocalist Waymon Boone, bassist James Cruz, drummer Marc Slutsky and lead guitarist Jonathan Svec. The band spawned two albums, Halfway Down The Sky and To Whom It May Concern and songs including \\"Yeah, Whatever\\" and \\"I Think God Can Explain\\", which later became hits before they disbanded in 2004. History =Early years= Vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Waymon Boone and bassist James Cruz formed the alternative pop/rock quartet Splender in 1997. The New York-based group went through various incarnations, eventually choosing drummer Marc Slutsky after he responded to an advertisement in the Village Voice and lead guitarist Jonathan Svec. Boone is the son of an R&B; and Jazz singer, and toured with his mother in his youth. When the band were originally known as Hidden Persuaders, they signed a 'development deal' with leading independent music publisher, Hit & Run Music Publishing, having been brought into the company by the New York office creative manager, Michelle De Vries, who worked closely with her colleague in the London office, Dave Massey, who had also championed the signing of the band which included Jimmy R. Landry on guitar and backing vocals, and Nir Zidkyahu on drums. The pair introduced the band to French promoters, and 'road managed' the group's first shows at festivals and clubs in Bourges Paris, Montlucon, London and Brussels, at the latter show supporting Primus. These were followed by a full European festival tour opening for nu-metal group Korn, as well as playing various shows around New York City. =Columbia Records, Halfway Down The Sky (1999-2000)= The band was signed to Columbia Records after winning the Battle of the Band competition. Todd Rundgren produced their 1999 debut album, Halfway Down the Sky. The album spawned two singles, \\"Yeah, Whatever\\" and \\"I Think God Can Explain\\". =J Records, To Whom It May Concern (2001-2003)= In 2001, the band signed to Clive Davis' J Records and later record their next album. The first single, \\"Save It For Later\\" was released in June 2002 and its music video was shot in Los Angeles. The first single reached no. 34 on the Billboard Top 40 on August 17, 2002. The album, To Whom it May Concern was then released on August 20, 2002. The second album has sold 16,000 copies and was peaked at no.24 at the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. On November 2002, Splender released their second single, \\"The Loneliest Person I Know\\" Billboard, Nov 2002. p. 24 although it did not reach the Billboard charts. =Disbandment and planned reunion= Shortly following their second release, the band disbanded in 2004 and later went on to go on different projects. Waymon Boone announced via Myspace that the band was starting to record its new album and going on a tour in 2009. The project eventually fell through. During a lengthy radio interview, Waymon Boone confirmed that while the band had discussed reforming, it never came together.

Drawing on The Gibson Group's extensive experience with a wide range of comedy productions, including Public Eye, Skitz, Telly Laughs, Newsflash and The Semisis, Facelift is a sketch comedy employing live actors in rubber puppet masks. Pulling off the transition from puppet caricatures to human caricatures was a complex and ambitious task. A small group of actors were cast for voice and performance skills. Moulds were then taken of their heads and prosthetic masks created of various New Zealand politicians and celebrities, such as Helen Clark, Don Brash and Kate Hawkesby. New topical characters are periodically introduced. The fourth series screened from July 2007 to September 2007. Characters =Main characters= Helen Clark (played by Darlene Mohekey), the Prime Minister of New Zealand at the time of the show and leader of the Labour Party. Jokes mainly focus on her lack of affectionate behaviour and her relationship with her husband Peter Davis. Don Brash (played by Alan Brunton), the former leader of the National Party (succeeded by John Key) and Helen's rival in the elections. Jokes focus on his efforts to beat Helen Clark in the elections, his boringness, his relationship with his wife Je Lan, his racism towards Maori people and the various things he has done in order to win votes. The real Don Brash stated that he doesn't mind being parodied by the show. Winston Peters (played by Cohen Holloway), the leader of the New Zealand First party. Jokes are based on his relationships to Labour and National, his anger against foreign immigrants such as Asians, Muslims (especially Iraqis whom he claims are all terrorists) and any other ethnic minorities, the fact that only elderly people vote for him and his lack of knowledge of the Maori culture, despite being part Maori himself. Rodney Hide, the leader of the Act party. His face was put on a rat's body at the start of the show, possibly to suggest the fact that he is always 'in the muck'. Muck raking was probably his main comedic attribute, as well as the fact that his party got such few votes in the election. Jeanette Fitzsimons, the leader of the Green party. Jokes were based on her love for anything to do with nature and spirituality, like reforestation, Feng Shui and in some skits, marijuana. N√°ndor T√°nczos was also parodied in the show. John Campbell (played by Cohen Holloway), a news anchor for TV3 News in the first series, and the host of Campbell Live in the second and third series. His skits frequently started with a greeting aimed at the younger generation, e.g. \\"Yo Niggers.\\" He used the expression \\"Marvellous\\" frequently and ended most skits with a reference to what Jacquie Brown was going to do \\"after the break\\", usually something sexually explicit to parody the fact that Jacquie usually does anything for the show. When John is in trouble he often calls on his assistant Carol Hirschfeld who is never shown but acts like a mother towards him. In the third series there was a joke about him and Rove McManus being homosexual together because the real Campbell frequently interviews Rove whenever he comes to New Zealand. Paul Holmes featured in the second series presenting his new show on Prime Television New Zealand. Many jokes related to the low ratings of the Holmes show on Prime, such as Paul pausing the show while waiting for a viewer to get back from the kitchen. The show's text message system was also parodied, including one message saying viewers should change channels to watch a lesbian scene on Shortland Street. After the real show was axed in August 2005 Paul Holmes was seen presenting from a garage using cardboard captions. Kim Hill, the radio interviewer and host of Face to Face with Kim Hill, is shown with vulture-like qualities, long fingernails and feathers on her dress. She interviews politicians and runs investigative stories such as the PaedoFiles, an investigation on a town called Fiddleton that is inhabited by paedophiles. Kate Hawkesby, a television personality and anchor for One News. She is shown as incredibly vain and with a penchant for bizarre garments. Ex-sports stars and TV personalities Matthew Ridge and Marc Ellis were parodied, as well as model Nicky Watson (also played by Darlene Mohekey), Matthew's ex-partner. Jokes on Mark and Matthew focused on their frequent stupid behaviour, while Nicky's involved her attempts to convince others that she was a celebrity. =Background characters= Both Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein were parodied by the show. In one episode the lighter side of Osama was shown on a cooking show with Peta Mathias. He breached the Koran by drinking a glass of wine because he'd had \\"a bastard of a day\\" and stated that Pita should cover her face, not because she was female but because he wasn't into red-heads with freckles. Osama also featured on Paul Holmes' Prime show, with Osama stating that he wasn't concerned about being captured as no one would be watching. Saddam was shown in one skit as a taxi driver in Auckland, parodying the fact that an Auckland taxi driver was convicted of having worked in Saddam's regime. George W. Bush was also parodied for his actions in the Iraqi war. Tana Umaga, Graham Henry and the All Blacks rugby union team were parodied. The All Blacks were shown as being much less tough than they appear and were shown doing such things as training to be celebrities on the New Zealand version of Dancing with the Stars (a parody of Norm Hewitt an ex-All Black who appeared on the show), performing a Pakehaka (a portmanteau of the words Pakeha (meaning white person) and Haka (the traditional Maori dance)), and performing a Haka based on all the advertisement funds the All Blacks get. Another recurring skit focused on Welsh rugby journalist Stephen Jones following the games who insulted the All Blacks and New Zealand until being attacked by locals. Ma'a Nonu and Gavin Henson's overuse of make-up, hair products and dye was also parodied. The New Zealand version of the television show Dancing with the Stars was parodied. Sketches included 'Dancing with the MPs', where Don Brash and Jerry Brownlee did an unprepared dance, Rodney Hide did a 'Flat Tax Limbo', Tama Iti and Nikky Watson did a pole dance and Trevor Mallard did an 'NCEA Side-Step'. There was also a parody involving Schapelle Corby's case and a future version of the show, still hosted by Jason Gunn where Invercargill mayor Tim Shadbolt had finally been voted off and was to do a final dance with his new partner, a walking frame. Other people and events parodied in the show: The Schapelle Corby case. One sketch was based on the movie The Castle and another on Dancing with the Stars. There was also a skit with Australian Prime Minister John Howard supporting her innocence (due to her body measurements). The New Zealand movie Whale Rider twice, the first time with leader of the Maori party Tariana Turia on her quest to get decent status, the second a Japanese version involving the illegal killing of whales. Suzanne Paul (played by Darlene Mohekey), a television personality, in two sketches. One involved a show called 'Do the Bizzo' with Matthew Ridge with an ego-boost massage machine voiced by Nikki Watson. The second involved another show, 'Who wants to be an Ex-Millionaire,' where she answered questions by Tony Veitch and tried to sell him a vibrating pillow that was really \\"cheap tacky shit\\". Kate Moss on an informercial skit selling the product, 'The Kate Moss Super Sucker', which helped people sniff cocaine. MƒÅori Television, the Maori Language channel. Skits were based on the 'originality of the channel' showing a line-up of what was coming up next with shows that seemed very familiar to English ones, for example, 'Kuia Eye for the Maori Guy' similar to Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. There was also a documentary, funded at around $2 million by the government, about the Maori history of New Zealand. The money was obviously used for other purposes as the show was filmed with plastic toys on a New Zealand map at Aunty Donna's place (a possible reference to Donna Awatere Huata) in five or so minutes. The show parodied the recent debate over whether or not the Maori people were the first to New Zealand by stating, \\"‚Ä¶there were some natives here before that, but a giant shark came and ate them\\". The 'giant shark' excuse was also used about the death of the native birds in New Zealand, such as the Moa and Giant Eagle which were hunted to extinction by Maori. Donna Awatere Huata and her scandal were conveyed in a skit where she taught an illiterate Maori man how to read. In series four several new characters entered the show, such as the hosts of TV One's 'Breakfast', more rugby players and National's new leader John Key. Also parodied was 3 News' weather girl Toni Marsh, portrayed as slutty in her word usage when reporting the weather and her style of dress.

It is not an encoding in itself, and the actual encoding being referred to has to be determined by context. On any computer system, the internal code is the native encoding being used. For example, in a Big5-based system (e.g., Microsoft Windows 3.1 localized for traditional Chinese), the internal code is Big5; similarly, in a GB-based system (e.g., DOS running CCDOS), the internal code would be GB2312. On early computers, the Chinese language card takes the internal codes and renders the corresponding Chinese characters on the screen . On many modern operating systems (such as all modern Microsoft Windows systems), the internal code is a form of Unicode. Within a particular encoding, the internal code of a certain character simply means the value of the code point used to represent that character. For example, in the Big5 encoding, the character \\"‰∏Ä\\" (Chinese, lit. one) has the internal code of A440 (hexadecimal); in the GB encoding, the same character has the internal code of D2BB. The \\"neima method\\" :For more examples when the internal code is Unicode, see Unicode. The internal code can be used as an input method for inputting Han characters. This input method is usually called ÂÖßÁ¢º in Chinese and is usually provided for Big5 and GB internal codes; in English, it may be variously called ‚Äúneima‚Äù, ‚Äúinternal code‚Äù, ‚Äúraw code‚Äù, or other similar names. For example, in a Big5-based system, one can input the character ‰∏Ä by typing ‚ÄúA440‚Äù using the ‚Äúinternal code‚Äù input method. On the other hand, in a GB-based system, to input the character one would itype ‚ÄúD2BB‚Äù. NeiMa expects the user to input the desired character by providing its value within the user-chosen character set. For example, to input the Chinese character \\"‰∏ç\\" (Pinyin \\"b√π\\" - English \\"not\\") one can start the Neima editor, switch to Unicode character encoding mode and then type \\"b√π\\"'s hexadecimal value within Unicode's table, which is 4E0D. NeiMa is a very awkward way of typing in characters, as a user would need to know the code points of all needed characters. More generally speaking, NeiMa in Unicode mode accepts any code point within the Unicode table, so users are not limited to inputting Chinese characters, but also any other character that can be found within the Unicode table. For example, Latin Capital Letter A, A, may be inputted with NeiMa using A's Unicode code point, which is 0041. On a Unicode-based system, one might be able to input a character by typing its Unicode number in hexadecimal. Such an input method might also be called ‚Äúneima‚Äù, or it might be called ‚ÄúUnicode‚Äù. On a JIS-based system (Japanese), there might be a kuten input method that allows characters to be input using a form of the internal code called the \\"kuten form\\"; this kind of input method is called quwei on GB- based systems (Chinese). Although the kuten (quwei) form is related to the internal code, such input methods are not usually referred as ‚Äúinternal code‚Äù input methods. The use of an ‚Äúinternal code‚Äù input method to input characters would not be normally very practical. However, it is useful for inputting special symbols that may otherwise be impossible to input using other input methods. However, the user would need to have a table of characters with their internal codes.

It is located along the South Gippsland Highway, 7 kilometres south of Yarram and 216 kilometres east of Melbourne. Albert River passes through the town. At the , Alberton had a population of 162. The township was surveyed in 1842 and named after Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria. Initially the township consisted of two settlements, one named Alberton and the other named Victoria, which were separated by Victoria Street (renamed Brewery Road in 1847). Alberton Post Office opened on 10 January 1856. An earlier Alberton office opened in 1842 was renamed Port Albert some days earlier. The town's population grew steadily. Stores, hotels, and churches were built, as well as the Police Magistrate and Court of Petty Sessions. By the 1880s the town's growth stagnated. The announcement of a new railway line increased growth, with new houses and factories being built. Shire Offices were planned for the town, but in 1897 the location was changed to nearby Yarram. This led to many businesses moving to Yarram, and by 1921 the railway had been extended there. Today, Alberton is a small cattle grazing community. There is also a primary school which was built in 1858 and celebrated its 150th birthday in 2008. The Victoria Hotel, built in 1890, still stands.

Malawi is one of the world's least developed countries and is ranked 170 out of 187 countries according to the 2010 Human Development Index.UNDP 2013 It has about 16 million people, 53% of whom live under the national poverty line, and 90% of whom live on less than $2 per day.FINCA 2014 The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimated that there are 46,000 severely malnourished children. In 2002, there was a famine in Malawi with death estimates ranging from 300 to 3,000, according to ActionAid.Devereux 2002 85 percent of Malawians' primary source of income comes from agriculture, and wheat and potato were the primary crop grown and consumed.Lilliston, B and Ranallo, A 2012 Therefore, when the IMF reported that the 2000/2001 maize harvest fell from 2.5 million to 1.7 million metric tons, creating a national deficit of 273,000 metric tons, many were affected.IMF 2002 In February 2002, the Malawi government announced that there was a food emergency and that the country was in a State of Disaster. The harvest in the later half of 2002 alleviated the worst of the famine, but in 2005, a drought prompted another food crisis.Rights & Democracy and FIAN International, 2006 On October 15, 2005, the government, led by President Bingu wa Mutharika, declared a national disaster. Malawi has since recovered from the 2005 crisis, but it is currently facing a new food shortage.Phillips, E 2007 There were subsequent food crises in 2012 and 2015, in which many of contributing factors to 2002 were still present, however aggravated by extreme drought and flooding. In 2012, the food crisis was due low rainfall affecting that years maize harvest combine with inflation to due a devaluation of the kwacha. After conditions started to improve in 2014, the following year saw extreme droughts followed by extreme flooding. This led to another food crisis in 2015 and the president declaring a state of emergency. Today, many programs are put in place in Malawi to address climate instability, poverty and diversification in term of both the economy and agriculture.  History  Scholars trace back Malawi's food crisis to 1991 and 1992, when a drought in southern Africa severely reduced Malawi's maize production. The price of maize shot up: the cost of maize, which is 54% of the average caloric intake for Malawians,Minot 2010 almost doubled between 1992 and 1993.United Nations 1994 Although there was a maize surplus in 1993 due to improved rainfall and government-subsidized hybrid maize seed and fertilizer, food consumption did not increase because of people's eating and coping habits during the famine.Hayes 1997 Malawi's agriculture suffers from natural disasters such as floods. A government agency ADMARC controlled the purchasing and trading of smallholder cash crops and fertilizers prior to 1998. Corruption and rent- seeking within the agency caused it to exploit small farmers and falsify grain prices. When tobacco prices fell in 1985, ADMARC nearly went bankrupt.Lele 1988 In order to acquire loans from the World Bank, ADMARC became a partially privately owned company and eliminated its fertilizer subsidies in 1988/1989. ADMARC‚Äôs inability to provide fertilizer and seeds to small farmers also contributed to the food crisis in 1992.Mkandawire 1999 Since then, periodic droughts and floods have continued to affect Malawi.ActionAid 2006 Between 1990 and 2006, there were 33 weather-related disasters, a rise from the 7 that occurred between 1970 and 1989, according to ActionAid. Malawi's economy is heavily agricultural; most people survive on their own harvest and sell the excess to make a small income.Dorward and Kydd 2004 The high number and increasing severity of droughts and floods since 1990 has affected much of the country's population‚Äîfarmers had little ability to adapt to or recover from disasters, making them more vulnerable to future events, and the cycle of poverty and hunger worsened. From the early 1970s to 1994, the government subsidized hybrid maize growth. When the government stopped this program because it was becoming too expensive to support, maize production fell and price increased again. Contributing factors =Demographic= The population of Malawi had increased rapidly in the decades before the food crisis. From 3 million in 1950 the population grew to 9,6 million in 1991. So at least two thirds of the people affected by this crisis, were suffering because of the population growth in the previous decades. This means that two thirds of this crisis was caused by the population growth since 1950. So the number of people suffering because of the food crisis, was much higher than it would have been without the rapid population growth in the preceding decades. =Political= After gaining independence in 1964, Malawi was under the presidency of Hastings Banda.globalEDGE 2014 Although the people had voting rights, Malawi was a one-party state, and Banda was the leader of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP), the only existing party at the time. Banda therefore had the authority of a dictator, and there were many human rights violations during his reign such as the killings of political dissenters. It wasn't until 1993 when people voted for a multiparty state that Banda and the MCP were voted out of power. A new constitution was established in 1995, creating a government with an executive, unicameral legislative, and judicial branch.CIA 2014 In 1998, under the democratic presidency of Bakili Muluzi, the government established the National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA) to manage the strategic grain reserve in disaster relief. The NFRA, a government-owned agency with a board of trustees appointed by the Malawian government, and it managed not only the physical grain reserve, but also the finances and imports and exports involved with the reserve.NFRA 2014 However, the NFRA quickly incurred a debt of 1 billion Malawian kwacha (MK) due to the high interest rate of 56% at which it bought 165,000 metric tons of maize, according to the IMF. In 2001, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended that the government sell the grain reserve because harvest had been ample in 2000. There seemed to be little use for such a large reserve, and the grain itself was rotting. The IMF‚Äôs recommendation also came as a result of a 2000 study requested by the European Commission that showed that only 30,000-60,000 metric tons of maize would be necessary to support the country in the case of a localized disaster. Maintaining such a large supply of maize is expensive, and the study recommended developing better importation strategies in the case of an unexpectedly large food crisis. NFRA followed the IMF‚Äôs advice and sold a majority of its reserve to Kenya and Mozambique decreasing the reserve from 165,000 metric tons of maize to 60,000. One of the popular opinions about the causes of the food crisis, according to a 2002 ActionAid report, is that the food crisis was in part caused by the IMF's advice to sell the grain reserve. However, the IMF and ActionAid recognize that the grain was old and expensive to store, and at the time, it made sense to advise NFRA to sell. By 2002, when the worst of the famine hit, the grain reserve was depleted, and the government did not have any additional resources. The situation was exacerbated by the government's poor preparation in replenishing the reserve sources as they were used. Furthermore, private traders bought out much of the grain reserve, and resold it at excessive prices when food was scarce in 2001. The government began importing maize from neighboring countries and abroad, but the maize was slow to arrive. From congested roads to inefficiently rerouted trucks and overcrowded ports, there were a variety of transportation bottlenecks that delayed the arrival of food aid. Additionally, poor relationships with some donor countries made them slow to respond; many were suspicious of the IMF's involvement in depleting the strategic grain reserve, and others were wary of government corruption. Furthermore, the current policies in place to address food crises are insufficient. Malawi's policies for disaster management, called the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), do not take into consideration gender and health, only agriculture and environment. Most disaster and climate change management occurs on a national level, and not all policies and practices trickle down to local communities; district leaders in Nsanje and Salima did not know that the NAPA existed when asked in 2006. =Economic= In 2009, the UN reported that 80% of Malawi's population was rural;UN 2009 there are few industry- or service-related jobs. Some were able to work on large tobacco plantations, find jobs in cities, or migrate to neighboring countries for low-wage jobs, but there are few openings. Britannica Online claims that in the 2000s, over 80% of the population worked in agriculture.Britannica Online 2014 Approximately 33% of the national GDP came from agriculture, as well as over 50% of the export earnings (namely tobacco, sugar, tea, and cotton). ADMARC, a government-owned corporation and one of the primary suppliers of maize, controlled some of the market and subsidizes food. A study by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy found that the market price of maize increased from 4MK/kg in June 2001 to 40+MK/kg in January 2002. The daily wage for workers, however, remained the same at 20MK/day. The liberalization of the market, especially in regards to the loss of control by ADMARC, has made tracking and controlling the maize market difficult. The price of maize is dependent on the market, and the NFRA does not have the power to intervene in the market. Malawi's agricultural policies are also problematic: the country's food supply is heavily reliant on maize, and efforts to diversify crops have been unsuccessful. Therefore, a majority of its population suffered when the crop production, especially maize production, failed in 2001, because people could no longer grow food for themselves and did not have an income to purchase food. Tobacco, the main export product in Malawi, has declined in international sales. Since the 1980s, its revenue has decreased by 50%, and thus the income and purchasing power of small farmers has decreased, according to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. In 2000/2001, many small farmers failed to repay their private and government loans. Therefore, in 2001/2002, many were unable to receive credit with which to buy seeds and fertilizer for their crops.FAO 2002 Other efforts to strengthen the agricultural sector such as encouraging mixed land usage, improving irrigation schemes, offering crop storage and protection, constructing roads and buildings, and providing credit and marketing opportunities, have been mainly offered to estate farmers, not small farmers. =Social and health= The food crisis made HIV/AIDS orphans in Malawi especially vulnerable to poverty, hunger, etc.Poverty is widespread in Malawi, with 50% of its population living under the poverty line of $2/day according to the World Bank.World Bank 2013 The rural poor were especially vulnerable to the food crisis because they could not afford to buy food when their harvests failed. A 2002 ActionAid report speculates that since 1994, when democracy was established in Malawi, there has been a social shift away from community solidarity. During the 1991/1992 drought, communities banded together and supported one another, giving food and employment to those that needed it. During the 2001/2002 food crisis, however, people's philosophies changed to an \\"anarchic mob justice,\\" an \\"everyone for himself\\" attitude, according to the 2002 ActionAid report. HIV/AIDS in Malawi is widespread: in 2012, the Malawian Government estimated that the disease affected about 17% of urban Malawians and 9% of rural Malawians.Government of Malawi 2012 Households with adults affected by HIV/AIDS and households without adults due to HIV/AIDS have significantly lower agricultural productivity. Not only are those with HIV/AIDS prevented from working the fields, but other people must take care of them and a portion of the household income must go to medication and funerals. Thus, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS has made many Malawians vulnerable during the food crisis.Meera, et al. 2002 During the 2002 famine, 70% of deaths in hospitals were due to HIV/AIDS.Avert 2012 =Ecological= The soil in Malawi is in poor condition due to many farmers' historical inability to afford fertilizer.Hardy 1998 There are few easy solutions to maintaining soil fertility; Malawi is too poor to import organic materials to restore soil nutrients, and land is too scarce to allocate large plots of land to soil restoration. Individual farmers cannot afford fertilizer for their land. Therefore, food production levels are also largely affected by declining soil fertility and land shortages.d shortage in Malawi by changing the climate. As rainfall patterns change and temperatures increase, the length of the productive growing season decreases and farmers must purchase more costly hybrid crops in order to obtain an adequate harvest. Some farmers shifted their maize season from November to December, while others shifted it earlier, in order to handle the changing weather. As aforementioned, the increasing frequency of droughts and floods has made farmers especially vulnerable to food shortages. The rainfall in 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 was sporadic, with recurrent dry spells and floods that prevented sufficient harvests.Lameck 2013 Many farmers, in order to cope with the unpredictable weather, harvested their crops prematurely, which further decreased the crop production in 2001/2002. Furthermore, the changing weather patterns made the methods of predicting crop prediction unreliable; the existing warning systems that predicted crop production based on weather forecasts and regular crop assessments only predicted that a decrease in maize production in the 2001/2002 season would be compensated for by an increase in other crops such as roots and tubers production. However, all crops suffered in the 2001/2002 season. Thus, the government was unprepared for a food crisis in 2002. Response & relief efforts  The Malawian government implemented a fertilizer subsidy program called the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) in 2005, under which the government subsidized fertilizer and seed to vulnerable farmers. Fertilizer was priced at $7 per 50 kg bag, a marked discount from the market price of $27 per 50 kg bag. A study by Michigan State University found that although the erratic rainfalls curbed the program's effectiveness in 2005/2006, improved weather in 2007 allowed the program to flourish and Malawi had a record maize harvest of 3.4 million tons, a surplus of 1.4 million.Jayne, Chapoto, Minde, Donovan 2008 As a result, in 2007, Malawi was able to export maize for profit and donate maize to other countries in need; Zimbabwe imported 40,000 metric tons of maize from Malawi, and Lesotho and Swaziland both received 5,000 metric tons of maize donated by Malawi. International and local NGOS, including the World Food Programme (WFP), the EU, UK, and USAID, donated food to Malawi after it was declared a state of disaster in 2002. In 2005, the WFP estimated that its food aid was feeding 11% of Malawi's population. Long- term effects =Health= The food crisis has made children especially vulnerable to malnutrition and disease. In 2006, UNICEF estimated that 46% of children under five were chronically malnourished and 19% were underweight.UNICEF 2006 Since 1992, when the roots of the food crisis began, children's nutritional status has not changed. In 2001/2002 and 2005/2006, during seasons of severe food shortage, there were large cholera outbreaks throughout the country. UNICEF recognized that the outbreaks were prompted by poor hygiene and unsafe water sources compounded with the food crisis, which made people susceptible to disease. Similarly, a study conducted by Save The Children UK in February 2002 found that the food crisis affected people's health by causing swelling in the hands and feet of both adults and children.Kamowa 2002 The food shortage has resulted in several thousand hunger-related deaths; the exact numbers are unknown. Many of these deaths have further exacerbated the problem of HIV/AIDS, leaving those afflicted by the disease especially vulnerable and also producing a large orphan population. UNICEF estimates that 17% of children do not have living parents due to HIV/AIDS. During the peak of the food crisis, from April to May 2002, the WHO conducted a health assessment in Malawi. It found that between October 2001 and March 2002, there was an average of 1.9 deaths per 10,000 every day. There was a cholera epidemic with 33,150 detected cases and 981 deaths, a fatality rate of 3%. Yet, the number of people seeking aid at health facilities decreased by 25% in that same period. The study suggested that the health facilities were crippled by shortages of staff and drugs and poor communication and transportation systems. As people began to prioritize food security over all else, health and seeking treatment at poorly-maintained health facilities fell to the wayside.WHO 2002 Starving people began to eat unsafe roots, maize cobs, sawdust, and boiled fruits and contracted food poisoning and other stomach illnesses. A report in The Lancet found that many families, even considerably wealthy ones, in Nsanje, a southern district in Malawi, were eating water-lily bulbs called nyika. These bulbs, which used to be considered snack foods but are now staple foods, cause diarrhea if eaten in abundance.Tenthani 2005 In one instance, the eldest son of a family of ten found a collection of poisonous yams. The father gave the children and mother the yams to eat because they had no other food; he did not eat the yams himself because he prioritized his children's hunger and his wife's hunger over his own. The mother and all eight children died, one after another, due to vomiting and food poisoning. =Policy= The government's food security policy, the FISP, has raised agricultural productivity. As aforementioned, maize production surpassed domestic demand after the implementation of FISP. Between 2005 and 2011, Malawi's GDP grew at an average of 11.7% per year, and many experts contributed the agricultural GDP growth to FISP. However, recent studies have suggested that FISP is not a sustainable program: as the number of needy households increase, the amount of fertilizer and seed provided has decreased from 85 kg per farmer in 2005/2006 to 60 kg per farmer in 2012/2013.Pauw and Thurlow 2014 New food security policies were developed in 2002 and 2003. The Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy was a framework policy document intended to direct and inform budget decisions for the central government. At the heart of the policy were economic growth, human capital, safety nets, and governance; by making budget decisions that encouraged agricultural economic growth and create effective safety nets, the government could promote food security and food availability.Sahey 2005 The Ministry of Agriculture collaborated with civil society organizations, other ministries, private companies, and donors to create a Food and Nutrition Security Policy. The policy aimed to: 1) increase food availability by extending irrigation systems and access to fertilizer and land, 2) strengthen the rural market, 3) create a number of health and dietary guidelines and services, and 4) establish and strengthen disaster management plans, the strategic grain reserve, and food production monitoring/predicting systems. Finally, the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development developed a growth strategy policy that would increase access to food by promoting trade and investment in rural Malawi to increase income and employment opportunities. =Culture and society= During the food crisis, people began to change their lifestyles to obtain food. Some have begun taking casual jobs in exchange for food. Many have sold household items and livestock at low prices to purchase food, making it difficult for them to regain stability after the food crisis.TearFund 2010 Some have migrated to Zambia and other neighboring countries to work for low wages or food. The food crisis has also affected education. In some areas, the dropout rate has increased to 25% due to hunger. Many skip school in order to work or search for food, while others can no longer afford the school fees. Some teachers have complained that schools have lost their control over students because they cannot force students to stay, study, or do their homework if they are hungry and sick. UNICEF claims that in some areas where the food crisis is especially severe, one-half to three-quarters of school- aged children have stopped going to school. In response to this drop in school attendance, UNICEF and WFP began implementing programs that fed children in school and provide extra support and materials to teachers and staff. UNICEF reported that the program brought a \\"great improvement\\" in school attendance, in some cases even causing school buildings to overflow with children seeking food. The overall social order has also worsened, as people have begun stealing from their neighbors, abandoning children, fighting for food, and exchanging sex for food. Theft of food and money has become much more common. In some areas, captured thieves are tortured and mutilated as punishment. The elderly, orphans, and women are increasingly vulnerable, not only because it is more difficult for them to provide for themselves, but also because they are bigger targets for theft and violence. In 2005, many women reported being attacked at the ADMARC market when purchasing their allotted 25 kg of maize.Global Policy Forum 2008 The price of sex work has decreased from MK1000 to MK200, heightening the risk for women and girls that must engage in such behaviors at a higher rate to earn money. The social structure of marriage has also changed as a result of the food crisis: many girls were forced to marry young because their families could not support them during the food crisis, leading to an increase in failed and abusive marriages. Other married men and women turned to infidelity to earn money and food, again leading to an increase in failed and abusive marriages. The windmill that William Kamkwamba built.There is a personal account of the famine by William Kamkwamba in his book \\"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind.\\" At the age of 14, Kamkwamba dropped out of school because his family could no longer afford the tuition.Kamkwamba 2012 He began studying electronics in the local library and realized that he could use wind power to supply electricity to his village. His first windmill was used to power light bulbs and charge cell phones; others were used to pump irrigation systems and clean water wells. His story gained national publicity in 2007, from TED talks to The Daily Show, and his windmill projects gained the support of donors from around the world. According to the memoir, the government estimate of famine deaths appears to be severely understated.Moving Windmills Project 2012-2013 food shortage Malawi saw a second food crisis in 2012 and 2013. According to the MVAC National Food Security Forecast, over 1.4 million people in Malawi are to be food insecure in the years of 2013 and 2014. This represents 9.5% of the population over 21 districts, with the conditions in the Northern region being the most dire. Both economic, political and agricultural factors played into this crisis. On the economic and political front, Joyce Banda came into power in April 2012, being the first female president of Malawi. In May of that same year the kwacha was devalued by 49% and heavily depreciated. According to the World Food Programme, this devaluation combined with a 12.4% inflation that same month led to a heavy increase in the price of primary goods and services throughout the country. Furthermore, the Centre for Social Concern released a report stating that the cost of living increased by more than 50% from 2011 to 2012. In terms of agriculture, maize production was down by 40% in many regions due to low rainfall. This low production of maize combined with lowered consumer purchasing power, meant that in 2012, around one million people required assistance to meet their basic food needs. In fact, the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee's projection for 2012 was a 21% increase in the number of vulnerable population due to the food crisis. Inflation combined with this decrease in maize production, meant that the retail prices for maize in 2012 were 40% higher than the five-year average. This is especially detrimental to food security in Malawi because maize is the country's most important and common food crop. The Famine and Early Warning System Network issued a statement claiming that a food emergency in Malawi could occur by July 2012 and have a duration of nine months. Furthermore, according to a study in The Journal of Modern African Studies, many of the lasting effects of previous food crises in Malawi were being felt in 2012. Indeed, many of the causes of the 2002 food crisis such as development and market failures play into the 2012 crisis. This includes the privatization of food production and its distribution system, the removal of farm subsidies, and deregulation. In addition, previous food crises have a serious long term cost due to malnutrition causing reduced manual productivity due to stunting. According to a study, on average 60% of adults suffer from stunting as children which equates to almost 4.5 million people throughout the country suffering from undernutrition. Indeed, the same study by the World Food Programme estimated that MWK 16.5 billion was lost in production output due to malnutrition. This equates to $67 million US dollars.  2015 Food Crisis  Although in 2014, food availability in Malawi was on the rise, farmers fell back into food insecurity in 2015. In 2014, the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC) estimated that 640,009 were food insecure compared to 1.46 million the previous year. This decrease in food insecurity was a result of higher food availability in 2014 due to successful harvests, however it did not last long as due to extreme flooding hit Malawi in 2015. It is estimated that Malawi loses around $12.5 million, or the equivalent of 1% of its GDP each year to drought, and $9 million or 0.7% of its GDP, to flooding in the southern regions of the country. Indeed, Malawi is not new to weather related disasters, between 1970 and 2006, there were over 40 weather related incidents. In 2015 and moving into 2016, Malawi saw a significant drought followed by intense flooding due to El Nino. These droughts were the worst in the past thirty five years with two consecutive failed rainy seasons with farmers having no resources to feed themselves and their families. The effects on the population were detrimental because 90% of the population relied on rain-fed crops and farming to survive. Therefore, on April 13, 2016, President Mutharika declared a state of national disaster following said droughts and flooding. As a result, maize prices saw a drastic increase and became unaffordable for most households. In addition, water availability for consumption farming was severely low making it even harder for farmers to recover. By February of the same year the price of maize was already 60% above the national average of the past three years. According to Action Against Hunger, maize production has decreased by 27% since the 2013, and has fallen by 20% compared to the five year average. These extreme conditions have resulted in people selling their assets to buy food for their families and therefore a widespread state of crisis. According to World Food Programme, four in every ten children suffer from stunting due to the lack of nutrition and food crisis brought on by climate instability. There were many other factors that played into the severity of this crisis such as a lack of formal long term safety nets in Malawi to account for climate variability's effects on farming. Indeed, it is believed that there is a need for policies to assist farmers in adopting strategies to mitigate climate change, such as sustainable farming systems and improved soil fertility. This lack of preparedness was combined with pre-existing vulnerability in the country. According to the World Bank, populations in developing countries are more likely to suffer intense consequences of environmental disasters as loses are measured as a percentage of their GDP. Indeed, the United Nation Development Programme claims that with a lower degree of preparedness, the disaster and aftermath is increasingly destructive. Malawi attempted to mitigate the consequences of this food crisis through purchasing drought insurance. In 2015, Malawi purchased drought insurance for the 2015/2016 farming season from the African Risk Capacity (ACR) insurance company. The insurance cost US$5 million. However, the delayed assistance did not reach Malawians until 2017 thus failed to mitigate the economic loss of the crisis. Action Aid estimates that the 2015 drought cost the country US$395 million. Ongoing crisis Although Malawi implemented the Farm Input Subsidy Programme in 2005, the success of the program was still dependent on rainfall. Further, the technologies used such as synthetic fertilizer and hybrid seeds have led to soil erosion and a debt cycle for farmers. Many other programs have been put in place to help farmer finances and debt such as Agricultural Extension Services, public works programs, and unconditional cash transfers. The National Adaption Plan also hopes to put in place measures to increase agricultural resilience. This goes hand in hand with Malawi's diversification plan that lists its main drivers as poverty, low land availability and strong reliance on natural resources. This plan seeks to address food security, resource management, clean energy, technology and funding in order to improve development, climate change and promote increased stability and security for its population. 2018 saw the price of maize spike multiple times, from 100 Malawi Kwacha (US$0.14) per kilogram to 140 Kwacha ($0.19) per kilogram in 2018. At the same time, maize production in Malawi decreased 20% in 2018. By September 2018, the price of maize was set by the Malawi government at 170 Kwacha ($0.23) per kilogram. On March 14, 2019, the Chief Paramount of Malawi's Karonga District expressed his concern that Karonga would face a maize shortage due to a drought. In March 2019, Malawi was struck by Cyclone Idai. After the devastating floods created by the cyclone, Malawi's Agriculture Minister announced that the country may have lost 20% of the maize it would produce this season.

Ubisoft has released a sequel, Far Cry Instincts: Evolution for the Xbox. Also released was Far Cry Instincts: Predator for the Xbox 360, which contains both Far Cry Instincts and Evolution running in high definition mode. Plot The game follows the story of a man named Jack Carver (voiced by Stephen Dorff). Carver is a former officer in the United States Navy, who was dishonorably discharged following a number of illegal actions. Afterwards, he sets up a shop in Manhattan and began supplying illegal arms to anyone and everyone, until a gang performed a hit using weapons supplied by Jack against a Mafia heir. Consequently, a price was put on his head by the Mob and he was forced to flee the United States and settle in Micronesia. Carver purchased a used boat from a government auction and spent his time ferrying tourists and diving clubs around the area. Eventually, a woman named Valerie Cortez shows up, offering a large sum if Jack would take her to a remote archipelago known as \\"Jacutan\\". Carver accepts, albeit with caution. Upon arriving at Jacutan, Cortez borrows a jet-ski from Jack and heads off on her own. Unworried, Jack decides to nap until she returns. When he awakes, Carver is startled to find UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters flying around his boat. They open fire on him, destroying his boat and force him to take cover inside a nearby wrecked Japanese aircraft carrier. At this point, the player assumes control. After a brief introduction level, the player acquires a headset and is directed by a mysterious voice who calls himself \\"Doyle\\". As it turns out, Cortez is part of the CIA and came to rescue Doyle. Doyle had been on a mission to expose the works of a mad scientist named Dr. Krieger. Krieger, along with his right-hand man, an ex-Apartheid officer named Colonel Richard Crowe, were attempting to develop a serum that would enhance the physical abilities of man and \\"unlock\\" hidden animal traits. Doyle convinces Carver to find and rescue Cortez, who has been captured by Crowe and his mercenaries. While covering Cortez, Carver himself is captured by Crowe on the orders of Doctor Krieger, who notes Carver's resourcefulness and tenacity and decided he would make a good test subject. Carver is injected with the serum and is to be transported to an observation area when he recovers prematurely and escapes and discovers, to his shock, that he has new \\"feral abilities\\", such as increased speed, night vision and a violent melee attack. Along with the feral powers comes an implant designed to regulate the serum's effects and allows for specialized weapons to be used against Carver. Doyle commands Carver to find his way to Doyle's position, so that the implant can be removed. Along the way, Carver has to prevent a mercenary computer programmer from deciphering a pocket PC that belongs to Cortez, which would, in turn, blow Doyle's cover. Descending into an old World War II-era Japanese bunker to stop the decryption, Jack is cornered by the mercenaries as he attempts to escape. He retreats through an old underground mining complex and follows Doyle's instructions to the main research facility. Carver then makes his way to the facility, where he discovers the extent of Krieger's work and the mutant monsters he has created. While in the facility, Carver discovers Crowe is gathering the mutants for an unknown purpose and then later, he finally meets with Doyle, who frees Carver from the implant. Upon having the implant removed, Jack begins to exhibit uncontrolled evolution; in game terms, the adrenaline cost for his abilities decreases and he gains the ability to carry and wield mounted weapons like the .50 caliber machine gun. As Jack escapes the research facility, he discovers that Crowe has taken Doyle and the mutant serum and has unleashed the mutants in a plot to betray Krieger. Jack must fight through the middle of a war between Crowe's mercenaries, the feral mutants and an elite group of special forces under Krieger's personal command, under orders to \\"sanitize\\" Crowe's troops. Rescuing Doyle, Carver discovers that Crowe has injected himself with a quadruple dose of the serum Jack received and without an implant. Assuming control of the \\"Alpha\\" creatures, the most powerful and intelligent mutants with abilities similar to Jack's own, Crowe has gone straight to Kreiger's base of operations. Jack follows and fights his way to Dr. Krieger's mansion atop an active volcano, where he battles and defeats the physically deformed Crowe. Krieger, in a last-ditch effort to use the Alphas against Jack, realizes that they now view Jack as their leader due to his victory over Crowe. The mutants turn on Dr. Krieger and kill him, viewing him as a threat to Jack, and thus allow him to escape as the volcano erupts. Jack is able to retreat onto a Black Hawk piloted by Cortez and Doyle, who promise to pay for a new boat to replace his destroyed one; Doyle also promises that they \\"can do one better\\" and slides a metal case to Jack, who opens it and laughs cryptically at the unseen contents as the helicopter flies away. The game includes subtle thematic elements relating to the dangers of genetic engineering and the genocide of local islanders, as can be seen by the deformed creatures created by Krieger. Also, a mysterious backdrop relating to dinosaurs is revealed via in-game radios that will sometimes carry programs that discuss the history of dinosaurs and the possibility that some might still be alive. This is further developed by appearance of lizard-like animals (which resemble small dinosaurs) that reside in the jungles on the island. The terrain in Far Cry: Instincts varies greatly. Set on a South Pacific archipelago, the landscape includes tropical rainforests, dense jungles, towering canyons, mines, swamps, and even volcanic forests. Features The major gameplay addition to Far Cry: Instincts that was not present in the PC version is the aforementioned \\"Feral Ability\\". There is also a trap system that allows the player to create a booby trap by wrapping a spiked tree branch around nearby foliage. When an unsuspecting NPC walks by, they are killed by the branch-whip. Claymore mines are also available, and can be set up in the paths of enemies for devastating results. These traps can be employed in multiplayer as well. There is also a map editor that allows the player to create their own maps with access to many vehicles, guns, buildings, trees; and the ability to change the landscape. Water can not be added; it is at a constant height and a player can choose whether or not water is accessible by making the land higher or lower. They may upload the maps and use them on Xbox Live to play against friends. Sequel and remakes =Evolution= A sequel to Far Cry Instincts, sharing the same name except for the addition of the subtitle Evolution, was released for the Xbox on March 28, 2006. Evolution includes a new single-player campaign, although it is considerably shorter than the campaign found in the original Far Cry Instincts. The storyline picks up a while after Instincts. Jack is hired by a woman named Kade for an arms deal between pirates and the government in Micronesia. The deal then is under attack by rebels led by a native Chieftain named Semeru, who along with his elite warriors, exhibit the same feral abilities as Jack, who is framed for the attack. After fleeing to a safehouse with Kade, Jack is confronted by Doyle, who is here for damage-control. He offers Jack and Kade amnesty in exchange for their help in destroying a refinery under rebel hands. After successfully doing so, Doyle is wounded and Kade is captured by rebels. Jack saves Doyle due in part to him knowing the way out of the jungle, but while finding transport, Doyle is captured by rebels. After tracking Doyle's blood through the jungle and base built in the forest canopy, Jack finds Doyle dead at the footsteps of a mountain temple. Jack then makes his way through the temple where he encounters Semeru again, who taunts that without focus or devotion, Carver is just a fake with powers he does not deserve. He then captures Jack and reveals that Kade gave him the money from the deal as well as to help kill Jack. Kade then wounds Jack before Semeru attacks him. Jack manages to defeat Semeru, and kills him by impaling him on bamboo rubble. Carver then confronts Kade, who pleads that there was no other way she could save her own life. Instead of killing her however, Jack gives her back the deal money saying \\"Save your tears. In another time I would've done the same. It's all too... human\\". Evolution also includes new weapons and vehicles, as well as an expanded map-maker and an extra multiplayer mode. It is not backward compatible with the Xbox 360, and maps that are created on the Xbox version of 'Instincts' cannot be transferred to the Xbox 360 version. =Predator= Far Cry Instincts: Predator, an Xbox 360 title, was released on the same day as Evolution. It includes graphically enhanced versions of both Far Cry Instincts and Evolution. It featured a map editor in which the player can create maps. Characters on online play are basic clones of Jack Carver but can be edited, the character still has the tattoo \\"Karma\\" on his shooting arm. =Paradise Lost= Paradise Lost is a rail shooter arcade game port of Far Cry Instincts developed by Global VR and published by Ubisoft in 2007. Its light guns are similar to those of Aliens: Extermination. Players use stationary turrets armed with rockets and grenades as power-ups.

The population at the was 9,220 making it the third most populated in the Ballarat urban area. Alfredton is located west of Lake Wendouree along Sturt Street. The suburb has some of Ballarat's best known landmarks including the Arch of Victory, a World War I memorial which once marked the entrance to Ballarat and the start of Ballarat's Avenue of Honour, the longest war memorial roadside plantation in Australia, which extends 18 km to the Western Freeway. Originally part of Cardigan and known by that name, the present area was named in honour of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh following his visit to Ballarat in 1867. The artist and illustrator Will Dyson was born in Alfredton in 1880. The Alfredton area is central to Western Ballarat's growth corridor, an area where suburban development is encouraged by the City of Ballarat and State Government of Victoria. Most of urban Ballarat's subdivision for new housing estates is happening in Greenfield land to the south, north and west of the Avenue of Honour. Large estates include Balymanus, Alfredton Central, The Chase and Insignia. History The Post Office opened on 1 August 1868. Originally part of Cardigan and known by that name, the present area was named in honour of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh following the royal visit to Ballarat in 1867. Urban form and housing While a small section of the original township and main roads are grid plan, the majority of Alfredton's residential areas have been developed under the concepts of street hierarchy with looped streets and culs-de-sac and almost all single-family detached homes. As a result, while the suburban streets are quiet the main roads around Alfredton are particularly busy. Transport The main form of transport in Alfredton is the private motor car and Alfredton can be classed as a car dependent suburb. There are two different urban bus services servicing the suburb, both of which run regularly to the city. Route 10 is from Ballarat Station to Alfredton via Howitt Street and loops around Robertson Drive via Dyson Drive and Cuthberts Road. Route 26 is Ballarat Station to Alfredton via Sturt Street and Cuthberts Road. The suburb is serviced by Ballarat Taxis, a co-operative taxi network. The former Redan Junction railway line servicing the Ballarat Saleyards and the Redan industrial precinct previously bisected the suburb, but this line was closed in 1997. The line has since been completely lifted, though the reservation remains unoccupied. The nearest railway station is Wendouree 3 km to the north.

Etymologist Michael Quinion and others date the expression back to the late 1830s; they and others consider the expression to have been a simple bowdlerization, with, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, an unknown origin. Possible referents Candidate referents for the use date back to at least the 19th century. The following are possibilities of the term's origin. * Euphemism for the devil: H. L. Mencken suggested that the phrase derives from Samiel, the name of the Devil in Der Freisch√ºtz, an opera by Carl Maria von Weber that was performed in New York City in 1825. The phrase \\"Sa' m Hill\\" can also be seen in the variant \\"Samil\\". * Store owner in Arizona: Sam Hill was also a mercantile store owner who offered a vast and diverse inventory of goods. People began using the term \\"what in the Sam Hill is that?\\" to describe something they found odd or unusual, just like the inventory found in Sam Hill's store. The original Sam Hill Mercantile building still stands on Montezuma Street in Prescott, Arizona, and is listed on the register of Historic Places. * Politician in Connecticut: An article in the New England Magazine in December 1889 entitled \\"Two Centuries and a Half in Guilford, Connecticut\\" mentioned that, \\"Between 1727 and 1752 Mr. Sam. Hill represented Guilford in forty-three out of forty-nine sessions of the Legislature, and when he was gathered to his fathers, his son Nathaniel reigned in his stead\\" and a footnote queried whether this might be the source of the \\"popular Connecticut adjuration to 'Give 'em Sam Hill'?\\" * Surveyor in Michigan: A possible origin for the phrase \\"Sam Hill\\" is the surveyor Samuel W. Hill (1819‚Äì1889), associated with the Keweenaw Peninsula area. Hill allegedly used such foul language that his name became a euphemism for swear words. In the words of Charles Eschbach, \\"Back in the 1850s the Keweenaw's copper mining boom was underway. There were about a dozen men who pretty much ran the Keweenaw. They were mining company agents, the 'go between' for the investors from Boston and the actual mining production people. Their names were attached to every report sent back to eastern investors. Among these company agents was a man named Samuel W. Hill. Sam was a geologist, surveyor, and mining engineer and had considerable power in the Keweenaw.\\" According to author Ellis W. Courter, Samuel Hill \\"was an adventurer, explorer, miner, and surveyor. He had worked with Christopher C. Douglas and Douglas Houghton on the early State survey. His judgment was respected. Although he was a rough character, he possessed a big heart and in the fall of 1847 had risked his life to help avert a threatened food shortage in the Copper Harbor district. Generally he was regarded as a hero throughout the entire Copper Country, however, he was contemptuous of all the praise that was heaped upon him. Hill also gained a reputation as being one of the most blasphemous and obscene swearers in the Keweenaw Peninsula. Although he had a colorful vocabulary and told many a good story of his early adventures, his ubiquitous use of lurid cuss words became legendary. Whenever friends or neighbors retold his colorful tales in more polite society, they had to tame his unmentionables by substituting the sinless sounding words 'Sam Hill'. In time the expression, 'What the Sam Hill' spread far beyond the Copper Country. Today it has become a part of the American language. Few who utter these words ever heard of Samuel Hill, or know that he was the unconscious originator of a sinless synonym for profanity.\\" *Adjutant General in Kentucky: Another possibility involves the former adjutant general of Kentucky Samuel Ewing Hill, who was sent by the governor of Kentucky to see what was going on in reference to the Hatfields & McCoys family feud in 1887. Between 1880 and 1891, the feud claimed more than a dozen members of the two families, becoming headline news around the country, and compelling the governors of both Kentucky and West Virginia to call up their state militias to restore order. The governor of West Virginia once even threatened to have his militia invade Kentucky. Kentucky governor Simon Bolivar Buckner in response sent his adjutant general Sam Hill to Pike County, Kentucky, to investigate the situation. Newspapers from around the country awaited word from Hill to find out \\"what in the Sam Hill was going on up there\\". * Non-contender: Millionaire in the Pacific Northwest: The millionaire Samuel Hill, a businessman and \\"good roads\\" advocate in the Pacific Northwest, became associated with the phrase in the 1920s. A reference appeared in Time magazine when Hill convinced Queen Marie of Romania to travel to rural Washington to dedicate Hill's Maryhill Museum of Art. The fact that \\"Father of Good Roads\\" Samuel Hill hadn't been born when the figure of speech first appeared in a publication rules out the possibility that he was the original Sam Hill in question.Words to the Wise: Issue 156, page 2 from the website of the Institute for Etymological Research and Education References Euphemisms ","title":"Sam Hill (euphemism)"},{"id":"2860943","text":"Alma is a town in Victoria, Australia, along the Maryborough - St Arnaud Road, west of Maryborough.

It is now obsolete. History The adoption of the arms was a belated response to a British government request, in 1869, for a design for a flag badge to identify the colony. The laying of the foundation stone of the new parliament building in May 1875 was considered as a good opportunity to introduce it. A Cape Town attorney with a keen interest in heraldry, Charles Aken Fairbridge (1824-1893), was accordingly asked to design arms for the Colony. The foundation stone of the colonial parliament was laid on 12 May 1875. According to the Cape Argus newspaper, \\"among the conspicuous features of the spectacle was the new colonial flag, hoisted aloft above the cornerstone, with the heraldic shielding, surroundings and mottoes blazoned on the Union Jack and the Royal Standard floating in the breeze from the loftiest flagstaff in the centre\\". Queen Victoria formally granted the arms by Royal Warrant a year later, on 29 May 1876.Brownell, F.G. (1993). National and Provincial SymbolsCape of Good Hope Government Gazette dated 5 September 1876 After the Cape became a province of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the provincial administration took over the arms. They were used as provincial arms until the Cape was divided into three smaller provinces in 1994. Blazon The original blazon was: > * Gules, a lion rampant between three annulets Or; on a chief Argent as many > hurts each charged with a fleur de lis of the second [i.e. Or]. * Crest: the > figure of Hope proper vested Azure, resting the dexter arm on a rock and > supporting with the sinister hand an anchor Sable entwined with a cable also > proper. * Supporters: dexter a gnu and sinister an oryx (gemsbok) both > proper. * Motto: SPES BONA. The symbolism of the arms is straightforward. The lion is a South African animal, and also appears in the arms of the two colonial powers which ruled at the Cape, Netherlands and Great Britain. The rings were taken from the arms of the founder of the colony, Jan van Riebeeck. The fleur-de-lis represent the contribution of the Huguenots to the early history of the country. The crest is the Lady of Good Hope, grasping an anchor, first introduced as a symbol of the colony in 1715.A proclamation issued in 1715 made Hope the hallmark for silverware assayed at the Cape. The supporters, a gnu (wildebeest) and an oryx (gemsbok), are two typical South African animals. The motto, \\"Spes Bona\\" simply means \\"Good Hope\\". Version with redesigned crest New artwork was introduced in 1952. Hope's dress was changed to white, and she was given a blue mantle. The arms were recorded in this format the College of Arms in July 1955 and registered at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1967. Bureau of Heraldry.

Mudd was chair of local symphony organizations and art museums. Early life Harvey Mudd was born in Leadville, Colorado, in 1888 to Colonel Seeley W. Mudd, the manager of the Small Hopes silver mine, and Della Mulock Mudd. Harvey had a younger brother, Seeley (1895‚Äì1968), who was a physician and cancer researcher at the California Institute of Technology and then professor and dean at the School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.Nancy M. Shader and Christopher Shannon, \\"Who was Seeley G. Mudd?\\" Princeton University. In 1902, Col. Mudd moved his family to Los Angeles, California,Harvey Mudd Obituary, Caltech Engineering and Science, Volume 18:8, May 1955 where he worked as a consulting engineer for the Guggenheim Exploration Company. In 1907, he developed the Ray mine in Arizona, which is still in production. Harvey attended Stanford University for two years and then transferred to Columbia University, where he received a degree in mining engineering in 1912. Career = Mining = Mudd and his father founded the Cyprus Mines Corporation in 1916. The Los Angeles‚Äìbased enterprise started with development of the copper mines on the island of Cyprus.Harvey Mudd College History In antiquity, Cyprus was a major center for the production of copper, since the second or even third millennium BC. In fact, the Roman name for copper was aes cyprium, from the name of Cyprus in Greek: ŒöœçœÄœÅŒøœÇ, which is read as: Kypros. In later centuries aes cyprium became simply cyprium and then cuprum. This was further transformed and gave the word for copper in European languages, for example copper in English. However, at the time the Mudds began the Cyprus Mines Corp., copper had not been mined on Cyprus for almost 1500 years.\\"CYPRUS: Copper Island\\". Time, March 12, 1956. With the backing of Colonel Seeley Mudd, geologist Charles Godfrey Gunther searched for new copper on Cyprus, but it was twenty years before Cyprus Mines paid its first dividends in 1936. In 1918, Mudd became president of Cyprus Mines Corporation. Mudd became chairman of Cyprus Mines in 1926 when his father died.Joseph B. Platt, Commencement Address at Harvey Mudd College, June 1, 2006 As head of Cyprus Mines, Harvey Mudd developed and managed copper mines in the Mediterranean, as well as an iron mine in Peru and oil properties in the United States. At the time of Harvey Mudd's death in 1955, the company's copper mines on Cyprus had become the island's largest industry, exporting nearly a million tons of copper a year. Mudd's copper mines on Cyprus supported 2,000 of the island's inhabitants and provided more than 25 percent of the island's entire annual revenue. Cyprus Mines paid its employees 15‚Äì20 percent above the island average. The company ran an up-to-date, 65-bed hospital for its employees, built scores of low-cost houses for them to live in, and helped to run schools, sports clubs, welfare centers, and summer camps for their families. Mudd served as president of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers in 1945.American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers website In 1949, the Columbia University Engineering School Alumni Association awarded him its Egleston Medal for distinguished engineering achievement. = Caltech = Mudd became a member of the Board of Trustees for the California Institute of Technology in 1929. He served on the finance and the executive committees and was vice president of the Board of Trustees.Caltech, C.I.T. News In 1954, Caltech faculty member Linus Pauling, upon winning the Nobel Prize in chemistry, sent Mudd a letter thanking him and the Caltech Board of Trustees for \\"providing here an atmosphere, second to none in the world, that is favorable to research.\\"Letter from Linus Pauling to Harvey Mudd, Nov. 30, 1954 Mudd's will left $50,000 to Caltech for research on the genesis of ore deposits. Two geology buildings at Caltech are named for family members. The Seeley G. Mudd Building (South Mudd) is named for his brother, and the Seeley W. Mudd Laboratory (North Mudd) is named for their father.Barclay Kamb, \\"Geophysics and Planetary Science at Caltech,\\" Oct‚ÄìNov 1974 = Civic leadership = At the time of Mudd's death, he was Chairman of the Board of the Southern California Symphony Association, the Welfare Federation of Los Angeles, and Greater Los Angeles Plans, Inc. He was a trustee and former president of the Southwest Museum, a member of the Board of Governors of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and member of the advisory committee of the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery. As Chairman of the Southern California Symphony Association, Mudd is credited with saving the Los Angeles Philharmonic.Mark Swed, \\"The Salonen-Gehry axis,\\" Los Angeles Times, Aug. 31, 2003 Fellow copper baron William Andrews Clark Jr. had founded the Philharmonic in 1919, but he had exhausted his fortune supporting the orchestra. To oversee the Philharmonic, the Southern California Symphony Association was created in 1933 with Mudd as chairman. Mudd personally guaranteed the salary of conductor Otto Klemperer. Mudd led fundraising efforts to enable the Philharmonic to continue performing through the Great Depression. Mudd is also credited with starting the Philharmonic's tradition of taking the stuffiness out of high culture. He was initiated as an honorary member of the Beta Psi chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music, in 1941. = Claremont Colleges = Mudd had a particular interest in The Claremont Colleges in Claremont, California. He served as Chairman of the Board of Fellows of Claremont College, now The Claremont Graduate University and University Center, for a quarter of a century. Harvey Mudd helped in the founding of Claremont McKenna College in 1945. He helped to plan Claremont's new undergraduate college of science and engineering that was chartered in 1955, shortly after his death. He was also Chairman of the Board of Fellows of Claremont College. Personal life Mudd married Mildred Esterbrook (February 21, 1891 ‚Äì August 23, 1958), the daughter of Mary Nichols and Richard Esterbrook (grandson of Richard Esterbrook (1813-1895)), on March 12, 1913. They had two children: Henry T. Mudd (1913‚Äì1990) and Caryll Mudd Sprague (1914‚Äì1978).Mudd family grave marker at Findagrave.com Caryll's husband was Norman F. Sprague, Jr. (1914‚Äì1997), a medical doctor. Henry succeeded his father as head of the Cyprus Mines Corporation. In her youth, Mildred attended the Veltin School for Girls in Manhattan, New York. In her adulthood, she was a social welfare leader. She became involved with the Girl Scouts in 1934 at the recommendation of Lou Henry Hoover, the wife of former U.S. President Herbert Hoover. For three years, beginning in 1934, she was the Los Angeles County Council commissioner of the Girl Scouts. Between 1934 and 1939, Mildred was able to double the enrollment in Los Angeles. She served as the national president of the Girl Scouts by 1938 and from 1939 to 1941.Time magazine, Sep. 8, 1958 She had been the director of the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles by 1938. In 1939, Time magazine described her as \\"Tall, dark, [and] slender\\" and as \\"a typical society matron, noted for her large and lavish parties, her charitable activities, [and] her ancient Roman jewelry (dug up in Cyprus).\\"Time Magazine, Nov 6, 1939. Mudd lived in Beverly Hills on Benedict Canyon Drive. The Tudor style residence was designed for Charles Boldt, owner of the Ohio-based Boldt Glass Co. that produced the popular Mason jars, by architect Elmer Grey in 1922. The residence is on an acre of land with seven bedrooms and a swimming pool. In 2008, the house was listed for sale at a price of $11.495 million. The historic property is known as the Harvey Mudd Estate. As of October 2013, this house is for sale again, asking price is $19.99 million. Mudd died of a heart attack on April 12, 1955, at his home in Beverly Hills, California. He was 66 years old. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.Findagrave.com Mildred Mudd died three years later at the age of 67. Harvey Mudd College After Mudd's death in 1955, Mildred Mudd supported the founding later that year of the planned undergraduate college of science and engineering college at Claremont, which would be named for him. Mildred and family members contributed $2 million to endow Harvey Mudd College,\\"Education: The Rise of Harvey Mudd,\\" Time magazine, Sep. 8, 1958 which awards degrees in science and engineering.

The origins of the legislature of Jersey lie in the system of self-government according to Norman law guaranteed to the Channel Islands by John, King of England, following the division of Normandy in 1204. The States Assembly has exercised uncontested legislative powers since 1771, when the concurrent law-making power of the Royal Court of Jersey was abolished. The Assembly passes and amends laws and regulations; approves the annual budget and taxation; appoints and removes the Chief Minister, ministers, presidents and members of committees; debates matters proposed by the Council of Ministers, by ministers or by individual members. Members are also able to ask questions to find out information and to hold ministers to account. Executive powers are exercised by a Chief Minister and nine ministers, elected from among the members of the Assembly and known collectively as the Council of Ministers. Ministers are accountable to the assembly for the conduct of their departments. Composition The constitution of the States is set out in the States of Jersey Law 2005. It is a unicameral parliament. In the current assembly, elected voting members comprise eight Senators (elected on an island-wide basis), twenty-nine Deputies (elected to represent single- or multi-member constituencies), and twelve Conn√©tables (head of each parish \\"who are members of the States by virtue of their office\\"). In previous assemblies, the number of Senators was ten. The reduction in the number of Senators was politically controversial and attempts were made, unsuccessfully, to prevent the Privy Council from approving the proposal.; There are also five non-voting members appointed by the Crown:States of Jersey Law 2005, Article 1 http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce/htm/LawFiles/2005/l-08-2005.htm#_Toc88473877 * the Bailiff‚Äìwho is the President (presiding officer); in his absence, the Deputy Bailiff or the Greffier, Deputy Greffier or an elected member presides * the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey‚Äìwho regularly attends the States but by convention only speaks at the ceremonial sittings marking his appointment and leaving office * the Dean of Jersey‚Äìwho conducts the opening prayers in French at every sitting and who may speak on any issue * the Attorney General‚Äìthe principal legal adviser to the States who may be called on to provide legal advice during sittings * the Solicitor General‚Äìthe Attorney General's deputy.

During the 2008‚Äì2011 assembly, 17 members sat on scrutiny panels, six sit only on the Planning Applications panel or the Privileges and Procedures Committee; and seven had no role other than as a member. Following widespread criticisms of the system of ministerial government introduced in December 2005, the assembly of the States of Jersey agreed in March 2011 to establish an independent electoral commission to review the make-up of the Assembly and government.Minutes of the States of Jersey, 15 March 2011 http://www.statesassembly.gov.je Elections are held every three years, with the most recent being in 2018. In the 2008‚Äì2011 assembly, four members were affiliated to the Jersey Democratic Alliance,; but three of them subsequently left the party and continued to sit as independents. In the 2011 elections, all candidates stood as independents. In the 2014 elections, candidates stood for the newly formed Reform Jersey for the first time, with 3 being elected as Deputies. Legislative functions A main type of legislation made by the States is known in English simply as a 'Law', and in French as a Loi (not an 'Act' as in the United Kingdom‚Äîin Jersey an Act or Acte of the States is an administrative enactment and may be in the nature of secondary legislation). After a Law is adopted by the States it must receive Royal Assent and be registered with the Royal Court of Jersey before it is 'passed'.  Scrutiny functions  Members of the Assembly are responsible for scrutinizing the work of the Council of Ministers, ministers and their departments. Scrutiny panels of backbench members of the assembly have been established to examine * economic affairs, * environment, housing and infrastructure * corporate services, * education and home affairs and * health, social security and housing. A Public Accounts Committee (PAC) also scrutinizes the spending of public finances. The real utility of the panels is said to be \\"that of independent critique which holds ministers to account and constructively engages with policy which is deficient\\". History Royal coat of arms (Hanoverian) on the States building in St. Helier The legislature derives its name from the estates (French: √©tats) of the Crown (represented by the Bailiff and Jurats), the Church (the rectors of the parishes) and the people (represented by the Conn√©tables) from whom the assembly was originally summoned. Jersey's political history begins as part of the Duchy of Normandy. However when the King of France stripped King John of England of the title ‚ÄòDuke of Normandy‚Äô the people of Jersey and the other Channel Islands rebelled against the French King maintaining the sovereignty of the 'rightful' Duke. In 1259 Henry III signed the Treaty of Paris resigning his claim to the Duchy of Normandy except the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands were not absorbed into the Kingdom of England but two offices were appointed; Warden (now Lieutenant Governor) and Bailiff. 1771 Code of LawsOriginally the Royal Court had legislative power but by the sixteenth century a legislative assembly within the Royal Court was convened. The Royal Court and the States both legislated until with the fixing in 1771 of the Code des Lois it was established that the States had a legislative monopoly. The earliest extant Act of the States dates from 1524. The States are mentioned in a document of 1497 regarding the endowments of the grammar schools; by 1526 attendance by members at the assembly was evidently a requirement, as in that year the Rector of Saint Mary was fined for failure to attend.Balleine's History of Jersey, Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) In the early seventeenth century separate minutes of the States of Jersey were first recorded. When the monarchy was restored, King Charles II who had escaped to Jersey on his way to exile in France rewarded Jersey with the power to levy customs duties. This power, exercised by the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats, was finally taken over by the States of Jersey in 1921, thereby enabling the States to control the budget independently of the Lieutenant Governor. The States voted on 6 November 1856 to adopt a law to add 14 Deputies to the assembly to counterbalance the mismatch of population and voting power between town and country. The first Deputies were elected 12 January 1857. The first election by secret ballot was held 1 December 1891. √âtats de Jersey and arms on the original terminal building of Jersey Airport built by the States in 1937 Until the constitutional reforms brought about in 1948 to strengthen the separation between legislature and judiciary, Jurats were the senior politicians, elected for life by islandwide suffrage, and were the presidents of committees and sat in the Royal Court. In 1948 the Jurats were replaced in the legislature by Senators, who at first were elected on an island-wide basis for mandates of 9 years (subsequently reduced to 6 years). The rectors were also removed from the States in 1948 (with the exception of the Dean as Rector of St. Helier, who remained but lost his vote), and replaced by an increased number of Deputies. The urban-rural cleavage which successive reforms have attempted to address remains. The less populated rural parishes enjoy an electoral advantage over the densely populated urban parishes due to the inequity of the distribution of seats when compared to population. A report produced under the chairmanship of Sir Cecil Clothier proposed a range of administrative reforms aimed at improving the machinery of government, including ending the distinction between Senators and Deputies, the removal of the Constables from the States and the removal of the Bailiff. Under the proposals, all members of the States would have the title Member of the States of Jersey (MSJ).Report of the Review Panel on the Machinery of Government in Jersey, 21 December 2000 This was rejected, although proposals to revive it were made by Deputy Geoff Southern in 2013.Jersey deputy plans to have one type of politician, BBC News, 19 August 2013 Other aspects of the report, especially concerning the r√¥le of Conn√©table, met with intense opposition at public meetings in the parishes. The ministerial system has been introduced in an amended form to that proposed by Clothier. The system of executive government was changed significantly by the States of Jersey Law 2005. States Chamber The States sat in the Royal Court until 1887 when the States Chamber was constructed adjacent to the Royal Court. The chamber is in Jacobean style, with the benches arranged in horseshoe form around the twin seats of the Bailiff and Lieutenant Governor. The Bailiff's seat is raised slightly higher than that of the Lieutenant Governor to demonstrate his precedence. Senators sit to the left of the Bailiff, then the Conn√©tables, and then the Deputies filling up the benches to the right. The States Chamber is depicted on the 2010 issue Jersey 20 pound note. Broadcasting BBC Radio Jersey broadcasts the main States sittings live on their medium wave frequency 1026 mW in Jersey, replacing the normal BBC Radio Jersey output which is a straight mirror of the FM output. The raw feed of the States members talking is provided by the States of Jersey and goes through a desk in the BBC Radio Jersey Studio in the States Chamber where it is mixed by the States Reporter on duty that day. Broadcasting of the States debates began experimentally on 30 September 1986 and was made a permanent feature on 25 November the same year. Since December 2005 the States of Jersey have released a complete written record of everything that members say during question time, statements and debates in the States Assembly using Hansard, similar to the UK parliament. These transcriptions are available on the States of Jersey website. On 15 July 2015 the States Assembly voted 31 in favour and 13 against a proposal that cameras would be installed in the States Chamber in order to provide a live and on-demand video stream through the States Assembly web site. The video feed will also be provided to the media.

For his resistance to the Abbasid Caliphate, Mazyar is considered one of the national heroes of Iran by twentieth-century Iranian nationalist historiography. His name means \\"protected by the yazata of the moon\\".  Origin  Mazyar belonged to the Qarinvand dynasty, which was descended from Sukhra, a powerful magnate from the House of Karen, who was the de facto ruler of the Sasanian Empire from 484 to 493. However, due to his great influence and power, he was exiled and executed by the Sasanian king Kavadh I (r. 488‚Äì496 & 498‚Äì531). Sukhra was survived by eight sons, one of them being Karin, who in return for aiding Kavadh I's son and successor Khosrow I (r. 531‚Äì579) against the Western Turkic Khaganate in the 550s, received land to the south of Amol in Tabaristan, thus starting the Qarinvand dynasty.  Accession, flight, and rise to power  Mazyar succeeded his father Qarin ibn Vindadhhurmuzd in ca. 817. However, his territories were soon invaded by the neighbouring Bavandid ruler Shahriyar I, who defeated Mazyar and forced him to flee. Mazyar took refuge with his cousin Vinda-Umid, who betrayed him and handed him over to Shahriyar. However, Mazyar managed to escape and reach the court of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun. There he met one of his astrologers, Yahya ibn al-Munajjim, a Persian who had recently converted to Islam and belonged to the Banu Munajjim family. Mazyar soon also embraced Islam, and al-Ma'mun gave him the title of \\"Servant of the Commander of the Faithful\\" (mawlƒÅ amƒ´r al-mu æminƒ´n) and the Muslim name of Abu'l-Hasan Muhammad. Mazyar was also granted two towns of Ruyan and Damavand in Tabaristan as his fief, and was named as the co-governor of Tabaristan with the Abbasid statesman Musa ibn Hafs. In 822/3, Mazyar returned to Tabaristan with Abbasid reinforcements, and began to deal with his enemies‚Äîhe had his brother Quhyar exiled, and did the same to Shahriyar I's son Qarin I, who was his nephew. In 825/6, Mazyar invaded the domains of the Bavandids, and captured Shahriyar's son and successor, Shapur. His uncle, Vinda-Umid, was also defeated, and shortly afterwards killed. Mazyar thus united the highlands under his own rule. He then assumed the titles of Gil-Gilan, Ispahbadh, and Padishkhwargarshah, all titles used by the 8th-century Dabuyid king of Tabaristan, Farrukhan the Great (r. 712-728).  Reign  =Early rule as Ispahbadh of Tabaristan= Map of northern Iran Shapur, knowing that Mazyar planned to have him killed, sent a secret message to Musa, willing to pay him 100,000 dirhams if he would assert him as his own prisoner. Musa responded by saying his best shot would be to convert to Islam and become a client of the caliph. Musa, nervous of Mazyar learning of his secret communication with Shapur, asked him how he would react if Shapur converted to Islam and offered to become a client of the caliph. Mazyar gave no answer, but had Shapur beheaded the same day, which greatly angered Musa. Mazyar, fearful of the consequences of having Shapur killed without consensus, apologized to Musa. Mazyar now began constructing mosques in several towns, and successfully plundered the territories of the Daylamites, and had a large number of them resettled in the border place of Muzn. In 826/7, Musa died and was succeeded by his son Muhammad ibn Musa, to whom Mazyar paid no attention. Mazyar continued to expand his influence, but his policies were regarded by the Muslims of Tabaristan as oppressive. The Muslims of Tabaristan and the Bavandid prince Qarin I now began complaining to al-Ma'mun about Mazyar's behavior, but did not manage to turn al-Ma'mun against Mazyar. After al-Ma'mun became involved in a war against the Byzantine Empire, Mazyar used the opportunity to imprison Muhammad ibn Musa on the charge of being secretly involved with the Alids. Al-Ma'mun soon acknowledged Mazyar's rule over Tabaristan and its surrounding regions. When al-Ma'mun died in 833, he was succeeded by his half-brother al-Mu'tasim, who also acknowledged Mazyar as the ruler of Tabaristan. However, when the Tahirid ruler Abdallah ibn Tahir demanded the payment of the land tax (kharaj) from Mazyar, the latter refused. Abdallah, claiming Tabaristan as his own fief, then demanded that Mazyar should release Muhammad ibn Musa. Mazyar, however, once again refused to obey Abdallah, and the latter went before al-Mu'tasim to accuse Mazyar of infidelity and tyranny. = Rebellion = Feeling threatened, Mazyar rebelled against the Abbasid Caliphate, an act which was widely supported by the native Zoroastrians, who began plundering the Muslim villages and the Abbasid- controlled border regions. Mazyar tried to secure the loyalty of the noblemen of Tabaristan and imprisoned anyone he did not trust. According to the medieval historian Ibn Isfandiyar in his Tarikh-e-Tabaristan, Mazyar is said to have proclaimed: Abdallah and al-Mu'tasim sent five armies that entered Tabaristan from all sides. Mazyar named his brother Quhyar as the defender of the Qarinvand mountains, and the Bavandid Qarin I as the defender of eastern Tabaristan. However, Tabaristan fell quickly to the Abbasid invasion: several cities were taken by surprise, while Qarin I betrayed Mazyar and agreed to aid the Abbasids in exchange for being restored as the ruler of his family's domains. The people of Sari revolted against Mazyar, and Mazyar was betrayed by his brother Quhyar, who captured him and surrendered him to al-Mu'tasim. Mazyar was brought to Samarra, where he was executed. His body later was gibbeted along with the body of Babak Khorramdin. Mazyar's brother Quhyar was shortly after killed by his own Daylamite soldiers because of his betrayal of Mazyar. This marked the end of the Qarivand dynasty. This left the Tahirids as the rulers of Tabaristan, and Qarin I was restored as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty as a vassal.

From 1997 to 2004, he was the lead singer of rock band Soil. McCombs has also served as the vocalist for alternative metal band Drowning Pool from 2005 until his departure in 2011; he was the longest-serving vocalist for the band at the time of his departure. In 2011, McCombs reunited with Soil. Career =Soil (1997‚Äì2004)= McCombs was discovered by Soil through a compilation CD of unsigned bands. He joined the rock band Soil as lead vocalist in mid-1997. The band has released three albums and two EP's during his time in the group: Soil (EP), El Chupacabra (EP), and Throttle Junkies, Scars and Redefine.

Their 2004 follow-up would continue Soil's significant exposure. While touring for their latest album, McCombs suddenly decided to leave the band, which caused the cancellation of many scheduled performances alongside acts like Sevendust and Damageplan. =Drowning Pool (2005‚Äì2011)= After his departure, McCombs took a hiatus from the music business. His hiatus only lasted one year, by the time he returned to music, Soil had already found a new lead singer.

Croaker is an unincorporated community in James City County, Virginia, United States on the south bank of the York River 10 miles downstream from West Point. The York River is formed from the confluence of the Mattaponi River and the Pamunkey River at West Point. The York River empties into the Chesapeake Bay about 30 miles downstream from Croaker. The name \\"Croaker\\" is believed to have derived from the abundant quantity of Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), an inshore, bottom-dwelling fish found in the Chesapeake Bay at the mouth of the York River. The town of Croaker was known in its early history as Taskinas Plantation, then Hollywood (due to the many holly trees). \\"Taskinask\\" was designated by the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730 as the site public tobacco warehouse where local planters stored their crops to be shipped to England. Croaker had several stores, two schools, a church, and several houses by the early 20th century. Some of the shopkeepers who established a presence before 1950 were members of the Garrett family. Garrett's Grocery opened in 1909 and was run by five generations of the family until its closing on December 31, 2013. Croaker General Store took over the building and opened up on May 25, 2015.

In addition to the Free County of Burgundy (present-day administrative region of Franche-Comt√©), the Burgundian Circle roughly covered the Low Countries, i.e., the areas now known as the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg and adjacent parts in the French administrative region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The circle's territorial scope was reduced considerably in the 17th century with the secession of the Seven United Provinces in 1581 (recognized 1648) and the annexation of the Free County of Burgundy by France in 1678. The occupation and subsequent annexation of Imperial territory to the west of the Rhine river by Revolutionary France in the 1790s effectively brought an end to the circle's existence.  Composition  After the 1548 Diet of Augsburg, the circle was made up of the following territories: = Seventeen Provinces = # the County of Artois, ceded by France in 1493, annexed by France in 1659. # the Duchy of Brabant, including the Margraviate of Antwerp. # the County of Drenthe, which seceded to form part of the United Provinces from 1579. # the County of Flanders. # the Lordship of Frisia, which seceded to form part of the United Provinces from 1579. # the Lordship of Groningen which is a grouping of the former Ommelanden, which seceded to form part of the United Provinces from 1579, and the City of Groningen, which joined the United Provinces in 1594. # the Duchy of Guelders, which, with the exception of Upper Guelders, seceded to form part of the United Provinces from 1579. # the County of Hainaut. # the County of Holland, which seceded to form part of the United Provinces from 1579. # the Duchy of Limburg, held by the Dukes of Brabant. # the Duchy of Luxembourg. # the Lordship of Mechelen, a personal lordship of the Duke of Burgundy. # the County of Namur. # the Lordship of Overijssel, which seceded to form part of the United Provinces from 1579. # the Prince-Bishopric, later Lordship of Utrecht, which seceded to form part of the United Provinces from 1579. # the County of Zeeland, held by the Counts of Holland; seceded to form part of the United Provinces from 1579. # the County of Zutphen, held by the Dukes of Guelders; seceded to form part of the United Provinces from 1579. = County of Burgundy = # the Free County of Burgundy and # the Imperial City of Besan√ßon both annexed by France according to the 1678 Treaty of Nijmegen. The Prince-bishopric of Li√®ge remained a part of the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle until its dissolution in 1795.  History  The Imperial Seventeen Provinces emerged from the Burgundian Netherlands ruled in personal union by the French Dukes of Burgundy. Most of them had been fiefs of the Holy Roman Empire on the territory of Lower Lorraine, except for Flanders and Artois. In 1477 they fell to the House of Habsburg. In 1363 the French king John II of Valois enfeoffed his youngest son Philip the Bold with the Duchy of Burgundy (Bourgogne). Philip in 1369 married Margaret of Dampierre, only child of Count Louis II of Flanders (d. 1384), whose immense dowry not only comprised Flanders and Artois but also the Imperial County of Burgundy. He thereby became the progenitor of the House of Valois-Burgundy who systematically came into possession of different Imperial fiefs: his grandson Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy from 1419, purchased Namur in 1429, inherited the duchies of Brabant and Limburg from his cousin Philip of Saint-Pol in 1430. In 1432 he forced Jacqueline of Wittelsbach to cede him the counties of Hainaut and Holland with Zeeland according to the Treaty of Delft and finally occupied Luxembourg, exiling Duchess Elisabeth of G√∂rlitz in 1443. Emperor Maximilian I and the coat of arms of the Burgundian provinces, wall fresco at the V√∂cklabruck City Tower, 1502 The Burgundian realm then bore a faint resemblance to the early medieval Lotharingia, it however fell suddenly with the death of the ambitious Charles the Bold. In 1473 he had made an agreement with Emperor Frederick III of Habsburg according to which he would marry his daughter Mary the Rich to the Emperor's son Archduke Maximilian I of Austria in exchange for the elevation of his Imperial territories to a \\"Kingdom of Burgundy\\", co-equal to the French kingdom of his Valois cousins. The Prince- electors, however, forestalled these plans, and the deprived Duke Charles started a desperate campaign against the Duchy of Lorraine and was killed at the 1477 Battle of Nancy. To secure her heritage against King Louis XI of France, his daughter Mary nevertheless married Maximilian in the same year. The Archduke defeated the French troops at the 1479 Battle of Guinegate and by the 1493 Treaty of Senlis annexed the Seventeen Provinces ‚Äì including the French fiefs of Flanders and Artois ‚Äì for the House of Habsburg. The sovereignty finally passed to the Empire in the Treaty of Cambrai in 1529. The Duchy of Burgundy proper was seized as a reverted fief by the French crown. Maximilian's grandson and successor, Emperor Charles V of Habsburg eventually won the Guelders Wars and united all seventeen provinces under his rule, the last one being the Duchy of Guelders in 1543. The Burgundian treaty of 1548 shifted the seventeen provinces from the Lower Rhenish‚ÄìWestphalian Circle to the Burgundian circle, resulting in a significant territorial gain for the latter and increased tax obligation. The Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 determined that the Provinces should remain united in the future and inherited by the same monarch. After Charles V's abdication in 1556, his realms became divided between his son, King Philip II of Spain, and his brother, Emperor Ferdinand I. The Seventeen Provinces went to his son Philip. Conflicts between Philip II and his Dutch subjects led to the Eighty Years' War, which started in 1568. The seven northern provinces gained their independence as a republic called the Seven United Provinces. They were: # the Lordship of Groningen and of the Ommelanden # the Lordship of Friesland # the Lordship of Overijssel # the Duchy of Guelders (except its upper quarter) and the county of Zutphen # the prince-bishopric, later lordship of Utrecht # the county of Holland # the county of Zeeland The southern provinces ‚Äì Flanders, Brabant, Namur, Hainaut, Luxembourg and so forth ‚Äì were restored to Spanish rule thanks to the military and political talent of the Duke of Parma, especially at the siege of Antwerp (1584-1585). Hence, these Provinces became known as the Spanish Netherlands or the Southern Netherlands. The northern Seven United Provinces kept parts of Limburg, Brabant and Flanders during and after the Eighty Years' War (see Generality Lands), which ended with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Artois, and parts of Flanders and Hainaut were ceded to France in the course of the 17th and 18th century.

Note that \\"Major\\" was a given name, not a military rank. His international career was restricted to the 1913‚Äì14 tour of South Africa, which was the last Test match tour before the First World War. After receiving a commission in the West Yorkshire Regiment, Booth became Second Lieutenant Major Booth, and died just under a year later when he went over the top on the trenches on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Somme offensive. After his death his sister would light a candle in his room every night in the hope that he would return. Cricket career Booth's earliest cricket was played at Fulneck School, and later he was associated with Pudsey St. Lawrence and the Wath Athletic Club, which played in the Mexborough League, and of which he was captain. He appeared regularly for Yorkshire Second Eleven in 1907 and the two following seasons, and in 1908 received his first trial for the county against Somerset at Dewsbury without success. He did not, however, secure a regular place in the team until two years later, but in 1911 he scored 1,125 runs for his county and took seventy- four wickets, with a highest innings of 210 against Worcestershire on the Worcester ground. Booth increased his reputation as a bowler in the following summer, and in 1913 made over a thousand runs and took 158 wickets for Yorkshire, whilst his aggregate of 181 wickets in first-class matches was the highest of any bowler that season. In 1914 he was not so successful in batting ‚Äì it was said during the 1913 season that he should concentrate on bowling as his build was not ideal for hard work ‚Äì but he obtained 141 wickets for Yorkshire at a cost of 18 runs apiece. Although a fine punishing batsman, Booth's claim to fame will rest chiefly upon what he accomplished as a bowler. Possessed of a free, natural action, he made the ball come quickly off the pitch. On occasion his off-break was quite formidable, but his strong points were swerve and pace off the ground.Booth's Obituary in the 1917 John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanac =Notable feats= His best feats with the ball may be summarised thus: *8‚Äì47, Yorkshire v. Middlesex, at Leeds 1912 *8‚Äì52, Yorkshire v. Leicestershire, at Sheffield 1912 *8‚Äì64, Yorkshire v. Essex, at Leyton 1914 *8‚Äì86, Yorkshire v. Middlesex, at Sheffield: 1913 *7‚Äì21, Yorkshire v.

Kent, at Sheffield 1914 In two consecutive matches in August 1914, he and Drake bowled unchanged throughout, Gloucestershire being dismissed for 94 and 84 at Bristol and Somerset for 44 and 90 at Weston-super-Mare. In the second innings of the latter match Booth had the very rare experience of bowling throughout without obtaining a wicket, Drake taking all ten for 35 runs. In 1913 Booth was chosen for the Players at Lord's, and during 1913‚Äì14 toured South Africa with MCC's team under Douglas' captaincy. His doings abroad were somewhat disappointing, and so strong was the side that he was left out of three of the Test matches. In the 144 games in which he appeared for Yorkshire Booth scored 4,213 runs with an average of 22.65 and obtained 556 wickets for 18.89 runs each. Tall of stature, good-looking, and of engaging address, Booth was a very popular figure both on and off the cricket field. Booth was brought up at Town End House near the Britannia Inn at Pudsey. He was the best man at Roy Kilner's wedding and the latter named a son after him. There is a memorial tablet in St Lawrence Church in memory of him.  Football career  Booth had a short football career with Bradford City and Doncaster Rovers.

It occurs in phosphorite deposits and forms encrustations on old bones. It may result from runoff of fields which have received heavy fertilizer applications. Associated minerals include tanarakite, ardealite, hydroxylapatite, variscite and gypsum. Brushite is the original precipitating material in calcium phosphate kidney stones. It is also one of the minerals present in dental calculi.

The CCR collected data from suppliers, validated and stored this data, and disseminated it to various government acquisition agencies. On July 30, 2012, the CCR transitioned to the System for Award Management (SAM) e-procurement system. History In October 1993, President Bill Clinton issued a memorandum that required the Government to reform its acquisition processes. Subsequently, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 was passed, requiring the establishment of a \\"single face to industry\\". To accomplish this, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) designated a centralized, electronic registration process, known as CCR, as the single point of entry for vendors that want to do business with the DoD. To this end, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Subpart 204.7300, required contractors to register in the CCR to conduct business with the DoD. A new Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) policy, published October 1, 2003 (Circular 2003-016, FAR case 2002-018), requires that all federal contractors register in the CCR database prior to the awarding of any contract or purchase agreement. The CCR and Business Partner Network (BPN) maintained 99.98% uptime. Most user issues stem from DoD mandated security controls or the user's network and/or ISP's not following RFC standards for Internet protocols. July 24, 2012 began Phase I of a consolidation of federal government systems used for contracting to SAM (System for Acquisition Management). On that date, users were no longer permitted to enter new information into the CCR or the other systems being migrated in Phase I to allow sufficient time for their data to be migrated to SAM. After July 30, 2012, users who visited the CCR, ORCA, or EPLS websites are automatically redirected to SAM.gov. The contractors providing services to DoD are required to file reports on the funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts through a separate ECMRA website.Memorandum on the Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application issued by the Office of the Secretary of Defence on 28 November 2012. Transition to SAM On July 30, 2012, the CCR transitioned to the System for Award Management (SAM), which combined legacy users' records in the CCR and eight other separate websites and databases that aided in the management of Federal procurement from start to finish. This consolidation SAM was designed to \\"reduce the burden on those seeking to do business with the government.\\" In addition to eliminating redundancies and streamlining processes, SAM provides a single help desk to resolve issues with any of the databases. =Systems included in SAM= The systems combined into SAM are listed below, grouped by functional area. Their migration to SAM is being conducted in phases: Phase I of SAM includes the functionality from the entity management systems - Central Contractor Registry (CCR), Federal Agency Registration (Fedreg), Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) - and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). =SAM users and registrants= Users of SAM include contracting officials, grant-makers, contractors, and the public. Those required to register in SAM include: * Vendors: Those doing business with the federal government \\"will be able to log in to one system to manage their entity information in one record, with one expiration date, through one streamlined business process.

Contrary to the stereotype of Han eunuchs being corrupt and power-hungry, he was loyal to the imperial family and tried (unsuccessfully) to counter the culture of corruption. Contribution to Emperor Shun's restoration During Emperor An's reign, those close to him, including the eunuchs Jiang Jing () and Li Run () and his wet nurse Wang Sheng (), as well as his wife Empress Yan Ji, effectively ran the imperial administration, and used the opportunity to seize power and wealth for themselves. In 124, Jiang and Empress Yan accused the nine-year-old Crown Prince Liu Bao () of crimes and persuaded Emperor An to demote him to Prince of Jiyin. In 125, Emperor An died suddenly, and even though Prince Bao was Emperor An's only son, Empress Yan, evidently wanting someone younger she could control, made Liu Yi (), the Marquess of Beixiang, emperor. When the young emperor became gravely ill later in the year, Sun, who was then a mid-level eunuch, became concerned that Empress Dowager Yan would again bypass Prince Bao, the rightful heir, and so he entered into a conspiracy with a number of other eunuchs. They swore an oath to restore Prince Bao, and several days after the former Marquess of Beixiang died, they made a sudden assault on the palace and proclaimed Bao as Emperor Shun. After several days of battling with the empress dowager's faction, the eunuchs led by Sun prevailed, and the Yan clan was slaughtered. For their contributions to his restoration, Emperor Shun created Sun and 18 of his fellow eunuchs marquesses. Failed attempt to guide Emperor Shun onto the right path Emperor Shun, whose temperament was weak, quickly fell under the control of the officials around him. In 126, when the eunuch Zhang Fang () was accused of corruption by the governor of the capital district, Yu Xu (), he instead convinced the emperor that the accusations were false and that Yu should be sentenced to death. Sun and Zhang Xian (), another eunuch who had helped put the emperor on the throne, interceded at great personal risk. Yu was spared, while Zhang was exiled. However, officials who were close to Zhang then accused Sun and his fellow eunuch-marquesses of being overly arrogant. Emperor Shun therefore sent them out of the capital Luoyang, to their estates. Sun, angered by this, had his marquess seal and emblems returned to the emperor and secretly stayed in the capital, looking to find another chance to try to guide the emperor onto the right path. He was soon captured, but Emperor Shun, remembering his accomplishments, simply sent him back to his estate without further punishment, but also without listening to his advice on stamping out corruption. Later in life In 128, Emperor Shun, remembering what Sun and the others had done for him, summoned them back to the capital, but largely again ignored their advice.

The series, was first published in the August 1984 issue of Balarama. Artist M. Mohandas gradually took over the drawing of the series after Balarama became a fortnightly. Mayavi, the protagonist in the series, is a tooth fairy, who helps to keep the forest safe from villains and dark wizards. Most of the stories revolve around how a dark wizard Kuttusan and his cadre of wizards aim at capturing Mayavi, but fail with drastic consequences. Mayavi takes place in a secluded forest in Kerala. It is not exactly known when the story takes place. In the local language Malayalam Mayavi translates as illusionist. As the target audience is young, the story takes the liberty to draw a fantasy world, in which wizards, demons and other strange creatures exist. However, despite the simplicity and slapstick comedy, Mayavi became one of the most widely read children's comics in Malayalam language. Characters Mayavi, a good imp, is the main character of the story. Mayavi was a slave of the witch Dagini, and she was very cruel to him. Two kids, Raju and Radha helps the imp escape from the bottle in which he was kept. Thankful to the children, Mayavi decided to help them forever from the clutches of evil forces. Dagini pledged to take revenge on the children and re-capture Mayavi. The comics pictures him staying alone in a forest without any notable family. Mayavi is loathed by the evil creatures and villains of the forest. Robbers who often take refuge in the forest to hide are brought to light by Mayavi. Apart from the power of invisibility, Mayavi is not known to possess any magical powers, but derives them from his red wand. This handicap has been one of the prominent vulnerabilities that are often exploited by the dark wizards who try to capture him. Once his wand is lost, his imp characteristics command him to be enslaved in a glass bottle by the one who holds his wand. Mayavi has a hobby of sleeping under trees. =Raju and Radha= Raju and Radha are siblings with benefits of Mayavi. The children are depicted as roaming about in the forest. They befriend Mayavi after helping him to escape from the witch Dagini, who had enslaved him in a bottle. The children are often imprisoned by Kuttusan and Dagini in a bid to lure Mayavi and thereby trap him. Another common storyline is one in which the children overhear the planning or execution of some dastardly crime. In such situations the children summon Mayavi using the spell \\"Om hreem kutichathaa\\" . =Kuttusan= Dakinies husband (1st 2 out of 4)A dark wizard who lives in a hollow tree trunk in the same forest, Kuttusan is one of the main villains in the comic. The storyline depicts capturing Mayavi as the sole purpose of Kuttusan's life. He often goes out of the way, befriending beasts and other dangerous dark creatures in order to satisfy his aim. However, his clumsiness in handling matters related to magic, eventually leads him into trouble. His stupidity and stubbornness is a frequent source of humor in the comic. =Dakini= Dakini, a witch, appeared in the series well before Kuttusan, is one of the close aides of Kuttusan. However, despite being a witch, she is often depicted as taking a rather repulsive approach to Kuttusan's wizardry. She is noted as much for her cowardice as for her noodle hair. Well into her old age, she teams up with Kuttusan with the aim of capturing Mayavi. She and Kuttusan also never leave out a chance to catch Raju and Radha, who they know to be friends of Mayavi. However, Dakini is a tantric deity described as a female embodiment of enlightened energy. In the Tibetan language, dakini is rendered khandroma which means 'she who traverses the sky' or 'she who moves in space'. Sometimes the term is translated poetically as 'sky dancer' or 'sky walker'. An owl is sometimes seen with Dakini. =Luttappi= Luttappi, is a cute, innocent devil bearing an uncanny resemblance to Hot Stuff the Little Devil, who works as an aide of Kuttusan. One of the primary sources of humor in the comic, Luttappi is noted for his cheekiness and cowardice. His stupidity and over excitedness often lands everyone in trouble. Luttappi owns the kuntam, a magical spear that can be propelled in flight (akin to flying brooms used in witchcraft). Manned by Luttappi, the kuntam serves as a convenient mode of transport for Luttappi's comrades - Dakini and Kuttusan. Luttappi stays with Kuttusan at his home in the tree trunk. Despite being a very resourceful aide, Luttappi isn't always at good terms with Kuttusan and Dakini, who, on their part, take little effort in hiding their dislike. Luttappi is often portrayed as doing all the housework for Kuttusan. He is also often shown as grumbling and cursing under his breath. =Vikraman and Muthu= Vikraman and Muthu are two notorious criminals at large and wanted by the local police. The comics pictures them as using the forest as a hideout after breaking out of jail. Vikraman and Muthu are friends of Kuttusan. However, their friendship is strictly limited to the mutual benefits they gain out of it. Vikraman and Muthu are never portrayed as having a grudge against Mayavi. However, they often assist Kuttusan and Dakini in order to capture him. Vikraman and Muthu's primary aim is to procure as much wealth and power as they can. However, all their plans are foiled by Mayavi, who is usually alerted by Raju and Radha. =Lottulodukku and Gulgulumal = Lottulodukku and Gulgulumal are two evil scientists who invent new gadgets and ideas to destroy the world. They are afraid of Vikraman and Muthu, who steal their inventions and use these tools for their purposes such as robbing the bank and breaking into people's houses. But Vikraman and Muthu always get into trouble using those gadgets. Their enemies are Raju and Radha, and they are always looking for a chance to kill them. =Puttalu= Uncle of Luttappi, unlike Luttappi, he is dark grey in colour. He is much bigger in size than Luttappi. Kuttusan and Dakini go to Puttalu's den to steal many charms and potions to trap Mayavi, but they get trapped in Puttalu's trap instead. Everybody is afraid of Puttalu, but Puttalu does not have very significant role in Mayavi. He enjoys sleeping and don't want Luttapi to wander with Kuttusan and Dakini. Puttalu's name is created by reading Luttappi's name backwards.  Dress-code change  Some of the characters in the series, including Mayavi and Luttappi, underwent a major dress-code change in 2011 after complaints from several parents regarding the inappropriate clothing. According to the editor of the magazine, the changes were intended to make the characters acceptable for readers of all age. Mayavi VCD Mayavi-VCD is a 3D animated version of the comic strip published in Balarama. It was released on 23 August 2010 by Manorama Music, a music production company owned by Malayala Manorama Group. Story and concept for this version was also by NM Mohan, who is the creator the comics, which is being published in Balaralam since many decades. The 3D version was developed by Hibiscus Digital Media Pvt. Ltd, Thiruvananthapuram. The music for the title song, Nammude Veeran Mayavi was done by Mohan Sithara, while the score and other songs were composed by Jaison. J. Nair. The lyrics were written by Sippy Pallippuram.

History The area was first settled by Europeans in 1846, when George Shaw and Horatio Ellerman applied for for sheep grazing. Ellerman named the area after his birthplace, the Belgian city of Antwerp. In 1858 two Moravian missionaries, Reverend Friedrich Hagenauer and Reverend Spieseke, arrived in the area. By 1859 they had built a church, and in 1860 they baptised their first Aborigine.Robert Kenny, The Lamb Enters the Dreaming ‚Äì Nathaniel Pepper and the Ruptured World, Scribe Publications, Melbourne, 2007. During the 1880s, the Eucalyptus Mallee Oil Company began operations in the township, distilling eucalyptus oil, which was sold under the brand name EMU. The eucalyptus oil business was responsible for the influx of people into the district. Antwerp State School No. 3104 (originally named Antwerp South State School) opened circa 1891, with tenders called to relocate a building from Koonik Koonik in 1901 and additions in 1905. The building was condemned by the Shire of Dimboola in 1909 on health grounds due to overcrowding. The school was rebuilt and continued operating until closure at the end of 1981 due to falling enrolments. The school buildings were removed from the site after closure. The first \\"Antwerp\\" Post Office opened on 25 November 1891, but was renamed Antwerp North in March 1892 and then Tarranyurk in May 1895, which mirrored its location along the railway line. The new Antwerp Post Office opened at Antwerp township in March 1892 and closed in January 1990. Antwerp railway station and sidings on the Dimboola to Jeparit railway line opened in June 1894. Passengers were carried on mixed goods/passenger trains pre-war (six days per week in 1928). The railway line was converted from broad to standard gauge in 1995. The concrete \\"Geelong\\" silos for bulk grain handling and storage were built for the Grain Elevators Board of Victoria and opened for the 1939/40 harvest. The steel \\"ASCOM\\" silos were built in the late 1950s and the grain bunker area was constructed in the early 1980s. Antwerp Weir revealing foundations whilst under construction, 1903 A timber bridge was constructed across the river at Antwerp circa 1890. This bridge remained in service until replaced with a concrete bridge that was built parallel to it on the upstream side around 1990. A timber weir was built across the Wimmera River in 1903 to provide a perennial water supply by regulating the river. Open channels were constructed across the landscape. Social infrastructure reflected the larger population in the early years, which included a hall built in 1904, a Methodist church and sports facilities including an oval and tennis courts at a recreation reserve across the river. The town previously had its own football, cricket, tennis and rowing clubs, with rowing regattas held on the Wimmera River. Antwerp Today Today, the ruins of the Ebenezer Mission to Aborigines have been restored and is the town's tourist attraction. A downsized town remains with a few houses, the grain silos adjoining the railway line, the hall and the bridge with tennis courts across the other side. The Antwerp Tennis Club is still competing. The grain facilities are currently not utilised, with the railway siding used to store surplus grain wagons.

Hillebrand (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation (Oxford University Press, 2005 [1996]). Retrieved 29 December 2017. Bourgeoisie, peasants and people with no estate from birth were separated in Sweden and Finland as late as 1905. Representation through estates was the norm in Europe until the advent of popular representation beginning with the French Revolution.\\"Estate or (Latin) status or (Dutch) staat or (French) √©tat or (German) Stand or (Italian) stato,\\" in Gordon Campbell (ed.), The Oxford Dictionary of the Renaissance (Oxford University Press, 2005 [2003]). Retrieved 29 December 2017. The Estates General of France were convoked only twice between 1614 and 1789, both times during the Fronde (1648‚Äì53), and in neither case did they actually meet. At the final meeting of the Estates in 1789, they voted to join together in a single National Assembly, generally seen as marking the start of the French Revolution. Estates continued to meet in Navarre until 1828, in Hungary until 1848, in Sweden until 1866, and in the Duchy of Mecklenburg until 1918. In some countries, the parliament kept the same name when its feudal organization was replaced with a more modern kind of representation, like census or universal suffrage. In Sweden, the Riksdag of the Estates was replaced with the Riksdag in 1866.

In 1914 he joined the Australian Army and spent World War I in the Signals Corps, seeing active duty in Gallipoli. He was discharged in 1916 following his return to Australia, where he was initially admitted to the first Auxiliary Hospital suffering from throat disease. After the war he settled at Murwillumbah on the NSW north coast, where he took up banana farming. By the 1930s he was the biggest banana-grower in Australia and chairman of the Banana Growers Federation. This made him an influential figure in the politics of the Northern Rivers region. Politics In 1937 Anthony was elected to the House of Representatives as Country Party member for the seat of Richmond. As a powerful figure in the party he had rapid promotion. He was an Honorary Minister 1940‚Äì1941, and Minister for Transport in 1941. During the years of the wartime Australian Labor Party government (1941‚Äì1949), he was a senior member of the Opposition. In 1949 the conservatives returned to power under Robert Menzies, and Anthony became Postmaster-General, adding the post of Minister for Civil Aviation in 1951. He held these posts until his sudden death at Murwillumbah in 1957. He was succeeded as Member for Richmond by his son Doug Anthony, then aged 27.

Some laws and ordinances approved by the States of Guernsey also apply to Alderney and Sark (the other component parts of the Bailiwick of Guernsey) as \\"Bailiwick-wide legislation\\" with the consent of the governments of those islands. All enactments of the States of Guernsey apply to Herm as well as Guernsey, since Herm is wholly owned by the States of Guernsey. When constituted as a legislature, it is officially called the States of Deliberation. When constituted as an electoral college, it is officially called the States of Election. Legislation passed by the States is termed Laws (Loi), which take effect in the island by Order-in-Council. Minor and secondary legislation does not require the assent of the Queen-in-Council and are known as Ordinances (Ordonnances). Membership The States of Deliberation consists of 38 People's Deputies, elected every four years from a single island-wide constituency by plurality-at-large voting, each voter being allowed to cast up to 38 votes. Before the 2020 election, the electoral system was multi-member districts by plurality block voting, in which each voter can vote for as many candidates as there are seats in the district. Two Alderney Deputies are appointed by the States of Alderney to represent Alderney's interest in matters delegated by Alderney to Guernsey under the 1948 Agreement. The Alderney Representatives are full members of the States of Deliberation but are unpaid, and are chosen from the 10 members of the States of Alderney after an Alderney-wide plebiscite. There are also two non-voting members being the Law Officers of the Crown - the Procureur (Attorney General) and the Comptroller (Solicitor General) both appointed by the monarch. The Bailiff presides over the States. History The legislature derives its name from the estates (French: √©tats) of the Crown, the Church and the people from whom the assembly was originally summoned. The Jurats, representing the Crown, and the representatives of the Church of England were replaced in the constitutional reforms following the Second World War, when the office of Conseiller was introduced. Until 2000, there were 33 Deputies elected with three year mandates, and 12 Conseillers representing the Bailiwick, serving terms of six years, with half being elected every three. The Conseillers were not originally directly elected by the people (although latterly directly elected by Bailiwick-wide vote), and the office was abolished before the General Election held that year. The 10 Douzaine representatives (representing parish authorities) were removed from the States in the 2004 constitutional reform and the total of elected deputies rose to the 45 total. In 2016 the number of deputies was reduced to 38. A 2018 referendum means the whole island will form a single 38-member district for the 2020 election.

Man√© became temporary head of state (official title: Chairman of the Supreme Command of the Military Junta) until 14 May when Malam Bacai Sanh√°, the President of the National People's Assembly, was installed as acting President. Political growth The military junta headed by Man√© remained in place during the transitional period leading to new elections; Man√© cast himself as a guardian of democracy. A parliamentary election, along with the first round of a presidential election, was held on 28 November 1999. Two weeks prior to this, Man√©'s junta proposed an arrangement giving it power over the government for ten years, which would enable it to dissolve the government in case of a severe political crisis; however, political parties objected to this and the proposal was dropped. Although the junta backed the presidential candidacy of Malam Bacai Sanh√° of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) in the second round of the election, held in January 2000, Kumba Ial√° of the Party for Social Renewal (PRS) was victorious. Prior to the election, Ial√° had already said that it would not be acceptable for the junta to remain in any capacity. Downfall Although the junta was dissolved following Ial√°'s victory, Man√© remained powerful, acting as an obstacle to Ial√°'s authority. At one point he refused to allow Ial√° to go to Senegal on a state visit; he also accompanied Ial√° on a visit to Nigeria. In November 2000, Ial√° promoted a number of senior military officers; Man√© objected to the promotions and declared himself head of the armed forces. He revoked Ial√°'s promotions, placed military chief of staff Ver√≠sssimo Correia Seabra and deputy chief of staff Em√≠lio Costa under house arrest, and appointed General Buota Nan Batcha as the new chief of staff. When issuing a communique claiming that the situation was calm, he signed it as the head of the junta, which had previously been dissolved when Ial√° was elected President.

It was surveyed in 1851 and proclaimed in 1852, a Post Office opening on 1 January 1854 replacing that of Lake Wallace (open since 1 March 1849) nearer what is now Edenhope serving the grazing population. The population at the 2016 census was 277. The town is close to Lake Bringalbert and Newlands Lake, and the Saint Gregory's Vineyard, which specialises in port wine. Apsley had a football club that competed in the Kowree Naracoorte Football League from 1937. Later this would become the Kowree Naracoorte Tatiara Football League where Apsley competed until 1998, when they merged with Edenhope. Since 2007 Edenhope Apsley have played in the Horsham & District Football League.

Early life and career Daria Nicolodi photographed by Paolo Monti in 1970 Daria Nicolodi was born in Florence on 19 June 1950. Her father was a Florentine lawyer and her mother, Fulvia, was a scholar of ancient languages. Her maternal grandfather was composer Alfredo Casella. She moved to Rome in the late 1960s. In 1970, she participated in the television variety show Babau in four episodes written by Paolo Poli and Ida Omboni and directed by Vito Molinari. Because of program content deemed outrageous at the time, the show was \\"archived\\" and only broadcast by RAI six years later. In the early 1970s Nicolodi had some significant work in the cinema and theater under the guidance of Elio Petri. Also in the same year, Nicolodi participated in some TV productions, such as the serial story Nicotera, Without a Trace with Rossano Brazzi (1972), Portrait of a Veiled Woman with Nino Castelnuovo (1975), the drama Saturnino Farandola with Mariano Rigillo (1978), and Rosaura at 10 (1981). Nicolodi starred in some films directed by Dario Argento between 1975 and 1987: Deep Red (1975), Inferno (1980), Tenebrae (1982), Phenomena (1985), and Opera (1987). She planned to act in Suspiria (1977) which she co- wrote with Argento, but could not due to an injury, and she was replaced at the last minute by Stefania Casini. Notably, Nicolodi starred in Shock, the final film of Italian horror auteur Mario Bava. After her relationship with Argento ended in 1985, Nicolodi participated in a few occasional thriller/horror films (Paganini Horror, The Picture of Joy), exploiting her aura of dark lady of the genre in some films (Macaroni, The End Is Known, Notes of Love), and in recent years, movies directed by her daughter Asia Argento. In 2007, Nicolodi made a comeback to the cinema, working with her daughter Asia in Argento's The Mother of Tears, the thematic sequel to both Suspiria and Inferno. Personal life Daria Nicolodi (1972) In the early seventies, she had a relationship with the sculptor Mario Ceroli; their daughter Anna was born in 1973 (she died in a 1994 car accident). Nicolodi had a professional and romantic relationship with director Dario Argento; they met in 1974 during casting for the film Deep Red, and their daughter Asia was born in 1975. They separated in 1985. Asia had a daughter of her own; she named her Anna after her half-sister. Recognition In 2012, Nicolodi was highlighted in the retrospective Argento: Il Cinema Nel Sangue at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City. The retrospective celebrated the influence of the Argento family on filmmaking in Italy and around the world.

Publication history The first appearance of \\"Tiger-Man\\" was in the first issue of Thrilling Adventure Stories, February 1975, a black and white magazine. The story was written by John Albano with art by Ernie Col√≥n. The first issue of Tiger-Man was published with a cover date of April 1975. The writing credit is given to Gabe Levy with the artwork credited to Ernie Col√≥n. The next two issues were cover- dated June and September 1975. Gerry Conway is credited as the writer for these two issues. Steve Ditko is given solo credit as the artist for issue #2 and given a co-credit with Al Milgrom for issue #3. Tiger-Man was cancelled after three issues. Fictional character biography Tiger-Man is Dr. Lancaster Hill, a scientist who has isolated the chromosomes that give the tiger its strength and agility. He is in Africa while performing his 2-year internship, working from a village in Zambia that has been using the services of a local witch doctor named Na'Bantu. When the Na'Bantu has a conversation with the village chief, he seeks to punish Dr. Hill for having caused the villagers to doubt his ability to treat their medical problems. Overly eager to see the results of his work, Dr. Hill injects himself with a solution containing the tiger chromosomes. He feels his strength, agility and ferocity increase to that of a tiger. That night, a jealous Na'Bantu releases the tiger that Dr. Hill has been performing experiments on and when Dr. Hill is leaving his tent, the tiger attacks but Dr. Hill meets the attack with his new abilities and kills the tiger. Within the time that it takes to finish his internship, the chief presents Dr. Hill with a costume made from the hide of the attacking tiger and tells Dr. Hill that wearing it will increase his cunning. Dr. Hill then departs for the states. Upon his return to the United States, Dr. Hill is picked up from the airport by his sister Anna, who informs him that he received an offer letter to start practicing medicine at the Harlem Hospital on the following Monday. Dr. Hill is dropped off at home by his sister and she goes off to theater rehearsal, where she is murdered by two visiting rodeo cowboys. Dr. Hill is called to the crime scene and is shown the evidence of a torn piece of fabric that his sister clutched in her hand, and told of a phone call she made to the police where she says the word \\"bald\\" over and over as she dies. Dr. Hill picks up the scent on the fabric and realizes that it smells of horses. Dr. Hill dons his Tiger-Man costume and sets out to track down his sister's killer. While searching for the killer, Tiger-Man stumbles across two thugs trying to mug a nurse. Tiger-Man stops them with very deadly force and warns the nurse about walking at night in the city. After tracking down the bald cowboy to a visiting rodeo, Tiger-Man realizes that the scent on the cloth is not completely his and that he must have had an accomplice. Tiger-Man follows the bald cowboy to a bar and attacks the two cowboys, but he still feels unfulfilled afterward. He decides to use his powers to hunt down criminals. Dr. Hill starts practicing medicine at the Harlem Hospital, but at night he patrols the city looking for wrong-doers. He stumbles upon a pack of bank robbers who are wearing electrified suits that repel bullets, but also electrocute anyone that the wearers touch. In this case, they electrocute two police officers who try to prevent them from getting away from the scene of the robbery. Tiger-Man comes in on the tail end of the attack and exacts his revenge against the robbers and interrogates one of them to find out where they got their suits from. One of them finally gives him the name of Dr. Kobart. Tiger-Man departs leaving one of the criminals alive who faints. Unknown to Tiger-Man he is being watched and pursued by the Blue Leopard, another enhanced person from the Zambian village he did his internship at. The Blue Leopard attacks Tiger-Man and though they very evenly matched, his claws are laced with drugs that cause Tiger-Man to pass out. The Blue Leopard warns Tiger-Man that this was only a dress rehearsal for the ending battle where his claws will be laced with poison instead of just a sedative. He then departs leaving Tiger-Man to sleep through to the next day. Tiger-Man awakens at around noon the next day and rushes from rooftop to rooftop to get to the Harlem Hospital to begin his shift. While working, Dr. Hill is consumed by the events of the previous day and contemplates what to do about the Blue Leopard. Seeing no way of finding him, Dr. Hill decides to pay a visit to Dr. Kobart. Once he has found him, he is surprised to see the Blue Leopard has killed him and framed Tiger-Man for the crime. While Tiger-Man is investigating the crime scene, the Blue Leopard appears in the window and tells Tiger-Man his origin. The Blue Leopard is a member of the village in Zambia that Dr. Hill did his internship. After Dr. Hill left the village at the end of his internship, people started to starve to death and Na'Bantu the witch doctor blamed Dr. Hill and his white man's medicine. The Blue Leopard was given a potion created by Na'Bantu which increased his strength to 3 times of a normal man, and gave him the ceremonial Blue Leopard skin to wear, similar to the tiger mane and claws worn by Tiger-Man. Tiger-Man and the Blue Leopard battle again, with no one winning due to the police arriving. The Blue Leopard runs off into the night laughing, knowing that he has implicated Tiger-Man for the murder. Later, we see Tiger-Man rush a burn victim into the Harlem Hospital, where he works as Dr. Hill. He starts shouting orders to the staff, almost giving his secret identity away. In a flashback we see the man he brought in had set himself ablaze with suicidal thoughts running through his mind. We go back to the present where Tiger-Man leaves the hospital and sneaks into a broom closet to change into this working clothes as Dr. Lancaster Hill. Dr. Hill is a part of the team operating on the burn victim, but the man dies from his severe trauma, but not before he utters the word \\"hypnos\\". A couple of days later, Tiger-Man is witnesses another suicide. An elderly woman steps on the tracks in front of a subway train. Moving as quickly as he can Tiger-Man can not stop the train from striking the woman dead. Tiger-Man then decides to investigate these strange suicides. Finding out that the elderly woman, named Hannah Markham, was a patient at a free psychiatric clinic in midtown run by Dr. Otto Kaufmann, Dr. Hill decides he will pay the doctor a visit to get to the bottom of this mystery. Dr. Hill's visit turns out to be waste of time as Dr. Kaufmann is adamant about sharing any information on his patients with Dr. Hill. As Dr. Hill is leaving, another patient of Dr. Kaufmann's steps in to let him know that she is ready for their session. That evening, Tiger-Man attempts to stop an out of control automobile from plunging into the river. Not acting fast enough, the car soon plunges into the deep waters off a bridge. Tiger-Man manages to pull the victim from the car and bring her to the surface. He recognizes the woman at once as she was at the free clinic when Dr. Hill visited Dr. Kaufmann. In shock, she utters the name \\"Hypnos\\". Dr. Hill then decides that it is now time for Tiger- Man to visit Dr. Kaufmann. Tiger-Man breaks into the clinic and begins to look through Dr. Kaufmann's patient files. He finds records of suicides that have happened, and suicides that are due to happen in the near future. Dr. Kaufmann then enters the office and notices Tiger-Man going through his files. He is easily beaten by Tiger-Man, but quickly recovers. He then uses a psychic ray through his monocle that hypnotizes Tiger-Man, which reveals to the reader that Dr. Kaufmann is in actuality Hypnos! Hypnos orders Tiger-Man to take his own life by setting himself aflame. Tiger-Man leaves the clinic with nothing else on his mind. At a nearby gas station, Tiger-Man doses himself with gasoline. He is spotted by two thugs, who have recently robbed the gas station and see him as an easy victim. In a trance-like state, Tiger-Man is knocked unconscious by these two thugs who complain about him not having any money or valuables in his costume. The smack to his head that he receives releases Hypnos' hold over Tiger-Man. Tiger-Man returns to the clinic to defeat Hypnos. The battle moves to the building's rooftop and Tiger-Man manages to avoid the psychic rays of Hypnos. He removes Kaufmann's monocle and turns it on him. Hypnotized by the ray, Kaufmann realizes that death is the only answer and leaps off the building, committing suicide in the process. Powers and abilities Dr. Hill as Tiger-Man possesses the strength, speed, agility and ferocity of an actual tiger in its most primal state. This ferocity sometimes grows to the point where it is hard to concentrate and Dr. Hill becomes lost in rage. Drinking samples of the tiger's milk that he preserved is able to increase his IQ by \\"120 points\\". Costume Dr. Hill as Tiger-Man wears a unitard, gauntlets, and boots made from the hide of a tiger that attacked him, which he defeated. The costume grants Dr. Hill extensive cunning which allows him to hunt prey and move very stealthy while in hunt mode.

The island is of volcanic origin and is approximately long and wide. The island group is politically part of the South American country Chile, and is administratively assigned to the Region of Valpara√≠so.  Geography  Santa Clara is the smallest island of the Juan Fernandez Islands and has an area of about . It is surrounded on the south side by a reef. This volcanic islet is related to a group of three islands. Located southwest of Robinson Crusoe Island, it has a mainly flat surface, with a maximum altitude of at Johow Hill. Based on its geomorphological characteristics and the composition of its lavas, it is postulated to be the earliest volcanic center which led to the emergence of Robinson Crusoe Island, and is, therefore, of greater antiquity - 5.8 million years (as compared to 3.8 - 4.2 million years). Santa Clara includes volcanic rocks and several small beaches, including some white sand beaches. A short distance from the western extremity of Santa Clara Island, there is a small rocky islet, and, at the tip south of the same islet, there is a sandbar composed of various rocks which break the water. Coming from the north, the island of Santa Clara has the appearance of a cliff or escarpment; but approaching from the south, shows an eroded quirky aspect of conical mounds and strangely cut rocks. Waters surrounding the island have a rocky bottom, with strong currents. Access by boat to the island is dangerous, especially in stormy weather, because the strong sea breaks on all sides.  Climate  Being low-lying in elevation, Santa Clara catches relatively little rainfall. The amount of rainfall also depends on the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation. The climate is subtropical, strongly influenced by fluctuations in the general northward flow of the cold sub-Antarctic Humboldt ocean current and the southeast trade winds, which create a high-winter and low-summer rainfall pattern and a stable temperature environment. Temperatures range throughout the year from to , with an annual mean of .  Flora and fauna  Santa Clara is generally desolate and barren, but in its eastern slope there are some trees, and in the northwest tip a periodical stream of water runs along the gorge, which reaches the sea. The low vegetation has been eroded in the past by herds of goats up on the rocks. The native flora is characterized by low fire tolerance and poor adaptation to herbivore resistance. Feral rabbits are the greatest threat because they exert devastating effects on the island‚Äôs habitats. The majority of the original vegetation on the island has been replaced by shrubs and grasses.Refugio N√°utico (n.d.). \\"La Isla y el Archipi√©lago\\" (in Spanish). The vegetation is a miniature mosaic of matorral, barren rock, various size trees, and shrubs mixed with ferns and perennial herbs. Nearly all of Santa Clara is abundant in the introduced Rubus ulmifolius, Aristotelia chilensis, Ugni molinae, Lantana camara and Lonicera japonica. Some have the potential to be serious pests, having fleshy fruits that are bird dispersed, in addition to weeds such as Danthonia collina, Stipa laevissima and Piptochaetium bicolor. There are no permanent sources of fresh water on the island. Vertebrates inhabiting the islet include birds, some endangered, which make their nests on or visit the island.Mar de Chile (25 September 2005). \\"Isla Santa Clara\\" (in Spanish).  Government  The uninhabited island is part of a municipality in the Region of Valpara√≠so, from which Easter Island is also administered. The main economic activities are fishing of the spiny lobster, Jasus frontalis, and tourism. The entire archipelago has been part of a nature reserve called the Archipi√©lago de Juan Fern√°ndez National Park since 1977.

Industrial gases are the gaseous materials that are manufactured for use in industry. The principal gases provided are nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, hydrogen, helium and acetylene, although many other gases and mixtures are also available in gas cylinders. The industry producing these gases is also known as industrial gas, which is seen as also encompassing the supply of equipment and technology to produce and use the gases. Their production is a part of the wider chemical Industry (where industrial gases are often seen as \\"specialty chemicals\\"). Industrial gases are used in a wide range of industries, which include oil and gas, petrochemicals, chemicals, power, mining, steelmaking, metals, environmental protection, medicine, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food, water, fertilizers, nuclear power, electronics and aerospace. Industrial gas is sold to other industrial enterprises; typically comprising large orders to corporate industrial clients, covering a size range from building a process facility or pipeline down to cylinder gas supply. Some trade scale business is done, typically through tied local agents who are supplied wholesale. This business covers the sale or hire of gas cylinders and associated equipment to tradesmen and occasionally the general public. This includes products such as balloon helium, dispensing gases for beer kegs, welding gases and welding equipment, LPG and medical oxygen. Retail sales of small scale gas supply are not confined to just the industrial gas companies or their agents. A wide variety of hand-carried small gas containers, which may be called cylinders, bottles, cartridges, capsules or canisters are available to supply LPG, butane, propane, carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide. Examples are Whipped-cream chargers, powerlets, campingaz and sodastream.  Early history of gases Blowing air at a spark The first gas from the natural environment used by humans was almost certainly air when it was discovered that blowing on or fanning a fire made it burn brighter. Humans also used the warm gases from a fire to smoke foods and steam from boiling water to cook foods. Bubbles of carbon dioxide form a froth on fermenting liquids such as beer Carbon dioxide has been known from ancient times as the byproduct of fermentation, particularly for beverages, which was first documented dating from 7000‚Äì6600 B.C. in Jiahu, China. Natural gas was used by the Chinese in about 500 B.C. when they discovered the potential to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to boil sea water. Sulfur dioxide was used by the Romans in winemaking as it had been discovered that burning candles made of sulfur inside empty wine vessels would keep them fresh and prevent them gaining a vinegar smell. D√∂bereiner's hydrogen lamp . Early understanding consisted of empirical evidence and the protoscience of alchemy; however with the advent of scientific method and the science of chemistry, these gases became positively identified and understood. Kipp's apparatusAcetylene flame carbide lamp The history of chemistry tells us that a number of gases were identified and either discovered or first made in relatively pure form during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries by notable chemists in their laboratories. The timeline of attributed discovery for various gases are carbon dioxide (1754), hydrogen (1766), nitrogen (1772), nitrous oxide (1772) , oxygen (1773) , ammonia (1774), chlorine (1774), methane (1776), hydrogen sulfide (1777),Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Chemische Abhandlung von der Luft und dem Feuer (Chemical treatise on air and fire) (Upsala, Sweden: Magnus Swederus, 1777), ¬ß 97: Die stinckende Schwefel Luft (The stinking sulfur air [i.e., gas]), pp. 149-155. carbon monoxide (1800), hydrogen chloride (1810), acetylene (1836), helium (1868) fluorine (1886), argon (1894), krypton, neon and xenon (1898) and radon (1899). Carbon dioxide, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide and manufactured fuel gas were already being used during the 19th century, and mainly had uses in food, refrigeration, medicine, and for fuel and gas lighting. For example, carbonated water was being made from 1772 and commercially from 1783, chlorine was first used to bleach textiles in 1785 and nitrous oxide was first used for dentistry anaethesia in 1844. At this time gases were often generated for immediate use by chemical reactions. A notable example of a generator is Kipps apparatus which was invented in 1844 and could be used to generate gases such as hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, chlorine, acetylene and carbon dioxide by simple gas evolution reactions. Acetylene was manufactured commercially from 1893 and acetylene generators were used from about 1898 to produce gas for gas cooking and gas lighting, however electricity took over as more practical for lighting and once LPG was produced commercially from 1912, the use of acetylene for cooking declined. Late Victorian Gasogene for producing carbonated water Once gases had been discovered and produced in modest quantities, the process of industrialisation spurred on innovation and invention of technology to produce larger quantities of these gases. Notable developments in the industrial production of gases include the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen (in 1869) and oxygen (from 1888), the Brin process for oxygen production which was invented in the 1884, the chloralkali process to produce chlorine in 1892 and the Haber Process to produce ammonia in 1908. The development of uses in refrigeration also enabled advances in air conditioning and the liquefaction of gases. Carbon dioxide was first liquefied in 1823. The first Vapor-compression refrigeration cycle using ether was invented by Jacob Perkins in 1834 and a similar cycle using ammonia was invented in 1873 and another with sulfur dioxide in 1876. Liquid oxygen and Liquid nitrogen were both first made in 1883; Liquid hydrogen was first made in 1898 and liquid helium in 1908. LPG was first made in 1910. A patent for LNG was filed in 1914 with the first commercial production in 1917. Although no one event marks the beginning of the industrial gas industry, many would take it to be the 1880s with the construction of the first high pressure gas cylinders. Initially cylinders were mostly used for carbon dioxide in carbonation or dispensing of beverages. In 1895 refrigeration compression cycles were further developed to enable the liquefaction of air, most notably by Carl von Linde allowing larger quantities of oxygen production and in 1896 the discovery that large quantities of acetylene could be dissolved in acetone and rendered nonexplosive allowed the safe bottling of acetylene.History ‚Äì Acetylene dissolved in acetone . Aga.com. Retrieved on 2012-11-26. A particularly important use was the development of welding and metal cutting done with oxygen and acetylene from the early 1900s. As production processes for other gases were developed many more gases came to be sold in cylinders without the need for a gas generator.  Gas production technology  Distillation column in a cryogenic air separation plant Air separation plants refine air in a separation process and so allow the bulk production of nitrogen and argon in addition to oxygen - these three are often also produced as cryogenic liquid. To achieve the required low distillation temperatures, an Air Separation Unit (ASU) uses a refrigeration cycle that operates by means of the Joule‚ÄìThomson effect. In addition to the main air gases, air separation is also the only practical source for production of the rare noble gases neon, krypton and xenon. Cryogenic technologies also allow the liquefaction of natural gas, hydrogen and helium. In natural-gas processing, cryogenic technologies are used to remove nitrogen from natural gas in a Nitrogen Rejection Unit; a process that can also be used to produce helium from natural gas where natural gas fields contain sufficient helium to make this economic. The larger industrial gas companies have often invested in extensive patent libraries in all fields of their business, but particularly in cryogenics. Gasification The other principal production technology in the industry is Reforming. Steam reforming is a chemical process used to convert natural gas and steam into a syngas containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide with carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Partial oxidation and autothermal reforming are similar processes but these also require oxygen from an ASU. Synthesis gas is often a precursor to the chemical synthesis of ammonia or methanol. The carbon dioxide produced is an acid gas and is most commonly removed by amine treating. This separated carbon dioxide can potentially be sequestrated to a carbon capture reservoir or used for Enhanced oil recovery. Air Separation and hydrogen reforming technologies are the cornerstone of the industrial gases industry and also form part of the technologies required for many fuel gasification ( including IGCC), cogeneration and Fischer-Tropsch gas to liquids schemes. Hydrogen has many production methods and is a carbon neutral alternative fuel displacing the use of hydrocarbons in Orkney http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190327-the-tiny-islands-leading-the-way-in- hydrogen-power; see hydrogen economy for more information on hydrogen's uses. liquid hydrogen is used by NASA in the Space Shuttle as a rocket fuel. A nitrogen generator Membrane nitrogen generator Simpler gas separation technologies, such as membranes or molecular sieves used in pressure swing adsorption or vacuum swing adsorption are also used to produce low purity air gases in nitrogen generators and oxygen plants. Other examples producing smaller amounts of gas are chemical oxygen generators or oxygen concentrators. In addition to the major gases produced by air separation and syngas reforming, the industry provides many other gases. Some gases are simply byproducts from other industries and others are sometimes bought from other larger chemical producers, refined and repackaged; although a few have their own production processes. Examples are hydrogen chloride produced by burning hydrogen in chlorine, nitrous oxide produced by thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate when gently heated, electrolysis for the production of fluorine, chlorine and hydrogen, and electrical corona discharge to produce ozone from air or oxygen. Related services and technology can be supplied such as vacuum, which is often provided in hospital gas systems; purified compressed air; or refrigeration. Another unusual system is the inert gas generator. Some industrial gas companies may also supply related chemicals, particularly liquids such as bromine and ethylene oxide.  Gas distribution  = Mode of gas supply= Compressed hydrogen tube trailer Most materials that are gaseous at ambient temperature and pressure are supplied as compressed gas. A gas compressor is used to compress the gas into storage pressure vessels (such as gas canisters, gas cylinders or tube trailers) through piping systems. Gas cylinders are by far the most common gas storage . Linde.com. Retrieved on 2015-12-07. and large numbers are produced at a \\"cylinder fill\\" facility. However not all industrial gases are supplied in the gaseous phase. A few gases are vapors that can be liquefied at ambient temperature under pressure alone, so they can also be supplied as a liquid in an appropriate container. This phase change also makes these gases useful as ambient refrigerants and the most significant industrial gases with this property are ammonia (R717), propane (R290), butane (R600), and sulfur dioxide (R764). Chlorine also has this property but is too toxic, corrosive and reactive to ever have been used as a refrigerant. Some other gases exhibit this phase change if the ambient temperature is low enough; this includes ethylene (R1150), carbon dioxide (R744), ethane (R170), nitrous oxide (R744A), and sulfur hexafluoride; however, these can only be liquefied under pressure if kept below their critical temperatures which are 9 ¬∞C for C2H4 ; 31 ¬∞C for CO2 ; 32 ¬∞C for C2H6 ; 36 ¬∞C for N2O ; 45 ¬∞C for SF6. All of these substances are also provided as a gas (not a vapor) at the 200 bar pressure in a gas cylinder because that pressure is above their critical pressure. Permanent gases (those with a critical temperature below ambient) can only be supplied as liquid if they are also cooled. All gases can potentially be used as a refrigerant around the temperatures at which they are liquid; for example nitrogen (R728) and methane (R50) are used as refrigerant at cryogenic temperatures. Exceptionally carbon dioxide can be produced as a cold solid known as dry ice, which sublimes as it warms in ambient conditions, the properties of carbon dioxide are such that it cannot be liquid at a pressure below its triple point of 5.1 bar. Acetylene is also supplied differently. Since it is so unstable and explosive, this is supplied as a gas dissolved in acetone within a packing mass in a cylinder. Acetylene is also the only other common industrial gas that sublimes at atmospheric pressure. = Gas delivery= Photos gas cabinet inventory The major industrial gases can be produced in bulk and delivered to customers by pipeline, but can also be packaged and transported. Most gases are sold in gas cylinders and some sold as liquid in appropriate containers (e.g. Dewars) or as bulk liquid delivered by truck. The industry originally supplied gases in cylinders to avoid the need for local gas generation; but for large customers such as steelworks or oil refineries, a large gas production plant may be built nearby (typically called an \\"on-site\\" facility) to avoid using large numbers of cylinders manifolded together. Alternatively, an industrial gas company may supply the plant and equipment to produce the gas rather than the gas itself. An industrial gas company may also offer to act as plant operator under an operations and maintenance contract for a gases facility for a customer, since it usually has the experience of running such facilities for the production or handling of gases for itself. Some materials are dangerous to use as a gas; for example, fluorine is highly reactive and industrial chemistry requiring fluorine often uses hydrogen fluoride (or hydrofluoric acid) instead. Another approach to overcoming gas reactivity is to generate the gas as and when required, which is done, for example, with ozone. The delivery options are therefore local gas generation, pipelines, bulk transport (truck, rail, ship), and packaged gases in gas cylinders or other containers. Bulk liquid gases are often transferred to end user storage tanks. Gas cylinders (and liquid gas containing vessels) are often used by end users for their own small scale distribution systems. Toxic or flammable gas cylinders are often stored by end users in gas cabinets for protection from external fire or from any leak.  What defines an industrial gas  Industrial gas is a group of materials that are specifically manufactured for use in industry and are also gaseous at ambient temperature and pressure. They are chemicals which can be an elemental gas or a chemical compound that is either organic or inorganic, and tend to be low molecular weight molecules. They could also be a mixture of individual gases. They have value as a chemical; whether as a feedstock, in process enhancement, as a useful end product, or for a particular use; as opposed to having value as a \\"simple\\" fuel. The term ‚Äúindustrial gases‚Äù is sometimes narrowly defined as just the major gases sold, which are: nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, hydrogen, acetylene and helium. Many names are given to gases outside of this main list by the different industrial gas companies, but generally the gases fall into the categories \\"specialty gases\\", ‚Äúmedical gases‚Äù, ‚Äúfuel gases‚Äù or ‚Äúrefrigerant gases‚Äù. However gases can also be known by their uses or industries that they serve, hence \\"welding gases\\" or \\"breathing gases\\", etc. ; or by their source, as in \\"air gases\\"; or by their mode of supply as in \\"packaged gases\\". The major gases might also be termed \\"bulk gases\\" or \\"tonnage gases\\". In principle any gas or gas mixture sold by the \\"industrial gases industry\\" probably has some industrial use and might be termed an \\"industrial gas\\". In practice, \\"industrial gases\\" are likely to be a pure compound or a mixture of precise chemical composition, packaged or in small quantities, but with high purity or tailored to a specific use (e.g. oxyacetylene). Lists of the more significant gases are listed in \\"The Gases\\" below. There are cases when a gas is not usually termed an \\"industrial gas\\"; principally where the gas is processed for later use of its energy rather than manufactured for use as a chemical substance or preparation. The oil and gas industry is seen as distinct. So, whilst it is true that natural gas is a \\"gas\\" used in \\"industry\\" - often as a fuel, sometimes as a feedstock, and in this generic sense is an \\"industrial gas\\"; this term is not generally used by industrial enterprises for hydrocarbons produced by the petroleum industry directly from natural resources or in an oil refinery. Materials such as LPG and LNG are complex mixtures often without precise chemical composition that often also changes whilst stored. The petrochemical industry is also seen as distinct. So petrochemicals (chemicals derived from petroleum) such as ethylene are also generally not described as \\"industrial gases\\". Sometimes the chemical industry is thought of as distinct from industrial gases; so materials such as ammonia and chlorine might be considered \\"chemicals\\" (especially if supplied as a liquid) instead of or sometimes as well as \\"industrial gases\\". Small scale gas supply of hand-carried containers is sometimes not considered to be industrial gas as the use is considered personal rather than industrial; and suppliers are not always gas specialists. These demarcations are based on perceived boundaries of these industries (although in practice there is some overlap), and an exact scientific definition is difficult. To illustrate \\"overlap\\" between industries: Manufactured fuel gas (such as town gas) would historically have been considered an industrial gas. Syngas is often considered to be a petrochemical; although its production is a core industrial gases technology. Similarly, projects harnessing Landfill gas or biogas, Waste-to-energy schemes, as well as Hydrogen Production all exhibit overlapping technologies. Helium is an industrial gas, even though its source is from natural gas processing. Any gas is likely to be considered an industrial gas if it is put in a gas cylinder (except perhaps if it is used as a fuel) Propane would be considered an industrial gas when used as a refrigerant, but not when used as a refrigerant in LNG production, even though this is an overlapping technology.  Gases  = Elemental gases = The known chemical elements which are, or can be obtained from natural resources and which are gaseous are hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, plus the noble gases; and are collectively referred to by chemists as the \\"elemental gases\\".[https://socratic.org/questions/an-elemental-gas-has-a-mass- of-10-3-g-if-the-volume-is-58-4-l-and-the-pressure-i ]. socratic.org. Retrieved on 2018-08-28. These elements are all primordial apart from the noble gas radon which is a trace radioisotope which occurs naturally since all isotopes are radiogenic nuclides from radioactive decay. (It is not scientifically proven if any synthetic elements with atomic number above 108 are gases, although it has been suggested that elements 112 and 114 are gases.) The elements which are stable two atom homonuclear molecules at standard temperature and pressure (STP), are hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), plus the halogens fluorine (F2) and chlorine (Cl2). The noble gases are all monatomic. In the industrial gases industry the term \\"elemental gases\\" (or sometimes less accurately \\"molecular gases\\") is used to distinguish these gases from molecules that are also chemical compounds. These elements are all nonmetals. Radon is chemically stable, but it is radioactive and does not have a stable isotope. Its most stable isotope, 222Rn, has a half-life of 3.8 days. Its uses are due to its radioactivity rather than its chemistry and it requires specialist handling outside of industrial gas industry norms. It can however be produced as a by-product of uraniferous ores processing. Radon is a trace naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) encountered in the air processed in an ASU. Chlorine is the only elemental gas that is technically a vapor since STP is below its critical temperature; whilst bromine and mercury are liquid at STP, and so their vapor exists in equilibrium with their liquid at STP. * Air gases ** nitrogen (N2) ** oxygen (O2) ** argon (Ar) * Noble gases ** helium (He) ** neon (Ne) ** argon (Ar) ** krypton (Kr) ** xenon (Xe) ** radon (Rn) *The other Elemental gases ** hydrogen (H2) ** chlorine (Cl2) (vapor) ** fluorine (F2) = Other common industrial gases = This list shows the other most common gases sold by industrial gas companies. *Compound gases ** ammonia (NH3) ** carbon dioxide (CO2) ** carbon monoxide (CO) ** hydrogen chloride (HCl) ** nitrous oxide (N2O) ** nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) ** sulfur dioxide (SO2) ** sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) *Hydrocarbon gases ** methane (CH4) ** acetylene (C2H2) ** ethane (C2H6) ** ethene (C2H4) ** propane (C3H8) ** propene (C3H6) ** butane (C4H10) ** butene (C4H8) * Significant gas mixtures ** air ** breathing gases ** forming gas ** welding shielding gas ** synthesis gas ** Penning mixture ** Mixed Refrigerant used in LNG cycles There are many gas mixtures possible. = Important liquefied gases = Dewar being filled with LIN from storage tank This list shows the most important liquefied gases : * Produced from air ** liquid nitrogen (LIN) ** liquid oxygen (LOX) ** liquid argon (LAR) * Produced from various sources ** liquid carbon dioxide * Produced from hydrocarbon feedstock ** liquid hydrogen ** liquid helium * Gas mixtures produced from hydrocarbon feedstock ** Liquefied natural gas (LNG) ** Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)  Industrial gas applications  A cutting torch is used to cut a steel pipe.

Maleny is approximately north of Brisbane and west of Caloundra. The reserve is positioned in the mountain rainforests of the Maleny region overlooking the Glass House Mountains. Geology The Region holds many of the large predominate landforms in Queensland, the most recognisable is the Glass House Mountains. The Glass House Mountains were formed thousands of years ago when the outer layer of soil and rock eroded from the extinct volcanic summit. The dirt and soil located in the region is very rich and healthy, due to the high quantity of volcanic rock decomposed in the soil. Volcanic rock contains high amounts of nutrients. The Mary Cairncross story The Cairncross Reserve was given to the Landsborough Shire Council in 1941 by three Thynne sisters. They named the reserve after their mother, Mary Thynne (n√©e Cairncross, born in 1848). Sunshine Coast Regional Council manages and maintains the reserve along with the volunteers that staff the Thynne Natural History Education Centre daily. The reserve was created to protect the flora and fauna of the Maleny region. The Rainforest Mary Cairncross Reserve rainforest The 55-hectare reserve consists of subtropical rainforest. These types of rainforests are mainly located in the north-east parts of Australia. The Cairncross reserve has an area of 530,000 square metres and reaches a peak canopy of 440 m. The main species of tree is the Australian red cedar. Strangler figs and fungi are some of the environmental elements that the rainforest needs to survive. The red- legged pademelon can be found at the park. Biodiversity Plants found in the reserve include 107 species of tree, 30 herbs, 50 vines, 3 palms, 21 species of fungi and 26 kinds of shrubs. Animals include 139 birds including the wompoo fruit-dove, brown cuckoo-dove, tree-creepers, thornbills, scrub- wrens, green catbird as well as 11 different marsupials, 3 bats, 20 lizards, 14 snakes and 14 frog species. Facilities The reserve contains a Rainforest Discovery Centre, walking tracks, a car park, barbecue and a cafe. The Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve Discovery Centre building was opened in 2017 by the Governor of Queensland, His Excellency the Honourable Paul de Jersey AC. The building was designed by Maleny based Building Designer, Norman Richards building design + interiors in collaboration with Brisbane based Guymer Bailey Architects.

V. Sasi, was an Indian film director who made over 150 films in various Indian languages. He is well known for his work in Malayalam cinema of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, although he directed a few Tamil and Hindi films as well. In 2015, he was awarded the J. C. Daniel Award, the highest award in Malayalam cinema. Early and personal life I. V. Sasi was born on 28 March 1948 in West Hill near Kozhikode, as the son of I.V. Chandran and Kausalya. He married Malayalam film actress Seema on 28 August 1980. He met her on the set of his film Avalude Raavukkal. Ever since, she has been his favorite heroine. They have worked together in more than 30 movies. He has two children, daughter Anu and son Ani. Anu has acted in Symphony, directed by her father. Anu married Milan Nair on 10 December 2010. Ani completed Visual Communication from Loyola College, Chennai and is an budding director himself. I. V. Sasi lived with his family in Chennai. Career I. V. Sasi started his film career as an art director. Later, after working as an assistant director in some films, he directed his first film at the age of 27. Though his name was not mentioned in the credits, the film turned out to be a huge success. He started his directorial career officially with his first film Ulsavam. Soon he carved out a name for himself in the Malayalam film industry. His films were known for their uniqueness and always contained a stamp of his directorial style. I. V. Sasi has directed more than 170 odd films over a span of 34 years and has constantly delivered super hits and some of them classified as classics or good cinema. His Malayalam film Avalude Raavukal permanently established his name in the industry. This film was later dubbed into many other Indian languages including Hindi. It was the second film in Malayalam to be rated as \\"Adults only\\" even though it was a drama. I. V. Sasi introduced actor Mammootty as a hero in his film Thrishna. Mammootty-I. V. Sasi combination was one of the most successful and bankable ones in Malayalam cinema. One of Mohanlal's first breaks as a co-hero Ineyengillum was also directed by I. V. Sasi. He also introduced actor Jose. Other collaborations such as M.T. Vasudevan Nair-I. V. Sasi, Padmarajan-I. V. Sasi, and T.Damodaran-I. V. Sasi are well remembered. He worked with Mammootty on more than 35 films. He went on to direct one of Mohanlal's biggest hits, Devaasuram, which was scripted by Ranjith. He has directed films in several other languages, such as Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil. He has directed Kamal Haasan in films like Guru, Allauddinum Arputha Vilakkum, Karishma and Eeta. He introduced Rajinikanth to Malayalam film industry with Allauddinum Albhutha Vilakkum (1979), and also made the Telugu-Tamil bilingual film Kaali with Rajinikanth in the lead role. He has directed Hindi movies as Patita (Mithun Chakraborty), Anokha Rishta (Rajesh Khanna and Smita Patil), Pratishodh (1980), Karishma etc. His most critically acclaimed Hindi film was Anokha Rishta with Rajesh Khanna in the lead which was remake of Kanamarayathu. His biggest blockbuster in Tamil was Ore Vaanam Ore Bhoomi starring K. R. Vijaya, Seema and Jaishankar in 1979, which was remade in Malayalam as Ezhamkadalinakkare. He has directed Malayalam movies in many genres. His war-themed movie 1921, written by screenwriter T. Damodaran, was the first Malayalam movie to be nominated in the Italian Film Festival. His Ina was the first Malayalam movie about child marriage. In 1982, he shared The Indian National film Awards' \\"The Nargis Dutt award\\" for the best feature film on national integration for his film Aaroodam with its producer Rosamma George. Ezhamkadalinakkare is the first Malayalam film to shoot in North America, with Manhattan being one of its locations. The song \\"Suralokajaladhaara\\" was filmed near in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. Death I. V. Sasi died at his home in Saligramam, Chennai on 24 October 2017 at the age of 69 at 10:30 am, due to a massive heart attack. He suffered from various ailments during his final years, like diabetes and high blood pressure. He survived a major stroke in 2006 and was undergoing treatment for cancer at the time of his death.

The film is based on the novel The Pitfall by Jay Dratler and stars Dick Powell, Lizabeth Scott, and Jane Wyatt, and features Raymond Burr. Plot John \\"Johnny\\" Forbes (Dick Powell) is a middle-class husband and father who is tired of his boring routine, working for the Olympic Mutual Insurance Company in downtown Los Angeles. On a day when he is especially downhearted about his life, private investigator and former policeman J.B. \\"Mac\\" MacDonald (Raymond Burr) reports to him regarding an embezzler who had been bonded by Olympic Mutual. The man, Bill Smiley (Byron Barr), is serving time for the crime, and is eligible for parole in two months. Smiley had given several expensive gifts ‚Äì including a speedboat named Tempest - to his girlfriend, Santa Monica model Mona Stevens (Lizabeth Scott). Mac admits he is attracted to Mona and, wanting to remain on the case, offers to go speak to her about retrieving the illicit gifts. Forbes tells the investigator his job is done and that he will go himself. At her apartment, the sultry blonde cooperates, especially after she learns that Smiley's parole may be sped up if she does, but needles Forbes about his job. He suggests they go for a drink. They go out on the speedboat, taking turns driving it; Forbes notices how much she loves the boat. After the drinks, Mona suggests dinner. The two begin a physical relationship. Mac, who is parked outside her apartment, sees Forbes leave much later that night. The next day, Mac is waiting for Forbes in his office. He says he has noticed the list of items reclaimed from Mona, but that the boat is not there; Forbes denies knowledge of it. Mac reveals he possesses the bill of sale. He reiterates how much he likes Mona and asks Forbes what it was he found to spend so much time talking with her about. Forbes is taken aback and decides to allow the boat to be re-possessed. When he tells Mona about this, that Mac knew he had let her keep it and could cause trouble, she reveals that Mac had been pounding on her door the previous night \\"until all hours\\". When Forbes arrives home, Mac is there and proceeds to beat him up, saying, \\"I told you I like that girl\\" and \\"Maybe this will keep you home where you belong for a few days\\". A happy Mona awakes the next morning and finds that Forbes has left his briefcase in her apartment. From her job at May Company department store she telephones his office and learns that he has called in sick. She borrows a co- worker's car, having decided to go to Forbes' home to visit him and take him some food; she gets his address from a card in the briefcase. She arrives at the moment when the doctor, Forbes' wife Sue (Jane Wyatt), and their son Tommy (Jimmy Hunt) are all outside. She overhears their conversation and realizes her lovers' marital status. When he recovers, Forbes meets Mona and she breaks off the affair, not wanting to destroy his family. Forbes rededicates himself to his wife, son and career, feeling a new contentment. Meanwhile, Mac continues to stalk Mona, both at her job and at home; she tells him bluntly that she does not like him, but he is not deterred. She contacts Forbes to tell him that when she threatened to call police, Mac in turn threatened to tell Sue about the affair. Forbes goes to Mac's apartment and repays him for the beating, promising to kill him if he ever talks about his family again. Mac visits Smiley in prison and drops broad hints that Mona has been fooling around with the insurance adjuster. Shortly, Mona learns that her cooperation had an effect and that Smiley is getting out of jail imminently. She visits him the day before and he angrily asks about both Mac and Forbes; he sees that she is not wearing the engagement ring he had given her with the stolen funds. Mona tells Forbes how Mac has been visiting Smiley and provoking him. At home, Sue, who has not believed the story that her husband told her about being beaten up by muggers, probes him to tell her what is on his mind. As he is about to do so, their son has a nightmare; the subject is dropped. When Smiley is freed, Mona finds him in her apartment drinking. He has a gun given to him by Mac, and wants to know from her why Mac wants him to kill Forbes. Mona admits the affair but begs him to understand it is over. He says he can forgive her, but not Forbes, and leaves. Mona telephones Forbes to warn him; Forbes tries to get Sue and Tommy to leave but fails. He tells Sue that a man from the office is coming to talk to him. He waits in the dark for Smiley, with his own gun; when the man arrives, Forbes manages to sneak up and order him to leave, but Smiley does not and breaks a window to enter the house. Forbes shoots him dead. Thinking that both his rivals are taken care of, Mac shows up at Mona's, fully expecting her to go away with him. She shoots him. Forbes allows the police to think that he has killed a prowler, and after they are gone, he finally confesses everything to Sue. Over her objections, and after walking the streets all night, he also tells all to the District Attorney (John Litel). The DA reluctantly pronounces that Johnny is safe because it was justifiable homicide; his story matches up with Mona's, who is now in custody. The charge against her will depend on whether Mac lives or dies. Outside, Sue is waiting for Forbes. She says she will give him a second chance, though she is not sure their marriage will ever be the same.

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1919 to 1946 for Hindmarsh, from 1954 to 1955 for Sturt, and from 1955 to 1963 for Bonython. He was Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives from 1929 to 1932 and served as Minister for the Navy, Minister for Munitions (1941‚Äì1946) and Minister for Aircraft Production (1945‚Äì1946) under John Curtin, Frank Forde and Ben Chifley. He was the first President of the United Nations Security Council in 1946, and served as Ambassador to the United States from 1946 to 1951. Early life Makin was born in Petersham, New South Wales, the son of an itinerant worker. His family moved to Melbourne in 1891 and to Broken Hill in 1898, where he attended Broken Hill Superior Public School. He left school at thirteen and became a parcel boy for Boan Bros. drapers. He was a member of the Shop Assistants' Union at fourteen; he worked for two stationers and newsagents, sold The Barrier Miner in the streets of Broken Hill, and was chief assistant at the C. Day & Co bookstore at eighteen. He was largely self-educated and became a keen reader, and was involved in local debating and literary societies. In 1909, while still a shop assistant, he was a witness for the defence at the conspiracy trial of trade unionist Tom Mann. At eighteen, Makin undertook an apprenticeship in pattern-making and engineering, and was employed in various mines; he joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. He moved to Adelaide in 1911, and married Ruby Florence Jennings on 10 August 1912. He worked in a Kapunda foundry, and for James Martin & Co at Gawler. He had difficulty finding work at times due to his political activities, and returned to Broken Hill for a period, but returned to Adelaide in 1914 to work at Gray Bros. at Port Adelaide, and then in the Islington Railway Workshops. Having been involved in the labour movement from an early age, Makin was president of the North Adelaide district branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers in 1914 and secretary of its political committee in 1917. He was an unsuccessful Labor candidate for Barossa at the 1915 state election, reportedly riding over 2000 miles during the campaign, and again for Wakefield at the 1917 federal election. He publicly campaigned against conscription during World War I, and was president of the South Australian branch of the Labor Party from 1918 to 1919, in the aftermath of the 1916 Labor split over the issue. In 1918, he published a book on the progress of the labour movement in South Australia entitled A Progressive Democracy. Makin was a lifelong Methodist, and in 1977 received a certificate from the church commending him on having been a lay preacher for seventy years. Early political career Makin in 1930, as Speaker of the House of Representatives Makin was elected to the House of Representatives for Hindmarsh at the 1919 federal election, defeating Nationalist MP and 1916 Labor defector William Archibald in an acrimonious campaign. He was re-elected without difficulty in 1922, 1925 and 1928, reverting Hindmarsh to its traditional status as a safe Labor seat. He spent ten years in Opposition before the election of the Scullin Labor government in 1929. While in opposition, he served as secretary to the Labor caucus and had been touted in 1925 as a potential successor to John Gunn as state Labor leader and Premier of South Australia. Upon the election of the Scullin government, Makin was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, defeating four candidates in the Labor selection vote. As with his Labor predecessor Charles McDonald, he declined the ceremonial wig and gown. He was described as having been a \\"well-respected\\" Speaker, and was commended for his \\"dignity and impartiality\\" as Speaker as the 1931 Labor split unfolded. Following the defeat of the Scullin government in 1931 amidst the split, Makin was an outspoken loyalist of official Labor, alleging that he had been subject to an attempt to bribe him to leave the party, condemning both the pro- Premiers' Plan and Lang Labor defectors, and repeatedly clashing with Premier Lionel Hill. His staunch opposition to the Premiers' Plan led to him being rumoured as a potential challenger to Scullin for the federal Labor leadership, although he denied interest and no challenge eventuated. At the 1931 federal election, Makin was the only Labor member elected from South Australia. During his second stint in opposition in the 1930s, he was again secretary of the Labor caucus, and served as federal president of the Labor Party from 1936 to 1938. He stood for leader of the Labor Party in 1935, following Scullin's resignation, but received only two votes. He shifted his vote to John Curtin on the second ballot, allowing him to win by a single vote over Frank Forde.McMullin, Ross (1991). The Light on the Hill: The Australian Labor Party 1891‚Äì1991, Oxford University Press, pp. 185‚Äì186. Makin was one of the three Labor members on the Advisory War Council from October 1940. By 1941, when Labor returned to power under John Curtin, of who Makin was a close supporter, Makin had an undeniable claim to office, and became Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions ‚Äì key posts in a wartime government. In 1945 he also became Minister for Aircraft Production. He established good relations with service chiefs and played an important role in Australia's successful transition to a wartime economy. He advocated for munitions factories to be retained in government control and adapted to civilian use to boost post-war manufacturing. When Curtin died in 1945, Makin contested the leadership ballot along with Ben Chifley and caretaker Prime Minister Frank Forde. He was unsuccessful, winning only seven votes out of 70 caucus members. Diplomat Makin had sought a diplomatic post as early as 1944 and had been in consideration for the positions of High Commissioner to Canada and High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, but he had been convinced by Curtin that he could not be spared. He was Acting Minister for External Affairs for four months during the absence overseas of H. V. Evatt until January 1946 while negotiations for the Australian‚ÄìThai Peace Treaty took place and Australia re- established a Commissioner in Singapore. In January 1946, he was selected by Chifley to lead the Australian delegation to the first General Assembly of the United Nations, having previously represented Australia at the London conference in early 1945. The government had initially planned to send only an official delegation to the United Nations, but made a late decision to send Makin after significant criticism that the lack of ministerial presence was inadequate for the importance of the event. The selection of Makin was nonetheless criticised by the opposition and some media due to a perception that he lacked experience in external affairs and did not have the stature of a figure such as Evatt. On 14 January 1946, the day Makin arrived in London, Australia won a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council; as the provisional rules appointed the body's president by rotation among members in alphabetical order, Makin became the first President of the United Nations Security Council from 17 January to 16 February that year and presided over its first meeting. He described it as \\"the most impressive day of my life\\". His presidency included responses to the Iran crisis of 1946, the Indonesian National Revolution and the presence of British troops in Greece, and the appointment of the first Secretary-General. Canadian journalist Ross Munro, in comments widely reported in the Australian press, sharply criticised Makin's tenure as President of the Security Council, claiming that he was insufficiently strong or decisive, that Makin seemed \\"uncertain about procedural matters\\" and was hesitant in applying and interpreting the United Nations Charter; Munro quoted one delegate who had commented that Makin \\"seemed overawed\\", and other correspondents that he \\"was too anxious to please\\". The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Makin's chairmanship had been \\"scathingly criticised in the lobbies\\" in England, while The Daily Mirror defended Makin, stating that he had \\"conducted proceedings with scrupulous fairness, great care, obvious sincerity and no small degree of skill\\", and deriding what they labelled a \\"campaign to belittle and disparage\\" him. He again served as President of the Security Council when the presidency returned to Australia in January 1947. In June 1946, Chifley announced that Makin would be appointed as Australian Ambassador to the United States, a decision that had been expected since December 1945, while also elevating the position in rank from resident minister. He arrived in Washington, D.C. and presented his credentials in September. He retained his Cabinet posts until the 1946 election, reportedly because Chifley was unsure whether his desired successor would replace Makin. The United States ambassadorship was a position of great importance in the gathering Cold War atmosphere of the post-war years, atop a rapidly-expanding Australian presence in Washington. The teetotal Makin found the cocktail party circuit \\"arduous\\", and although he acknowledged the opportunities for more informal diplomacy, resented the limitations of the demanding social calendar on his home life. His practice of drinking only orange juice at such events was described as \\"almost unique among high-living diplomats\\". In 1947, he was involved in canvassing support in the United Nations for the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, and signed the papers bringing Australia into the International Monetary Fund. He remained in the post after Labor lost government to Robert Menzies in 1949, and served until 1951. His last official act as ambassador was to read the opening prayers for the United States Senate. Return to politics and later life After leaving his diplomatic post, Makin returned to Australia. In October 1951, several months after his return, he campaigned for a \\"no\\" vote in the 1951 referendum on banning the Communist Party. In 1954, he decided to return to electoral politics, although he was by then 65 years old. At the 1954 election he captured the marginal Liberal seat of Sturt for Labor, defeating incumbent Keith Wilson with a 53 percent primary and two-party vote from a 5.4 percent swing. Sturt was significantly redistributed prior to the 1955 election. Most of the Labor-friendly territory in Sturt was shifted to the newly created Bonython. While this redistribution made Sturt notionally Liberal, Bonython was notionally a comfortably safe Labor seat. Makin opted to transfer to Bonython, a move which proved prescient; while Makin won Bonython easily, Wilson retook Sturt for the Liberals almost as easily. While still a Member of Parliament in 1961 he authored a book with brief biographies of all leaders of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party until that time.Norman Makin (1961), Federal Labour Leaders, Union Printing, Sydney, New South Wales He retired at the 1963 election, following an amendment to Labor Party rules that introduced a mandatory retirement age of seventy, though Makin unsuccessfully appealed the decision to the federal executive. He remained active in Labor affairs for many years following his retirement. He died in 1982 at the age of 93, at Glenelg, where he had spent his last years in a Uniting Church aged care home, and was cremated. He was survived by two sons, who published Makin's memoirs, The Memoirs of Norman John Oswald Makin, 31 March 1889 ‚Äì 20 July 1982, posthumously later that year. He was the second-last surviving member of the Curtin Cabinet behind Frank Forde, who died the following year. Honours He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1980 Australia Day Honours. The House of Representatives electorate of Makin, established in 1984 in Adelaide's northeastern suburbs, is named after him.

It is located between the Dalyston - Glen Forbes Road and Loch-Wonthaggi Road, on the Archies Creek Road, in the Bass Coast Shire, north-west of Wonthaggi. Much of the development in this particular corner of South Gippsland was due to the discovery of coal at Cape Paterson in 1825‚Äì26. But it was far more than just coal which caused this area to grow. Many pioneers had realised the potential of the land and had begun clearing it to raise cattle and sheep long before coal mining began in 1859. Early records indicate that a factory was established at Archies Creek in the late 1800s but very little development actually took place in the township until after the turn of the century. In 1902, when an application was made for a hotel licence by Mrs Mary A Dixon, it appeared that the only other business in the town was the Melbourne Chilled Butter Factory. This privately owned factory was sold to the Wonthaggi Dairy Produce Company in 1903 for the sum of 800 pounds. It was run as a co- operative with local dairy farmers on the Board to control operations and built up a world-wide reputation for quality butter and other dairy products. The township was well established when, on 14 August 1902, a group of men met in the Royal Mail Hotel to discuss the possibility of building a public hall. Jas Dixon offered to buy the land and the local people were canvassed to raise the 200 pounds required for its construction. The Grand Ball to mark its opening occurred on 1 January 1904, with tickets admitting two ladies and one gentlemen costing 5 shillings. Dances were often held on the full moon to provide the light for the men on horses to find their way back home. As the old hall deteriorated over time a new brick hall was built in 1958. In February 1963 the first wedding of Mary and Graeme Mabin was catered for by the Ladies Committee. The butter factory was the life blood of Archies Creek. It provided employment for over 200 people at the peak of the operations and was at the forefront of dairy factory development in Australia. It became one of the first dairy factories to transport milk in bulk tankers, starting a pilot scheme in 1957.Back to Archies Creek - 1985 The Post Office, Archie's Creek, opened on 17 November 1899 and closed in 1986 The Postmaster at the time was Michael Bentick. Archies Creek was the seat of the Shire of Bass until it amalgamated in 1994 and is now in the Bass Coast Shire. In May 2019 the inaugural Archies Bald Portrait Prize was held at the Archies Creek Hall. Inspired by Deb Rielly, a paramedic and cancer sufferer who died in April 2019, who suffered taunts because she refused to wear a wig or scarf when she lost her hair due to chemotherapy, the local community art gallery, ArtSpace,http://www.artspacewonthaggi.com.au along with the Hall, organised a painting and sculptural exhibition in honour of the beauty of the hairless head. A sold out Biggest Morning Tea raised money for Cancer Research. It is now an annual event.

It is on Suffolk's border with Essex, which is marked by the River Stour, approximately from Colchester and from Bury St Edmunds. It is one of Suffolk's \\"wool towns\\" and is a former market town. The parish also includes the hamlets of Bridge Street and Cuckoo Tye. Its name is derived from the nature of the village's layout (originally concentrated along a 3-mile stretch of a single road) and the Mill ford crossing the Chad Brook (a tributary of the River Stour).  History  Prehistoric finds discovered in 2011 have shown that early settlement of what is now known as Long Melford dates back to the Mesolithic period, up to 8300 BC. In addition, Iron Age finds were made in the same year, and again were found within the largely central area of the current village. The Romans constructed two roads through Long Melford, the main one running from Chelmsford to Pakenham. Roman remains were discovered in a gravel pit in 1828, a site now occupied by the village's football club. In 1997 Roman finds were uncovered including complete skeletons with one in a stone coffin, part of the original Roman Road, complete Samian pottery in a villager's garden. In June 2013, some archaeological evidence of a Saxon and Bronze Age settlement in the northern area of the village was discovered by Carenza Lewis and her team from Cambridge University, during a student dig. = Middle Ages = The Manor of Melford was given to the Abbey of St. Edmundsbury by Earl Aflric c. 1050. The village is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, which lists the manor of Long Melford as an estate of 600 hectares. The neighbouring Manor of Kentwell is also recorded. During the Middle Ages the village grew and gained a weekly market and an annual fair in 1235. Long Melford survived the Black Death in 1348-9, and was a brief stop- off in the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. By the early 15th century, the manor of Kentwell belonged to the Clopton family. John Clopton was arrested in 1461 and charged with treason. Clopton was spared execution and he was released and returned to Kentwell. There he organised and largely helped to pay for the rebuilding of the parish church, a notable example of a wool church. During this time the wealth of the parish was increasing, with most of the inhabitants being free men, renting their homes and lands. Guilds were founded, and weaving cloth became a key part of the village's economy. In the official inspector's returns for the year 1446, there were as many as 30 named weavers in Long Melford, who between them produced 264 finished \\"cloths\\". Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry VIII granted the manor to Sir William Cordell. = Modern era = In 1604, an epidemic of the plague arrived in Melford and 119 people died between the months of May and September. During the English Civil War, a Puritan mob of over one thousand arrived in Melford pursuing Elizabeth Savage, Countess Rivers, a staunch Catholic and Royalist, from her property in St Osyth to her Suffolk estate at Melford Hall. The hall was sacked and plundered and the Countess fled to Bury St Edmunds, then to London where eventually she was imprisoned for debt and died a pauper. By the end of the 17th century, cloth production had once again become important in the area as many new entrepreneurs started to produce a range of materials known as 'Bays and Says', similar to baize and serge.David Hatton, Clare, Suffolk, an account of historical features of the town, its Priory and its Parish Church, 2006 ; p. 20 These were lighter, cheaper types of cloth than the traditional woollen broadcloths that had been made in the 15th and 16th centuries but, once again, many of the cloth merchants became extremely wealthy and for some years prosperity returned to Melford. Soon after the beginning of the 19th century, a range of new industries such as horsehair weaving, an iron foundry, a flax works and coconut matting started in Melford. By 1851, there were three horsehair manufacturers in Melford employing over 200 men, women and children. Prince Bertie, who later became King Edward VII, together with Princess Alexandra visited the village in November 1865, and large archways were constructed at key points in their honour to welcome them in, with the crowds. During the 1880s, a series of wage cuts in the coconut industry caused widespread anger and eventually resulted in strike action. Feelings ran high, culminating in a riot breaking out on polling day in December 1885, during which considerable damage was caused throughout the village. Troops were summoned from Bury St Edmunds to restore order; they arrived by train and marched from Melford station to read the Riot Act from the steps of the Police Station. In World War I, hundreds of village men volunteered to serve their country. They joined many diverse army regiments, such as the Scots Guards, Prince of Wales Regiment, Royal Engineers, the Suffolk Regiment, serving in Gallipoli, Ypres, the Somme and numerous military campaigns. Other men fought in the Royal Navy, and the newly formed Royal Flying Corps. The personal stories of these 1,100 men and how the war affected the village is found in Long Melford and the Great War ‚Äì The Stories of a Thousand Lives by David Gevaux.https://www.suffolkfreepress.co.uk/news/historian-sheds-light-on-long- melford-during-first-world-war-in-new- book-9047138/https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/first-world-war-book-on-long-melford- in-suffolk-is-published-1-5744260In October 1920, the village war memorial was unveiled, and is located at the entrance of the Holy Trinity Church. During World War II, Long Melford was a location for American and Allied service personnel, who flew B24 and B17 aircraft from two large bomber stations, RAF Lavenham and RAF Sudbury, located nearby. Troops from, amongst others, the Berkshire and Black Watch Regiments, were billeted and garrisoned within the village. Injured airmen, troops from the D-Day landings and prisoners of war were treated at the large nearby 136th Station Hospital, located between Long Melford and Acton. Band leader Glenn Miller and his orchestra briefly visited Long Melford and played to injured airmen, invited locals and hospital staff at the 136th hospital in 1944. German prisoners of war were interned at a camp near the 136th Station Hospital, and Italian prisoners were located at a camp at the nearby village of Borley. USAF personnel from bases at Lakenheath, Mildenhall, and Wethersfield airbases often lived within Long Melford. By the end of the war, two B24 Liberators, one B17 Flying Fortress and one RAF de Havilland Mosquito had crashed in the parish with over twenty persons killed or injured. Numerous pillboxes and temporary gun emplacements were constructed in the village during the war, and in 2012 a previously unknown underground bunker room was located. According to the Remembrance Plaque at Holy Trinity Church, ninety-six serving villagers were killed in World War One, and eleven during World War Two.  Governance  An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes Alpheton and has a total population at the 2011 Census of 3,774.  Buildings  The size and architecture of Holy Trinity Church make it unusual for a village parish church, and it was the only church in Suffolk to receive five stars in Simon Jenkins' book \\"England's Thousand Best Churches\\". The church dates from the reign of Edward the Confessor; it was then substantially rebuilt between 1467 and 1497 by John Clopton of Kentwell Hall. It is one of the richest \\"wool churches\\" in East Anglia and is noted for its flushwork, Clopton chantry chapel and the Lady Chapel at the east end with some surviving medieval stained-glass. Edmund Blunden, the World War I poet, is buried in the churchyard. Next to the church is the Hospital of the Holy and Blessed Trinity, an almshouse founded by William Cordell in 1573 and restored in 1847. The village contains two stately homes, Kentwell Hall and Melford Hall, both visited by Queen Elizabeth I, and all built from the proceeds of the wool trade in the Middle Ages. Kentwell Hall and Holy Trinity Church were financed by the Clopton family, in particular by John Clopton. Both Kentwell Hall and Melford Hall are open to the general public, with Melford Hall being a National Trust property. The village has 100 listed buildings, including many of the inns that were built along its main street. The village's history is recorded in the Long Melford Heritage Centre, and contains finds uncovered in the July 2011 Long Melford Dig. There are also displays of old photographs, and ancient finds from the village, including a collection of locally found Roman artefacts.  Education  The village contains one school, Long Melford Church of England Primary School. Opened in 1974, it has been part of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich Diocesan Multi Academy Trust since 2016. The village's previous school was built in 1860, in the Elizabethan style, enlarged in 1895 and is now a community centre.  Transport  Long Melford once had a railway station on the Stour Valley Line, but this closed in March 1967 when the line was cut back to Sudbury. It is connected to several large towns by bus, notably Sudbury, Colchester, Bury St Edmunds, Haverhill and Ipswich.  Sport and leisure  Long Melford has a Non-League football club, Long Melford F.C., which plays at Stoneylands, just off St Catherine's Road. They are members of the Eastern Counties League Premier Division following promotion as champions of Division One in the 2014/15 season. The village's large elongated village green was dominated until the 1980s by a group of great elms that included one of the largest in England.Photographs of Long Melford elms in Oliver Rackham, A History of the Countryside (London, 1986) and in Francis Frith Collection, images.francisfrith.com The elms were painted in 1940 by the watercolourist S. R. Badmin in his 'Long Melford Green on a Frosty Morning', now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.Victoria and Albert Museum, collections.vam.ac.uk, 'Long Melford Green on a frosty morning' Long Melford has a large water meadow on the approach to Liston and a network of footpaths. Among these paths is the Melford Walk, which follows the route of the disused railway line before joining the Valley Walk path to Sudbury. The Suffolk Cycle Route also passes through the village. Located at the southern end of the village next to the River Stour in the adjoining hamlet of Rodbridge Corner is Long Melford Country Park. This was formed by gravel excavations for nearby airfields during the second world war, leaving some large, attractive lakes with wildlife habitats and walking areas for visitors. The Long Melford Street Fair, Classic Steam Rally and the Big Night Out Guy Fawkes Night fireworks event at Melford Hall are held annually.  In popular culture  Long Melford was visited by Daniel Defoe, who mentioned the village in his book A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain. Defoe wrote, \\"Near adjoining to it [Sudbury] is a village call'd Long-Melfort, and a very long one it is, from which I suppose it had that addition to its name; it is full of very good houses, and, as they told me, is richer, and has more wealthy masters of the manufacture in it, than in Sudbury itself.\\"Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain was published in 3 vols. in 1724‚Äì26; Defoe's travels were made at various times before 1723. Drabble, Margaret, ed. Oxford Companion to English Literature entry for Defoe, Daniel Between 1962 and 1967 Peter Pears and Benjamin Britten organised a series of Bach Weekends at Holy Trinity Church, with guests including the English Chamber Orchestra. A performance of Christmas Oratorio from 1967 was recorded for BBC Television. The Bull Hotel in Long Melford, England The Bull Hotel in Long Melford features in the BBC documentary The World of John and Yoko. Melford village, and many of the buildings surrounding it were used as settings for the BBC television series Lovejoy. The 1968 film Witch Finder General and Terry Jones's film Wind in the Willows were both partially shot in Long Melford. The frontage of Kentwell Hall was digitally added into the 2005 film, The Chronicles of Narnia. The Long Melford Dig was filmed and documented in Michael Wood's 2012 BBC series The Great British Story. In early July 2014, Kentwell Hall was used as a location for the filming of Tulip Fever. Long Melford was rated by a Times article in September 2015, as being one of the Top Ten most desirable villages in Britain.  Notable residents  The World War I poet Edmund Blunden lived, and is buried, in Long Melford; the opera singer Mignon Nevada died here; and racing driver Richard Seaman lived at Kentwell Hall during part of his childhood. England international footballer William Cobbold was born in the village, as was editor of The Times, Wickham Steed. The notorious 17th century witch-hunter John Stearne, one of the two main instigators of the Bury St Edmunds witch trials, grew up in Long Melford . The children's author Beatrix Potter was a cousin of Ethel, Lady Hyde Parker, of Melford Hall, and was a frequent visitor there between 1899 and 1916. In the 20th century, artist Francis Bacon was a regular visitor to Long Melford, and his longtime companion and heir John Edwards subsequently bought a house there.. The lawyer and Liberal Democrat peer Andrew Phillips, Baron Phillips of Sudbury was born in Long Melford.

Plot Cindy Liggett (Sharon Stone) is waiting on death row for a brutal double murder she committed in her teens, 12 years earlier. Clemency lawyer Rick Hayes (Rob Morrow) tries to save her, based on the argument that she was under the influence of crack cocaine when she committed the crime of which she was found guilty and that she is no longer the same person she had been at the time of the murder. However, her death sentence is carried out.

Sharon Stone was nominated for a Razzie Award in 1997 for \\"Worst New Star\\" based on her role in the film (as the new \\"serious\\" Sharon Stone).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116827/awards?ref_=tt_awd Last Dance received negative reviews from critics. It currently holds a 32% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. Sharon Stone was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst New Star (as the new serious Sharon Stone) for this film and Diabolique, where she lost to Pamela Anderson for Barb Wire. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt the film handled \\"potentially powerful material thoughtfully\\" and made a \\"good showcase for Stone\\". However, he pointed out that the film suffered from the \\"inescapable misfortune\\" of being following too soon after the \\"unquestioned masterpiece\\" of Dead Man Walking. In comparison, Ebert felt Last Dance \\"comes across as earnest but unoriginal\\". James Berardinelli of ReelViews also felt Dead Man Walking was \\"far superior\\". He felt Last Dance was a \\"less compelling tale\\" and \\"a little too safe\\", with \\"a little too much manipulation and melodrama\\". He praised Stone as giving the \\"most impressive performance of a rather lackluster career\\", but criticized Morrow as \\"leav[ing] something to be desired\\". He concluded that Last Dance is \\"perfectly watchable, and even worth a marginal recommendation, [but] in comparison to Dead Man Walking, it feels diluted.\\" Janet Maslin of the New York Times praised Stone's \\"stellar presence and surprisingly intense performance\\" in the film, describing her \\"dead-end role\\" as the film's \\"lifesaver\\". However, she was critical of the overall film, stating: \\"...soon the story begins taking sentimental turns, and even Ms. Stone's startling ferocity gets buried in sludge.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was unfavorable of the film and concluded: \\"Last Dance is a prison melodrama that embraces all the cliches that Dead Man Walking artfully dodged. Last Dance acts tough, but its heart is pure soap opera.\\" Desson Howe of The Washington Post was also critical of the film, suggesting that the film \\"isn't quite \\"Dumb Blonde Walking\\", but that satirical slur isn't so far off the mark\\". He described the film as \\"formulaic\\" with a \\"strangely distancing\\" emotional effect. Barbara Shulgasser of the San Francisco Chronicle described the film as \\"simplistic, puerile rubbish\\", adding that Stone needed to \\"start picking difficult material if she really wants to become an actress\\". Edward Guthmann of the same newspaper felt the film had \\"able\\" direction and acting, but that Dead Man Walking was \\"far superior\\". He praised Stone's performance, but added: \\"The moments when Last Dance doesn't gloss over Stone's character are the best, and they make you wish the movie had been restructured.\\" He described the film as an \\"earnest, unremarkable addition to the Hollywood canon of prison movies\\". Anne Billson of the UK newspaper The Telegraph felt Stone \\"emerges from this enterprise with a certain amount of dignity\\", unlike Morrow who is given \\"a wilfully unsympathetic role\\". She described the film as providing the \\"usual compendium of clich√©s\\".

It is typically formed into balls of approximately 6 cm diameter, which are often covered in za'atar and Aleppo pepper, and then aged and dried. The most common spice is thyme, thus giving the cheese its appearance somewhat resembling a rum ball. Shanklish is also sold in much smaller balls or unformed. In Egypt, shanklish is made by fermenting Areesh cheese, usually called mesh. Shanklish varies greatly in its texture and flavour. Fresh cheeses have a soft texture and mild flavour; those dried and aged for a longer period become progressively harder and can acquire an extremely pungent odour and flavour. To make spicier cheeses, spices such as aniseed and chilli can be mixed in before the cheese is formed into balls. Spicy shanklish are often covered in chilli, especially in Syria, thus appear red. Shanklish from the Syrian coastal plain around Tartus and the adjoining northern Lebanese region of Akkar are considered particularly delectable; these tend to be hard, with a clean strong flavour and near-white colour. Shanklish is generally eaten with finely-chopped tomato, onion, and olive oil; and often accompanied by araq. It is a common meze dish. Shanklish is also mashed up with eggs or crushed in a pita with cucumbers, mint, and olive oil for breakfast.

Its local government area is the Shire of Nillumbik. At the , Arthurs Creek had a population of 496. It is named after Henry Arthur, a member of John Batman's Port Phillip Association and nephew of George Arthur, a governor of Tasmania. Another source says that it was named by the surveryor Thomas Nutt, supposedly because one of his party, a Mr Arthur, died and was buried in this location.  History  The proclamation of the Duffy Land Act in 1862 saw the beginning of the permanent settlement at Arthurs Creek. Arthurs Creek began as a horticultural settlement with numerous orchards, with the Post Office opening on 7 October 1889 (it closed in 1972). After the First World War, cattle and sheep farms replaced orchards as the principal industry. Today, the land-holdings of Arthurs Creek are a mixture of smaller farm properties including vineyards, orchards, and life-style properties. The township of Arthurs Creek consists of a primary school, Mechanic's Institute Hall, CFA Station and a Uniting church. There is also a cricket oval known as Ryders Flat and the Arthurs Creek Cemetery, dating back to the 1840s. The Hazel Glen Cemetery, now the Arthurs Creek Cemetery, was established by Patrick Reid as a private burial ground for his young wife Agnes (nee Hay) who died on 17 May 1847 at the early age of 49. Agnes had expressed a wish to be buried at her favourite picnic spot on the nearby hilltop overlooking the Hazel Glen homestead and former Stewart‚Äôs Ponds pastoral run.

Tietz was the first to carry out the idea of the department store in Germany and founded the chain store later known as \\"Hertie\\", which existed until its takeover by Karstadt in 1993. In 1882, the first department store of Tietz was opened in Gera (Thuringia, Germany) by his nephew Oskar Tietz. Oskar's brother Leonhard Tietz later founded his own chain store (\\"Kaufhof\\"). After stores in smaller towns like Bamberg, Erfurt, Rostock, Stralsund und Wismar had been successful, Tietz established his first department store in Berlin. In 1900, Herrmann Tietz opened a store in Leipziger Stra√üe, where it was located close to the department store Wertheim, the biggest store in Europe at the time. In 1904, Tietz opened another luxurious store at Alexanderplatz. The impressive and palace-like stores were designed to offer the customers a unique shopping experience. Another example is the Alsterhaus in Hamburg (established in 1912). With ten department stores Tietz was the largest chain in Berlin. In 1927 some 13,000 employees worked in the Tietz department stores. The Tietz family divided the German market into two spheres of interest. Herrmann and Oscar Tietz concentrated on the South and East, while Leonhard Tietz (\\"Kaufhof\\") was active in the West and in Belgium. In the Third Reich, all businesses of the Tietz family were \\"Aryanized\\" (i.e. seized and given to new owners) and the family members emigrated. In 1933, Georg Karg, the new owner, changed the company‚Äôs name to the less Jewish-sounding \\"Hertie Department Stores\\" as an abbreviation of Hermann Tietz.https://www.hertie-school.org/the- governance-post/2016/08/story-name-talking-herties-darker-past/ Hertie was acquired by its competitor Karstadt in 1994,http://www.company- histories.com/Karstadt-Quelle-AG-Company-History.html and the Hertie stores were gradually converted to Karstadt outlets.

The original band, existing with various lineups for approximately two years, first comprised vocalist Tesco Vee (A.K.A.

Vee then relocated from Michigan to Washington D.C. in the fall of 1983, dissolving the Crippled Children Suck lineup and assembling a new band consisting of members of several DC hardcore bands.

For the 1986 follow-up Rock 'N' Roll Juggernaut, released on Caroline Records, lead guitarist James Cooper (later of Battalion of Saints) replaced Baker. Following a solo Vee single, \\"Twisted Road,\\" issued in 1987 by Forced Exposure under the name the Tesco Vee Experience, Caroline issued a live Meatmen album, We're the Meatmen...

Biography Born in Sydney, Australia, Sinclair rose to fame in the 1960s and early 1970s firstly on New Zealand radio and then as host of Let's Go, Happen Inn and C'mon, New Zealand's primary rock music television shows of the time. In the late 1970s he reinvented his place in New Zealand television as presenter and quizmaster on University Challenge and Mastermind, two popular television quiz shows which ran until the late 1980s. Sinclair's measured on-screen personality was suited to these kinds of interactive game shows. As a quizmaster he made the phrase \\"I've started, so I'll finish...\\" (originally coined by Magnus Magnusson on the British version of Mastermind), a New Zealand cultural clich√©. Sinclair also hosted the 1982 Mastermind International contest in New Zealand. Sinclair was also a noted writer, penning a novel called The Frontman and writing regular columns for the New Zealand Herald newspaper. In later years he was a radio announcer from 1986, for Radio Avon, in Christchurch, the city he grew up in, which became C93FM, before moving on to Classic Hits FM and finally Easy Listening i98FM, hosting the popular Lovesongs till Midnight program. While still in Christchurch he helped raise money to build a Police Kiosk in Cathedral Square, for people who needed a safe place to go at all times of the day in case of emergencies. In his later years, he developed a passion for computers and was one of the first New Zealanders to become actively involved with the Internet. He wrote widely on internet issues, software developments and content. In the 2001 Queen's Birthday Honours, Sinclair was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to broadcasting. Sinclair died in Auckland on 8 August 2001, from leukaemia, aged 62.

The 18th-century French playwright Charles-Georges Fenouillot de Falbaire de Quingey (1727‚Äì1800) died in Sainte- M√©n√©hould. It was the subprefecture of the arrondissement of Sainte-Menehould until its abolition in April 2017.D√©cret n¬∞ 2017-453 du 29 mars 2017 portant suppression de l'arrondissement de Sainte-Menehould (d√©partement de la Marne) History Dom P√©rignon, the Benedictine monk who made important contributions to the production and quality of Champagne wine, and is often (erroneously) credited with its invention, was born in Sainte-Menehould around 1638. As part of the county of Clermont-en-Argonne, Sainte-Menehould was in the Duchy of Lorraine until 1641, when the county was ceded to France; in 1648, it was granted as an appanage to Louis, le Grand Cond√©, effectively making it independent of Crown control. Cond√© established Sainte-Menehould as his capital and fortified it in 1652, when he was leader of the 1650-1653 civil war known as the Fronde des nobles. The military engineer Vauban worked on the fortifications as a member of Cond√©'s regiment; he changed sides when captured by a Royalist patrol in early 1653. Cond√©'s governor, the Comte de Montal surrendered the town in November 1653, allegedly in return for a payment of 50,000 pistoles. After his return to France in 1659, Cond√© retained Clermont, which remained in his family until the abolition of feudalism in France during the French Revolution in 1790. The next year, Louis XVI passed through the town during the Flight to Varennes, where he was recognized, allegedly on account of the similarity between his face and the image on the coinage. The royal party left the town before the significance of the king's recognition had been acted upon, but they were pursued along the road towards Varennes and arrested by Citizen Drouet the local postmaster. 130 years later Ste-Menehould was important in the Champagne Riots of 1910/1911.

This engagement is also known to the Kuomintang as the Battle of Liaohsi (Traditional Chinese: ÈÅºË•øÊúÉÊà∞), took place between September and November 1948 and lasted a total of 52 days. The campaign ended after the Nationalist forces suffered sweeping defeats across Manchuria, losing major cities of Jinzhou, Changchun and eventually Shenyang in the process, eventually leading to the capture of the whole of Manchuria by the Communist forces. The victory of the campaign resulted in the Communists achieving strategic numerical advantage over the Nationalists for the first time in its history.  Background  = Race for Manchuria = Manchuria, alternatively known as the Northeast China in contemporary accounts, was the most industrialized region in China. In the immediate aftermath of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Manchuria was placed under Soviet occupation. Both the Nationalists and the Communists began their expansion in the region after the Soviet withdrawal in March 1946. After the Communist Winter Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China, the PLA had expanded considerably in the Northeast, surpassing the Nationalists in total operational strength in Northeast China for the first time since the beginning of the civil war. In response to the deteriorating situation for the Nationalists, Chiang Kai-shek decided to replace Chen Cheng with Wei Lihuang as the commander of the Nationalist forces in the Northeast.  Prelude  Communist commanders (from left): Liu Yalou, Lin Biao and Luo Ronghuan In January 1948, the Communist forces in the Northeast were renamed as the Northeast Field Army with Lin Biao as the commander. The Nationalist forces were indecisive in responding to Communist expansion, as Wei Lihuang directly clashed with Chiang over Nationalist strategies in the Northeast. Wei believed that it was better to \\"preserve the status quo\\" and concentrate on defending Shenyang and Changchun, while Chiang insists Wei to withdraw from these two cities and concentrate Nationalist forces in the Jinzhou-Huludao area to prevent the PLA from entering the North China Plain through the Shanhai Pass. By spring 1948, the Communist forces were in control of the countryside across Northeast China, isolating the Nationalist forces in Shenyang, Changchun and Jinzhou from each other. In addition, the PLA had seized control of the Jingha Railway, cutting off the Nationalist land route supply lines to Shenyang and Changchun. Consequently, supplies for the Nationalist forces in the Northeast had to be airlifted, which were largely ineffective and unsustainable.  Communist advance (12 September ‚Äì 20 October)  = Jinzhou = Map showing the Liaoshen campaign as one of the three campaigns during the Chinese civil war Jinzhou was a \\"key point\\" in the Liaoxi Corridor, the principal land passage from Manchuria to North China Plain. On 12 September 1948, the Northeast Field Army headed south and launched a series of attacks along the Beining Railway. Between 12 September to 28 September, the Communist forces maneuvered to cut off Nationalist supply line from Qinhuangdao to Jinzhou. By 28 September, they had captured Suizhong, Changli, Tashan and Yixian, controlling the area between Jinzhou and Qinhuangdao, effectively isolating Jinzhou. Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Beiping on 30 September and held a military conference with Fu Zuoyi. The Nationalists assembled the 39th, 62nd and 92nd Army led by Hou Jingru to reinforce Jinzhou as part of the \\"East-Advancing Army Corps\\", with the objective to fortify Nationalist positions in Huludao. On 2 October, Chiang flew to Shenyang to discuss the formation of the \\"West-Advancing Army Corps\\" with Wei Lihuang, and ordered Liao Yaoxiang to reinforce Jinzhou with the 9th Army from the west to break the encirclement attempt of Jinzhou by the CCP. With the new developments in Nationalist strategies, Lin Biao was initially hesitant to continue with Communist offensive against Jinzhou, but he was convinced to carry on with the assault by Mao Zedong. By 8 October, the Northeast Field Army have amassed 250,000 troops and completed the encirclement of Jinzhou. Between 10 and 15 October, the Nationalist reinforcements for Jinzhou from both the west and the east were closing in on the Communists, but they were decisively stopped in Tashan. The final assault on Jinzhou began on 14 October. The city was captured in the next evening, along with the Nationalist commander Fan Hanjie and 80,000 Nationalist troops. = Changchun = Communist troops after the capture of Changchun Changchun had been encircled for more than five months prior to the campaign. Already weakened by starvation since February 1948, civilians were fleeing Changchun in large numbers on daily basis by June 1948. Many refugees were unable to pass through the Communist blockade, and unable to return as the Nationalist defenders blocks refugees from returning to the city. The Nationalist garrison were unable to break out of the city despite the order from Chiang. Following the fall of Jinzhou, the Nationalist 60th Army stationed in the east side of the city defected to the Communist side on 17 October. Following their defection, the Nationalist New 7th Army agreed to the terms of surrender on 19 October. The remaining Nationalist forces in Changchun surrendered the city to the PLA on 23 October, and Nationalist commander Zheng Dongguo became a prisoner of war.  Nationalist counter-offensive (21‚Äì28 October)  Battle of Heishan = Heishan = After the Nationalist forces suffered heavy losses in Jinzhou and Changchun, Chiang Kai-shek intended to stage a counteroffensive and quickly recapture Jinzhou. He ordered Liao Yaoxiang and the Ninth Army Group which had been advancing from Shenyang to continue marching west and attack Jinzhou. However, Liao and other senior Nationalist officers contested this decision. On 16 October, the Nationalist high command reached a consensus and decided to attack Heishan and Dahushan instead, covering their withdrawal to Yingkou in the process. The decision was approved by Chiang, and on 21 October the Ninth Army Group launched an attack on Heishan. The Communist forces successfully defended Heishan and Dahushan, and the Nationalist forces were unable to make any progress. The Ninth Army Group was subsequently encircled by the main forces of the PLA and decisively defeated. Over 25,000 Nationalist soldiers had been killed in action, and Liao Yaoxiang was captured by the PLA.  Fall of Shenyang (29 October ‚Äì 2 November)  People's Liberation Army and Type 97 Chi-Ha tanks advance into Shenyang. After the Ninth Army Group was destroyed, the Northeast Field Army began to encircle Shenyang on 29 October. As the city fell into disarray, the Nationalist's Eighth Army Group collapsed as the commander Wei Lihuang fled from Shenyang by plane on 30 October. The Communist forces launched the final assault on Shenyang the next morning on 1 November against the Nationalist garrison of 140,000 men, which quickly surrendered soon after. On 2 November, Yingkou was also captured by the Communist forces, with the Nationalist 52nd Army narrowly retreating by ship. The remainder of the Nationalist forces, mostly from the West Army, managed to preserve some of their strength as they withdrew from Huludao to Tianjin. With the Northeast being completely clear of the Nationalist forces, the Liaoshen campaign effectively came to its conclusion.  Aftermath  According to Lew, the Liaoshen campaign was both a major \\"strategic and tactical defeat\\" for Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist government, as the initial objective of containing the Communists in the Northeast failed after the fall of Jinzhou. Between 1945 and 1948, Chiang committed some of his best troops from the Chinese Expeditionary Force in the Northeast against the CCP, and many of these troops were lost in the subsequent campaigns. The role of Mao Zedong in pushing Lin Biao to fully commit in the final attack of Jinzhou elevated the reputation of Mao in the CCP. With the CCP fully in control of the Northeast, Nationalist garrisons in Beiping and Tianjin led by Fu Zuoyi were now exposed to Communist attacks.

Created by Nicholas P. Dallis with art by Alex Kotzky, the strip began May 8, 1961, initially distributed by the Publishers Syndicate, which later merged with King Features Syndicate in 1988. The strip went through several changes of writers and artists over its 54-year run, finally ending on November 22, 2015. Characters and story The strip's situations and characters were influenced by the pioneering soap opera strip Mary Worth as well as Rona Jaffe's bestselling 1958 novel The Best of Everything.Mary Worth at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on October 24, 2015. The three main characters are Margo Magee, a brunette who has variously held positions as a secretary, actors' agent, publicist and event planner; Abigail \\"Tommie\\" Thompson, a redheaded nurse; and Lu Ann Powers n√©e Wright, a blonde art teacher. The appearances of the three main characters were loosely based on real actresses: Tommie was based on Lucille Ball, Margo on Joan Collins and Lu Ann on Tuesday Weld.Mendez: Apartment 3-G Kindly neighbor Professor Aristotle Papagoras serves as a father figure. Lu Ann, originally single, met and married a U.S. Air Force pilot named Garth Powers (renamed Gary in a 2011 story arc) in 1964, after which she moved out of the apartment. She was replaced by another blonde, Beth Howard. Lu Ann's husband was later killed in Vietnam and she eventually moved back into the apartment, while Beth was written out after falling in love with young physician Lester Pride. There have been a number of other notable supporting characters in the comic strip throughout the years. Byron Frost was Margo's generally supportive boss from 1962 to 1990. Newton Figg (1966, 1971, 1977, 1980, 1986), the handsome but childlike author of children's books, talked to his pet stuffed animals as though they were real. Not surprisingly, he had some romantic challenges. Roberta Magee, Margo's temperamental mother, caused recurring troubles. When Lisa Trusiani took over scripting the strip, stories began to revolve more around family relations. Gabriella Gatica turns up in 1999 as Margo's biological mother, a maid that Margo's father had had an affair with. Blaze Wright, Lu Ann's employment-challenged cousin and an aspiring actor, first appeared in 1998 and appeared off and on through 2011. Ruby Wright followed in 2007 and turned out to be Lu Ann's biological mother.

Nicholas Peter Dallis (December 15, 1911 - July 6, 1991),\\"United States Social Security Death Index,\\" index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/JYDS-92X : accessed 12 Mar 2013), Nicholas P Dallis, 6 July 1991. known as Nick Dallis, was an American psychiatrist turned comic strip writer, creator of the soap opera-style strips Rex Morgan, M.D., Judge Parker and Apartment 3-G. Separating his comics career from his medical practice, he wrote under pseudonyms, Dal Curtis for Rex Morgan, M.D. and Paul Nichols for Judge Parker. Born in New York City, Nick Dallis grew up on Long Island. He graduated from Washington & Jefferson College in 1933 and from Temple University's medical school in 1938 and married a nurse, Sarah Luddy. He decided to specialize in psychiatry, and after World War II, started a practice in Toledo, Ohio.Mendez, E. \\"Remembering the Girls Next Door: Alex Kotzky and Apartment 3-G\\", 2006. Allen Saunders was chair at the time of the local mental hygiene center that invited him there, and in his autobiography, he recalled that Dallis approached him, as a well- known comics writer (Steve Roper and Mike Nomad, Mary Worth), about \\"his desire to write a comic strip, one tracing the history of medicine. I told him that, commendable as his idea was, such a feature would not succeed. Readers want entertainment, not enlightenment. But a story about a handsome young doctor's involvement with his patients might be a winner.\\"Saunders, Allen. 1986. Autobiography \\"Playwright for Paper Actors,\\", ch. 14, Nemo, the Classic Comics Library, no. 18. Comic strips After further conversations with Saunders on strip writing, Dallis successfully launched his Rex Morgan, M.D in 1948. Later, he found himself working more with troubled youth in juvenile court, and from his experiences there, he conceived a second strip focused on the legal world, Judge Parker, which took off in 1952 and also became successful. Both strips were in the soap opera tradition pioneered by Saunders, as continuities in which each story was basically distinct. And yet they differed from Mary Worth in centering on male protagonists who counseled their clients with professional advice as well as intervening to help them with personal problems. In addition, Dallis did manage to work in education and enlightenment for his readers, as well as entertainment. In 1958, he retired from medicine and moved to Arizona, where he continued to author his comics. In 1961, he launched his third strip, Apartment 3-G, about three young women sharing a Manhattan apartment. Dallis died in 1991, but all three of his strips survived over the years (with Apartment 3-G ending in 2015), and as of 2020 Judge Parker and Rex Morgan, M.D. continue in syndication. He was later remembered by his successor on two of his strips, Woody Wilson, as \\"a prince among men... educated, kindly, compassionate, talented and generous.\\"Boog, Jason. The Publishing Spot, June 21, 2007. Wilson honored Dallis in a striking manner in the episodes of November 30 and December 1, 2015 by giving Rex and June's baby boy the second name \\"Dallis\\"; when asked by his daughter why he and June had chosen this name, Rex replied, \\"Nick Dallis was a very good friend of ours, Princess.

He is the president of the Intelligence Summit. He is the president of The Intelligence Summit and president of the Florida Holocaust Museum in St. Petersburg. Loftus is an author of numerous books on a purported CIA-Nazi connection including The Belarus Secret and The Secret War Against the Jews, both of which contain material claiming a Bush-Rockefeller-Nazi connection. He currently writes a weekly column called \\"spyview\\" for the Ami magazine. Early career Son of a Boston firefighter, Loftus was born in Boston, Massachusetts and is a graduate of Boston College (BA, 1971) and Suffolk University (JD, 1977). He served in the U.S. Army from 1971 to 1974, attaining the rank of First Lieutenant. He began working for the US Department of Justice in 1977 and in 1979 joined their Office of Special Investigations, which was charged with prosecuting and deporting Nazi war criminals in the US. Loftus' now-expired Web site claimed, \\"As a young U.S. Army officer, John Loftus helped train Israelis on a covert operation that turned the tide of battle in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\\" Author America's Nazi secret: An Insider's History of How the United States Department of Justice Obstructed Congress by: Blocking Congressional Investigations into Famous American Families Who Funded Hitler, Stalin and Arab Terrorists Loftus is the author and co-author of several books on Nazis, espionage, and similar topics including The Belarus Secret (1982), Unholy Trinity: How the Vatican's Nazi Networks Betrayed Western Intelligence to the Soviets (1992), The Secret War Against the Jews: How Western Espionage Betrayed the Jewish People (1994), Unholy Trinity: The Vatican, the Nazis, and the Swiss Banks (1998), America's Nazi Secret: An Insider's History of How the United States Department of Justice Obstructed Congress by: Blocking Congressional Investigations into Famous American Families Who Funded Hitler, Stalin and Arab Terrorists (2010).

KTAV, 1994, p. 52 What Loftus had described as the Belarus secret is that many of the Belarus Brigade's leaders, a unit incorporated into a German SS division, were assisted into the United States after the Second world war ‚Äì thanks largely to the efforts of Frank Wisner. In defiance of federal law, Loftus asserted, the Office of Policy Coordination helped obtain visas for Nazi collaborators from Belarus ‚Äî who were believed to have facilitated numerous atrocities by the Nazi Germany. According to Loftus, it was all part of a Cold War scheme to wage guerrilla warfare in Soviet-occupied Europe, in which the Nazi collaborators were to play a key role. When the project collapsed, however, the Belarussians quickly settled in and obtained US citizenship ‚Äì and intelligence agencies protected them from exposure for decades.Richard Rashke: Useful Enemies: John Demjanjuk and America's Open-Door Policy For Nazi War Criminals (Delphinium Books, 2013) Google Books The New York Times wrote: \\"there is a question as to whether the author in his zealousness may not have overstated some of his material. He says 300 Byelorussian Nazis and an 'even larger number of Ukrainian Nazis' were smuggled in. But he fails to draw a distinction between documented war criminals and hangers-on and perhaps other less culpable collaborators. ... Still, The Belarus Secret is certain to be a valuable source book when Congress reopens hearings ... into allegations of a war criminal cover-up.\\" Radio talk show host Loftus previously had a radio show on Talkline Communications Network broadcast live every Monday and Tuesday from 11 pm to midnight EST in New York City, northern New Jersey, southern Connecticut, and Miami and Pompano Beach, Florida. His co-host was John Batchelor. Social critic Loftus serves as a media commentator, appearing regularly on ABC National Radio and Fox News. He also writes weekly for Ami, an Orthodox Jewish weekly newsmagazine. On August 7, 2005, he provided the United States address of an alleged terrorist named Iyad K. Hilal on Fox News. Only afterwards was it revealed that Hilal had left the address three years previously and the home was now owned by a family, which was then subjected to threats and vandalism and required police protection as a result of Loftus' words. Fox terminated Loftus's contract to commentate after the event. Loftus said \\"I thought it might help police in that area now that we have positively identified a terrorist,\\" but he did not say why he did not contact police in a more direct manner. Loftus apologized for the mistake and expressed frustration about \\"one federal [agency's]\\" inaction on an earlier tip he had given them years ago due to the same address.

When that deal foundered soon after the band's move from Belfast to London, in-fighting amongst the members of that band led rapidly to its split. Finding himself in the heart of London's clubland, Cunnah, already a producer, originally conceived D:Ream as a way of re-using songs from his previous band. With little by way of support in London, he teamed up with DJ Al Mackenzie on a series of dance records by a 'faceless' dance act which would be fronted live and on-record by a diva, leaving Cunnah free to concentrate on songwriting and production and Mackenzie free to concentrate on building a DJ reputation.

Initially performing as a duo, they received acclaim in clubs and found management and record and publishing deals.

In the , Wavell Heights had a population of 9,684 people.  Geography  Wavell Heights is located north of the Brisbane central business district. The land use is almost entirely residential, apart from Mercer Park and Shaw Park in the southernmost part of the suburb.  History  In December 1935 the Methodist Church bought four parcels of land in Rode Road. A timber-framed weatherboard-clad building opened on 28 May 1938 and was used for all church purposes: services, Sunday school and social activities. It was known as the West Nundah Methodist Church. The building was extended in 1947 to cater for a larger congregation. In 1957 a new brick church was opened beside the original building, which was then only used as a church hall. In 1977 the Methodist Church was amalgamated into the Uniting Church of Australia and the church and hall are now known as the Wavell Heights Uniting Church and Hall. The Catholic Church of St Paschal Baylon was opened and blessed by Archbishop James Duhig on 8 August 1937. Due to the growth in the congregation, a new building was constructed with the church on the lower floor and space for a school on the upper floor. In 1941 the Brisbane City Council requested that the area commonly known as West Nundah be recognised as Wavell Heights. It is named after Field Marshal Lord Wavell who was the Commander-In-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Middle East during the Second World War.

He currently hosts the Radio Hauraki breakfast show with Matt Heath. Wells also appears beside Hilary Barry on Seven Sharp.  Career  Wells first appeared on television in 1997 on MTV. He later appeared with Mikey Havoc, as Newsboy, on Havoc's television show. After the conclusion of Havoc, Wells and Havoc went their separate ways - Havoc fronting his own show on TV3 and Wells his for TVNZ, Eating Media Lunch. He also presented the satirical The Unauthorised History Of New Zealand in 2005 and an episode of Intrepid Journeys in 2007. Wells' impassive, deadpan style has been called \\"newsnight-of-the-living-dead\\" by the New Zealand Listener, and the same article claimed \\"Wells would be compelling viewing reading the phone book.\\" He became notorious in November 2003 when an episode of Eating Media Lunch featured a spoof of the current affairs programme Target, who often would use hidden cameras to catch less than reliable tradepersons or workers. In it, the spoof depicted two actors as Target camera technicians in someone else's home caught on hidden camera in various degrading acts such as masturbation, defecation (on a kitchen stove), injecting and smoking drugs and phone sex. Also, one technician stripped naked and covered himself with cling wrap, and later urinated on the other technician. The spoof attracted several complaints from viewers, however in March 2004 the BSA (Broadcasting Standards Authority) of New Zealand found the episode had not breached any guidelines. Wells and Havoc satirically labelled Gore the gay capital of New Zealand in 1999, during Havoc and Newsboy's Sell- out Tour. Returning to the town to cover the 2008 election, Wells was confronted by a group of fifteen men angry over the comments. The group started harassing him at a petrol station, and followed him back to his hotel room. They harassed him for ninety minutes and he was trapped in his hotel room until the police were called. Wells spent 23 days travelling with the 108 members of the NZSO in October 2010 and produced a documentary The Grand Tour, a product of his own interest in classical music. The programme contains several interviews with the musicians and support crew, including Dame Kiri Te Kanawa. Wells co-hosted The Saturday Special with Steve Simpson on bFM; the show continued when both hosts moved to Radio Hauraki. In 2014, Wells changed shows to become a co-host of the Radio Hauraki breakfast show, alongside Matt Heath and Laura McGoldrick. Since 2018, he has co-hosted TVNZ's Seven Sharp with Hillary Barry.

He was the country's first Prime Minister and held that position from September 24, 1973 until his fatal car accident under suspicious circumstances on July 7, 1978. Early career In the early 1960s PAIGC launched an armed struggle against Portuguese imperialism which would last more than a decade. Mendes was one of the few Guinea-Bissau students in secondary education when he abandoned school to join the PAIGC. He rose through the ranks in the 1960s, becoming a political commissar of the Bafat√° area in 1962. In the years 1963 - 1964 he held the same function on the Northern Front. He entered the Political Bureau in 1964 and he became a member of PAIGC‚Äôs Council of War in 1965. In 1967 he was appointed delegate of the Council for the Northern Front. Prime minister After negotiations between Portugal and PAIGC in early 1974, Portugal granted independence to Guinea- Bissau despite PAIGC having declared unilateral independence nearly a year prior. The PAIGC-led government was headed by Lu√≠s Cabral, half-brother of the PAIGC co-founder Am√≠lcar Cabral whose assassination in Conakry on January 20, 1973 remains a mystery. Francisco Mendes was elected the country's first Prime Minister as Comiss√°rio Principal and in this role in the newly UN-member, Francisco Mendes was responsible for a series of socialism-inspired development programs, and a four-year drive toward national reconciliation. Mendes' signature graced the first four banknotes (10, 50, 100 and 500 peso) issued in 1976 in Guinea-Bissau. Although the causes behind his death on July 7, 1978 are still disputed, it is mostly accepted that PAIGC was involved in it. A widely accepted theory ‚Äì though unverifiable as of 2006 ‚Äì is that dissent among PAIGC leadership may have led to his assassination. Honours As an African nationalist and a national figure in the struggle for independence, Francisco Mendes has been honoured both in Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde. In addition to his face being featured on 500 Pesos Guineense (second (1983) and third (1990) issues), many schools and streets bearing his name can be seen throughout Guinea-Bissau, and Francisco Mendes International Airport in Praia, Cape Verde was named in his honour.

It has been nationally and internationally acknowledged as a crucible for cutting edge, contemporary theatre since 1967. La Mama produces work by theatre makers of all backgrounds and encouraging works that deconstruct and critique form, content and social issues. The iconic venue was devastated by fire in the early hours of Saturday 19 May 2018, due to an electrical fault. History The theatre, an initiative of founder Betty Burstall, was inspired by the \\"off-off-Broadway\\" theatre scene in New York City. Betty and her husband, film maker Tim Burstall, had just returned from a trip to New York and wanted to re-create the vibrancy and immediacy of the small theatres there. La Mama was modelled after the similarly named New York venue La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. > \\"I got the idea for La Mama when we went to New York in the sixties. We were > poor. It was impossible to go to the theatre ‚Äì even to see a film was > expensive ‚Äì but there were these places where you paid fifty cents for a cup > of coffee and you saw a performance, and if you felt like it you put some > money in a hat for the actors. I saw some awful stuff and some good stuff. > It was very immediate and exciting and when I came back to Melbourne I > wanted to keep going, but there didn't exist such a place. So I talked > around a bit, to a few actors and writers and directors, sounding them out > about doing their own stuff, Australian stuff, for nothing ... I decided on > Carlton because in 1967 it was a lively, tatty area with an Italian > atmosphere and plenty of students ...\\" (Betty Burstall) At a time when the production of Australian plays was almost non-existent (and financially risky), La Mama's non-for-profit organisation provided the venue for the performance of new experimental Australian theatre works. The first play performed at La Mama was a work by a new Australian writer Jack Hibberd, entitled Three Old Friends (1967), whose most successful play Dimboola opened there in 1969. The production of Australian works at La Mama soon became a staple, and within the first two years of its life twenty-five new Australian plays had premiered there. La Mama also nurtured new works by composers, poets, and filmmakers. The opening of the alternative theatre provided a home base for many important figures in theatre and film including Hibberd and Alex Buzo. It was also regularly used by underground performance troupe Tribe (who later collaborated with Spectrum). The theatre's house troupe, the La Mama Group, established by actor-director Graeme Blundell evolved into the Australian Performing Group. La Mama's list of alumni includes notable Australian theatre artists such as David Williamson, Cate Blanchett, Jack Hibberd, Graeme Blundell, Judith Lucy and Julia Zemiro. Current La Mama Theatre operates today under the direction of Liz Jones, who took over the theatre as its artistic director in 1976. La Mama's model of giving artists upfront funding to present work in a rent-free venue, with 80% box-office return, is unique in Australia. This model supports a high artistic risk/low financial risk proposition for artists and encourages a high volume of activity. In addition access to rehearsal and meeting space, administrative, marketing and technical support and ticketing reduces the barriers posed by a lack of money or infrastructure for artists. In recent years, La Mama artists such as The Rabble, Daniel Schlusser and Nicola Gunn have gone on to perform at the Melbourne International Festival and Melbourne Theatre Company's NEON Festival of Independent Theatre. La Mama veteran Jack Charles continues to work across the country, and in 2013 La Mama regular Ben Grant was touring internationally with Robert Lapage. Venues La Mama operates out of two buildings: the original La Mama Theatre on Faraday Street, and the La Mama Courthouse a block away on Drummond Street. The simple two-storey brick building housing the La Mama Theatre was built originally as a printing works for AR Ford in 1883. After serving various industrial purposes it was leased in 1967 for use as a small theatre to nurture new Australian drama. Designed by Carlton architect George S Clarke, it faced a right-of-way off University Street, which is south of and parallel to Faraday Street. The land in front of the Theatre is currently used as a forecourt for the community. Fire damage and reconstruction On 19 May 2018, La Mama was largely destroyed by fire.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-19/la-mama-theatre-vows-to-rebuild- after-fire-destroys-carlton-base/9778856 It is intended to have it rebuilt by 2021, with the existing theatre building being restored and with a new structure to the front. The size of the performance space will remain the same, along with its original features (the internal staircase, the trapdoor and the fireplace). The administration team will be separately housed.https://lamama.com.au/rebuild-la-mama/ References Further reading *Jones, Liz with Betty Burstall and Helen Garner, La Mama: History of a Theatre (Penguin Books Australia, 1988) *Robertson, Tim, The Pram Factory: The Australian Performing Group Recollected (Melbourne University Press, 2001) External links * Theatres in Melbourne Organisations based in Melbourne Victorian Heritage Register 1967 establishments in Australia Theatre in Melbourne ","title":"La Mama Theatre (Melbourne)"},{"id":"2861470","text":"Borba (–ë–æ—Ä–±–∞ in Serbian Cyrillic) was a Serbian newspaper, formerly the official gazette of the Yugoslav Communist Party (KPJ). Its name is the Serbian word for 'struggle' or 'combat'. History The very first issue of Borba was first published in Zagreb on 19 February 1922 as the official gazette of the Yugoslav Communist Party (KPJ), a banned political organization since December 1920 that nevertheless operated clandestinely in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and later Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Functioning as the banned Yugoslav Communist Party's propaganda piece, the paper played in important part in disseminating information among the party members, activists, and sympathizers. On 13 January 1929, a week following the proclamation of King Alexander's 6 January Dictatorship, Borba got banned. During World War II Borba was published in the Republic of U≈æice. After the World War II liberation by the Partisans, its publication moved to Belgrade. From 1948 to 1987, the newspaper was also published simultaneously in Zagreb. For a long time, Borba alternated pages in Serbian Cyrillic alphabet and Gaj's Latin alphabet in the same edition. In 2002, more than a year following the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, Borba along with its distribution network were purchased by Serbian businessman Stanko \\"Cane\\" Subotiƒá who bought the government shares in the paper. However, under Subotiƒá, the daily Borba barely survived, printing no more than several hundred copies a day while according to business records, the company's monthly revenues never exceeded ‚Ç¨30,000.Investigation: Mystery Hangs Over Death of Yugoslavia‚Äôs Flagship Paper;BalkanInsight, 13 April 2011 =2009 redesign and cease of publication= Redesigned Borba got announced in December 2008 with Ivan Radovanoviƒá presented as the paper's new owner after reportedly buying it from fugitive Serbian businessman Stanko \\"Cane\\" Subotiƒá.Predstavljene nove dnevne novine - \\"Borba\\";mondo.rs, 2 December 2008 Before the first issue of the redesigned paper appeared, Serbian deputy prime minister Mlaƒëan Dinkiƒá accused Subotiƒá of still being Borba's true owner with Radovanoviƒá only serving as the front man.Ponovo izlazi Borba;B92, 2 December 2008 Though announced for December, the first redesigned issue ended up appearing on newsstands on 15 January 2009 under editor-in-chief Milo≈° Jevtoviƒá who came over from the state-owned Tanjug news agency. It was published by \\"Izdavaƒçko preduzeƒáe Novine Borba\\" using the Latin alphabet. Content-wise, the paper's new format was conceived as something new on the Serbian print media market with no news wire items and press releases with only analysis of the current events as well as ongoing political and social trends.

He is best known for the Nickle Resolution that ended the practice of knighthoods and peerages being awarded to Canadians. Born in Kingston, Ontario, the son of William Nickle, Nickle was educated at Queen's University and Osgoode Hall. He was called to the Ontario bar in 1896 and set up a law practice in Kingston. He entered local politics and was elected to the school board 1904 and then served on Kingston city council from 1905 until 1908. He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1908 provincial election as a Conservative and served for three years until his election to the federal House of Commons in the 1911 federal election, as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston. He was re-elected in the 1917 federal election as a Unionist. Nickle was appointed to chair a special committee of the House of Commons to examine the question of the appointment of honours. There had been criticism in the press about a surfeit of knighthoods being created during World War I. In 1919, Nickle moved and had passed through the House a resolution calling for an end to the practice of Canadians being granted knighthoods and peerages. Nickle's detractors charged that he was bitter at having failed to get a knighthood for his father-in-law. Later that year, he resigned his federal seat contending that the wartime Union Government should also resign and seek a post-war mandate to govern. Nickle returned to provincial politics and won a seat in the Ontario legislature in a 1922 by-election. The Conservatives formed government following the 1923 provincial election. The new Premier of Ontario, George Howard Ferguson, appointed Nickle to cabinet as Attorney-General of Ontario. Nickle resigned from Cabinet in October 1926 when Premier Ferguson announced his plan to repeal the Ontario Temperance Act and allow liquor sales. He ran as an Independent on a prohibition platform in the subsequent 1926 provincial election but was defeated in the riding of Kingston and Portsmouth by the Conservative candidate, Thomas Kidd. He married Agnes Mary McAdam in 1885 and married Katherine Louise Gorden in 1911 after the death of his first wife. Nickle served on the city council for Kingston, also serving as a member of the school board, and was a trustee for Queen's University and a member of the board of governors for Kingston Hospital. William McAdam Nickle, a son from his first marriage, went on to serve in the Ontario cabinet. References *McCreery, Christopher (2005). The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History and Development.

Long before the arrival of English colonists, Native Americans of the Delaware and Catawba tribes used this well-watered path as a migratory route and hunting grounds, moving between what is now Georgia and Canada. Beginning in the 1730s, Scots-Irish and German immigrants coming from Pennsylvania began to move up the valley and establish settlements (‚ÄúUp the Valley‚Äù in this context refers to movement to higher altitude and indicates a southward direction). As a result of the Treaty of Lancaster, the Iroquois were promised a marked path up the Valley which was laid out in 1745 by James Patton and John Buchanan. Initially called the \\"Indian Road\\", it was later known as the \\"Great Wagon Road.\\" A drawing entitled \\"the escape of Stonewall Jackson's Army down the valley pike at Strausburg [sic], Va.\\" U.S. Library of Congress Collection On March 3, 1834, The Valley Turnpike Company was incorporated by an act of the Virginia General Assembly, and the state participated in the public-private venture through the Virginia Board of Public Works with a 40% investment to build between Winchester and Harrisonburg. A similar road from Harrisonburg to Staunton was built by another company, and they merged. The new combined road, by then known as the \\"Valley Pike\\", was significantly improved and tolls were charged for the upkeep of its length. An official report made by General P. H. Sheridan published in July 1866 described the Valley Pike as follows: \\"The city of Martinsburg,... is on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, at the northern terminus of the Valley pike--a broad macadamized road, running up the valley, through Winchester, and terminating at Staunton.\\" The United States Army and Navy Journal, Volume III, 1865-1866, p760. Valley Turnpike, 1897 During the American Civil War, the Valley Pike was a key transportation link in both Jackson's Valley Campaign of 1862 and the Valley Campaigns of 1864. The macadamized road enabled fast movement of heavy wagon trains and gun carriages even during rainy weather, when dirt roads turned into mud. Confederate General Stonewall Jackson marched his infantry soldiers‚Äînicknamed foot cavalry‚Äîup and down the Valley and through various mountain gaps, such as Swift Run Gap and Thornton Gap, and make sudden appearances in front of Union troops in the Piedmont region on the east side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. In 1918, The Valley Turnpike Company, which had been managed by a young Harry Flood Byrd, allowed the Valley Turnpike to be one of the first roads taken over by the state. It was designated as part of State Route 3, one of the routes of the state highway system managed by the State Highway Commission. The Valley Turnpike was given the U.S. Route 11 designation in 1926, and remained the major north-south highway thoroughfare for the Shenandoah Valley until Interstate 81 was built beginning in the 1960s. Today, the road carries much local traffic, and provides an alternative to the busy Interstate Highway. A section of the original Valley Pike runs parallel to U.S. Route 11 in Rockbridge County, 1 mile north of Lexington.

It is most famous for its roast goose.  History  In 1938, Kam Shui-fai () began selling siu mei at a dai pai dong on Kwong Yuen West Street, near the old Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Pier. After some success, he converted it into a restaurant in 1942, leasing the premises at 32 Wing Lok Street in Sheung Wan for HK$4,000. During the Second World War, the building was destroyed in a Japanese air raid. In 1944, the restaurant was moved to 32 Pottinger Street. It moved into its current premises on Wellington Street in 1964, and after four more adjacent buildings were acquired, the lot was rebuilt in 1978 to become today's Yung Kee Building. The sixth floor of the restaurant building is occupied by the Kee Club, named after Yung Kee and described by founder Maria Rhomberg as \\"a place for people tired of discos but still too young for formal restaurants and stuffy establishment clubs\\"; she met Kam in Shanghai to present the concept to him, and opened the club in 2001. During the SARS outbreak that year and again during the avian flu scare, Yung Kee was forced to temporarily stop serving roast goose and other poultry. Finances and ownership Yung Kee is owned by Yung Kee Holdings Ltd, a private holding company with roughly HK$127 million in assets. In 2000, the two top floors of the building which the restaurant occupies became available; the company purchased those floors at that point, and now owns the entire building. After the death of the founder Kam Shui-fai in 2004, its shares were divided among Kam's children. One report stated that eldest son Kam Kin-sing () (or \\"Kinsen Kam Kwan-sing\\") and second son Ronald Kam Kwan-lai (ÁîòÁê®Á¶Æ) each received 45%, while the remaining 10% was held by Kam's daughter Kam Mei-ling through her own holding company Everway Holdings Limited; she later sold it to the younger Kam. Another report stated that the two brothers each received a 35% stake on the founder's death, with a further 10% owned by his widow, their mother, Mak Sui-chun. Her daughter Kelly Kam was also a party to the dispute. In fiscal year 2009, the restaurant earned HK$51.1 million in net profit. However, there have been continuing disputes among the two brothers about the management of the company, especially due to the appointment of the younger Kam brother's son Kam Lin-wang () as a director, drawing a salary of HK$45,000/month for only a few hours of work. In July 2010, the elder Kam brother applied to the High Court for liquidation of the holding company if the younger Kam brother refused to buy out his stake. The Court of Final Appeal, acting on an appeal filed by the widow of the deceased Kinson Kam, ruled in favour of the winding up order of the holding company registered in the British Virgin Islands based on the fact that the parties, property and dispute were based in Hong Kong. The net assets were stated to be HK$2 billion ($256 million) in 2012.http://www.ejinsight.com/20151112-yung-kee-goose-may- be-cooked-as-wind-up-order-looms/ Specialties Yung Kee is most famous for its roast goose, and serves as many as 300 whole birds per day. A half bird‚Äîwhich serves up to six people‚Äîcosts HK$240, while a two-person portion goes for HK$120. The late founder Kam is nicknamed \\"Roast Goose Fai\\" (), and Yung Kee's roast goose has become well known in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau, and also among foreign tourists. Some take a box of goose on the flight home to share with family and friends, giving rise to the nickname \\"Flying Roast Goose\\" (). Yung Kee dishes are served in first and business class on board Cathay Pacific flights, and boxes of roast goose and preserved eggs from the restaurant are sold in the on-board duty-free shop in an effort to take advantage of a growing demand for \\"souvenir food\\". Awards and recognition In 1968, Yung Kee was named by Fortune magazine as one of the Top 15 Restaurants in the World, the only Chinese restaurant on the list. In 1997, four dishes from Yung Kee received awards in the Hong Kong Food Festival Culinary Awards Competition: \\"Wild Geese Resting on Plum Tress\\" won a platinum award, while \\"Fish Biting Lamb in Huizhou Style\\" (fresh carp stuffed with shredded lamb), \\"Celebrating Prosperity\\" (fish and chicken wings on a bed of stir-fried vegetables and shredded turtle meat), and \\"Aloe Vera with Golden Pomegranate\\" each won gold awards. Yung Kee also once held one star in the Michelin Guide received in the inaugural 2009 Hong Kong and Macau edition, but on 1 December 2011, it was relegated to \\"Bib Gourmand\\" section of the guide's 2012 edition. ;Asia's Top 20 Restaurants ‚Äì Miele Guide * 2008/2009: no. 8 * 2009/2010: no. 10 * 2010/2011: no. 12 * 2011/2012: no. 17 See also * List of Chinese restaurants References External links *Yung Kee Restaurant ‚Äì official website Central, Hong Kong Restaurants in Hong Kong Michelin Guide starred restaurants in Hong Kong Chinese restaurants Restaurants established in 1942 1942 establishments in Hong Kong ","title":"Yung Kee"},{"id":"2861492","text":"Beatrice Louise Gore (March 6, 1925 ‚Äì October 6, 2005) was an American Republican politician from Maryland.

She was a Republican National Committee member from 1972 to 1984 and worked for Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidential campaign in 1952. In 1974, Gore launched an unsuccessful bid for Governor of Maryland against then incumbent Marvin Mandel, who was the successor to Spiro T. Agnew. She was opposed by Congressman Lawrence J. Hogan Sr. (R) who represented the Congressional District encompassing Prince George County, Md. and who had served on the House Judiciary Committee being one of the Republicans who helped draw up and vote for the \\"Articles of Impeachment\\" against then President Richard M. Nixon. Gore was considered to be the underdog candidate in the Republican Primary to Hogan but won in an upset believed due to Hogan's anti-Nixon stance. Gore was considered at the time to be a \\"liberal Republican\\" but because she did not take an open public stand against Nixon (though she personally supported Nixon's removal) and many \\"loyal\\" Republicans voted for her over Hogan. Gore became the first woman of either major political party in Maryland to be nominated for Governor. Gore's gubernatorial campaign included a lion and a placard which read: \\"Gore is no pussycat.\\". Gore fought against Governor Marvin Mandel who was criticized for an extramarital affair which later resulted in a divorce between Mandel and his first wife. He was also suspected of corruption. Gore was subjected to a \\"whisper campaign\\" concerning her sexuality which was suspected but never proved as she had never married. Mandel won in a landslide.See election returns as reported by the Md. State Board of Elections 1974. Gore was a second cousin of former Vice President Al Gore through their common ancestor Charles Claiborne Gore. Her sister, Mary Gore Dean, was the mistress of Attorney General John Mitchell and a Watergate scandal figure, and Mary's daughter is Deborah Gore Dean, a former official in the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development convicted in a kickback scheme.

The campus is about north of Kottayam in Gandhinagar-Arpookkara area in Central Kerala. History The college started functioning in December 1962 as the third government-run medical college in Kerala. The college which initially functioned in the District Hospital, Kottayam from 1962 to 1970 was shifted to Arpookara in April 1970. In 1975, all clinical departments were shifted to the newly constructed campus at Arpookara, now named Gandhinagar. The same year, the nearby ESI Hospital was taken over to start the children's hospital: Institute of Child Health. A new administrative B block was started in 1985. In 1996, the C block was added which houses the departments of Pharmacology, Pathology, Microbiology and the Central Library. Newly constructed block =Events= *1960: The project for establishing a medical college at Kottayam was included in the third five-year plan. *1961: First batch (1961 batch) of 50 MBBS students were selected and accommodated at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram from 8 January 1961. *1962: Site for the campus was identified and land acquisition begins. This area was the confluence of three panchayaths -- Kumaranalloor, Athirampuzha and Arpookara -- and formed part of the territorial limits of three villages: Perumbaikkad, Athirampuzha and Kaipuzha. Dr C M Francis was appointed as principal and special officer of the college. He took over on 5 July 1962 with the college functioning from Kottayam town. Semi-permanent buildings were constructed to house the college and two hostels (one for 100 male and the other for 50 female students). The Inspection Commission of Kerala University visited the college on 10 July 1962 for assessing the facilities; affiliation was granted on the basis of the commission's report. *1962: Admission (II batch, 50 students) accommodated at Thiruvananthapuram joined the Arpookara Campus on 12 March 1962 after spending September to November at Thiruvananthapuram. The medical college was formally inaugurated on 3 December 1962 by R Sankar, the chief minister of Kerala in the presence of M P Govindan Nair, the health minister. Campus on the day of inauguration consisted of the semi-permanent buildings to house pre-clinical and para- clinical departments, library, animal house, store, women's hostel (now the Dental College) and men's hostel (now MHSQ) besides the PWD office and seven acquired buildings. *1963-1961 admission (I batch, 50 students) joined the campus on 06.01.1963 after first MBBS at Thiruvananthapuram. *1964: The District Hospital at Kottayam was brought under the college and used as teaching hospital (MCH Kottayam) from January 1963 onwards; a 100 bedded block for medicine and surgery and another 116-bedded block for Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Paediatrics were constructed in the District Hospital complex in 1963 and 1964. III batch (1963) with increased strength of 60 students was admitted at Medical College Kottayam itself on 01.08.1963. Construction of permanent buildings for hostels for men and women, quarters, etc. were undertaken from 1963. Annual intake was increased to 80 from 1964 batch. A space of around the campus was declared as a Controlled Area and \\"Kottayam Medical College Area Development Authority\\" was constituted to ensure proper development *1965: The MC Health Centre at Ettumanoor was established in 1965 after taking over the Government Dispensary. *1969: Construction of E, F and G blocks and Kitchen block of MCH at Arpookara was completed. *1970: Construction of the present outpatient (OP) block and laundry of MCH at Arpookara completed. Medical College Hospital at Arpookara was formally inaugurated by the minister for health KM George on 14.04.1970. Departments of Medicine and Surgery were shifted from DH Kottayam to MCH Arpookara. Other departments continued to function at DH Kottayam (MCH Kottayam). The campus in 1970 consisted of the semi-permanent buildings to house pre- and para-clinical departments, library, animal house, college office and central workshop (earlier women's hostel and now part of DCK), pharmacy, MCH EFG block, laundry, kitchen block, women's hostel (now MHSQ), men's hostel, PHED, PWD office and store, quarters type A: 01-10, B: 01-13, C: 01-17, D: 01-05, E: 01-16, F: 01-16, G: 01-34, and seven acquired buildings. *1973: Post graduate courses (MS Surgery & MD Medicine) started from 1973/74 (1 June 1973). *1974: Construction of A, B and C blocks of MCH at Arpookara was completed; other major departments were shifted from DH Kottayam to MCH Gandhinagar in 1974 and 75. The area surrounding the campus and the surrounding localities was christened Gandhinagar. *1975: ESI hospital with its quarters and campus was bought from ESI Corporation and converted to Institute of Child Health in April 1975, shifting the Paediatrics department from DH Kottayam. *1977: Strength of admission increased from 80 to 85 during 1977-78; Bed strength stood at 837. *1979: Annual intake of MBBS increased to 100 from 1979/80 academic year. *1980: Affiliation was shifted to Gandhiji University (later renamed Mahatma Gandhi University) following the bifurcating of Kerala University. *1982: College of Nursing, Kottayam started functioning from May 1982 with 25 BSc (Nursing) students. Due to lack of facilities at Kottayam, it was initially accommodated at the College of Nursing Thiruvananthapuram. *1985: The new Medical College administrative block was opened in October. The College of Nursing was shifted to Gandhinagar in November and starts functioning from the space vacated by college office (the present Dental College). *1994: The Departments of Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology and Central Library shifted to the new C block. *2001: Dental College started functioning in the campus. *2003-4: Major construction started. ** Construction of phase 1 of cardiology ‚Äì cardiothoracic block ** Construction of the (C2 block) intended for housing the remaining departments: Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry and Community Medicine, which are still functioning in the temporary buildings put up in 1962 ** 300-bed hostel for nursing students ** Obstetrics & Gynaecology block, Phase I *2004: Inauguration of Dental College building *2005: Inauguration of learning resource centre in January.

The modern village has just under 100 dwellings. The population (including Knaptoft) at the 2011 census was 302. Entries in Domesday According to the Domesday Book, Mowsley had two manors in 1086, situated in the ancient hundred of Gartree.Open Domesday Online: Mowsley, accessed January 2017 This was a chapelry in the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Knaptoft with the chapel being built c1250AD. The chapel, which was sensitively restored at the end of the 19th century has a perfect cruciform plan and contains three piscinas, a large carved altar stone and a font which has the original bowl. Schools The Church of England School in Mowsley was built in 1864, but there had been a Sunday school in the village from 1833, which was attended by 17 boys and 22 girls. By 1871 there were 18 boys and 18 girls who attended the new school and in 1872 a school committee was formed who assumed responsibility for the ongoing management of the school, which had previously been the remit of the rector and the Churchwardens. A school mistress was also appointed in this year at a salary of ¬£22 10s a year. In 1892, the cost of the general management and upkeep of the school was ¬£64. The number of pupils two years later was just 16. In 1900 the school attendance had increased to 22, due to the closure of Laughton school and the subsequent transfer of its students to Mowsley. In 1923 it was decided that children over the age of 11 would attend the 'senior top' at Husbands Bosworth National School, however this was a fairly short lived arrangement, because the 'senior top' closed in 1930, transferring all senior pupils to Church Langton. The school in Mowsley continued as a junior school for the Mowsley and Laughton districts and in 1933 it had 35 pupils in attendance. The junior school eventually came under the jurisdiction of the local authority and by 1958, it had an attendance of 22.J. M. Lee and R. A.

Similar to in situ mining, heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner, then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the ore, whereas in situ mining lacks these liners and pulls pregnant solution up to obtain the minerals. Heap leaching is widely used in modern large-scale mining operations as it produces the desired concentrates at a lower cost compared to conventional processing methods such as flotation, agitation, and vat leaching.Petersen, J., & Dixon, D. G. (2002). Thermophilic heap leaching of a chalcopyrite concentrate. Minerals engineering, 15(11), 777-785. Additionally, dump leaching is an essential part of most copper mining operations and determines the quality grade of the produced material along with other factors Due to the profitability that the dump leaching has on the mining process, i.e. it can contribute substantially to the economic viability of the mining process, it is advantageous to include the results of the leaching operation in the economic overall project evaluation.Bouffard, Sylvie C., and David G. Dixon. \\"Investigative study into the hydrodynamics of heap leaching processes.\\" Metallurgical and Materials Transactions B 32.5 (2001): 763-776. The process has ancient origins; one of the classical methods for the manufacture of copperas (iron sulfate) was to heap up iron pyrite and collect the leachate from the heap, which was then boiled with iron to produce iron(II) sulfate.Industrial England in the Middle of the Eighteenth Century, Nature, Vol, 83, No. 2113, Thursday, April 28, 1910; page 267. Process Left: ore fines without agglomeration. Right: Ore fines after agglomeration - Improved percolation as a result of agglomeration. The mined ore is usually crushed into small chunks and heaped on an impermeable plastic or clay lined leach pad where it can be irrigated with a leach solution to dissolve the valuable metals. While sprinklers are occasionally used for irrigation, more often operations use drip irrigation to minimize evaporation, provide more uniform distribution of the leach solution, and avoid damaging the exposed mineral. The solution then percolates through the heap and leaches both the target and other minerals. This process, called the \\"leach cycle,\\" generally takes from one or two months for simple oxide ores (e.g. most gold ores) to two years for nickel laterite ores. The leach solution containing the dissolved minerals is then collected, treated in a process plant to recover the target mineral and in some cases precipitate other minerals, and recycled to the heap after reagent levels are adjusted. Ultimate recovery of the target mineral can range from 30% of contained run- of-mine dump leaching sulfide copper ores to over 90% for the ores that are easiest to leach, some oxide gold ores. The essential questions to address during the process of the heap leaching are:Roman, Ronald J., Blair R. Benner, and George W. Becker. \\"Diffusion model for heap leaching and its application to scale-up.\\" TRANS SOC MIN ENG, AIME 256.3 (1974): 247-252. * Can the investment of crushing the ore be justified by the potential increase in recovery and rate of recovery? * How should the concentration of acid be altered over time in order to produce a solution that can be economically treated? * How does the form of a heap affect the recovery and solution grade? * Under any given set of circumstances, what type of recovery can be expected before the leach solution quality drops below a critical limit? * What recovery (quantifiable measure) can be expected? In recent years, the addition of an agglomeration drum has improved on the heap leaching process by allowing for a more efficient leach. The rotary drum agglomerator, such as the tyre driven Sepro Agglomeration Drum works by taking the crushed ore fines and agglomerating them into more uniform particles. This makes it much easier for the leaching solution to percolate through the pile, making its way through the channels between particles. The addition of an agglomeration drum also has the added benefit of being able to pre-mix the leaching solution with the ore fines to achieve a more concentrated, homogeneous mixture and allow the leach to begin prior to the heap. Although heap leach design has made significant progress over the last few years through the use of new materials and improved analytical tools, industrial experience shows that there are significant benefits from extending the design process beyond the liner and into the rock pile itself. Characterization of the physical and hydraulic (hydrodynamic) properties of ore-for-leach focuses on the direct measurement of the key properties of the ore, namely: * The relationship between heap height and ore bulk density (density profile) * The relationship between bulk density and percolation capacity (conductivity profile) * The relationship between the bulk density, porosity and its components (micro and macro) * The relationship between the moisture content and percolation capacity (conductivity curve) * The relationship between the aforementioned parameters and the ore preparation practices (mining, crushing, agglomeration, curing, and method of placement) Theoretical and numerical analysis, and operational data show that these fundamental mechanisms are controlled by scale, dimensionality, and heterogeneity, all of which adversely affect the scalability of metallurgical and hydrodynamic properties from the lab to the field. The dismissal of these mechanisms can result in a number of practical and financial problems that will resonate throughout the life of the heap impacting the financial return of the operation. Through procedures that go beyond the commonly employed metallurgical testing and the integration of data gleaned through real time 3D monitoring, a more complete representative characterization of the physicochemical properties of the heap environment is obtained. This improved understanding results in a significantly higher degree of accuracy in terms of creating a truly representative sample of the environment within the heap.Guzm√°n-Guzm√°n, A., Y. C√°ceres Hern√°ndez, O., Srivastava, R., & W. Jones, J. (2014). Integrated process control to enhance heap leach performance. Paper presented at the Second International Conference on Heap Leach Solutions, Lima, Peru. By adhering to the characterization identified above, a more comprehensive view of heap leach environments can be realized, allowing the industry to move away from the de facto black-box approach to a physicochemically inclusive industrial reactor model. =Precious metals= The crushed ore is irrigated with a dilute alkaline cyanide solution. The solution containing the dissolved precious metals in a pregnant solution continues percolating through the crushed ore until it reaches the liner at the bottom of the heap where it drains into a storage (pregnant solution) pond. After separating the precious metals from the pregnant solution, the dilute cyanide solution (now called \\"barren solution\\") is normally re-used in the heap-leach-process or occasionally sent to an industrial water treatment facility where the residual cyanide is treated and residual metals are removed. In very high rainfall areas, such as the tropics, in some cases there is surplus water that is then discharged to the environment, after treatment, posing possible water pollution if treatment is not properly carried out. The production of one gold ring through this method, can generate 20 tons of waste material.Gage B. & G. 2008. American Outrage. USA: Human Rights Watch. During the extraction phase, the gold ions form complex ions with the cyanide: :{Au+ (s)} + 2CN^- (aq) -> Au(CN)2^- (aq) Recuperation of the gold is readily achieved with a redox-reaction: :{2 Au(CN)2^- (aq)} + Zn (s) -> {Zn(CN)4^2- (aq)} + 2 Au (s) The most common methods to remove the gold from solution are either using activated carbon to selectively absorb it, or the Merrill-Crowe process where zinc powder is added to cause a precipitation of gold and zinc. The fine product can be either dor√© (gold-silver bars) or zinc-gold sludge that is then refined elsewhere. =Copper ores= The method is similar to the cyanide method above, except sulfuric acid is used to dissolve copper from its ores. The acid is recycled from the solvent extraction circuit (see solvent extraction-electrowinning, SX/EW) and reused on the leach pad. A byproduct is iron(II) sulfate, jarosite, which is produced as a byproduct of leaching pyrite, and sometimes even the same sulfuric acid that is needed for the process. Both oxide and sulfide ores can be leached, though the leach cycles are much different and sulfide leaching requires a bacterial, or bio-leach, component. In 2011 leaching, both heap leaching and in-situ leaching, produced 3.4 million metric tons of copper, 22 percent of world production.US Geological Survey, 2011 Minerals Yearbook - Copper, 2012. The largest copper heap leach operations are in Chile, Peru, and the southwestern United States. Although heap leaching is a low cost-process, it normally has recovery rates of 60-70%. It is normally most profitable with low-grade ores. Higher-grade ores are usually put through more complex milling processes where higher recoveries justify the extra cost. The process chosen depends on the properties of the ore. The final product is cathode copper. =Nickel ores= This method is an acid heap leaching method like that of the copper method in that it utilises sulfuric acid instead of cyanide solution to dissolve the target minerals from crushed ore. The amount of sulfuric acid required is much higher than for copper ores, as high as 1,000 kg of acid per tonne of ore, but 500 kg is more common. The method was originally patented by Australian miner BHP Billiton and is being commercialized by Cerro Matoso S.A. in Colombia, a wholly owned subsidiary of BHP Billiton; Vale in Brazil; and European Nickel PLC for the rock laterite deposits of Turkey, Talvivaara mine in Finland, the Balkans, and the Philippines. There currently are no operating commercial scale nickel laterite heap leach operations, but there is a sulphide HL operating in Finland. Nickel recovery from the leach solutions is much more complex than for copper and requires various stages of iron and magnesium removal, and the process produces both leached ore residue (\\"ripios\\") and chemical precipitates from the recovery plant (principally iron oxide residues, magnesium sulfate and calcium sulfate) in roughly equal proportions. Thus, a unique feature of nickel heap leaching is the need for a tailings disposal area. The final product can be nickel hydroxide precipitates (NHP) or mixed metal hydroxide precipitates (MHP), which are then subject to conventional smelting to produce metallic nickel. =Uranium ores= Diagram of heap leach recovery for uranium (US NRC) Similar to copper oxide heap leaching, also using dilute sulfuric acid. Rio Tinto is commercializing this technology in Namibia and Australia; the French nuclear power company Areva, in Niger with two mines and Namibia; and several other companies are studying its feasibility. The final product is yellowcake and requires significant further processing to produce fuel-grade feed. =Apparatus= While most mining companies have shifted from a previously accepted sprinkler method to the percolation of slowly dripping choice chemicals including cyanide or sulfuric acid closer to the actual ore bed,Krauth, Richard G. 1991 Controlled Percolation System and Method for Heap Leach Mining. United States Patent 5,005,806. April 9, 1991. heap leach pads have not changed too much throughout the years. There are still four main categories of pads: conventional, dump leach, valley fills, and on/off pads.Thiel, Richard, and Mark E. Smith 2004 State of the practice review of heap leach pad design issues. Geotextiles and Geomembranes 22(5): 555-568 Typically, each pad only has a single, geomembrane liner for each pad, with a minimum thickness of 1.5mm, usually thicker. The conventional pads simplest in design are used for mostly flat or gentle areas and hold thinner layers of crushed ore. Dump leach pads hold more ore and can usually handle a less flat terrain. Valley fills are pads situated at valley bottoms or levels that can hold everything falling into it. On/off pads involve putting significantly larger loads on the pads and removing and reloading it after every cycle. Many of these mines which previously had digging depths of about 15 meters are digging deeper than ever before to mine materials, approximately 50 meters, sometimes more, which means that, in order to accommodate all of the ground being displaced, pads will have to hold higher weights from more crushed ore being contained in a smaller area (Lupo 2010).Lupo, John F. 2009 Liner system design for heap leach pads. Geotextiles and Geomembranes 28(12): 163-173 With that increase in build up comes in potential for decrease in yield or ore quality, as well as potential either weak spots in the lining or areas of increased pressure buildup. This build up still has the potential to lead to punctures in the liner. As of 2004 cushion fabrics, which could reduce potential punctures and their leaking, were still being debated due to their tendency to increase risks if too much weight on too large a surface was placed on the cushioning (Thiel and Smith 2004).Thiel, Richard, and Mark E. Smith 2004 State of the practice review of heap leach pad design issues. Geotextiles and Geomembranes 22(5): 555-568 In addition, some liners, depending on their composition, may react with salts in the soil as well as acid from the chemical leaching to affect the successfulness of the liner. This can be amplified over time. Environmental Concerns =Effectiveness= Heap leach mining works well for large volumes of low grade ores, as reduced metallurgical treatment (comminution) of the ore is required in order to extract an equivalent amount of minerals when compared to milling. The significantly reduced processing costs are offset by the reduced yield of usually approximately 60-70%. The amount of overall environmental impact caused by heap leaching is often lower than more traditional techniques. It also requires less energy consumption to use this method, which many consider to be an environmental alternative. =Government regulation= In the United States, the General Mining Law of 1872 gave rights to explore and mine on public domain land; the original law did not require post-mining reclamation (Woody et al. 2011). Mined land reclamation requirements on federal land depended on state requirements until the passage of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act in 1976. Currently, mining on federal land must have a government-approved mining and reclamation plan before mining can start. Reclamation bonds are required.Nevada Division of Minerals, Modern mining reclamation . Mining on either federal, state, or private land is subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. One solution proposed to reclamation problems is the privatization of the land to be mined (Woody et al. 2011). =Cultural and social concerns= With the rise of the environmentalist movement has also come an increased appreciation for social justice, and mining has showed similar trends lately. Societies located near potential mining sites are at increased risk to be subjected to injustices as their environment is affected by the changes made to mined lands‚Äîeither public or private‚Äîthat could eventually lead to problems in social structure, identity, and physical health (Franks 2009).Franks, Daniel 2009 Avoiding Mine-Community Conflict: From Dialogue to Shared Futures. In: Jacques Wiertz and Chris Moran, Proceedings of the First International Seminar on Environmental Issues in the Mining Industry. Enviromine 2009, Santiago, Chile, (x-x). 30 Sept- 2 Oct 2009 Many have argued that by cycling mine power through local citizens, this disagreement can be alleviated, since both interest groups would have shared and equal voice and understanding in future goals. However, it is often difficult to match corporate mining interests with local social interests, and money is often a deciding factor in the successes of any disagreements. If communities are able to feel like they have a valid understanding and power in issues concerning their local environment and society, they are more likely to tolerate and encourage the positive benefits that come with mining, as well as more effectively promote alternative methods to heap leach mining using their intimate knowledge of the local geography (Franks 2009).

It is sometimes designed to run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. Toothed belts are used in a wide array of in mechanical devices, where high-power transmission is desired. Design and application Timing belts, toothed belts, cogged or cog belts,in Contact !, Experimental Aircraft and Powerplant Newsforum for Designers and Builders, n¬∞55, Dieselis Aircraft, A Prototype Aircraft with a Diesel Engine and synchronous belts are non-slipping mechanical drive belts. They are made as flexible belts with teeth moulded onto their inner surface. The belts run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. When correctly tensioned, these type of belts have no slippage, and are often used to transfer motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used in lieu of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary. Toothed belts are used widely in mechanical devices, including sewing machines, photocopiers and many others. A major use of toothed belts is as the timing belt used to drive the camshafts within an automobile or motorcycle engine. As toothed belts can deliver more power than a friction-drive belt, they are used for high-power transmissions. These include the primary drive of some motorcycles, notably later Harley-Davidsons; and the supercharger used for dragsters. Microlight aircraft driven by high-speed two-stroke engines such as the Rotax 532 use toothed belt reduction drives to allow the use of a quieter and more efficient slower-speed propeller. Some amateur-built airplanes powered by automotive engines use cog belt reduction drive units.For example : Bede BD-5, Dieselis aircraft , and Pennec Gaz'Aile 2 Other names A gilmer belt was a brand or trade name for a mechanical belt used for transferring power between axles in a machine. The gilmer belt was originally sold by the L. H. Gilmer company after 1949, and represents one of the earliest toothed belt designs. Gilmer belts use trapezoidal teeth to engage matching grooves on toothed pulleys in order to maintain synchronicity between moving parts. Belts are no longer sold under the Gilmer name, although enthusiasts are still likely to refer to toothed belts by the gilmer name.  Fabrication  Toothed belts are made of a flexible polymer over a fabric reinforcement. Originally this was rubber over a natural textile, but developments in material science have had a substantial effect in increasing the lifetime of these belts. This included changes from natural to synthetic rubber and polyurethane and also the adoption of steel, nylon, Kevlar (or other aramid fibres), and/or carbon fibres in their reinforcement.  Belt failure  A new belt, already damaged by knotting Toothed belts have two failure modes, one gradual and one catastrophic. There is an increased risk of either over the lifetime of the belt, so it is common for highly-stressed belts to be given a service lifetime and to be replaced before this failure can occur. One failure mode is gradual wear to the tooth shape, which may eventually lead to slippage over rounded teeth. The belt often continues to work, but the relative timing between shafts changes. The catastrophic failure mode is caused by delamination between the belt and its fabric reinforcement. Although this may be caused by age and wear, it is often accelerated by mistreatment of the belt, often during initial installation. Overloading the belt by bending it to a narrow radius is a common cause of damage, either by bending out of the belt's designed axis, twisting, levering it into place with tools, bending in the correct axis but to too small a radius, or even knotting a belt in storage. Another cause, particularly with natural rubber belts, is contamination by oil, especially to the edges where the reinforcing fabric is exposed and can cause a wick effect. It is extremely rare for a timing belt to break. More common is for the belt to delaminate, disconnecting the fabric strength member from the teeth that ride on the pulleys. The belt is then often thrown from the pulleys and may be further damaged, cut, or break. Although worn teeth may be detectable by careful inspection, internal deterioration is not considered to be reliably detectable and so the observance of service lifetimes is important.

Gottvald: Kdo byl Georg Placzek (1905-1955) ƒås. ƒças. fyz., Vol. 55, No. 3, 2005, pp. 275-287 (in Czech) (pdf) Placzek was born in Brno, Moravia, then part of Austria-Hungary, into a wealthy Jewish family. He studied physics in Prague and Vienna. In the 1930s, Placzek was known as an adventurous person with sharp sense of humor, a tireless generator of novel physics ideas which he generously shared with his colleagues. The scope of Placzek's pilgrimage around world's physics centers in the 1930s was unique among his colleagues. He worked with Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, Rudolf Peierls, Werner Heisenberg, Victor Weisskopf, Enrico Fermi, Niels Bohr, Lev Landau, Edoardo Amaldi, Emilio Segr√®, Otto Frisch, Leon van Hove and many other prominent physicists of his time. His wife, Els Placzek (n√©e Andriesse) was an ex-wife of physicist Hans von Halban. He lost all his relatives to Holocaust, casting a tragic shadow on his life. Placzek's major areas of scientific work involved a fundamental theory of Raman scattering, molecular spectroscopy in gases and liquids, neutron physics and mathematical physics. Together with Otto Frisch, he suggested a direct experimental proof of nuclear fission.Frisch O. R.: \\"The Discovery of Fission ‚Äì How It All Began\\". Physics Today 20 (1967), 11, pp. 43-48 Together with Niels Bohr and others, he was instrumental in clarifying the role of Uranium 235 for the possibility of nuclear chain reaction. During his stay in Landau's circle in Kharkiv around 1937, Placzek witnessed the brutal reality of Joseph Stalin's regime. His first-hand experience of this influenced the political opinions of his close friends, in particular, fathers of nuclear and thermonuclear bombs, Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Teller. Later, Placzek was the only Czech with a leading position in the Manhattan project, where he worked from 1943 till 1946 as a member of the British Mission; first in Canada as the leader of a theoretical division at the Montreal Laboratory and then (since May 1945) in Los Alamos, later replacing his friend Hans Bethe as the leader of the theoretical group. Since 1948, Placzek was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, USA. Unlike many trailblazers of nuclear physics, George Placzek did not leave his recollections or life story notes. Many new facts about Placzek's life and his family roots emerged in connection with a Symposium held in Placzek's memory. Placzek's premature death in a hotel in Zurich was very likely a suicide influenced by his long- time serious illness. The first detailed biography of George Placzek sheds light on poorly known pages of his life, illuminating also circumstances of Placzek's death.

LeTourneau, Rodger, \\"Death Takes No Holiday: Labor Day Disaster Claims 31 Lives,\\" in the National Railway Bulletin, Volume 55, Number 6 (1990), at 12-23. This detailed article contains black and white photos, track maps, and a timetable. Scene A westbound train, The Minaki Campers‚Äô Special operating as Passenger Extra 6001 West, was a seasonal excursion service carrying vacationers from the Minaki region of Northwestern Ontario. It had been given orders at Malachi, Ontario, east of Winnipeg to meet Canadian National Railways train No. 4, the eastbound Continental Limited at Vivian.Shaw (1978) p. 140 These orders later were changed, so that the meeting point was relocated westward, for a meet at Dugald, east of Winnipeg. These second orders had been received at Elma. Collision and fire By the train order operation rules then in use, Extra 6001 would have to use the siding at the east switch of Dugald. The conductor of the train reminded the engineer of the Dugald stop one or two miles beforehand, by the air signal line, and received the proper acknowledgement. However, Extra 6001 failed to enter the siding at the east switch, and collided head-on with the stationary eastbound train number 4, the Continental Limited at 9:44 p.m. at approximately . Extra 6001 was composed of U-1-a class 4-8-2 steam locomotive 6001, two steel baggage cars, nine wooden gas- illuminated coaches, and two steel parlour cars. After the collision, the wooden carriages of the vacation train caught fire. Strict rationing of steel during World War II had resulted in old wooden cars being kept in service until newer cars could be purchased. The collision began a series of events that caused fires fuelled by compressed gas from broken lines and tanks on the wood coaches that gutted the wooden cars and set fire to oil tanks near the tracks. With the exception of the engineer and fireman of Extra 6001, who were killed by the initial collision, the fatalities of this incident were caused by the fire. No fatalities occurred in the vacation train's two rear cars or on the Continental Limited. Inquiry An inquiry blamed the crew of the vacationers' train for failing to obey orders. The inquiry also determined that the crew's error had been precipitated by their seeing a clear signal, which implied that the track ahead was clear, and that the Continental Limited‚Äôs dimming of its headlamp while waiting in the station lessened its visibility to the oncoming vacation train. This resulted in both the acquisition of modern rail cars and the improvement of rules regarding operations on the line.

History The history of Ypoyia Revmata starts in 1992, when a company of musicians and classmates at the same time from Kallithea, Athens, Greece started playing their own songs. At that time, Grigoris, Kostas, Giannis and Panagiotis had rented a place at Psyri, Athens in order to make comfortably their performances. When Kostas started working at Melodia FM, he met the manager Dimitris Hatzopoulos, and that is when Mitsos joined the band. In 1993, manager Dimitris Hatzopoulos takes a demo of the band to ŒàŒ≤Œ¥ŒøŒºŒ∑ ŒîŒπŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒ∑ (Evdomi Diastasi, Seventh Dimension) label and Ypogia Revmata start recording their first album. In 1994, the band, after deciding their permanent name, make their first appearance in Greek discography with their first album 'Œü ŒúŒ¨Œ≥ŒøœÇ ŒöŒøŒπœÑŒ¨Œ∂ŒµŒπ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ†œåŒªŒ∑' (O Magos Kitazei tin Poli, The Magician is Looking at the City). The sound of Ypogeia Revmata does not have anything new to offer to the rock scene, but their songs have fun, humor, catchy melodies and rhythm and lyrics written without any complex. From that album comes their classic hit 'Œú'Œ±œÅŒ≠œÉŒµŒπ ŒΩŒ± ŒºŒ∑ ŒõŒµœâ Œ†ŒøŒªŒªŒ¨' (M'aresi na mi Leo Polla, I Like not Saying Much). That year, they make their first concert at 'Metro', which overwhelms with crowd. In 1995, Markos joins the band and they release their second album 'Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±ŒªŒøŒ≥Œ≠œÇ' (Paraloges. Paralogs), a little more inflexible, but closer to the sound they wanted to approach. Kostas is in charge of remixing and sound recording, who later is going to be a member of the band. In summer 1996, they recorded their live concert at 'Theatro Vrahon' with their new drummer Vasilis, who before releasing their third album 'Live œÉœÑŒø ŒòŒ≠Œ±œÑœÅŒø ŒíœÅŒ¨œáœâŒΩ' (Live at Theatro Vrahon) - which marks the end of an era - loses his life in a car accident. After that tragic event, Kostas and Giannis leave the band. In 1997, the remaining members release the darkest album of the band 'Œ§œÉŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫œâŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒµœÇ ŒúŒ≠œÅŒµœÇ' (Chalakomenes Meres, Creased Days). The missing members are replaced by Iraklis and Kostas - the sound recorder from 'Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±ŒªŒøŒ≥Œ≠œÇ'. Despite that, the band participates that year in the live performance of George Dalaras at 'ŒôŒµœÅŒ¨ ŒüŒ¥œåœÇ' (Iera Odos), where they sing two of their songs: 'Œú'Œ±œÅŒ≠œÉŒµŒπ ŒΩŒ± ŒºŒ∑ ŒõŒ≠œâ Œ†ŒøŒªŒªŒ¨' and 'ŒëœÉŒ∑ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒπŒ± Œ£œÜŒÆŒ∫Œ±' (Asimenia Sfika, Silver Wasp). In 1998, their next work 'ŒïŒπŒ∫œåŒΩŒµœÇ œÉœÑŒ± Œ£œçŒΩŒΩŒµœÜŒ±' (Icones sta Synnefa, Images in the Clouds) is followed, obviously better than their previous, but missing their early freshness. They cover the song 'ŒòŒ±ŒªŒ±œÉœÉŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ±' (Thalassographia, Seagraphy), which is sung by Eleni Tsaligopoulou and is included in an album with song covers of Dionysis Savvopoulos. Mitsos and Iraklis leave the band, while the other members continue participating in other albums, giving songs to artists and doing concerts in many cities. In 1999, after Kostas's departure, a new member, Nikiforos, joins the band. During that year, they start recording their sixth album 'ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒ¨ œÄŒøœÖ ŒïŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ œÑŒ± ŒåŒΩŒµŒπœÅŒ±' (Micra pou Ine ta Onira, How Small Dreams Are). After a lot of work, the album was released in 2000 including 13 new songs. During the next two years, Ypogeia Revmata sign the music of several theatrical plays, do concerts and cooperate with many other artists and bands. In 2003 the band experienced a lot of changes in formation. Markos, Panagiotis and Nikiforos leave the band, while Tasos, Marios, Apostolis and Kostas - one of the founding members of the group - replace them. Before the year ends, Kostas leaves the band again. For the next years, with Grigoris (guitar, vocals) being the only remaining member from the start, Tasos (drums, vocals), Marios (keyboards, vocals) and Apostolis (bass, guitar, accordion, vocals), Ypogia Revmata do a lot of concerts all over Greece, covering their older songs and trying their new material live. In 2007, after six years of absence from discography, Ypogeia Revmata return with their new album 'ŒùŒ≠Œ± ŒúŒ≠œÅŒ±' (Nea Mera, New Day), a title that marks the new age of the band. The band shows a different sound and composition from the usual, mixing rock and lyrical elements and emphasising in poetic lyrics. This new album startled many, as it has a lot of foreign elements.

The film chronicles a former race car driver (played by Bruno Lawrence) who inadvertently contributes to the end of his marriage, then kidnaps his daughter (Greer Robson). Lawrence's character runs a carwrecking yard in an isolated area of New Zealand's North Island. Smash Palace was the second feature directed by Roger Donaldson. Critical acclaim in the United States won him interest from Hollywood, and the chance to direct the first of a number of films financed outside of New Zealand, The Bounty. The soundtrack was composed and performed by New Zealand- born singer Sharon O'Neill. Smash Palace has an R16 rating. Synopsis Retired international racing driver Al Shaw (Lawrence) returned home to take over his late father's car-wrecking yard, \\"Smash Palace\\", on the remote North Island Volcanic Plateau. Al's French-born wife Jacqui (Jemison) is increasingly unhappy with Al's obession with cars and refusal to sell the yard, and fears for the future of their daughter Georgie (Robson). Jacqui begins a relationship with Al's best friend, local police officer Ray Foley (Aberdein). When Al findes Jacqui and Ray together, he violently beats and rapes his wife. Jacqui leaves Al, taking Georgie with her. Jacqui subsequently takes up a job as a teacher and continues her relationship with Ray. Al can't adjust to the separation and harasses Jacqui in his constant efforts to see his daughter. Al plans to make a racing comeback, and Jacqui forbids Al from taking Georgie to the race. In response, he destroys part of Jacqui's house with his tow truck, and is arrested. Jacqui subsequently takes out a protection order on Al to prevent him seeing Georgie. Al sets up a hideout deep in the bush, then kidnaps Georgie from Jacqui at gunpoint. He pushes his tow truck off a cliff into a river to create a diversion for police. Al and Georgie get reacquainted in their bush hideout, but suddenly Georgie falls ill. Al drives into town and robs a pharmacy at gunpoint, where he is spotted by a patrolling police car. He takes the pharmacist hostage and flees with her and Georgie back to Smash Palace. Ray and Jacqui arrive at the hostage scene. Jacqui defies orders and runs through the cordon to reunite with her husband and daughter. Al hands over Georgie, and agrees to let the pharmacist go in exchange for Ray.

When Donaldson first applied for funding, he was turned down. On a second attempt he was once again denied funding, until veteran film maker John O‚ÄôShea pointed out that Donaldson's earlier work Sleeping Dogs had been the reason the commission was founded.Booth, Roger. Bruno: The Bruno Lawrence Story. Canterbury University Press, 1999, p. 203 One of the conditions of the film's eventual funding by the NZFC was that it be completed in time to screen at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival. This forced a tight schedule on the production team, giving only four months between the commencement of the shoot and the film's premiere. Release and reception Although the film was completely New Zealand financed and shot, the film was first released in the USA. The expectation was that by initially releasing in the US the film would gain positive reviews from international critics, thus encouraging local audiences, prone to a dismissal of Kiwi product as amateurish, to go and see the film. The strategy worked, with the film proving hugely successful in New Zealand.McDouall, Hamish. 100 Essential New Zealand Films. Awa Press, 2009, p. 178-180. The film won much acclaim for the performance of Bruno Lawrence, one of New Zealand's best-known actors. It was successful in its home land, and received positive reviews in the United States; Veteran critic Pauline Kael described it as \\"amazingly accomplished\\". Roger Ebert called it one of the best films of 1981, \\"so emotionally wise and observant that we learn from it why people sometimes make the front pages with guns in their hands and try to explain that it's all because of love\\". The New York Times picked it as one of its ten best movies of the year.Martin, Helen and Sam Edwards. New Zealand Film: 1912-1996. Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 78. At the 1982 Manila Film Festival, Bruno Lawrence received an award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Al Shaw.  Location Much of the film was shot on location at car dismantling business Horopito Motors, which has existed on the same site since the 1940s, in the former town of Horopito near Ohakune (). A scene from road movie Goodbye Pork Pie was also shot in the same location. More recently the finale of Hunt for the Wilderpeople was shot at the same site, referencing both the above films.  Soundtrack  A soundtrack was released in 1982, featuring five songs by New Zealand singer songwriter Sharon O'Neill. It won Best Film Soundtrack/Cast Recording/Compilation at the 1983 New Zealand Music Awards.

Their first single 'Yksin' (\\"Alone\\"), penned by Lindahl, came out in summer 1966. Soon afterwards the band's bassist Jorma Toivonen and drummer Mikko Kuoppam√§ki left the Ernos. Late 1966 was released the second single 'Harha' (\\"Illusion\\"), another Lindahl composition and probably the best-known track of the Ernos. These were melancholic songs akin to someone like Roy Orbison. Harmonies also played an important part in the Ernos sound, sung alongside Lindahl by Ilari Hannula who joined in 1966, and in summer 1968 Kati Borg and Marjo-Riitta Kervinen. One can even trace doo-wop influences in some of their songs. The Ernos is known for the exuberant stage performances, even visiting Tallinn of Soviet Estonia as the first Western band in autumn 1968. As a celebration the Ernos concert was arranged on 23 Sept 2008 in Tallinn as well, with Ivo Linna and Rock Hotel also performing in concert hall of Estonia theater. The first Ernos album Rutto ja romu (1968) consisted entirely of Erno Linldahl's own compositions except for the song \\"Kaikki hyvin\\", which was a Finnish translation of The Beach Boys' \\"Good Vibrations\\". The second album Lekaa otsaan (1970) included some rock classics sung in English. The final album Ernos came out in 1973. Erno Lindahl also did some solo recordings accompanied by the orchestra of Nacke Johansson, such as \\"Ei h√§t√§√§\\" (a Finnish version of \\"Elenore\\" by The Turtles) and \\"El√§m√§lt√§ en halua enemp√§√§\\" (\\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La- Da\\" by The Beatles).

The village also gives its name to a former Cambridgeshire hundred. History Thriplow and surrounding villages The parish of Thriplow covers , roughly spanning the land between the former London to Cambridge coaching road (now the B1368) and the Royston to Newmarket road (now the A505). The presence of tumuli in the south of the parish suggests an Iron Age settlement; and a barrow to the east of the village contains a Bronze Age burial. The village itself probably existed in Romano-British times (around AD 150). The Icknield Way to the south of the village was probably an important factor in the village's growth. Listed as Tripelan in around 1050 and Trepeslau in the Domesday Book, the name \\"Thriplow\\" means \\"Hill or tumulus of a man called Tryppa\\". Tryppa is believed to have been a Bronze Age chieftain who may be buried in the tumulus just south east of the church.Thriplow Website In 1647 the New Model Army camped on Thriplow Heath (often referred to in contemporary accounts as \\"Triploe Heath\\") after its refusal to disband during its dispute with Parliament. Thirteen Thriplow residents are recorded to have perished in the First World War and three in the Second World War.Roll Of Honour In recent times the hamlet of Heathfield has built up in the south east of the parish alongside the Imperial War Museum Duxford, with most of the housing dating from the 2000s. Its population (around 600) is now larger than that of Thriplow village (around 440). Church There has been a church in Thriplow since at least the 12th century. In 1284 the church was given to Peterhouse, Cambridge and the first recorded vicar, John de Hyndrayngham, was installed in 1299. The parish church of St George (dedicated to All Saints until the 19th century) dates from the late 13th century and consists of a chancel with north vestry, north and south transepts, a central tower with short spire, and a nave with south porch. The tower and spire date from the 14th century. The south porch was rebuilt by Gilbert Scott in 1877. William Dowsing mutilated the church screen in 1644. The parish is now held with that of Fowlmere and no vicar has lived in Thriplow since 1936. Village life Thriplow has one public house, The Green Man, which has been open since the first half of the 19th century. As of 1 October 2012, The Green Man has been operated as a limited company and owned by local 71 shareholders., Community Page. Former pubs include The Fox, on the east side of Church Street, open in the early 19th century; it burned down in 1919. The Red Lion at the north end of Middle Street burned down around 1941 with the site taken by the village hall in 1958. The village shop last operated as an independent commercial concern between 1997 and 2000. After that there were several failed attempts to continue the shop as a business, and the management was finally taken over by the Thriplow Village Shop Association in June‚ÄìJuly 2007. The village has a park, a primary school, a village hall and a cricket ground. The smithy on the village green was still open in the early 1960s but was given to the village in 1964 as a museum. It opens twice a year when the blacksmith gives a demonstration of traditional skills. Thriplow also contains two sites of special scientific interest: Thriplow Meadows and Thriplow Peat Holes.Natural England - Sites of Special Scientific Interest The Thriplow Daffodil Weekend This tradition started in 1969, to raise money for repairs to the church, and has run each year since (except for 2001 when the weekend was cancelled due to foot-and-mouth disease). The event is organised by the Daffodil Weekend Trust and raises funds for a different charity each year, with the charity for 2014 being Home Start. There are numerous attractions during the weekend including heavy horses giving dray rides, children's entertainment, sheepdog working, open gardens and stalls. New for 2014 was a miniature steam railway on the Cricket Meadow, and over the last two years, the weekend has hosted a Taste of Thriplow.

XOR is a pure puzzle game with no random or arcade elements, as summed up by the blurb on Logotron's original advertising campaign:  Gameplay  = Objective = The player controls two shields, Magus and Questor, which can be moved horizontally and vertically though the maze, in order to collect masks. The object of each level is to collect all the masks, then reach the exit. In all levels, use of both shields are required for completion, and in some, one shield must be sacrificed (walled in or destroyed) in order to complete the level. = Force fields = In the first level, the only obstacles except for the maze walls themselves, are two types of force field: one of which can only be entered from above or below, and a second which can only be entered from left or right. In both cases entering the force field destroys it. = Fish and chickens = In subsequent levels, fish and chicken objects are introduced. Fish fall downwards whenever possible, while chickens run to the left if not blocked. Both can destroy the player's shields by hitting them from more than one square away (like rocks in Boulder Dash). Fish and chickens can move through force fields if entering from the appropriate direction. It is also possible to push fish left or right, and chickens up and down. = Bombs = There are two types of bombs in XOR: \\"V-bombs\\" (\\"vertical\\") and \\"H-bombs\\" (\\"horizontal\\"). V-bombs move left in the same manner as chickens, while H-bombs (shaped like old-fashioned spherical bombs with a burning fuse) fall downwards like fish. Like fish and chickens, H-bombs can be pushed left and right, and V-bombs can be pushed up or down, by the player's shield. A bomb explodes when it is hit from more than one square away by a fish, a chicken, or another bomb. The object hitting the bomb is destroyed, along with anything directly above or below a V-bomb, or to the left or to the right of an H-bomb. If one bomb hits another, only the bomb that is hit (the lower or left-hand one) actually detonates. = Dolls = Unlike fish and chickens, dolls cannot move on their own, although the player's shields can push them around the maze. Once a doll is moving it keeps going until it hits an obstacle. Dolls cannot detonate bombs or pass through force fields. = Other objects = * Map sections: these reveal the layout of part the maze to the player. Masks are highlighted on the map. * Frowning masks: these are switches ‚Äì collecting (or blowing up) one turns off the lighting, causing the maze walls to become invisible, while collecting another turns the lights back on again. * Teleportation portals (labelled BMUS, for \\"Beam Me Up Scotty\\", in some versions): this moves the player's shield to the other teleportation portal within the maze.

Paul Getty, and patriarch of the Getty family. TOC Life and career Getty was born in 1855 in Allegany County, Maryland, to Martha Ann (Wily) and John Getty (1835-1861), who was the son of James Getty and the grandson of another John Getty, a Presbyterian Ulster Scots peasant who immigrated to America and claimed kinship with the namesake of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.Russell Miller, The House of Getty (Google eBook) (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2011) However, Robert Lenzner wrote in his book The Great Getty that Gettysburg was founded by the Gettys family, not Getty.Robert Lenzner, The Great Getty:The Life and Loves of J. Paul Getty-Richest Man in the World (Crown Publishers, Inc., 1986) Shortly after his birth Getty's family moved from Maryland to Ohio where his father died in 1861. Getty was forced to work at a young age until his uncle, Joseph Getty, provided funds for George to attend school. Getty earned a Bachelor of Science from Ohio Northern University in 1879. Eventually Getty married and attended law school at the University of Michigan Law School and was admitted to the bar. In 1884, George F. Getty moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota where he specialized in insurance and corporate law and made a good living in what was the \\"flour capital\\" of America. In 1890 his first child, a daughter, died in a typhoid epidemic that hit the city. In 1892, the Gettys had another child, a son, Jean Paul Getty (later known as J. Paul Getty). In 1904, the Gettys moved from Minnesota to Oklahoma, where George began a career as an independent oilman. Within two years, he had amassed a fortune from his Minnehoma Oil Company and moved his family to Los Angeles, California. In 1913, George lent his son Jean Paul (then aged 21) money to invest in oil wells. By 1915, Jean Paul had made his first million and the following year George and Jean Paul incorporated the Getty Oil Company, later to become Getty Oil. George never approved of Jean Paul's lifestyle. Perhaps this is why he did not leave the company in the sole control of his son. George F. Getty died in 1930. He left his estate, in the form of the controlling interest in the family firm \\"George F. Getty, Inc.\\", and valued at between $10 million and $15 million U.S. ($ million and $ million, respectively, in ), to his wife Sarah, although Jean Paul Getty became President of the firm. George Getty II Jean Paul Getty's eldest son, George Franklin Getty's grandson, was named George Franklin Getty II (1924‚Äì1973), and was an executive in the Getty Oil company until his death. His residence, Getty House, was then donated to the city, and became the official residence of the serving Mayor of Los Angeles.

The structure of Japan's labor market experienced gradual change in the late 1980s and continued this trend throughout the 1990s. The structure of the labor market is affected by: 1) shrinking population, 2) replacement of postwar baby boom generation, 3) increasing numbers of women in the labor force, and 4) workers' rising education level. Also, increase in numbers of foreign nationals in the labor force is foreseen. As of 2019 Japan's unemployment rate was the lowest in the G7. Its employment rate for the working-age population (15-64) was the highest in the G7. Character The basic Japanese employment structure is known as \\"Simultaneous recruiting of new graduates\\" and \\"ranking hierarchy\\", which includes seniority wages and lifetime employment. It allows employees to learn broad skills to achieve in long-term perspective through job rotation and on- the-job training which is likely to be firm-specific. Since Japanese firms develop firm-specific skills throughout long-term employment, it is difficult to enter the internal labor market which is only open to new graduates from high school or university, or those who can be competitive in the market with their special qualification or knowledge. This internal market worked well in Japanese firms. However, Japan has shifted to US-type regulation and capitalism after the burst of economic bubble, and Japanese firms have introduced two developments: 1) performance-related pay, and 2) non-regular employment such as part-time, temporary and hiring through human resource agencies. Performance-related pay requires short-term evaluation of employees' performance, which means that wage could reflect immediate job performance rather than the skills over the long-term. This could have negative effect on the long-term development. It was suggested that this system cannot be efficacious for typical Japanese firms where skill-based wages motivate employees to gain experience and build their abilities. However, the notion of non-regular employment was introduced by the employer's association Nikkeiren and has been promoted since the 1990s. The principal reason of innovation in flexible staffing is not for flexibility but economizing labor costs. Non- regular employees are common in the retailing and restaurant sectors: 44.3% in retailing and 63.4% in restaurant/hotel industry compared to 17.7% in construction and 21.4% in manufacturing industry in 2004. Demographic impact Japan is now facing a shortage of labor caused by two major demographic problems: shrinking population because of a low fertility rate, which was 1.4 per woman in 2009, and replacement of the postwar generation which is the biggest population range who are now around retirement age. The population aged over 15 to 64 years old is 63.7% (80,730 thousand people) of the total population; most of them are considered as productive population who work and support those who are too old or too young to work, while the percentage of the population aged 65 and over is 23.1% of the total population in 2011 This impacts the shortage of labor in the physical care of the aged people, and Japanese government started bring in care workers from overseas which is managed by bilateral agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines. Recently, Japan has seriously considered introducing \\"foreign workers\\" to the nation twice. The first was in the late 1980s, when there was the labor shortage because of the economic boom, however it was forgotten when the economy worsened. The second started in 1999 since the labor shortage caused by demographic change According to Shinzo Abe in Davos in 2019, while Japan‚Äôs labor force decreased by 4.5 million in the past six years, the employment of women and elderly people each increased by 2 million. With a shortage of work force, Japan has been trying to supplement the labor market with higher female participation. Socially, Japanese society has been reversing the traditional norms of domestic housewives, as more and more women are encouraged to work. Institutionally, Japanese government has been making efforts to close the wage gap and offer better family policies, as part of womenomics proposed under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2013. Employment wise, female labor-participation rate has gone up from 62.7% in 1997, to 70.1% in 2015. Yet a significant portion of female workers are participating in low wage and part-time jobs, while the wage gap was still the third highest in OECD countries in 2017 and women still felt limited in career development. Another changing demographic of Japanese labor market is higher elder participation. As the share of population 65 and above jumped from 10% in 1990 to 26.6 percent in 2015, the elderly component of the workforce rose from 7.8% in 2006 to 11.8% in 2016. On one hand, many elders are retired workers that are rehired to the work force as an irregular employee, which account for the majority of workers between 65-69. On the other hand, the regular and irregular employee structure can limit potentially higher elder participation, as \\"irregular\\" positions can be insecure and lower paying. As many elders still need to supplement their post- retirement income, the aged worker participation may continue to rise, as 42% of employees above 60 suggest they would like to continue working as long as able. Workers' changing attitudes The success of corporations in Japan is attributable to the remarkable motivation of its workers. Also behind this corporate prosperity is the workers' strong sense of loyalty to and identification with their employers. While many theories have evolved to explain the extraordinary attitude of Japanese workers, perhaps the most noteworthy is that of personnel management. This view holds that loyalty to the company has developed as a result of job security and a wage system in which those with the greatest seniority reap the highest rewards. Such corporate structure presumably fostered not only a determined interest in the company but also a low percentage of workers who changed jobs. During the postwar economic reconstruction, the backbone of the labor force was, of course, made up of people born before World War II. These people grew up in a Japan that was still largely an agriculturally based economy and had little material wealth. Moreover, they had suffered the hardships of war and had accepted hard work as a part of their lives. In the late twentieth century, these people were being replaced by generations born after the war, and there were indications that the newcomers had different attitudes toward work. Postwar generations were accustomed to prosperity and were also better educated than their elders. As might be expected, these socioeconomic changes have affected workers' attitudes. Prior to World War II, surveys indicated that the aspect of life regarded as most worthwhile was work. During the 1980s, the percentage of people who felt this way was declining. Workers' identification with their employers was weakening as well. A survey by the Management and Coordination Agency revealed that a record 2.7 million workers changed jobs in the one-year period beginning October 1, 1986, and the ratio of those who switched jobs to the total labor force matched the previous high recorded in 1974 (one year after the first oil crisis). This survey also showed that the percentage of workers indicating an interest in changing jobs increased from 4.5 percent in 1971 to 9.9 percent in 1987. Another indication of changing worker attitudes is the number of people meeting with corporate scouts to discuss the possibility of switching jobs. Corporations' treatment of older workers also affects attitudes: there are fewer positions for older workers, and many find themselves without the rewards that their predecessors had enjoyed. Workers from overseas Traditionally, Japan has had strict laws regarding the employment of foreigners, although exceptions were made for certain designated activities, provided that the workers have attended a Japanese university and have a high level of Japanese-language proficiency. Excepted categories have included executives and managers engaged in commercial activities, full-time scholars associated with research and education institutions, professional entertainers, engineers and others specializing in advanced technology, foreign-language teachers, and others with special skills unavailable among Japanese nationals. In 2019, restaurant, retail shop and factory production line workers were added to the list. Officially, in 2008 there were 486,400 foreign workers in Japan: 43.3% of Chinese, 20.4% of Brazilians, 8.3% of Filipinos and others (A labour Ministry survey of Companies). More recent studies suggest that Japan has struggled to attract potential migrants despite immigration laws being relatively lenient (especially for high-skilled workers) compared to other developed countries. This is also apparent when looking at Japan's work visa programme for \\"specified skilled worker\\", which had less than 400 applicants, despite an annual goal of attracting 40,000 overseas workers, suggesting Japan faces major challenges in attracting migrants compared to other developed countries. A Gallup poll found that few potential migrants wished to migrate to Japan compared to other G7 countries, consistent with the country's low migrant inflow. Despite the now-reversed upward trend in the unemployment rate, many unpopular jobs go unfilled and the domestic labor market is sluggish. Imported labor is seen as a solution to this situation by some employers, who hire low- paid foreign workers, who are, in turn, enticed by comparatively high Japanese wages. The strict immigration laws are expected to remain on the books, however, although the influx of illegal aliens from nearby Asian countries (China, South-East Asian and Middle-Eastern countries) to participate in the labor market is likely to increase. Japanese companies have also established foreign subsidiaries to profit from low wages overseas. This trend started in Singapore in the 1970s. The outsourcing helped to build local infrastructure and started a technological transfer, and some of the former subsidiaries and joint ventures developed into fierce competitors. =China and Vietnam= China has become an exporter of labor to Japan to perform low wage \\"3K\\" jobs: Kitsui (demanding), Kitanai (dirty), and Kiken (dangerous). Chinese workers are hired by Chinese companies which contract with Japanese industry to provide labor. The Japanese government facilitates the import of labor under the Technical Intern Training Program administered by the Japan International Training Cooperation Organization (JITCO). Hours are long, pay sub-standard, and the freedom of the workers while in Japan is restricted. The Chinese or Vietnamese workers customarily pay a substantial sum to enter the programs and may have to make a substantial deposit as a guarantee that once in Japan they will work for the assigned employer, nevertheless, once in Japan, a number abandon the program and seek illegal employment in Japan, only the most exploitive being available. There is also a substantial number of workers from Vietnam. =Brazil= Japanese-Brazilians are descendants of Japanese who have immigrated to Brazil. They were discovered as a new labor source around 1990 and around one fifth of them now reside in Japan, which increased even after the collapse of the bubble economy in 1990. They are mainly located in two less appreciated sectors: 1) comparatively stable but low wage level in small to medium size factories troubled by constant labor shortage, and 2) highly unstable in medium to large size firms needing flexible staffing. The employers prefer Japanese-Brazilians to undocumented workers for racial or ethnocultural reasons. Earlier migrants were relatively fluent in Japanese, and caused less xenophobic reaction in factories. Undocumented workers tend to find jobs based on their personal networks whereas Brazilians do so through institutionalized channels, including recruiting agencies, and are paid more. During 2009, the national unemployment reached 5.7%, which is considerably high in Japan, especially in the manufacture industry which congregates in T≈çkai region, where estimated 83,000 of Japanese-Brazilians and Peruvians work in the industry. In April, the Japanese government budgeted 1.08 billion yen (valued 1.08 million US dollar in 2009) for Japanese-Brazilian immigrant workers for training, including Japanese language lesson, but also offered 300,000 yen (average wage of 18 to 39 years old in manufacture industry is 241,200 yen) to any unemployed workers who wished to leave the country and 200,000 yen each to their family members on the condition of not returning to Japan within 3 years with the same status =United States of America= In the 1980s, the strong Japanese yen allowed Japanese companies to buy several American firms, adding a large American workforce to Japanese companies. The crisis of the 1990s, the lost decade, reversed the process, and western companies were buying major stakes in big Japanese companies, especially car makers. The process became like that of the 1980s by the early 2000s, when the country experienced a major recovery under the Prime Minister Koizumi administration. During that time, western stakes were greatly reduced or eliminated.

There was no exception to the Nazis' policy of racial discrimination and physical annihilation of the Jews. As stated by Yehuda Bauer, academic advisor at Yad Vashem, \\"regarding the Jews, the perpetrators were equal opportunity killers.\\" In European North Africa There were 400,000 Jews in France's territories in North Africa (French Algeria, which was an integral part of France, and the French protectorates of Morocco and Tunisia). They were included in the number relevant to \\"the Final Solution to the Jewish Question in Europe\\" under: \\"France/unoccupied territory 700,000 (see Sir Martin Gilbert's the Dent Atlas of the Holocaust, p. 99) The Jews of European North Africa were spared the mass deportations that happened in the rest of Europe. =Jews of Italian Libya in the Shoah= Libya was under Italian rule. The Jews, who were British and Italian subjects, suffered from antisemitism and economic restrictions as a result of the strengthening of Italy's relationship with Germany. From 1942, laws of racial discrimination were activated in Libya. Men between the ages of 18 and 45 were recruited to forced labor and thousands died from hunger and epidemics. In February of that year, the Germans ordered the transfer of the Jews to concentration camps. =Jews of Vichy-Algeria in the Shoah= Vichy France (that ruled in Algeria from 1940) cancelled the citizenship of the Jews and instituted the same restrictions that applied to the Jews in metropolitan France. It forbade them from working for the government or as bankers, teachers and students. In addition, the number of Jews permitted to work in free professions was limited. In 1941, the property of the Jews was confiscated. However, in a sign of the solidarity in suffering, not a single Muslim Algerian took advantage of Jewish confiscated property; on a Friday in 1941, religious leaders throughout Algiers delivered sermons warning Muslims against participation in schemes to strip Jews of their property.The Schindlers of the Middle East The suffering of the Jews of Algeria was worsened by their previous high position in society. In 1941, some Jews joined the anti-Nazi underground. Many Jews were caught and were sent to labor camps or were executed. The Judenr√§te required assistance in preparation of materiel. In November 1942 Algeria was occupied by the United States and Great Britain. In 1943, the restraints on the Jews of Algeria were officially cancelled. =Jews of Vichy-Tunisia in the Shoah= Tunisia was also ruled by pro-Nazi Vichy France, which extended its anti- Jewish measures to Morocco and Algeria. In November 1942 Nazi Germany occupied French Tunisia for six months, until May 1943. SS Oberstrumbannf√ºhrer Walter Rauff, a brutal and notorious killer involved in the development of death gas vans and the Final Solution in Eastern Europe, was posted as commander of Tunis. From July 1942 until May 1943, he headed an Einsatzkommando to take care of the Jewish Question in Tunisia, and to continue to implement the Final Solution in Vichy-Tunisia. Oswald Pohl, charged by Himmler to organize the camps in Eastern Europe, joined him. Despite constant attacks by the Allies, Rauff instigated drastic anti-Jewish policies. The Nazis established a local Judenrat, took hostages, confiscated the property of the Jews (aryanization) and imposed on the community heavy financial punishments. The community was required to provide the needs of the German army, and the synagogue become a German storeroom. The Jews were marked with the Yellow badge, 5,000 Jews were sent to more than 30 slave labor camps in Tunisia and a few were sent to the extermination camps. Many Jews were murdered by means of being shot in their homes, death marches, hunger, diseases and bombings. Tunisia was occupied by the Allies in May 1943, and the persecution of the Jews ceased. It was the first Jewish community to be liberated from Nazi Germany. =Jews of Vichy- Morocco in the Shoah= In 1940, the Nazi-controlled Vichy government issued antisemitic decrees excluding Jews from public functions and imposing the wear of the yellow Magen David star. Sultan Mohamed V refused to apply these laws and, as sign of defiance, insisted on inviting all the rabbis of Morocco to the 1941 throne celebrations.Moroccan Jews pay homage to \`protector' - Haaretz - Israel News In Asia =Jews of Iraq in the Shoah= While not under occupation by Nazi Germany, Iraq was, for a short term, under the Nazi-allied regime of Rashid Ali al-Gaylani. While the regime did not last long, the Farhud (a pogrom in which 180 Jews died) is considered among its results. =Jews in Japan and China= Prior to the war there was a small Jewish presence in Japan, particularly Kobe, which consisted of Jews originating predominantly from Russia, as well as those from the Middle East, Eastern Europe and the United States. In Japanese-occupied China there was a more significant Jewish population, including White Russian refugees and Baghdadi Jews. As Jewish persecution in Europe stepped up an increasing number of refugees travelled to China by steamship or had transited through the Soviet Union and were hoping to move on to the United States. Most of these Jews were concentrated in the Shanghai International Settlement. When Japan entered the war many Jews were interned, including the Baghdadi Jews who were identified as British subjects. The Japanese implemented strict measures to control the activities of the Shanghai ghetto who were restricted in 1943 to a one square mile city block shared with 100,000 Chinese. However despite repeated requests from Nazi Germany to implement antisemitic policies, including exterminating the Jewish population in the Shanghai ghetto, the Jewish population was generally left alone (apart from wartime privations).

Sibyrtius ( Sivyrtios; lived 4th century BC) was a Greek officer from CreteHelmut Berve (Das Alexanderreich auf prosopographischer Grundlage #703) in the service of Alexander the Great, who was the satrap of Arachosia and Gedrosia shortly after the death of Alexander until about 303 BC. After serving in Alexander's army for a number of years, Sibyrtius was appointed by Alexander, on his return from India (326 BCE), governor of the province of Carmania. Shortly after, Sibyrtius exchanged this post for the more important satrapy of Arachosia and Gedrosia, to which he succeeded on the death of Thoas. Following the death of Alexander in 323, Sibyrtius, in common with most of the other governors of the remote eastern provinces, retained possession of his satrapy, which was again confirmed to him in the second partition at Triparadisus in 321. In the subsequent divisions involving the eastern satraps, Sibyrtius was one of those who supported Peucestas against Peithon and Seleucus, and afterwards accompanied Peucestas when he joined Eumenes in Susiana in 317. His attachment was to Peucestas and not to Eumenes, and in Peucestas' subsequent intrigues against his commander-in-chief, Sibyrtius supported him so strongly that he incurred Eumenes' strong resentment, who threatened to bring him to trial; a fate from which he only escaped by a hasty flight. Sibyrtius' open rupture with Eumenes had the advantage of securing him the favour of Antigonus, who, after the defeat of his rival, confirmed Sibyrtius in his satrapy, and placed under his command a large part of the select body of troops termed Argyraspids. Antigonus adopted this measure with the ostensible object of guarding the Eastern provinces against the neighbouring Indians, but in reality Antigonus has in mind the gradual destruction of the troops in question, whose turbulent and disaffected spirit was well known.. According to Arrian, Megasthenes lived in Arachosia at the court of Sibyrtius, and travelled as an ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya in Pataliputra. Arrian mentions that Megasthenes, the historian and ambassador of Seleucus to India after his 303 BCE treaty with Chandragupta, lived with Sibyrtius, suggesting the latter may have remained at his post as satrap for quite a long time: :\\"Megasthenes lived with Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, and often speaks of his visiting Sandracottus, the king of the Indians.\\" References *Smith, William (editor); Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \\"Sibyrtius\\", Boston, (1867) Notes Satraps of the Alexandrian Empire Ancient Cretan generals Ancient Greeks in Macedon Generals of Alexander the Great 4th-century BC Greek people Governors of Antigonus I Monophthalmus ","title":"Sibyrtius"},{"id":"2861799","text":"The tensor product of graphs. In graph theory, the tensor product G √ó H of graphs G and H is a graph such that * the vertex set of G √ó H is the Cartesian product V(G) √ó V(H); and * vertices (g,h) and (g',h') are adjacent in G √ó H if and only if **g is adjacent to g' **h is adjacent to h'. The tensor product is also called the direct product, Kronecker product, categorical product, cardinal product, relational product, weak direct product, or conjunction. As an operation on binary relations, the tensor product was introduced by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell in their Principia Mathematica (1912). It is also equivalent to the Kronecker product of the adjacency matrices of the graphs. The notation G √ó H is also (and formerly normally was) used to represent another construction known as the Cartesian product of graphs, but nowadays more commonly refers to the tensor product. The cross symbol shows visually the two edges resulting from the tensor product of two edges. This product should not be confused with the strong product of graphs. Examples * The tensor product G √ó K2 is a bipartite graph, called the bipartite double cover of G. The bipartite double cover of the Petersen graph is the Desargues graph: K2 √ó G(5,2) = G(10,3). The bipartite double cover of a complete graph Kn is a crown graph (a complete bipartite graph Kn,n minus a perfect matching). * The tensor product of a complete graph with itself is the complement of a Rook's graph. Its vertices can be placed in an n by n grid, so that each vertex is adjacent to the vertices that are not in the same row or column of the grid. Properties The tensor product is the category- theoretic product in the category of graphs and graph homomorphisms. That is, a homomorphism to G √ó H corresponds to a pair of homomorphisms to G and to H. In particular, a graph I admits a homomorphism into G √ó H if and only if it admits a homomorphism into G and into H. To see that, in one direction, observe that a pair of homomorphisms and yields a homomorphism :begin{cases} f : I to G times H  f(v) = left (f_G(v), f_H(v) right ) end{cases} In the other direction, a homomorphism can be composed with the projections homomorphisms :begin{cases} pi_G : G times H to G  pi_G((u,u')) = u end{cases} qquad qquad begin{cases} pi_H : G times H to H  pi_H((u,u')) = u' end{cases} to yield homomorphisms to G and to H. The adjacency matrix of G √ó H is the tensor product of the adjacency matrices of G and H. If a graph can be represented as a tensor product, then there may be multiple different representations (tensor products do not satisfy unique factorization) but each representation has the same number of irreducible factors. gives a polynomial time algorithm for recognizing tensor product graphs and finding a factorization of any such graph. If either G or H is bipartite, then so is their tensor product. G √ó H is connected if and only if both factors are connected and at least one factor is nonbipartite. In particular the bipartite double cover of G is connected if and only if G is connected and nonbipartite. The Hedetniemi conjecture, which gave a formula for the chromatic number of a tensor product, was disproved by . The tensor product of graphs equips the category of graphs and graph homomorphisms with the structure of a symmetric closed monoidal category. Let G_0 denote the underlying set of vertices of the graph G. The internal hom [G, H] has functions f:G_0 to H_0 as vertices and an edge from f:G_0 to H_0 to f':G_0 to H_0 whenever an edge {x, y} in G implies {f(x), f'(y)} in H.

Fakhar ul mulk and Khan-i-Khanan II, were the son's of Nawab Fakhar- ul-mulk I, a noble of Hyderabad. The founder of the college and of several other educational institutions in the Hyderabad State, was Syed Hussain Bilgrami (Nawab Imad-ul- Mulk), who did pioneering work in the field of education as the Director of Education. He scouted and then appointed Dr. Aghorenath Chattopadhyay ( father of Sarojini Naidu, Nightingale of India) as the first Principal of the college. The present building, was a summer palace of Paigah Nawab Mulk Fakrul Bahadur, later he gifted the palace to the college administration. Institution This college is an autonomous, constituent college of Osmania University. It is located near Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in Hyderabad. Nizam College was originally a palace of Fakhrul-ul-mulk II, a noble of Hyderabad. One of the premier colleges within the fold of Osmania University, Nizam College celebrated its centenary in 1987. The college is one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions of higher education not only in Telangana State but also in India. It was established in 1887 by the amalgamation of the Hyderabad School (Noble School) and Madarsa-I-Aliya. Initially it was affiliated to the University of Madras for 60 years and was made a constituent college of Osmania University on 19 February 1947. In view of its consistently high degree of academic performance and long standing the college had been granted autonomous status by the UGC in the year 1988‚Äì89 at undergraduate level and continues to enjoy this status. It is also NAAC accredited and has been given CPE (College with Potential for Excellence) grant by the UGC. The college has its own academic bodies viz., Governing Body, Academic Council, Finance Committee, Internal Quality Assurance Cell and Boards of Studies for each department to monitor its academic, financial and other activities to the desired level of satisfaction of the appropriate authorities. The College offers both the undergraduate as well as postgraduate courses in the Faculties of Management, Arts and Social Sciences, Science, and Commerce. At present the college has 29 teaching departments. In addition to these courses, several students are pursuing their Doctoral and Post-Doctoral programmes. Courses of Study The college has undergraduate courses B.B.A., B.Sc., B.A. and B.Com. It also has B.C.A. There are 13 postgraduate programs leading to M.A., M.Sc. and M.Com degrees. There is a new 5-year integrated M.Sc. course in Chemistry. The college also has M.B.A., M.C.A and M.Sc. (IS) professional courses.

History The concept is mentioned in the 1965 science fiction novel Dune by Frank Herbert as a method to inflict pain with no actual injury. No known real-life analogues of such a device currently exist. However, the effect sometime occurs as a side effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation. In addition, a number of non- lethal pain compliance devices have been developed. The most reminiscent of Herbert's fictional device is the microwave-based Active Denial System, which shows many of the same traits, but uses microwaves rather than nerve induction.

Like the band's first album The Funeral Sciences, it was released through the record label The Control Group. Following the band's first release, they had generated success with the underground Seattle rock scene and had secured a small cult following, largely due to the reputation they had built from their concert tour with Vendetta Red. All four members of the band recorded the album while living at the same University District together. The production of the album was handled by Joe Reineke and T. Dallas Reed, with the majority of the lyrics composed by the band's singer and frontman Ryann Donnelly. Donnelly serves as the main singer on the album, with bassist Jonah Bergman performing backing vocals. Taking influence from horror films, lyrically the album features macabre subject matter and social commentary. The band expressed the desire to become more diverse with their musical approach than on their debut album, citing a larger list of influences. The album presents some of its themes in a theatrical, over-the- top and often campy style. It was promoted by the single \\"They Live\\", which received a music video. The album received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Donnelly's singing, the progression that the band had showcased from their prior work, and the humorous way that the morbid themes were expressed on the project. While a critical success, the album failed to achieve any chart positions. The success of the album lead to the release of their final album Abominations released in 2007. Background The debut album by Schoolyard Heroes, The Funeral Sciences was an underground success, selling over 5000 copies. Following the release of their album, the band promoted themselves with a concert tour with Seattle-based band Vendetta Red. While on tour the band simultaneously worked on their second album. The band quickly developed a reputation for their eccentric, often shocking live performances, and began to develop a cult following. They were noted for their prolific nature and their frequent live performances and touring. For their sophomore release, the band chose to stay with their record label The Control Group, founded by Nabil Ayers. Ayers stated that touring with Vendetta Red was the best thing that could have happened to the band, comparing it to touring with the band Green Day. He expressed that touring with a band with a similar style and an already established fanbase would influence the band members positively. Writing and recording Singer Courtney Love served as an inspiration to vocalist Donnelly. All four members of Schoolyard Heroes lived together at the Seattle University District during the recording of Fantastic Wounds. Vocalist Ryan Donnelly noted that during the production of the album the band didn't do drugs or drink alcohol, and instead spent their time playing video games and eating fast food. Between recording sessions, the band spent their loose time watching episodes of classic horror series like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits. The album's style progresses from the one found in The Funeral Sciences; the more pop heavy aesthetic exhibited on that album was replaced with themes found within heavy metal music, and was more forceful and \\"merciless\\" in nature. Conceptual themes found within their first project are maintained on Fantastic Wounds, including lyrics inspired by science fiction and horror films. Like all of the band's projects, the album takes several of its themes from b-movies and horror films. Horror films had always been a substantial influence on the band; bassist Jonah Bergman's father had taken him to double features as a kid. According to Bergman, the band had grown quite a lot from their first album and had learned more about producing and recording music. Bergman, when describing the album, mused, \\"honestly, these are 10 of the most fucking killer songs I've ever heard in my life,\\" stating that the album perfectly embodied the type of music the band wished to produce. According to Donnelly, the band had been working together for five years, stating that if she didn't have the band, she wouldn't know what else to do with her life. She described the band as a work of passion, citing sources of influences such as the bands Misfits, Blondie and Iron Maiden, and singer Courtney Love. The Misfits in particular were a large influence to the album; their horror themed and often purposely over-the-top style to making music were important in shaping the way the band presented themselves in image. Donelly expressed an interest with progressing the style of music on their sophomoric effort, stating that she wanted to have a tighter focus this time around, and specifically noting that the song titles on Fantastic Wounds were more direct and confident in nature. Speaking about the creation of the project, she mused: > ‚ÄúI am so very happy with this record‚Äîboth with the performances and the > production. Blood, sweat and tears went into its making. It was the longest > we‚Äôd spent on anything ever we‚Äôve done. We knew how we wanted it to sound > and we wanted to get it perfect, so yeah, we spent a long time on it. And I > tell you; we had to make a lot of tough choices, with the sequencing. We > wanted it to be perfect, we wanted all the different energies to flow into > each other just so.‚Äù While the album was influenced by things such as macabre horror tales, zombies, and monsters, Donelly assured that the album was ‚Äúalways about something much more real\\", musing that \\"there‚Äôs so much genuine evil in the world. That said, I love that people take all kinds of different things away from our songs, and invest so much of themselves in their interpretations.‚Äù To prevent the album from being to depressing, the band attempted to present the album with the aesthetic of a b-movie, with a comical, overly theatrical tone. Donelly also noted the desire to become more diverse musically with the second album, as the band had begun to listen to more sources of music. Bergman cited his desire to one day perform in Graceland as another influence on the project, musing that if the band became popular enough he would one day be able to perform there. Bergman commented \\"I used to sit in my bedroom and think, 'Damn, if we could just play Graceland, I would die a happy guy'\\". Before the album was released, it was promoted by the release of a music video for the single \\"They Live\\". Content Album opener \\"Body Shots\\" serves as an introduction to the style of the album. The song is barely one minute in length, compared to the duration of the majority of the songs on the album which are around four minutes long. The song contains singing by Donnelly that is largely scream-based, with guitar riffing taking influence from thrash metal. The track showcases guitarist Steve Bonnell's math rock-driven and largely melodic riffs that dominate the opening song. \\"Body Shots\\" has been described as a trailer for the rest of the album; the overall tone and energy of the song has been cited as a teaser for the rest of the album. The next song, \\"Panic in the Year Zero\\", boasts a chorus that invokes the Iron Maiden song \\"Run to the Hills\\". The song has been called epic in nature, with guitar playing influenced by the playing of Omar Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez. Donnelly's vocal performance has been compared to that of Bruce Dickinson on the song. The song waltzes over topics like the apocalypse and features Donnelly singing \\"say your prayers\\" in a multitude of ways. Steven Bishop of Hybrid Magazine views that \\"Year Zero\\" showcases some of the lighter themes of the album, summarizing: > \\"Believe me, there is nothing like a female singer who can step up and belt > out the lines, yet has enough Sauv√© Fair to finesse the lighter side of the > material, and \\"Panic In The Year Zero\\" is a perfect example of that. If the > vocals are the constancy, the guitar is the meat and potatoes, delivering > resounding lines that drive the material and vary the intensity nicely; one > moment giving meaningful power chords, the next moving with an asynchronous > line. The bass uses space appropriately, developing astute lines that > emphasize relationships to the drums here and the guitar there, always > keeping it interesting.\\" \\"Serial Killers Know How to Party\\" is tongue-in-cheek and somewhat comical in nature, heavily influences by horror films. Donnelly shouts \\"your screams could raise the dead\\" over a fast-paced guitar riff. \\"Centaur: Half-Man Half- Motorcycle\\" is reinforced with a double-bass panel, a technique that allows the drumming to sound more clear. Both \\"Centaur: Half-Man Half-Motorcycle\\" and \\"Battlestar Anorexia\\" channel some of the thematic similarities as the act Betty Blowtorch. On \\"They Live\\", Donelly boasts the line ‚Äúcome with me, you pretty thing, and we‚Äôll celebrate with amputations.‚Äù The song is named from the John Carpenter film, They Live. \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\" features a foreboding atmosphere, fueled by a progressive math-rock style of production, with some disco influences as well. \\"Funeral Parlor Tricks\\" features widely different styles of production during its running time. \\"Nothing Cleanses Quite Like a Fire\\" and album closer \\"The Girl Who Was Born Without a Face\\" relay themes of pulp violence. Reception Exclaim! critic Sam Sutherland felt that the band had successfully progressed from their debut album, musing \\"more polished than their debut, this record possesses all the angular riffs and math-rock breakdowns of their previous work, but is greatly aided by a sense of cohesion between their colliding influences and disparate style of songwriting\\", describing the album \\"as fantastic as its title suggests.\\" Ernest Simpson of TrebleZine called Donnelly the Seattle-based Karen O, and wrote that \\"don't be surprised if Schoolyard Heroes leap to a major or at least a larger indie label after the success of Fantastic Wounds.\\" Roger Holland of PopMatters viewed that the band had begun as a juvenile pop-punk with only a few unique ideas, calling Fantastic Wounds a \\"thing of pure kinetic beauty\\". According to Holland, the album was \\"polished, perfected and just generally worked up into something quiet shiny and special. On the debut, the influences were everywhere, suffocating the spark. But the new songs, with names like ‚ÄúPanic in the Year Zero‚Äù, ‚ÄúNightmare At 20,000 Feet‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Girl Who Was Born Without a Face‚Äù are confident, complex and strong enough to give this young band its own fierce identity.\\" Seattle Weekly critic Michaelangelo Matos viewed that while Donnelly was the standout of the album, stating that the band was \\"neither a rock Diamanda nor a mere hood ornament; Schoolyard Heroes' ghastly gestalt feeds on at least four entities\\", and that the album was launched by a triplet-driven solo performance by Jonah Bergman. Decoy's music Brandon Carter compared the band favorably to a train wreck, commenting that the band could be viewed \\"in the same fashion as a train wreck you just can‚Äôt bring yourself to look away, for fear that you might miss something\\", continuing that \\"however, what you‚Äôd miss if you turned away from this band is a fearsome onslaught of shrieks, screams, and raw energy.\\" Steven Bishop of Hybrid Magazine reported that style-wise the band was not be for everyone, commenting that but for those select few who appreciate the movement and atmosphere created here, they will find a technically judicious band that leads with good hooks and follows through with great substance to create an album that is wholly worth it, back to front.\\" Jessica Grose of Spin viewed that Donnelly seems \\"to be lobbying for goth poster girl of the new millennium\\", stating that the album successfully bordered on both metal and punk influences. Three Imaginary Girls mused that Fantastic Wounds maintained the \\"acrobatic inter-instrumental dynamics and savagely clever, at times genuinely affecting modern-life-as-horror-movie lyrics that defined their awesome debut, The Funeral Sciences\\", and noted that it \\"lacks a bit in the insouciant exuberance displayed by its predecessor.\\" The same website later listed the album amongst their 100 best albums of the year at number 18. While not charting on any music charts, the album was a commercial success, selling 1500 copies in its first week of release.

The company has 60 manufacturing facilities across 18 countries within North and South America, Europe, and Asia. It provides drivetrain components to all three U.S. automakers, as well as a variety of European and Asian original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. BorgWarner has diversified into several automotive-related markets (1999), including ignition interlock technology (ACS Corporation est.1976) for preventing impaired operation of vehicles. Historically, BorgWarner was also known for its ownership of the Norge appliance company (refrigerator/freezers, washers and dryers), as well as York International (heating, ventilating, and air- conditioning equipment). Company history The original Borg-Warner Corporation was formed in 1928 by the merger of Warner Gear, which itself was founded by Thomas Warner in 1901, and Borg & Beck founded by Charles Borg and Marshall Beck in 1903, Marvel Schelber Carburetor Co founded in 1905 by George Schebler and the Mechanics Universal Joint Co. The company was best known as the supplier of Warner Gear overdrive units for cars of the 1930s to the 1970s, and as the developer of Studebaker's three-speed automatic transmission introduced in 1950, along with 'Holley' brand Borg & Beck carburetors. Ford took up development of the transmission in Studebaker's place in 1955. The early Ford automatics are derivatives of the Borg Warner. The Warner Gear name was still being used for the marine and industrial transmissions supplied by Borg Warner under the trade name 'Velvet Drive' into the 1980s. The 'Velvet Drive' production was transferred to Regal-Beloit Corporation in 1995, who trade as \\"Velvet Drive Transmissions\\". In the 21st century, the company changed the styling of its name from Borg-Warner to BorgWarner. The company is also notable for co-developing a variable-geometry turbocharger with Porsche, the Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) system, used in the 2007 911 Turbo. BorgWarner claims this technology will reach mainstream cars within 10 years. From 2002, Peugeot, Ford and Renault became major customers for the company's turbochargers with the Volkswagen Group on-board since 1999, choosing to exclusively use the BorgWarner K-Series turbochargers for their then-new 1.8T power plant. BorgWarner supplies wet clutches and hydraulic modules for dual- clutch transmission systems. With their DualTronic technology, BorgWarner has gained contracts with European automakers that want to use dual clutch transmissions. The German automotive concern Volkswagen Group is BorgWarner's largest customer (by sales), and Europe is their largest market. Light vehicles (automobiles, car-derived vans, and light commercial vehicles) account for 72% of BorgWarner's total sales. The company's world headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Robert S. Ingersoll formerly served as the company's CEO and Chairman. BorgWarner's Powertrain Technical Center (PTC) is also based in Auburn Hills. The BorgWarner Indianapolis 500 Trophy is presented to the winner of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto racing event; this has been provided by the company since 1936, as a legacy of Louie Schwitzer who won the first automobile racing event held at the facility, in 1909. It was announced by the Izod Indycar Series that BorgWarner has been selected as the official supplier for the turbochargers to be used in the 2.2L turbocharged engine formula for the series which took effect in 2012. On October 2, 2006, BorgWarner announced the purchase of the European Transmission and Engine Controls product lines from Eaton Corporation. In January 2020, BorgWarner and Delphi Technologies announced that BorgWarner will acquire Delphi for $3.3 billion to expand its ability to supply hybrid and electric vehicles. In March 2020, BorgWarner raised the option of terminating the acquisition deal after Delphi tapped its $500 million revolving credit facility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020 BorgWarner completed the acquisition of Delphi Technologies. Company structure In 2002, BorgWarner Inc. was split into two key business divisions: *BorgWarner Engine Group: This is responsible for the research and development of the company's internal combustion engine-related components, along with operational efficiency, including fuel consumption, emissions and performance. Key products are turbochargers and other related engine operation components. *BorgWarner Drivetrain Group: The fundamental core of this division is its automotive transmission systems. These include manual transmissions, automatic transmissions, and the critically acclaimed DualTronic dual clutch transmission, which is more commonly known as Volkswagen Group's Direct-Shift Gearbox. Other responsibilities are its four- wheel drive systems and transmission electronic control units.

Plot Wayne Dobie (De Niro) is a shy Chicago Police Department crime scene photographer who has spent years on the job without ever drawing his gun; his colleagues jokingly call him \\"Mad Dog\\". Mad Dog saves the life of mob boss Frank Milo (Murray) during a hold-up in a convenience store. Milo offers Mad Dog a gift in return: for one week, he will have the \\"personal services\\" of Glory (Thurman), a young woman who works as a bartender at Milo's club. Mad Dog learns that Glory is trying to pay off a personal debt and wants nothing to do with Milo after the debt is paid off. After an awkward start, they fall in love. Mad Dog wants her to move into his apartment, but Milo has no intention of letting Glory go. Milo says that Mad Dog has to pay $40,000 to give Glory her freedom, and sends one of his thugs to enforce the threat. Mad Dog's partner, Mike (Caruso), saves Mad Dog from the thug. Mad Dog does his best to get the money but falls short by $12,500. Knowing that Mike can't protect him, he courageously stands up to Milo himself, and ends up brawling with Milo in the street. Humiliated, Milo makes peace with Mad Dog and lets Glory go with no strings attached.

J. Johnston as Shanlon * Richard Belzer as M.C. / Comic * Jen Taylor as Pam Delmar (cameo, Uncredited) Production According to a profile of producer Steven A. Jones written by Luke Ford, the film was delayed by a year because of studio-required changes. Jones and director McNaughton were contractually required to deliver the film with no changes to the script written by Price. Universal test-screened the film, then insisted on reshooting the film's final scene. As written, when Milo and Mad Dog fight, Milo dominates Mad Dog. Mad Dog's one connecting punch did no damage, but did serve to prompt Milo to realize that Glory was not worth fighting over. It was reshot to respond to an audience typecasting of De Niro, whom they saw as the Raging Bull he had played more than a decade earlier. Those who saw the test screenings could not accept the fact that De Niro's Mad Dog had done so poorly against Murray's Milo. Such a reaction was ironic because De Niro had actually been offered the Milo role, and had insisted on the Mad Dog role instead precisely because of its meekness. Other reshoots for the film were done to make Glory seem less manipulative and Milo more of a puppetmaster behind Glory's actions. Reception Mad Dog and Glory has received positive reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 77% approval rating, with an average score of 6.3/10, based on reviews from 30 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"Inspired casting and a prevailing sweetness make Mad Dog and Glory an oddball treat.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C+ on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying, \\"The movie is very funny, but it's not broad humor, it's humor born of personality quirks and the style of the performances.\\" He went on to add that the film is \\"the kind of movie I like to see more than once. The people who made it must have come to know the characters very well, because although they seem to fit into broad outlines, they are real individuals‚Äîquirky, bothered, worried, bemused.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times also gave the film a positive review, calling it \\"a first-rate star vehicle for the big, explosive talents of Mr. De Niro, Mr. Murray and Richard Price, who wrote the screenplay.\\" Expanding on the performances, Canby said, \\"The great satisfaction of Mad Dog and Glory is watching Mr. De Niro and Mr. Murray play against type with such invigorating ease.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film \\"A pleasurably offbeat picture that manages the rare trick of being both charming and edgy\\".

Synopsis  Robert is contacted one day by a friend in France, who tells him that Nicole, a woman with whom Robert had had an affair years ago, has died - and Jean-Claude, the son Robert never knew he had, is now an orphan. That evening, Robert explains the situation to his wife, Sheila, and they agree to take in Jean-Claude for the summer holidays; however, they also agree to keep Jean-Claude's true identity a secret. Later that summer, Sheila, chief editor of the Harvard University Press, is, encouraged by her best friend Margo, tempted by the possibility of an affair with a British professor whose book she has been editing. At the same time, Robert's daughters, Jessica and Paula, discover Jean-Claude's true identity, through Davey Ackerman, Robert's friend's son. They refuse to speak to their father. As Robert Beckwith is bringing Jean-Claude to the airport to return to France, the boy suddenly falls ill and is hospitalized. After surgery, during which the Beckwiths become closer again, Jean-Claude makes a full recovery. At last, the whole family come to terms with Jean-Claude and their relationship with him and would like him to live with them. However, Jean-Claude refuses politely, for he has to go to the school in France chosen by his mother years before.

It was described as new to science in 2005. It has been found at 21 sites in montane forest between 1,420 and 2,130 m altitude in the northern Cordillera Central of the Colombian Andes; although having a restricted range, within this limited area it is a common understorey bird. Initially, it seemed as if the species would classify as near threatened (Cuervo et al. 2005), but it turned out to be more plentiful and thus is classified as species of least concern in the 2007 IUCN Red List. The species was originally observed in the 1990s, but when Niels Krabbe examined recordings of their songs, his suspicions arose that they were a new species - Stiles's tapaculo's song is considerably faster and lower-pitched than that of the closely related Ecuadorian tapaculo S. robbinsi (Cuervo et al. 2005). The species was named in honour of Frank Gary Stiles, an ornithologist who played a prominent role in research into Neotropical birds in the 1980s and 1990s.

It is an important agricultural, commercial and industrial comune and city. Caserta is located on the edge of the Campanian plain at the foot of the Campanian Subapennine mountain range. The city is best known for the Royal Palace of Caserta. History Anciently inhabited by Osco-Samnite tribes, modern Caserta was established around the defensive tower built in Lombard times by Pando, Prince of Capua. Pando destroyed the original city around 863. The tower is now part of the Palazzo della Prefettura which was once the seat of the counts of Caserta, as well as a royal residence. The original population moved from Casertavecchia (former bishopric seat) to the current site in the 16th century. Casertavecchia was built on the Roman town of Casa Irta, meaning \\"home village located above\\" and later contracted as \\"Caserta\\". The city and vicinity were the property of the Acquaviva family who, being pressed by huge debts, sold all the land to the royal family. The royal family then selected Caserta for the construction of their new palace which, being inland, was seen as more defensible than the previous palace fronting the Bay of Naples. At the end of World War II, the royal palace served as the seat of the Supreme Allied Commander. The first Allied war trial took place here in 1945; German general Anton Dostler was sentenced to death and executed nearby, in Aversa. Pope Francis visited Caserta on Monday, 28 June 2014, together with a friend named Giovanni Traettino the pastor of an evangelical, charismatic/Pentecostal Protestant church. The Pope apologized for the complicity of some Catholics in the persecution of Protestant Pentecostals during the fascist regime in Italy.Fournier K. A.

As one of the most visited monuments in Italy, the palace has more than 1200 rooms, decorated in various styles. It has been the set for several famous movies such as Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, Angels & Demons and Mission: Impossible III.

He was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and served in the House of Representatives from 1949 to 1980, representing the Division of Hindmarsh. He was a leading figure in the Australian labour movement and held ministerial office in the Whitlam Government as Minister for Labour (1972‚Äì1974), Labor and Immigration (1974‚Äì1975), and Science and Consumer Affairs (1975). Early life Cameron was born in Murray Bridge, South Australia, the son of a shearer of Scottish descent. He was educated at Gawler but left school at 14 to work as a shearer. During the very worst years of the Great Depression, he was unemployed, and the experience of joblessness was one that he never forgot or forgave. When he finally got work, later in the 1930s, he ended up having to travel to every Australian state and also to New Zealand. He was active in the Australian Workers' Union and the Australian Labor Party from an early age, becoming an AWU organiser and then South Australian State President and a Federal Vice-President of the union in 1941. From 1943 to 1948, he was the union's industrial advocate and taught himself industrial law. In 1946, he became State President of the Labor Party. In 1939, Cameron married Ruby Krahe (always called \\"Cherie\\") with whom he had three children (twins Warren and Tania, and a second son Noel). In 1949, he suffered a personal crisis when all three children were afflicted with poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis). He also learned that his youngest son suffered from an intellectual disability. Although they all eventually recovered from polio, the ordeal permanently affected Cameron and contributed to the breakup of his marriage. In 1966, the Camerons were divorced and in 1967, he remarried, now to Dorothy Bradbury. He was the uncle of Terry Cameron.Condolences: Hon. Clyde Robert Cameron AO, Nick Minchin, Parliament of Australia, 17 March 2008 Early political career Clyde Cameron c. 1960 Cameron was the most powerful figure in the South Australian labour movement in the years immediately after World War II. At the 1949 election, he was elected to the House of Representatives for the safe Labor seat of Hindmarsh and left his brother Don (later a senator) in charge of the South Australian AWU. He rapidly made his mark as one of the most aggressive and uncompromising Labor members ever to enter the Australian Parliament. Cameron regarded the conservatives with a deep and personal hatred and made no secret of it. He rapidly emerged as one of the leaders of the left wing of the Caucus, led at that time by Eddie Ward, who became Cameron's mentor. Nonetheless, he was an intelligent and able parliamentarian. It was the tragedy of Labor politicians of Cameron's generation that Labor spent almost a quarter of a century in Opposition, from 1949 to 1972, with the result that Cameron, like many others, spent his best years out of office. During the Labor Split of the 1950s, Cameron became a leading supporter of federal Labor Leader Dr H.V. Evatt and an opponent of the right-wing Catholic faction. He was among those who insisted for all the \\"Groupers\\" to be expelled from the party. He also conducted a long feud with the right-wing (but anti-Grouper) federal leadership of the AWU led by Tom Dougherty, one of a long list of people that Cameron detested. By the 1960s, Cameron realised Labor would never win a federal election again unless it could find both a leader and a set of policies acceptable to an increasingly middle-class electorate. Ward's death in 1963 marked the end of the old Depression-era leftism in the federal Caucus. The younger leftist leaders such as Cameron, Jim Cairns and Tom Uren were sober enough to adapt to the changed circumstances. Cameron became increasingly critical of Arthur Calwell's leadership but supported Calwell in his passionately opposing the Vietnam War. Calwell retired in 1967 and was succeeded by Gough Whitlam. Although he disagreed with Whitlam on many issues, after 1968, Cameron became a supporter of Whitlam's leadership. In 1969, Whitlam made Cameron Shadow Minister for Employment. Cameron's decisive influence helped Whitlam gain control of the Federal Executive. In 1970, he supported Whitlam's intervention in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party, which was controlled by the extreme left. Cabinet minister At the December 1972 election Labor came to office under Whitlam, and Cameron became Minister for Labour at the age of 59. He created a sensation by dismissing the permanent head of his department, Sir Halford Cook and bringing in an outsider; he was always deeply suspicious of senior public servants. However, he greatly improved the pay and conditions of other public servants by using the public sector to set new benchmarks, which he hoped would be extended to the private sector. Revealing himself to be an unsuspected feminist, he hired Mary Gaudron (later the first woman on the High Court bench) to argue before the Arbitration Commission for equal pay for women workers. His senior advisor was John Bannon, later Premier of South Australia. Following Al Grassby's defeat at the 1974 election, Cameron became Minister for Labour and Immigration. The unions had high hopes that Cameron would bring greatly improved benefits for industrial workers. Unfortunately for Cameron, the Australian economy began to deteriorate rapidly in 1974, as a result of the inflation caused by the oil shock, and the government came under increasing pressure to hold back wage increases, which were seen by orthodox economists to be fuelling inflation. Cameron resisted that pressure, and his relations with Whitlam deteriorated. At the same time, he became increasingly critical of the more irresponsible union leaders, who, he believed, blindly pursued wage rises without regard to the state of the economy or to the incomes policy of their own Labor government. Still, in the twelve months from September 1973, Cameron claimed to have presided over \\"the greatest redistribution in the favour of wage earners ever to be recorded in any one year by any country in the world.\\"Ross McMullin, The Light on the Hill: The Australian Labor Party 1891-1991 By 1975 the Whitlam government was in crisis and Whitlam made a sharp turn to the right by bringing in Bill Hayden as Treasurer and Jim McClelland as Minister for Labour and Immigration. Cameron refused to resign as Labour and Immigration Minister, and Whitlam was forced to ask the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, to withdraw his commission. He was eventually persuaded to accept the position of Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs. Cameron thus became once again Whitlam's implacable enemy, but with the dismissal of Whitlam's government in November, there was little he could do. He withdrew to the backbench, where he remained for the next five years until he retired from Parliament, after the 1980 election. After politics Subsequently, he published several volumes of vindictive but amusing memoirs. He kept a diary throughout his career, but shortly after his retirement, the volumes of the diary were, he insisted, stolen from his home by ASIO agents. In 1985, he recorded 125 hours of an oral history interview with Adam Ashforth, for the Bicentennial History of Parliament's Oral History Project. Comprising more than a million words in transcripts, these interviews shine an extraordinary light on the history of organized labour and the Labor Party in Australia. Cameron was amazingly disciplined, diligent, and organized - one might say obsessive - in his record keeping. He kept notes, for example, on every round of caucus voting in every leadership election during his time in Parliament. He stored dozens of filing cabinets in his garage. The interview, according to the only person alive who has heard it, proceeds by Cameron recounting stories of his political life, interspersed with readings from the relevant documents (all of which are referenced, under questioning by Ashforth). Cameron was deeply suspicious of ASIO, probably for good reason. But his diaries were not stolen. In the 1985 interview he consults them constantly, taking them off the shelf in his living room. He also kept a set of copies in the safe of a Chinese gem dealer who lived in the neighborhood. These diaries and the interview will be an amazing source for historians of the Australian labour movement. Unfortunately, due to Australian libel laws, under which truth is no defence, Cameron chose to close access to the documents for 40 years - since even after his death, he knew, his estate could be sued for libel. And libel aplenty there is in these troves. His diaries, for example, document many instances where Whitlam induced his cabinet secretary to alter the decision of Cabinet. He is merciless, and fastidious to a fault, in his documentation of Whitlam's perfidy in giving Indonesia the green light to invade East Timor. Cameron was involved in the Georgist movement and wrote for the Georgist Education Association.Cameron, Clyde R. (Clyde Robert) and Georgist Education Association. \\"Revenue That is Not a Tax\\". Georgist Education Association, South Perth, W.A, 1989. http://www.georgist.multiline.com.au/revenue2.htm In the 1982 Australia Day Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia.It's an Honour: AO Clyde Cameron College was run by the Australian Trade Union Training Authority from 1977 until its abolition in 1996. Well into his last years, he remained a frequent contributor to public debate, uttering various remarks showing a surprisingly respectful attitude towards his contemporary and former antagonist B. A. Santamaria. The two men never met, but when Santamaria died in 1998, Cameron (as reported by the Santamaria-founded magazine News Weekly) paid him a warm tribute by saying that \\"his soul was not for sale.\\" Inspired by his marathon interview with Ashforth, Cameron contacted Santamaria and the two sat for dozens of hours of taped discussions. Cameron went on to interview other colleagues and rivals, adding to the extraordinary archive for which he will ultimately be most remembered for. He was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001.It's an Honour: Centenary Medal Cameron died at his home on Sunlake Place in Tennyson, South Australia, at age 95.NAA Oral History Collections He was survived by three children, six grandchildren, 11 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.

Gala Bingo was originated in 1991 as a division of Bass plc. It later became an independent company, and then became the Gala Coral Group after acquiring Coral Eurobet in 2005. After the sale of its 126 clubs in 2015 to Caledonia Investments (who rebranded them as Buzz Bingo in September 2018), Gala Coral retained the online Gala services and was later acquired by Ladbrokes (which was later acquired by GVC Holdings). History The chain began as bingo clubs operated by Bass Leisure, a division of Bass plc. As of 1983, Bass had 22 clubs operating under the Coral brand, and another 24 located in its Pontins holiday camps. That year, Bass purchased a chain of 80 bingo clubs from Thorn EMI for ¬£18.2 million. By 1988, Bass was down to 72 locations, but added another 30 by purchasing Zetters Leisure for ¬£23 million. In May 1991, Bass purchased Granada plc's chain of 74 bingo clubs for ¬£147 million. Combined with Bass's 91 clubs, the chain was tied with the Rank Organisation for the largest bingo operator in Britain. A united brand for the combined operation, \\"Gala,\\" was chosen by John Murphy of Interbrand as a simple word incorporating letters from \\"Granada\\" and \\"Coral\\". Gala was officially launched on 17 October 1991 when 17 clubs re-branded and launched a new image. In 1997 a management buy-in purchased all 130 Gala Bingo Clubs from Bass for ¬£235 million. Over the next few years, Gala began acquiring other bingo clubs to increase their portfolio, including 17 clubs from Ritz in July 1998 and 10 clubs from Jarglen in March 2000. In April 2000, they added 27 Riva Bingo Clubs from First Leisure for ¬£90 million. Gala diversified outside bingo for the first time when it purchased 26 Ladbroke Casinos for ¬£235 million from the Hilton Group in December 2000. In 2001 it added the Jamba Online business for ¬£1.5m. The owners sold the whole business for ¬£1.24 billion in February 2003 to the private equity firms Candover and Cinven. Permira bought a stake in the company in August 2005, which valued the business at ¬£1.89 billion. In October 2005, Gala acquired Coral Eurobet for ¬£2.18 billion and changed its name to Gala Coral Group, creating the United Kingdom's third largest bookmaker and largest bingo operator. The group added another 10 bingo clubs in 2006 when it purchased the County Clubs in Scotland for ¬£64 million. The company spent another ¬£14.5 million in February 2006, when it bought the Leo Casino in Liverpool from Dolby Management Ltd increasing the number of casinos in the estate to 31 (at the time). Gala Coral won 403 betting licences in Italy in an open market tender in December 2006, under its Eurobet brand. The group formally established an international division in 2007. The group also set up a joint venture to attempt to launch bingo shops in China. In 2011, a decision was made to move substantial parts of the business to Gibraltar, including almost all of the remote gaming division. The group, through acquisitions and new developments had over 30 casinos and 1,800 licensed betting offices. Gala's total clubs peaked at around 174, but since 2007 and the introduction of smoking bans in Great Britain, this total declined to around 140.Gala Bingo galacoral.co.uk. In their year end accounts of 2012, the company reported employment of 4,801 staff in their bingo clubs, along with 10,849 in 1,600 Coral shops, 2,776 in 25 casinos, 276 in remote gambling and 98 in Italy where it had over 400 betting outlets, plus a further 374 in support staff functions.Annual Reports and Accounts 2012 galacoral.co.uk In July 2015, Gala Coral agreed to be acquired by its slightly larger rival Ladbrokes. The 130 Gala Bingo clubs were not part of the merger, and were sold to Caledonia Investments for ¬£241 million in December 2015. The merger was completed on 1 November 2016, and Ladbrokes became Ladbrokes Coral.  Operations  As of 2008, Gala Bingo operated 137 clubs throughout the United Kingdom, with approximately a 24% share of all clubs and nearly 40% of National Bingo Game ticket sales up until the operator's withdrawal from the National Game in Summer 2008.

Biography =Early years= A Greek nobleman, possibly from Miletus in Asia Minor, Timarchus was a friend of the Seleucid prince Antiochus IV Epiphanes during his time as a hostage to the Roman Republic. He was appointed satrap of Media in western Iran when Antiochus IV Epiphanes became king in 175 BC, and his brother Heracleides became minister of the royal finances. The Persian part of the empire was threatened by the Parthian kingdom, and Timarchus probably spent much of his time reinforcing the defences. The Seleucid realms probably extended as far as the area of Teheran during this time. =Short reign and defeat= In the turmoil following the death of Antiochus IV during a Persian campaign in 164 BC, Timarchus became the more or less independent ruler of Media, opposing the general Lysias who acted as steward for the infant king Antiochus V Eupator, son of Antiochus IV. In 162 BC Demetrius I, the proper heir to the Seleucid throne, became king, killing Lysias as well as the young Antiochus V. This may well have been the provocation that caused Timarchus to take the final step to independence and declare himself king. Timarchus now managed to extend his realm into Babylonia, where records of his reign were inscribed into the astronomical calendars. His forces were however not enough for the legal Seleucid king: Demetrius defeated and killed Timarchus in 160 BC, and the Seleucid empire was temporarily united again. =Legacy= Timarchus was one of the last Hellenistic kings in Iran but unfortunately little is known of his reign, except the short - and stereotypical - notion by Appian that Timarchus was a tyrant. On his coins, he introduced the epithet \\"Great King\\" (Basileus Megas) which was the traditional Achaemenid title and may reflect an effort to gather support from the natives in a time when the Seleucid empire lost ground in Iran. He was inspired by the Bactrian king Eucratides the Great, who had taken the same assuming title a few years earlier. Timarchus was survived and avenged by his brother Heracleides, who eventually became champion of Alexander Balas, a boy that he claimed was a natural son of Antiochus IV. Heracleides convinced the Roman Senate to support the young pretender against Demetrius, who was defeated and killed in 150 BC. Thus the family of Timarchus contributed in no little way to the disintegration of the Seleucid empire.

This Bohemian Lion makes up the first and the fourth quarters of the greater coat of arms, so it is repeated in the shield. The Moravian red-and-silver chequered eagle is shown on a blue background. Between 1915 and 1918 the Moravian Eagle was chequered in the red-and-gold colors. The arms of Silesia are a black eagle with the so-called \\"clover stalk\\" (lat. perisonium) in her breast on a golden background, although only a small south-eastern part of the historical region (Czech Silesia) belongs to the Czech Republic (the main part is now in Poland). The rulers of Bohemia originally bore for arms a so-called St. Wenceslas flaming eagle. In the 12th century, Emperor Frederick granted new arms to King Vladislaus II consisting of a silver lion on a red field, to symbolise his valor. The lion was at first represented with one tail. Later a second tail was added, for the help provided by the King P≈ôemysl Otakar I fighting the Saxons (Beware - this is just a legend (from Dalimil's chronicle)).LOUDA, Ji≈ô√≠: Kr√°lovstv√≠ ƒçesk√©: erby a rodokmeny vladnouc√≠ch rod≈Ø (Czech Kingdom: Coats of Arms and Family Trees of Governing Arostocratic Families) ‚Ä¶ Hav√≠≈ôov : Petr P.Pavl√≠k, 1996. s. 22-23. . During the first half of the 13th century the kings of Bohemia used a coat of arms bearing a black eagle in a silver shield. Red gonfanons had appeared earlier. From 1253 a two- tailed silver lion in a red field had been the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia.

The Moravian Eagle was first documented on the seal of Ottokar's uncle, Margrave P≈ôemysl (d. 1239). The Silesian Eagle stems from the ruling dynasty of the Piasts and was first applied by Duke Henry II the Pious (1238-1241). The shields also appeared on the emblems of the Crown of Bohemia established by Emperor Charles IV. Today the greater shield is also used as the badge for the Czech national ice hockey team. The Czech national football team also featured it in their shirts, until being replaced with a newer, more streamlined badge featuring only the Bohemian lion, since the UEFA Euro 2012.

Miranda Library moved to new premises outside Miranda Fair in 1985. Miranda Fair was easily distinguishable as it had a large eight-pointed, slowly revolving star on its rooftop. Part of the heritage of the centre, and somewhat of a local landmark, the star was lit at night and unique to any Westfield shopping centre. The star was knocked of the top of the tower in late July 2013 during the centre's 2013 ‚Äì 2014 re-development as the office tower it sat upon was demolished. = Renovations = Outside of former main entrance area, looking east. December 2006 (demolished mid-2013) There have been two major renovations and extensions since 1964. The first was in 1971, which made it the largest shopping centre in Australia for its time. It was also the first major shopping centre to have two major department stores, Grace Bros. and Farmers. Further expansion occurred in 1992 giving it 108,316 square metres (1,165,900 square feet) of retail space. (107,929 square metres or 1,161,734 square feet is also cited) There was also a third renovation in 1984. Since these openings, other shopping centres have been built and expanded, including Westfield Parramatta and Westfield Bondi Junction, now making it the fourth largest Westfield shopping centre in Sydney. In December 2005 it was valued at 481.6 million, up from $444.7 million in December 2004. Redevelopment of former main entrance, looking west. December 2013.

Myer lost its ground floor for a larger 'full-line' Woolworths supermarket. The entrance has moved closer to the Kingsway. The centre expanded by approximately 19,000 square metres to 127,000 square metres of gross lettable area. Demolition of the areas around the office tower began in July 2013.

During the renovations when the new parking system came in, people who lived near Miranda Fair noted that shoppers and employees of Miranda Fair were increasingly parking in the streets to avoid paying the fees for parking in Miranda Fair. In February 2015, Westfield Miranda planned to reintroduce free parking for people with disability stickers in response to feedback that parking was difficult to find. In December 2015, Westfield Miranda extended its opening hours until midnight.

The history of Osio Sopra has significant links to Osio Sotto's. Early settlements can be traced to Ancient Roman times, when an important communication road linked Milan to Bergamo passing through the bridge 'Ponte Corvo' in the Marne locality. In Bergamo, the last section of this road was in-fact named 'via Osio', highlighting the importance of the location. During those times, Osio underwent an important process of centuriation, with which a first development of the 'pagus' took place; the name 'Osio' originates from the Patrician 'gens Otia' (or gens Oxia). Among Osio Sopra's landmarks, the medieval Catholic church of San Zenone features good quality paintings of Lombard artists. Legend has it that this sacred church was built with materials from an ancient castle. The Santuario della Madonna della Scopa is a chapel located on the border Osio Sopra shares with Osio Sotto. Built in the fifteenth century, it was initially much smaller than it is today, with the most recent extension added at the beginning of the twentieth century. Religious frescoes cover its inner walls. According to the legend, the name of the chapel ('Madonna della scopa' is Italian for 'Madonna of the broom') is due to a miraculous apparition in which the Virgin Mary intervened to clean up this chapel at a time in which it had been abandoned. Finally, Palazzo Camozzi-Andreani, also known as Villa Andreani or more colloquially as Palazzo delle Gigine, was built during the eighteenth century as a library. Osio Sopra's western border consists of the river Brembo; along its shore, a number of natural reserves such as Bosco Astori are frequented by locals and visitors for recreational purposes.

It is the native language of the Hyderabadi Muslims and their diaspora. It contains loan words from Indian languages like Marathi, Telugu, Kannada and foreign languages like Arabic, Turkish and Persian. Hyderabadi is considered to be the northern dialect of the Dakhini language. History The Hyderabadi dialect derives from Dakhini, that took root in the Deccan when Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb invaded and occupied the region and his armies introduced the \\"Camp\\" or \\"Lashkari\\" language to the area. Lashkari was the lingua franca born in Delhi and northern India as a necessity for the armies of a succession of Muslim invaders from Muslim lands in Central Asia to communicate with the native population. The language acquired more and more Persian and Arabic words in the Mughal court of Bahadur Shah Zafar, and was used by the intelligentsia of Delhi and Lucknow. In the Deccan, however, it retained its original form, referred to now as Dakhani (of, or pertaining to, Dakhan (South), Anglicized as Deccan). Distinctive features Hyderabadi is mutually intelligible with most Hindi/Urdu speakers but has distinctive features from interaction with local Indian Languages such as Marathi, Telugu, Kannada. = Phonology = The letter ŸÇ (qƒÅf) is pronounced as an unvoiced velar fricative /x/ with the same pronunciation as ÿÆ ( _kh_ e) whereas in Standard Hindustani dialects the ŸÇ is pronounced as a velar plosive /k/ with the same pronunciation as ⁄© (kƒÅf). For example, the word 'qabar' (grave) is pronounced as ' _kh_ abar' (news). = Lexical features = Distinct vocabulary unique to Hyderabadis: *ÿ¢ÿ±€å⁄∫ \\"ƒÅrai _n_ \\" - (is) coming; \\"ÿ¢ÿ±€Å€í €Å€å⁄∫\\" \\"aa rahe hai _n_ \\" in standard Urdu *Mereku - my, instead of mujhe or mujhko in standard Urdu *Chindiyaan kardiya- Nailed it *Chupke to be / chupkaich - No reason *Hona - to want, instead of chahiye in Orthodox Urdu (instead of \\"mujhe woh chahiye\\" in Orthodox Urdu, Hyderabadi Urdu would use \\"mereku woh hona.\\") *Hao - for yes, instead of \\"Haan\\". *Hallu - Slow *Haula - foolish, crazy person *Hota ki nai ki - May or may not happen *Jaaraun - I am leaving *ÿ¨ÿßÿ±€å⁄∫ \\"jƒÅrai _n_ \\" - (is) going; ÿ¨ÿßÿ±€Å€í €Å€å⁄∫ \\"jƒÅ rahe hai _n_ \\" in standard Urdu *⁄©ÿßÿ¶⁄©Ÿà⁄∫ \\"kaik≈´ _n_ \\" - why; ⁄©€åŸà⁄∫ \\"kyo _n_ \\" is standard Urdu. *Kaiku ki - wonder why, who knows why *⁄©⁄Üÿß \\"kacha(i)\\" - wet; in standard Urdu, wet would be ⁄Ø€åŸÑÿß \\"gƒ´la\\". ⁄©⁄Üÿß \\"kacha\\" in standard Urdu means \\"raw\\". *Katey - it is often used when a person mentions something told by someone else. It could be translated as \\"it seems\\". Usage: \\"Kal unay bahar jaara katey\\" means \\"It seems he is going outside tomorrow\\". * Khayaali pulao - Wishful thinking *Kunjee - keys; in standard Urdu, keys would be \\"chaabee.\\" *Miyan - fellow (i.e. \\"Chalo miya.\\" means \\"Let's go, man.\\") *ŸÜ⁄©Ÿà \\"nakko\\" - an alternate (and informal) negative generally indicating \\"no\\", \\"no thanks\\" or \\"don't\\". Can be (and is often) used in place of ŸÖÿ™ \\"mat\\". ŸÜ€Å€å⁄∫ \\"nahƒ´ _n_ \\", ŸÜ€Å \\"nƒÅ\\" and ŸÖÿ™ \\"mat\\" (from traditional Urdu) are used where ŸÜ⁄©Ÿà \\"nakko\\" is inappropriate for the context or in polite situations. * Parsaon - literally it means the day before yesterday or the day after tomorrow but it is widely used for any time in recent past. *ŸæŸàŸπŸπ€å \\"po·π≠·π≠ƒ´\\" - derogatory term for girl *ŸæŸàŸπŸπÿß \\"po·π≠·π≠ƒÅ\\" - derogatory term for boy *Phugat (for free) *Paintabe - socks; in standard Urdu it would be \\"moze\\". *Uney - he/she, instead of woh in standard Urdu. *Tumaareku - you, instead of tumhen or tumko in standard Urdu *Tereku (informal slang) - you, instead of tujhe or tujhko in standard Urdu * light liyo (take it easy) * Jaando (let it go) * zyada nakko kar (don't act over smart) * kya toh bhi hora (what the hell is happening) The word ÿßŸê⁄Ü \\"ich\\" is often added after a noun or verb to express the confidence of the action. In standard Urdu, €Å€å \\"hi\\" would be used. For example: \\"Biryanich laaraun myn.\\" In standard Urdu this would be \\"Biryani hi laa raha hoon main\\". The Urdu word €Å€í \\"hai\\" is often dropped. For example, Urdu \\"Mujhe maaloom hai\\" would be \\"Mereyku maaloom\\" Peculiar features The suffix \\"an\\" is often used to mark plurality. The letter 'n' is an almost silent nasal stop. For example, Log (people) would become Logaan, Baat (talk) would become Baataan, Aadmi (men) pronounced as 'Admi' would become Admiyaan, etc. in the Hyderabadi dialect. While talking, many long a's (as in \\"father\\") are pronounced \\"uh\\" as in \\"hut.\\" For example, instead of \\"aadmi\\" (man) or \\"raasta\\" (path) in Orthodox Urdu, Hyderabadi would use \\"admi\\" and \\"rasta.\\" Similarly \\"bhool\\" (to forget), \\"toot\\" (to break) and \\"chooriyan\\" (bangles) is \\"bhul\\", \\"tut\\" and \\"churyan\\" in Hyderabadi. Popularity and usage Osmania University had adopted Dakhani as the medium of instruction as early as 1923 which was discontinued after the fall of Hyderabad in 1948, during Indian independence. In the early sixties, film star Mehmood popularized the another dialect, the Dakhni slang in Indian films, which originates from former Mysore State. Both Dakhani and Dakhni are different dialects, but they are born from a single language called Dakhini, where Dakani is used in Andhra/Telangana, and Dakhni is used in Karnataka. A very famous Guinness record holder drama /stage comedy written in Dakhani is Adrak Ke Punjey. Many Urdu poets also write in the Hyderabadi dialect of Dakhani, including Pagal Adilabadi, Khamakha Hyderabadi and Nukko Hyderabadi (of Chicago, Illinois). Hyderabadi gained sudden prominence and recognition in 2006 after the success of the comedy film The Angrez that adopted the dialect. The film's success sparked several other Hyderabadi dialect films including: Kal ka nawaab, Hyderabad Nawaabs, Aadab Hyderabad, Gullu Dada, Gullu Dada returns, Berozgaar, Hungama In Dubai, Daawat-e-Ishq See also * Bengluri Dakhni * Dakhini * Pagal Adilabadi - Famous Hyderabadi Urdu poet * List of Urdu-language poets References Urdu in India Dialects of Urdu Languages of Telangana Culture of Hyderabad, India ","title":"Hyderabadi Urdu"},{"id":"2862011","text":"Luis H√©ctor Cristaldo Ruiz D√≠az (born August 31, 1969 in Formosa, Argentina) is a retired Argentine-Bolivian football midfielder.

While the contour line on topographic maps is generally accepted as its height, the exact elevation of the summit has never been officially determined by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and many informal surveys suggest the mountain may actually top 4,200 feet (1,280 m) above sea level. While it was not identified as the range's highest peak until the late 19th century, it has played a prominent role in Catskill history. Renowned naturalist John Burroughs wrote memorably of his climbs up Slide, and it helped get the Catskills added to New York's Forest Preserve. Bicknell's thrush was first identified on its summit. Geography Aerial infrared view of Slide Mountain Like most other Catskill peaks, Slide's summit is gentle and rounded, taking the form of a narrow ridge that rises to a wider bump on its eastern end. From there the mountain slopes down steeply to the col with neighboring Cornell Mountain. At the western end, a broad slope, part of the Catskill Divide, leads down to the gap between Slide and Hemlock Mountain to the west and Winnisook Lake, the source of Esopus Creek, to the mountain's northwest. Two more pronounced ridges lead off the mountain, one to the southwest and the col with Wildcat Mountain, the other to the north and Giant Ledge. Both upper branches of the Neversink River begin on the mountain's slopes. In addition to the Catskills, Slide is also the highest point of: * Ulster County. * the Delaware River watershed. * all of New York State outside the Adirondack High Peaks region. * a 300 kilometer (186.5 miles) radius of New York City. (Slide is located roughly north/northwest of Manhattan; the southwest flank of Vermont's Killington Peak, about north northeast of the Bronx, is the next closest point of equal elevation.) It is also the southernmost peak in the Northeast exceeding . The Appalachians do not rise to that level again until West Virginia. History =Identification as highest Catskill peak= For a mountain with so many superlatives, Slide actually took a long time to be discovered for what it was. The mountain received its name locally from a landslide in 1819 on its north face near the summit. The scar can still be seen today, and was partially gouged out again by another slide in 1982. Slide would not be established as the highest peak in the range until 1886, long after much of the interior Northeast and their mountain ranges had been surveyed and settled. Due to land disputes and schemes that dated back to the colonial period, no complete, impartial survey of the entire Catskill region had been carried out until then. Seven years earlier, Princeton geology professor Arnold Henry Guyot had been staying at the Catskill Mountain House when he became interested in the surrounding mountains, and management's claim that nearby Kaaterskill High Peak () was the highest in all the Catskills despite growing doubt. His survey, carried out on his own time and at his own expense, established that Slide, located some distance to the southwest, was far and away the highest peak in the range. His findings were vehemently disputed by the hotelkeepers around North-South Lake until others confirmed his results. There was a movement, once its status had been confirmed, to give Slide a name believed to be more fitting for a highest peak. \\"Mount Lincoln,\\" after the late U.S. president, was considered for a while. But it ended when Guyot announced that he preferred Slide, as he had followed local custom wherever possible in naming the peaks for his survey.

Image courtesy of http://www.catskillarchive.com Legends have grown up over the years in the Catskills over this belated discovery of the range's highest peak. Some tell of a new owner of Hunter Mountain, the range's other 4,000-footer and second- highest peak, swinging a level around to ensure he had bought the highest peak until being stopped by Slide. Another story has John Burroughs, who later became rich and famous writing about his hikes up Slide and other nearby mountains, proving the case atop the mountain by having his friends aim a rifle with a ball in the barrel at all other contending peaks and observing that the ball fell out every time. Regardless, tourism soon shifted to the new highest peak, and a local woodsman, Jim Dutcher, who knew the mountain well from his days peeling hemlock bark for tanning, built a hotel and did a regular business escorting visitors to the summit up a trail he built in 1880. While it runs over privately owned land and has been abandoned since 1941 save for the final section leading across the summit ridge from the west, it still exists and can be followed. =Forest Preserve= Around the same time, Slide would prove instrumental in creating New York's Forest Preserve as it exists today. Some of the other private lands near the mountain had been utterly deprived of any value by tanners who had decided to boost their profits by neglecting to pay their property taxes and simply leaving the area. At that time, when the county took possession through foreclosure, it was among those required by the state to guarantee payment of state property taxes. Many county voters and landowners felt shafted, leading Ulster to refuse to pay despite a court order. Their representatives in Albany worked out a compromise by which the lands in question were given to the state as part of the newly established Forest Preserve, originally meant to include just the Adirondacks, to satisfy the county's unpaid debts to the state. That was the beginning of what ultimately became the Catskill Park. The bridle trail up Slide Mountain, photo by S.R. Stoddard, about 1900 On June 11, 1886, a delegation from the state's forest commission climbed Slide to give some sort of official recognition to the peak and the Catskill Forest Preserve. While they used Dutcher's trail, the man himself did not take part ... in fact, he did no maintenance on the trail beforehand, since he was a Republican and the commissioners had been appointed by Democratic governor David Hill. Nevertheless, the party got to the summit, where Townsend Cox, head of the commission, declared the view as fine as anything to be found in the Adirondacks. The next year the state decided to use 200 acres (80 ha) along the West Branch of the Neversink at the west slope of the mountain (south of the current trailhead) to reintroduce white-tailed deer, which had been seriously thinned in the area over the preceding century. A 10-foot (3 m) wooden fence was built around the whole area to protect them from poaching, and eventually 95 deer were released back into the wild, successfully re- establishing the species. Ironically, today there are actually very few deer in that area, because the undisturbed forest no longer offers as much of the second- and third-growth species deer prefer to feed on, and predators such as black bears have become more numerous as well. The new legislation helped Slide score a significant first in 1892, when the state appropriated $250 to build a trail, paralleling Dutcher's, up the west side of the mountain ‚Äî the first trail built at public expense in the Forest Preserve. A survey was also authorized to determine whether it was on public land, and even though it was not the trail was built anyway. While heavily eroded and rocky, it is still in use today as part of the Burroughs Range Trail and remains the most frequently used ascent. Two years later the Forest Preserve legislation was written into a new version of New York's constitution as Article 14. =John Burroughs= Plaque in memory of John Burroughs near summit Slide's fame was spread far and wide by Burroughs. He had often been able to see the peak's summit ridge from Old Clump Mountain near his boyhood home in Delaware County, likening it to seeing a horse grazing from behind. He tried to climb the mountain several times with friends, and his account of his successful ascent from nearby Woodland Valley, \\"The Heart of the Southern Catskills,\\" is one of his best works. He wrote of the view from the summit: Camping at the summit rock around 1900. On several occasions, Burroughs spent the night in the small stone shelter at the base of the rock. > :We saw the world as the hawk or the balloonist sees it when he is three > thousand feet in the air. How soft and flowing all the outlines of the hills > and mountains beneath us looked! The forests dropped down and undulated away > over them, covering them like a carpet ... > : All was mountain and forest on every hand. Civilization seemed to have > done little more than to have scratched this rough, shaggy surface of the > earth here and there. In any such view, the wild, the aboriginal, the > geographical greatly predominate. The works of man dwindle, and the original > features of the huge globe come out. Every single object or point is > dwarfed; the valley of the Hudson is only a wrinkle in the earth's surface. > You discover with a feeling of surprise that the great thing is the earth > itself, which stretches away on every hand so far beyond your ken. \\"Here the works of man dwindle,\\" was put on a plaque near the summit by the Winnisook Club shortly after his death in 1921 and placed on a ledge near the summit that offers the best view from the mountain. It has since been known as Burroughs Ledge. =Eugene Bicknell= A Bicknell's thrush Another early visitor to the mountain was an amateur ornithologist from Brooklyn named Eugene Bicknell. On one of those days, he caught a small brown thrush near the summit which he was unable to identify as belonging to any known species of that time. The bird was named Slide Mountain thrush at first, then Bicknell's thrush when it was found living high up in the boreal forests of other Northeastern mountains. But it was not studied, as prevailing scientific opinion of the time considered it a subspecies of the gray-cheeked thrush. Only in the late 20th century did newer research methods such as DNA comparisons prove that it was, indeed, a separate species, setting off a scramble to save habitat and learn as much as possible about it. =Early 20th century= The trail built in 1892 had been meant to facilitate travel to the lookout towers that existed in some form or another on the mountain's summit. Recreational visitors found views from the summit severely limited without a stand to get above the trees; the state was interested in fire control. Despite the peak's importance in establishing the Forest Preserve in the Catskills, much of the land remained in private hands. While purchases in 1900 did much to change that, it would take until 1928 before the state actually acquired the summit property and much of the land it had already built a trail on. During World War II, a small military training plane crashed on the mountain's east slope at about 3,620 feet (1,103 m). While most of the debris is gone, the site can still be reached via a short side path from the Burroughs Range Trail. =Wilderness area= In the mid-1960s, the formal organization of the Catskill Mountain 3500 Club, the range's first peak bagging organization, gave more hikers a reason to climb the mountain as they were required to do so at least twice, once in wintertime and once during the rest of the year, for membership. Around the same time, the Long Path was also routed over the mountain when it was finally established as a marked trail rather than a collection of points of interest. The summit is still the highest point on the entire trail. A major change in management of the mountain occurred in the mid-1970s, after the state's Conservation Commission had become the Department of Environmental Conservation and the Temporary Commission on the Future of the Catskills had recommended that it establish a master plan for all the Catskill lands. Slide would wind up lending its name to the state-designated Slide Mountain Wilderness Area, the largest in the Catskills at 47,500 acres (190 km¬≤). New regulations also ended abuse of the summit by campers. For many years, the first two miles (3 km) or so of the trail climbing Slide crossed the property of the nearby Winnisook Club. There was a metal gate across the Burroughs Range Trail marking the property line, below which nearly every tree had a No Trespassing sign on it. Because of the 1970s hiking boom, parking along the road at Winnisook Lake (there was no parking lot) had become a nightmare. In the late 1970s, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation solved the problem by buying the land south of the ridgeline from the Winnisook Club, making all but the last stretch of trail to Winnisook Lake public land. Then, in its first-ever Unit Management Plan for the wilderness area, they built a new parking lot further south down Ulster County Road 47 and relocated the trail onto the new public land, ending at the new parking lot. This was the trailhead for a new section of the Phoenicia-East Branch Trail, which connected to the carriage road commonly used very near the base of the Burroughs Range Trail. Plaque memorializing Timothy O'Lear near trailhead This new section requires crossing the west branch of the Neversink right at the beginning. While it is normally not difficult to follow the stepping stones, the creek can be impassable and even fatal in high water. In December 2000, Timothy O'Lear, a Boy Scout from Long Island drowned when he fell in and was caught under some nearby tree branches when returning after a weekend backpacking trip. He is memorialized with a small plaque on a bench at the beginning of the trail. Natural environment =Forest= Slide's slopes are covered with a typical Catskills ridge hardwood forest of various maple species, yellow birch and beech at lower elevations and a boreal forest composed predominantly of balsam fir at higher elevations. Paper birch can be found where the two forests begin to change over. Catskill forest researcher Michael Kudish has found an anomalous grove of sugar maple at roughly 3,900 feet (1,189 m) in elevation just off the trail near the western end of the mountain's summit ridge. He has also noted that, in contrast to the boreal forests on other Catskill High Peaks, Slide's has no red spruce. He does not believe there ever has been any. There are some groves and isolated individual trees on lower elevations on the mountain. =Geology= Detail of quartz pebbles along trail near summit One of the mountain's more curious features is the white quartz pebbles found on the trail along the summit ridge, which lend it something of a garden-path feel. These are found nowhere else in the Catskills, and since it is likely that they would not have survived the Wisconsin glaciation, it has been speculated that Slide's summit may have been a nunatak during that time, protruding above the ice which buried all the other peaks. However, one researcher reportedly found striation marks on rocks along the summit ridge, suggesting that glaciers did indeed cover the summit. Those marks have eroded over time, however, becoming more difficult to confirm, and the consensus now is that they may have been left instead by glaciers during the Illinoian Stage prior to the Wisconsin Stage. Approaches Trailed and trailless routes exist to the summit. To protect the higher-elevation forests, DEC regulations prohibit camping above 3,500 feet (1,067 m) anywhere on Forest Preserve land in the Catskills except between December 21 and March 21. Open fires are banned in those areas all year round. =Trails= Three trails combine to create three possible approaches to the mountain, although only one crosses the summit. Burroughs Range Trail from the west The most common route up Slide has always been from the pass between it and the mountains to the west, where the high elevation at the trailhead has greatly reduced the vertical ascent required. The move from Winnisook Lake to the new state trailhead has added to the climb slightly, but it is still less than that required to climb some of the lower Catskill High Peaks. After crossing the upper west branch of the Neversink at the trailhead, 2,400 feet (731.5 m) in elevation, the yellow- blazed P-EB trail works its way gently up slope and over some lesser streams 0.7 mile (1 km) to the old carriage road it originally followed through the Winnisook Club property. It follows this south past a reliable spring 0.3 mile (500 m) to the western terminus of the red-blazed Burroughs Range Trail, the old horse trail built in 1892. This works its way steadily up Slide's southwest ridge for about a mile to the summit ridge, where boreal forest takes over and it abruptly turns to the north, then west again to follow the north side of the summit ridge. Shortly after this latter turn, the old Dutcher Trail, marked by very faded orange blazes, comes in from the north. The remainder of this section, where the treadway lies heavy with the white quartz pebbles, is the trail Dutcher built and used in his day. From bottom, Slide's north ridge, Giant Ledge and Panther Mountain from the north overlook near the summit. An official trail, the Curtis-Ormsbee (see below), soon comes in from the south. At this point the Long Path also joins the trail. From here it is 0.7 mile (1 km) to the summit, with views to the north opening up at several points along the way. This includes one just short of the summit, above the top of the slides that give the mountain its name. Total distance via this route is 2.75 miles (4.4 km), with a vertical ascent of 1,700 feet (518 m). Curtis-Ormsbee Trail Reached from the same starting point, the Curtis-Ormsbee Trail adds more distance to the overall trip but is a favorite with serious hikers since it offers an additional viewpoint and passes through more scenic stretches of forest. It is the route the Long Path takes up the peak. Monument to Curtis and Ormsbee at south end of trail It is named in memory of William Buckingham Curtis and Allan Ormsbee, two hikers from New York who died in a sudden snowstorm in the Presidential Range of New Hampshire's White Mountains on June 30, 1900. They had laid the trail out, and a small monument to them is located at the trail's southern end, where it leaves the Phoenicia-East Branch Trail 0.8 mile (1.2 km) south of the Burroughs Range Trail junction, in the col between Slide and neighboring Wildcat Mountain. The blue-blazed trail, 1.6 miles (2.6 km) long follows another ridge up to the junction with the Burroughs Range Trail on the summit ridge. Just above the signs indicating the camping and fire restrictions that NYSDEC has put in place for areas above 3,500 feet (1,067 m) in the Catskills to protect the montane forests, there are two viewpoints just off the trail. One takes in Table and Lone mountains; the other offers the only good glimpse of the lowest High Peak, remote and challenging Rocky Mountain. It continues to the summit through long and fragrant stretches of balsam fir and soil muddy enough to require puncheon bridges in some areas. It is 4.1 miles (6.6 km) to the summit via this route. Many hikers make a loop of the trip if time permits, ascending via the Curtis-Ormsbee Trail and returning down the Burroughs Range Trail, a total trip of 6.85 miles (11 km). The beginning of the Curtis-Ormsbee Trail can also be reached by using the Long Path approach and coming from the southern end of the Phoencia-East Branch Trail, 2.95 miles (4.7 km) away in the town of Denning. Vertical rise to the summit via this route is almost 2,000 feet (609 m), and the total distance to the summit is 6.25 miles (10.1 km). Burroughs Range Trail from the east The most challenging route to the summit of Slide begins at the Burroughs Range Trail's eastern terminus, Woodland Valley State Campground south of Phoenicia. It takes in the whole range, going over Wittenberg and Cornell mountains for a 7-mile (11.2-km), 2,700-foot (823 m) ascent. Wittenberg and Cornell are both challenging climbs in and of themselves, and the climax is the steep 900-foot (274 m) east slope of Slide. It is not surprising that this is often done as an overnight backpacking trip, since the long col between Slide and Cornell features a spruce grove that is an excellent place to camp, and the state has accordingly designated several sites in that area. Some hikers, though, have been able to get to the summit of Slide and back to Woodland Valley in a single lengthy day, often by descending to the western trailhead and following the Phoenicia-East Branch trail back down, a grand loop of 13.95 miles (22.5 km). =Bushwhacks= Two approaches that are at least partially trailless have been used by those seeking greater challenges. The north ridge The ridge leading down from the summit to the col with Giant Ledge to the north is an obvious route. DEC had, at one point, planned a trail up it but the idea was dropped when hikers and hunters objected and the route was judged too environmentally fragile to support a trail. It can be used by starting from the Giant Ledge trailhead at a hairpin turn on County Road 42, about 2,200 feet (670.5 m) in elevation. It is 0.65 mile (1 km) to the junction with the blue-blazed Fox Hollow Trail, which leads north to Giant Ledge and Panther Mountain. By striking out due south from this junction one will soon begin to climb the north ridge, reaching first a 3,620-foot (1,103.3 m) summit (on the private property of the Winnisook Club), then turning to the southeast through thickening boreal forest to the 3,800-foot (1,158 m) summit. From there the narrow, thickly forested ridge is followed steeply up to the summit ridge and the Burroughs Range Trail, about 0.25 mile (400 m) from the summit. East Branch of the Neversink A long route that very ambitious hikers have used, especially on multi-day trips with attempts on the range of trailless peaks to Slide's southeast, follows the east branch of the Neversink up to the ridge connecting Slide and Cornell. Starting from the Denning trailhead, the P-EB Trail is followed 1.1 mile (1.8 km) to its junction with the blue-blazed Peekamoose-Table Trail, which drops down to the east 0.35 mile (560 m) into the river valley near the flood plain at the Deer Shanty Brook confluence and its many channels, some of them difficult to cross at high water. After one of the last, alert eyes can find the beginning of the \\"Fisherman's Path,\\" an unofficial trail following the East Branch far upstream into the wildest country in the Catskills. It takes some skill to follow this trail, as red paint blazes that sometimes appear are often painted out by DEC forest rangers (there are, however, some official campsites along its length) and while it is sometimes wide and obvious it is not always, and switches sides of the river several times. Further upstream, as it passes the usual points of departure for Lone, Rocky, Balsam Cap and Friday mountains, the path gets increasingly disused and harder to follow. The challenge in hiking Slide this way is not so much the mountain itself as the routefinding when it begins to climb to the col. Deer Shanty Brook The most challenging trailless route is the seldom-attempted approach up this tributary of the East Branch. It begins identically to that route but involves leaving the trail at that crossing and eventually following the brook to the slopes of Slide to the southeast. There is no trail whatsoever through this country and the boreal forest on this part of the mountain itself is reportedly difficult to penetrate, even by the standards of other peaks in the vicinity. Summit Actual summit, with tower footings The mountain's actual height of land is a small, viewless clearing with the footings of the towers that once stood there. Just to the west, however, is the much wider clearing of Burroughs Ledge with a sweeping view to the east in which Ashokan Reservoir is prominent, the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge can be glimpsed. The neighboring high peaks to the east seem like small hills and the Devil's Path and Blackhead Range in Greene County are visible to the north. In fact, it is possible to see, from various points along the summit ridge, all but one of the other 34 Catskill High Peaks (Thomas Cole may or may not be hidden by Hunter). At one time the view was even more expansive, but since camping on the summit is now banned except during winter and in emergencies, the balsam fir has grown back in around the edges of the clearing, giving the area a more natural look. Close inspection, in fact, can find remnants of the two lean-tos that once stood here before 1975 when camping was permitted. There is also a spring 0.25 mile (400 m) down the trail to the east. On June 15, 1985, the summit received its most visitors ever at a single time when at least a hundred hikers, nature lovers and DEC officials gathered there to commemorate the centennial of the Forest Preserve. Similar traffic was recorded in 2004 when the Catskill Park itself reached a similar milestone. =Towers= The lack of an unobstructed 360-degree view from Slide has led, over the years, to several observation towers being built at the summit. Observation tower on Slide Mountain, from a postcard postmarked in 1913 (the image is probably much older) Dutcher probably built a crude one out of balsam logs, since Burroughs refers to its presence in his writings. It was still there in 1900 when another visitor recorded it. The state wanted to take advantage of the mountain's height for fire control purposes, and in 1911 built a more permanent fire lookout and observer's cabin on the summit. But it would only be occupied and used for the next year, then abandoned again. Steel for a more permanent tower was brought up to the summit in the early 1930s, but the tower itself was not built until wartime. It would be dismantled around 1965, and no replacement has been erected. In the late 1990s, when DEC updated the Slide Mountain Wilderness Area's Unit Management Plan, it considered rebuilding an observation tower at the summit to provide the long- absent views. However, despite the historical precedent, wilderness area values governing DEC policy that were in place at the time led to the idea being rejected during the planning process.

He was an important contributor to the development of tensor calculus and Ricci calculus, and was one of the founders of the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam.  Biography  Schouten was born in Nieuwer-Amstel to a family of eminent shipping magnates. He attended a Hogere Burger School, and later he took up studies in electrical engineering at the Delft Polytechnical School. After graduating in 1908, he worked for Siemens in Berlin and for a public utility in Rotterdam before returning to study mathematics in Delft in 1912. During his study he had become fascinated by the power and subtleties of vector analysis. After a short while in industry, he returned to Delft to study Mathematics, where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1914 under supervision of Jacob Cardinaal with a thesis entitled . Schouten was an effective university administrator and leader of mathematical societies. During his tenure as professor and as institute head he was involved in various controversies with the topologist and intuitionist mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer. He was a shrewd investor as well as mathematician and successfully managed the budget of the institute and Dutch mathematical society. He hosted the International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam in early 1954, and gave the opening address. Schouten was one of the founders of the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam. Among his PhD candidates students were Johanna Manders (1919), Dirk Struik (1922), Johannes Haantjes (1933), Wouter van der Kulk (1945), and Albert Nijenhuis (1952). In 1933 Schouten became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Schouten died in 1971 in Epe. His son Jan Frederik Schouten (1910-1980) was Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology from 1958 to 1978.  Work  Dr. J.A. Schouten, 1913 Prof. Dr. J.A. Schouten, 1923 = = Schouten's dissertation applied his \\"direct analysis\\", modeled on the vector analysis of Josiah Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside, to higher order tensor-like entities he called affinors. The symmetrical subset of affinors were tensors in the physicists' sense of Woldemar Voigt. Entities such as ', ', and ' appear in this analysis. Just as vector analysis has dot products and cross products, so analysis has different kinds of products for tensors of various levels. However, instead of two kinds of multiplication symbols, Schouten had at least twenty. This made the work a chore to read, although the conclusions were valid. Schouten later said in conversation with Hermann Weyl that he would \\"like to throttle the man who wrote this book.\\" (Karin Reich, in her history of tensor analysis, misattributes this quote to Weyl.) Weyl did, however, say that Schouten's early book has \\"orgies of formalism that threaten the peace of even the technical scientist.\\" (Space, Time, Matter, p. 54). Roland Weitzenb√∂ck wrote of \\"the terrible book he has committed.\\" = Levi-Civita connection = In 1906, L. E. J. Brouwer was the first mathematician to consider the parallel transport of a vector for the case of a space of constant curvature. In 1917, Levi-Civita pointed out its importance for the case of a hypersurface immersed in a Euclidean space, i.e., for the case of a Riemannian manifold immersed in a \\"larger\\" ambient space. In 1918, independently of Levi-Civita, Schouten obtained analogous results. In the same year, Hermann Weyl generalized Levi- Civita's results. Schouten's derivation is generalized to many dimensions rather than just two, and Schouten's proofs are completely intrinsic rather than extrinsic, unlike Tullio Levi-Civita's. Despite this, since Schouten's article appeared almost a year after Levi-Civita's, the latter got the credit. Schouten was unaware of Levi-Civita's work because of poor journal distribution and communication during World War I. Schouten engaged in a losing priority dispute with Levi-Civita. Schouten's colleague L. E. J. Brouwer took sides against Schouten. Once Schouten became aware of Ricci's and Levi-Civita's work, he embraced their simpler and more widely accepted notation. Schouten also developed what is now known as a K√§hler manifold two years before Erich K√§hler. Again he did not receive full recognition for this discovery. = Works by Schouten = Schouten's name appears in various mathematical entities and theorems, such as the Schouten tensor, the Schouten bracket and the Weyl‚ÄìSchouten theorem. He wrote Der Ricci-Kalk√ºl in 1922 surveying the field of tensor analysis. In 1931 he wrote a treatise on tensors and differential geometry. The second volume, on applications to differential geometry, was authored by his student Dirk Jan Struik. Schouten collaborated with √âlie Cartan on two articles as well as with many other eminent mathematicians such as Kentaro Yano (with whom he co-authored three papers). Through his student and co-author Dirk Struik his work influenced many mathematicians in the United States. In the 1950s Schouten completely rewrote and updated the German version of Ricci-Kalk√ºl and this was translated into English as Ricci Calculus. This covers everything that Schouten considered of value in tensor analysis. This included work on Lie groups and other topics and that had been much developed since the first edition. Later Schouten wrote Tensor Analysis for Physicists attempting to present the subtleties of various aspects of tensor calculus for mathematically inclined physicists. It included Paul Dirac's matrix calculus. He still used part of his earlier affinor terminology. Schouten, like Weyl and Cartan, was stimulated by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. He co-authored a paper with Alexander Aleksandrovich Friedmann of Petersburg and another with V√°clav Hlavat√Ω. He interacted with Oswald Veblen of Princeton University, and corresponded with Wolfgang Pauli on spin space. (See H. Goenner, Living Review link below.)

He joined The Dubliners in 1964 and played with them until 2012 when The Dubliners' name was retired following the death of founding member Barney McKenna.  Early years and musical apprenticeship  John Sheahan was born in Dublin on 19 May 1939. His father, a native of Glin, County Limerick, was a member of the Garda S√≠och√°na (the Irish Police Force) stationed in Dublin. He is the great-nephew of Patrick Sheahan, a Dublin Metropolitan Policeman, who in 1905 died trying to save the life of a pipe workman who was overcome by toxic exhalations in a sewer on Hawkins Street, Dublin, where a memorial statue stands today. He went to school to the local Christian Brothers in Marino, Dublin, where he received his first musical education, learning the tin whistle. This experience was shared with Paddy Moloney, who later founded The Chieftains, and Leon and Liam Rowsome, sons of the piper Leo Rowsome. When he was about twelve years old he began to take an active interest in music and soon he was to transfer the musical knowledge gained on the whistle to a fiddle he found lying around at home. Enthusiastically supported and encouraged by his parents, he attended the Municipal School of Music (now known as the Dublin Institute of Technology) where he studied classical violin for more than five years. During this time he continued to maintain his interest in Irish traditional music, which sometimes led him to improvise on the classics by putting in a few embellishments. His tutor would not approve his \\"composing\\"; however, Sheahan continued to apply the classical technique to his traditional playing which would ultimately lead to the development of his unique style, gaining him a number of awards at various feiseanna (festivals of Irish traditional music, dancing, poetry and literature). His interest in American bluegrass fiddle music also influenced his style, as can be heard in tunes like \\"Flop Eared Mule\\" (also called \\"Donkey Reel\\"), recorded with The Dubliners in 1968, 1969 and 1983. Career with The Dubliners Sheahan played with a number of bands around the country until he met The Dubliners in the early 1960s. At that time, the group was formed by Ronnie Drew, Barney McKenna, Ciar√°n Bourke and Luke Kelly. He joined the band in 1964, together with Bobby Lynch. Both musicians had been playing during the interval at concerts and usually stayed on stage for the second half of the show. When Luke Kelly moved to England in 1964, Lynch was taken on as his temporary replacement; when Kelly returned in 1965, Lynch left the band and Sheahan stayed. He is the only member of the Dubliners to have had a formal musical education. John Sheahan Dubliners Tour After 50 years of playing and after the death of founding member Barney McKenna, in the fall of 2012 Sheahan announced the retirement of The Dubliners by the end of the 50th anniversary tour. The last formation of the band featured Sheahan himself, Sean Cannon, Eamonn Campbell, Patsy Watchorn and Gerry O'Connor. After The Dubliners In 2013 Sheahan went on tour with Jane and Shane in Denmark playing classical music and some famous Irish jigs such as The Irish Washerwoman. He also joined in some informal sessions in pubs in Dublin featuring other Irish musicians and Luke Kelly's brother Jim Kelly. In April 2013 he had his own documentary on RT√â about his life and career with The Dubliners the programme being titled John Sheahan ‚Äì A Dubliner. In May he went into Dundalk Primary School to talk about his career with The Dubliners. In October 2013 Sheahan was on The Late Late Show on RT√â with Paddy Moloney of The Chieftains and performed a jig together on the Tin Whistle. Sheahan said he was working on a solo album which would contain a collection of unrecorded compositions he had written over the past 50 years and was developing a book containing his poetry. He played at Templebar Tradfest in Dublin City Hall in January 2014. thumbnail In April 2014, Sheahan was awarded two Irish Film and Television Awards for the television documentary John Sheahan ‚Äì A Dubliner. On 10 April 2014 Sheahan was part of Ceili√∫radh at which he and other Irish musicians performed at the Royal Albert Hall for the Irish presidential visit to the UK. He sang a verse of the Auld Triangle and played the fiddle to accompany other musicians. In June 2014 he performed at a special fund raising concert in Dublin raising money in aid of cystic fibrosis. In September 2014, he performed with the RT√â Concert Orchestra conducted by Gearoid Grant, live in Meeting House Square for Culture Night 2014. Other contributions Composing his own music has been one of Sheahan's interests for many years. This led in the 1980s to a big chart hit with \\"The Marino Waltz\\" charting at No.4 in Ireland. The tune was subsequently covered by a number of other artists and was followed by the release of an album of original instrumental pieces, written and recorded together with classical guitarist Michael Howard. The album, entitled \\"In Our Own Time\\", was released in 1987. Another album, entirely of Sheahan's compositions, was released in 2008 with the title \\"The Marino Suite\\" and features the Young European Strings Chamber Orchestra as a supporting ensemble to his fiddle playing. Sheahan contributed as a guest to several albums.

While working at ABC-TV in Los Angeles, McCormick pitched a children's program to a CBS affiliate in Fresno, California, and went on the air there in Spring, 1959 with Charley (inspired by Dennis Weaver's character Chester on Gunsmoke) and his sidekick Humphrey. Charley was a horse who wore a sea captain's hat, and Humphrey Hambone was a bulldog. In time, he'd added additional characters, \\"Sneezer,\\" \\"Shagnasty Bear,\\" and \\"Pussyfoot\\", the grand piano playing cat wearing sunglasses. The characters followed McCormick when he signed with San Francisco's KGO-TV in 1961, and finally to KTVU where they starred in \\"The Charley and Humphrey Show\\" from 1972-1976 and they became a staple in afternoon PSAs. Humphrey eventually wore a trademark Oakland Raiders sweater sent to McCormick by Sonny Barger of the Oakland Hells Angels. In a 2008 interview, McCormick admitted that the \\"Charley and Humphrey\\" skits were his favorite aspect of working on television: \\"All the other things I did on television were just jobs.

The \\"count\\" was used to determine which person would be called. The host would pick a slip of paper from a drum containing pages from local phone books sliced into convenient sizes. At the beginning of the show, the count was determined by spinning two wheels, one of which resulted in a number and the other in \\"top\\" or \\"bottom\\". If the count was, for instance, 3/top, the host would start at the top of the slip of phone book and count three numbers down from the top and call the resulting number. The \\"amount\\" was the amount of money to be won. It would start at $100 and increase by a fixed amount with every unsuccessful call. The calls were made during commercial breaks while the afternoon movie was being screened. Personal life After his retirement, McCormick settled in Gold Beach, Oregon.

Peire Cardenal (or Cardinal)His name is spelled P√®ire in modern Occitan. (c. 1180 ‚Äì c. 1278)The estimated dates of his life come from Lavaud. was a troubadour (fl. 1204‚Äì1272) known for his satirical sirventes and his dislike of the clergy. Ninety-six pieces of his remain, a number rarely matched by other poets of the age.Aubrey, 23-4. Peire Cardenal was born in Le Puy-en-Velay,Called Puy Nostra Domna in his vida. apparently of a noble family;His vida calls him the \\"son of a knight and a lady\\" (Egan, 74). the family name Cardenal appears in many documents of the region in the 13th and 14th centuries. He was educated as a canon, which education directed him to vernacular lyric poetry and he abandoned his career in the church for \\"the vanity of this world\\", according to his vida.Egan, 74. The author of Peire's vida is known: Miquel de la Tor. Peire began his career at the court of Raymond VI of Toulouse--from whom he sought patronage--and a document of 1204 refers to a Petrus Cardinalis as a scribe of Raymond's chancery. At Raymond's court, however, he appears to have been known as Peire del Puoi or Puei (). Around 1238 he wrote a partimen beginning Peire del Puei, li trobador with Aimeric de Pegulhan. At Raymond's court also perhaps, probably in 1213, Peire composed a sirventes, Las amairitz, qui encolpar las vol, which may have encouraged Peter II of Aragon to help Toulouse in the Battle of Muret, where Peter died. In this sirventes Peire alludes first perhaps to the accusations of adultery that Peter had leveled against Peter's wife Maria of Montpellier but also perhaps to the various changes in law governing women. In the second stanza Peire mentions Peter's success in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa; in the third he alludes to the sacking of B√©ziers (whose count Raymond Roger Trencavel was supposed to have been Peter's vassal): at B√©ziers the poorer soldiers of the Inquisition were flogged by the wealthier, and this is the theme of the stanza. Peire's mention of the court of Constantine may also again evoke the divorce proceedings of Peter and Marie where Peire ultimately lost. Peire later alludes to the death of someone (perhaps a daughter or perhaps Peire's wife Marie) and then apparently to the couple's son James I of Aragon, born at Candlemas, according to James's Chronicle. It's not clear who the crois hom or \\"dreadful man\\" is in the final couplet, whose deeds are \\"piggish\\": Peire has really never addressed anyone in this verse but Peter II and those close to him. (But dualism had by then made its way into some of the local religious views of Medieval Languedoc: in dualist philosophy worldly deeds might be seen as \\"piggish\\".) Peire subsequently travelled widely, visiting the courts of Auvergne, Les Baux, Foix, Rodez, and Vienne. He may have even ventured into Spain and met Alfonso X of Castile, and James I of Aragon, although he never mentions the latter by name in his poems. (James is however of course mentioned in Peire's vida.) During his travels Peire was accompanied by a suite of jongleurs, some of whom receive mention by name in his poetry. Among the other troubadours Peire encountered in his travels were Aimeric de Belenoi and Raimon de Miraval. He may have met Daude de Pradas and Guiraut Riquier at Rodez.Aubrey, 233-4. Peire was influenced by Cadenet, whom he honoured in one of his pieces. He was possibly influenced by Bernart de Venzac. In his early days he was a vehement opponent of the French, the clergy and the Albigensian Crusade. In the sirventes, Ab votz d'angel, lengu' esperta, non bleza, dated by Hill and Bergin to around 1229 (when the tribunal of the Inquisition was established at Toulouse by the Dominican Order), Peire enjoins those who seek God to follow the example of those who \\"drink beer\\" and \\"eat bread of gruel and bran\\", rather than argue over \\"which wine is the best\\". The latter behavior Peire's verse attributes to the \\"Jacobins\\" (Hill and Bergin say this is the Dominican Order). In Li clerc si fan pastor he condemned the \\"possession\\" of the laity by the clergy, for so long as the clergy order it, the laity will \\"draw their swords towards heaven and get into the saddle.\\" This poem was written probably around 1245, after the First Council of Lyon, where the clergy took action against the Emperor Frederick II, but not against the Saracens.Throop, 401-2. In Atressi cum per fargar Peire suggests that the clergy \\"protect their own swinish flesh from every blade\\", but they do not care how many knights die in battle. Peire was not an opponent of Christianity or even the Crusades. In Totz lo mons es vestitiz et abrazatz he urged Philip III of France, who had recently succeeded his father, Louis IX, who died in 1270 on the failed Eighth Crusade, to go to the aid of Edward Longshanks, then on the Ninth Crusade in Syria.Throop, 409. Near the end of the sirventes, Ab votz d'angel, lengu' esperta, non bleza, composed as noted probably around 1229, Peire's words, [s]'ieu fos maritz, \\"if I were wed\\", suggest that he is not yet wed. The verse which follows provides evidence in the view of some that Peire married: it first mocks the \\"barrenness that bears fruit\\" of the beguinas (beguines, who may have sometimes been associated with the Dominicans; Hill and Bergin in 1973 said this was a reference to nuns of the Dominican Order). Throughout the verse of course Peire had been poking fun at the Dominican clergy, but the comment about the nuns may have additional significance. His tone changes after this and his closing lines suggest though that all this is a miracle from the \\"saintly fathers\\", suggesting his acceptance of things: Cardenal.org says that some have interpreted these lines as suggesting that Peire married at this time. (also available in Italian) By the end of his life he appears reconciled to the new modus vivendi in southern France. He died at an advanced age (allegedly one hundred years old) possibly either in Montpellier or Nimes, but this is only a supposition, based on where the biographer and compiler Miquel de la Tor was active. Three of Peire's songs have surviving melodies, but two (for a canso and a sirventes) were composed by others: Guiraut de Bornelh and Raimon Jordan respectively.This is not unusual for thirteenth-century sirventes. The poems with borrowed melodies are Ar mi posc eu lauzar d'amor and Ricx hom que greu ditz vertat e leu men respectively. Guiraut's poem is No posc sofrir qu'a la dolor and Jordan's is Vas vos soplei, domna, premieramen. Like many of his contemporary troubadours, Peire merely composed contrafacta. The third, for Un sirventesc novel vuelh comensar, may be Peire's own work. It is similar to the borrowed melody of Guiraut de Bornelh, mostly syllabic with melismas at phrasal ends. The meagre number of surviving tunes (attributable to him) relative to his output of poetry is surprising considering his vida states that \\"he invented poetry about many beautiful subjects with beautiful tunes.\\"Egan, 74, emphasis added.

It is the largest cannon ever cast in what is now Thailand, measuring 2.7 m long (9 feet) and made of brass. It is on display in front of the Ministry of Defence, opposite the Grand Palace in Bangkok. The cannon still serves as the symbol of Pattani Province and used on the official seal of Pattani Province since 1939.  History  Cannon used on the seal of Pattani Province Cannon on the flag of Pattani Various sources give differing accounts of how cannons came to be made in Pattani and who made them. According to Sejarah Kerajaan Melayu Patani (\\"History of the Malay Kingdom of Patani\\"), cannons were cast in the early-17th century in the Sultanate of Pattani by a man of Chinese descent named Tok Kayan. Raja Biru ordered the construction of powerful artillery to protect their independence from Siam. Three cannons were made ‚Äì two siege guns named Seri Negara, Seri Patani, and a smaller cannon named the Maha Lela. Phongsawadan muang pattani (\\"Chronicle of Pattani\\") named the cannons as Nang Pattani, Cri Nagri, and Maha Lalo. Hikayat Patani, however, gives the name of the these three cannons as Seri Negeri, Tuk (Datuk) Buk, and Nang (Lady) Liu-Liu, and suggests that these cannons were cast earlier. The cannons were said to have successfully repelled a number of attacks. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese in 1767, the Sultanate of Pattani renounced its tributary status to Siam and declared its independence. Eighteen years later in 1785, however, a Thai army led by King Rama I's brother, the vice-king Boworn Maha Surasinghanat, invaded and conquered Patani, and the Thais have ruled it ever since. The Phaya Patani and Phaya Negara were ordered to be sent to Bangkok as spoils of war. Some sources said that Phaya Negara came loose as it was being loaded aboard a ship and plunged into the sea, where it remains. King Rama I ordered a similar-sized cannon named the Narai Sanghan () to be cast to serve as a companion to the Phaya Patani, now renamed the Phraya Tani. A replica of Phaya Tani was created and placed in front of Krue Se Mosque in Pattani in 2013, but it was damaged by separatists who saw it as 'faked' and wanted the return of the original cannon. Cultural significance The cannon has been used as a symbol Pattani on the official seal of Pattani Province since 1939. It is also remembered in Pattani by the locals who fired bamboo cannons during the Hari Raya festival celebrations.

The vast majority of services on the Shenfield to Southend Line connect to the Great Eastern Main Line, linking station in Southend-on-Sea to Liverpool Street station in London. The Engineer's Line Reference for the line is SSV and the station's three-letter station code is BIC. The platforms have an operational length for 12 carriages. Billericay station is located in close proximity to the town's centre and industrial areas, sunk into a cutting in which the railway line is situated. It is from Liverpool Street and is situated between and . The station and trains serving it are currently operated by Abellio Greater Anglia. History The line from Shenfield to Wickford, together with Billericay station, was opened for goods on 19 November 1888 and for passengers on 1 January 1889 by the Great Eastern Railway.[1] There was a goods yard on the 'down' (eastbound) side of the running lines to the north- west of the station, including a goods shed, cattle pens and a crane. There was a signal box on the 'up' side to the north-west of the station. Goods traffic ceased on 15 June 1967 and the goods shed was demolished soon after. The Shenfield to Southend Victoria line was originally electrified using 1.5 kV DC overhead line electrification (OLE) on 31 December 1956. This was changed to 6.25 kV AC in November 1960 and to 25 kV AC on 25 January 1979. There were two sidings at Ramsden Bellhouse, 2.75 miles east of Billericay station on the 'down' (north) side of the line. The sidings closed on 22 August 1960. As part of the National Station Improvements scheme, the station underwent improvement works costing around ¬£1.7 million, which were completed in January 2012. These changes have completely altered the aspect of the station from the road side.

The book is currently in its third edition and is published by American Vision in Atlanta, Georgia. Content The book presents a sustained argument from fields such as biblical hermeneutics, ancient history, textual criticism, archaeology, and Christian theology for why the Book of Revelation must have been written before the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, during the reign of Roman emperor Nero. Gentry argues that Nero Caesar is the \\"sixth king\\" presently ruling () who functions in Revelation as the Beast. In particular, Gentry focuses on the foundation of most external evidence for the late date hypothesis of the Book of Revelation, which is a statement by Ireneaus that 'the Apocalyptic vision was seen during Domitian's reign'.Book Review: Before Jerusalem Fell: Dating the Book of Revelation (An Exegetical and Historical Argument for a Pre-AD. 70 Composition), by Kenneth L. Gentry, Jr., Th.D. Reviewed by the Rev. Grover E. Gunn, III, pastor, the Carrollton Presbyterian Church (PCA), Carrollton, Mississippi. Counsel of Chalcedon Magazine, March 1990, Issue 2, pp. 22‚Äì23. The original statement is ambiguous and Gentry proposes that it could also validly be translated to mean 'apostle John, who wrote the vision, was seen during Domitian's reign', hence it is not relevant to the late date argument. Iraneaus is also considered prone to historical error as, for example, he wrote that Jesus lived until almost fifty years of age, after fifteen years of earthly ministry. These build reasons for Gentry to state that Ireneaus' statement cannot be conclusive. Controversy The book is controversial in that it goes against majority evangelical and Dispensational opinion that Revelation was written in the reign of Domitian in AD 95, though the pre-AD 70 date for Revelation was the dominant view of scholars in the 19th century and first two decades of the 20th century.

Children's poetry is poetry written for, or appropriate for children. This may include folk poetry (for example, Mother Goose rhymes); poetry written intentionally for young people (e.g. Shel Silverstein); poetry written originally for adults, but appropriate for young people (Ogden Nash); and poems taken from prose works (Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling).  History  Poetry is usually one of the first types of literature presented to a child in the form of nursery rhymes or lullabies. Poetry is universal throughout the world's oral traditions as songs and folklore passed down to younger generations. Written poetry first began appearing in the 15th century mostly religious to provide moral instruction. The eighteenth century saw the development of the concept of childhood, and a separate genre of children's literature, including poetry, began to emerge.  Importance  Introducing poetry to children helps develop their literacy skills by developing vocabulary through rhythmic structure of the stanzas which give context to new and unknown words; phonemic awareness through pitch, voice inflection, and volume; memorization through patterns and sequences; self-expression through the creativity and emotion of the words; physical awareness of breath, movements of the mouth and other gestures as they align to the rhythm of the poetry. Scholars also see that poetry and nursery rhymes are universal throughout cultures as an oral tradition.

A sequestrum (plural: sequestra) is a piece of dead bone that has become separated during the process of necrosis from normal or sound bone. It is a complication (sequela) of osteomyelitis. The pathological process is as follows: * infection in the bone leads to an increase in intramedullary pressure due to inflammatory exudates * the periosteum becomes stripped from the ostium, leading to vascular thrombosis * bone necrosis follows due to lack of blood supply * sequestra are formed The sequestra are surrounded by sclerotic bone which is relatively avascular (without a blood supply). Within the bone itself, the haversian canals become blocked with scar tissue, and the bone becomes surrounded by thickened periosteum. Due to the avascular nature of this bone, antibiotics which travel to sites of infection via the bloodstream poorly penetrate these tissues, hence the difficulty in treating chronic osteomyelitis. At the same time as this, new bone is forming (known as involucrum). Openings in this involucrum allow debris and exudates (including pus) to pass from the sequestrum via sinus tracts to the skin. Rarely, a sequestrum may turn out to be an osteoid osteoma, a rare tumor of the bone.

It was the original home of the White Conduit Club, forerunner of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Later it was used by The Islington Albion Cricket Club, who played their last game at the ground in 1834. Maps from the time show that the cricket field was a few hundred metres north of the White Conduit House, in the land surrounding the modern Richmond Crescent,Map Of Islington, E. Baker, 1805, https://www.researchgate.net/figure/1805-map-of-Islington-source- Baker-E-1805_fig5_32888945Map Of Islington, 1817, http://cloudesleyassociation.org/about-the-area/london-map-1830 and paintings suggest it was also possibly on the adjacent field to the south at the modern Barnard Park. Early matches The earliest match known to have been played at White Conduit Fields was the controversial encounter on Monday, 1 September 1718, between London Cricket Club and the Rochester Punch Club. This game provoked a legal case when the Rochester players walked off in an attempt to save their stake money, London clearly winning at the time. The case focused on the terms of the wager rather than the rules of the sport and the judge ordered the game to be played out. It was concluded in July 1719 at the same venue and London won by 21 runs.Waghorn (DC), p. 5. London's 21-run victory is the earliest known definite result of any cricket match. The next known match was on Wednesday, 19 August 1719, between London and Kent. Kent won and the contemporary report concludes with: \\"The Kentish men won the wager\\" (i.e., the wager was more important than the match). London and Kent met again on Saturday, 9 July 1720, and this time London won. After 1720 the important London cricket matches were played at Kennington Common and the Artillery Ground, but White Conduit Fields was still used sporadically for cricket. In 1754 there was a single wicket match, where Falkner and Harris beat the two Bennets by 45 notches.Derby Mercury, 30 August 1754 In 1772 there was a cricket match between the butchers of London, when 11 Master Butchers of Newgate Market beat 11 Master Butchers of Clare Market for a money prize. The players began to wrangle and both parties came to blows when Newgate butchers had only a few runs left to chase.Derby Mercury, 21 August 1772 In 1773 London played England at White Conduit Fields. Other early matches in Islington There are two known matches which took place in the Islington area in 1722 and 1730 but their precise locations are unrecorded or indeterminate. The first match may have been played on or near White Conduit Fields and took place on Wednesday, 18 July 1722 between London and Dartford. Knowledge of the match is via a letter in The Weekly Journal dated 21 July 1722. The match was abandoned following a dispute. The letter said: \\"A Match at Cricket was made between the little Parish of Dartford in Kent, and the Gentlemen known by the name of the London Club\\". Teams styled \\"London\\" were already in existence but this is the first reference to an actual \\"London Club\\".Maun, pp. 26‚Äì27. On Wednesday, 12 August 1730, a London v Kent match began at a place called \\"Frog Lane\\" in Islington. Frog Lane was in east Islington, and forms the modern Danbury Street, Rheidol Terrace and Popham Street. It is therefore highly unlikely that this was White Conduit Fields. The source records that \\"being obliged by their articles to leave off at seven o‚Äôclock, they could not finish it\\". London had a lead of 30 runs when play ended and it was decided to complete the match on Tuesday, 18 August, at Kennington Common. There is no surviving record of the resumption.Waghorn (CS), p. 2. White Conduit Club White Conduit Fields became the home venue of the White Conduit Club from around 1780, and it became a major venue again from 1784 to 1786 when at least four matches involving the club were played there. It is believed that the club members were dissatisfied with the venue because it was \\"too open\\" and so they sought a more private location. They authorised Thomas Lord, one of the ground staff bowlers, to do the necessaries and find another venue. Before the 1787 season, the club moved to what is now called Lord's Old Ground in Marylebone. Islington Albion Cricket Club Cricket continued to be played at White Conduit Fields for several decades after the White Conduit Club moved to Lord's. The Oldfield family had owned the ground for many generations and operated a dairy farm adjacent to it. A new club called The Islington Albion Club was established in 1805Morperth Herald, 6 June 1874 and held the ground from the Oldfields. The club was named after The Albion tea house, built by Mr Thomas Albion Oldfield at the turn of the nineteenth century, which overlooked the ground. The earliest known games were in 1822 against Chislehurst,Morning Post, 1 July 1822 and other reported games were played against the Thursday's Kennington, Canonbury, Highgate, Richmond, Hornchurch and Cambridge clubs. The Albion Club played its last game on White Conduit Fields in 1834. In 1835 it moved to a more open ground near Copenhagen House, about a mile north of White Conduit Fields, and later played at Holloway, and Alexandra ParkMiddlesex Gazette, 11 December 1892 until at least the 1890s before disbanding. Ground location and subsequent urban development 1805 map from a 1793 survey of Islington showing the cricket ground The cricket field was long supposed to have been in the vicinity of King's Cross railway station. In 2005, a researcher concluded that the site was bounded by the modern streets of Cloudesley Road to the north, Barnsbury Road to the west, Tolpuddle Street to the south and probably as far as Liverpool Road to the east. There exists a White Conduit Street in this area. However maps from the time show that the cricket field was in the area of the modern Richmond Crescent, and it was bounded by Richmond Avenue to the south and the modern Thornhill Road cutting across the eastern part of the field. Eighteenth century paintings also indicate this more northerly location, or possibly the field immediately south of the one shown on the maps for pre-1787 matches. They show it is situated a few hundred metres directly north of the White Conduit HousePainting of White Conduit Fields, late 1700s, https://georgianera.wordpress.com/2018/06/21/cricket-quoits-and-fives- sporting-prints-of-the-18th-century/ and close to the Islington Workhouse, which was located just behind on Barnsbury Street.Painting of White Conduit Fields, circa 1787, https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=792720001&objectId;=3266375&partId;=1 The venue has disappeared under the spread of urban development. The Regent's Canal was cut through the land in the years after 1810 and passed almost directly under White Conduit House. The Islington Albion Club played at White Conduit Fields from 1805 to 1834, by which time some of the ground, which formed part of the Oldfield dairy farm, had already been lost. A part of the south of the ground had been incorporated into nursery grounds (owned by Mr Smith of Liverpool and others), and later maps show that the ground had become less open, before it was built upon with housing from 1839 onwards.

It is made from mochi and leaves of yomogi, also known as Japanese mugwort. Because Japanese mugwort is kneaded into the mochi, kusa mochi takes on a vivid green color. The greenness of it depends on the amount of Japanese mugwort blended in the mochi. It is also beneficial as medicinal food.  History  Jersey cudweed The custom to knead Japanese mugwort was transmitted from the Chinese. Documents state that nobles were eating kusa mochi during palace events in the Heian era. It used to be made with Jersey cudweed before the Heian era. However, since the Heian era, people started to make kusa mochi using Japanese mugwort (or yomogi) because of its capability to boost fertility and as medicinal food was discovered. Another purported reason for the change in ingredients was because Jersey cudweed is called Haha-ko-gusa which literally translates to \\"mother-and-child grass\\". As kusa mochi was enjoyed with a purpose of wishing for the health and well-being of mother and her children, it was considered ominous to knead jersey cudweed into the mochi. Since the Edo-era, kusa mochi began to be used as offering for Hinamatsuri (the Girl's Festival). The reason it was chosen as the offering was because of the vivid green color that represents fresh verdure. Another reason why it was chosen as an offering is because of the medicinal power of Japanese mugwort. Japanese mugwort is known for its vitality, which makes it difficult to eradicate. Kusa mochi was used as an offering with a desire of health and longevity.  As medicinal food  Japanese mugwort (also known as yomogi) The idea of food being fundamentally connected to medication has been present for a long time. The Japanese mugwort, which is the main ingredient of kusa mochi, has a history of at least 2,500 years of medicinal use. In one piece of Japanese ancient literature, it is stated that Japanese mugwort can be used as a hemostatic, a medicine for diarrhea, and for miscarriage prevention, and these uses are still put to practical use today. Japanese mugwort has many active ingredients that are beneficial to the body, such that it is also known as \\"the queen of herbs\\". Some of its components are dietary fiber, chlorophyll, vitamin B1 and vitamin B2. Some of its effects are preventing constipation, ameliorating the intestinal environment, and having antioxidant action. Research done in by the Hokkaido Tokachi Area Regional Food Processing Technology Center has claimed that Japanese mugwort is effective in improving blood flow. It is said that it helps expand the blood vessels and thus effective for people with bad circulation. The Japanese mugwort is a member of the asteraceae plant family, which some people have allergies to.

Trisong Detsen is said to have had four sons: Mutri Tsenpo, Mun√© Tsenpo, Mutik Tsenpo, and Sadnalegs. The eldest son, Mutri Tsenpo, died early. Mun√© Tsenpo is said to have taken power when his father, Trisong Detsen retired (probably around 797 CE). After a short reign, Mun√© Tsenpo, was supposedly poisoned on the orders of his mother, Tsephongsa, who was jealous of his beautiful young wife, Queen Phoyongsa. After his death, Mutik Tsenpo was next in line to the throne. Several sources, however, claim that Mutik Tsenpo murdered a senior minister and was exiled to Lhodak Kharchu (lHo-brag or Lhodrag), near the Bhutanese border in the south, so the throne was taken by Sadnalegs instead.Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. Tibet: A Political History (1967), p. 47. Yale University Press, New Haven and London.Ancient Tibet: Research Materials from The Yeshe De Project, pp. 283-284. Dharma Publishing, Berkeley, California. Some sources say that Mutik Tsenpo was later killed by members of sNa-nam clan, but this couldn't have happened until after Sadnalegs became king, as Sadnalegs mentions in an inscription at Zhwa'i-lha-khang that he took power from his father, that one of his brothers had died, and that he bound his elder brother, Mur-rug-brtsan, with an oath.Richardson, Hugh.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley from the 1935 general election until the 1959 general election, when he was succeeded by Margaret Thatcher (who later became British Prime Minister). Crowder was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He worked as an underwriter and elected a member at Lloyd's of London. He served with the Lincolnshire Yeomanry from 1914 to 1918, when he transferred to the Reserve Regiment of the Royal Horse Guards. He served again during World War II, as a staff captain and army welfare officer. Crowder served as a Hampshire County Councillor 1931-46 and a Fleet Urban District Councillor 1933‚Äì46. He was vice-chairman of the Aldershot and North Hants Conservative Association from 1930. He won Finchley in 1935 by a majority of 18,040 over Thomas Robertson, who had been Liberal MP for the seat 1923‚Äì24. In Parliament, Crowder was an influential member of the 1922 Committee and Second Church Estates Commissioner. His son Petre Crowder also became a Member of Parliament. He appears as a character in The Long Walk to Finchley, on Thatcher's selection to succeed him as Conservative candidate for his seat - he is played, in a less than flattering yet accurate light, by Geoffrey Palmer.

The aim was to set up a high-quality journal, capable of competing with existing journals, but with substantially lower subscription fees. The journal was open-access for its first ten years of existence and was available free to individual users, although institutions were required to pay modest subscription fees for both online access and for printed volumes. At present, an online subscription is required to view full- text PDF copies of articles in the most recent three volumes; articles older than that are open-access, at which point copies of the published articles are uploaded to the arXiv. A traditional printed version is also published, at present on an annual basis. The journal has grown to be well respected in its field, and has in recent years published a number of important papers, in particular proofs of the Property P conjecture and the Birman conjecture.

Early life Bayley was born in Newbridge, Victoria, son of John Bayley, a butcher, and his wife Rosanna. When only 16 years of age he went to North Queensland and did prospecting and mining work at Charters Towers, Hughenden, Normanton, Croydon and Palmer. He then went to Western Australia and landed at Fremantle with about thirty shillings in his pocket. Prospecting in Western Australia Bayley walked to Southern Cross, and while working there a few months later heard that gold had been discovered about to the east. Bayley kept this in mind and determined some day to prospect the area himself. In January 1889 he went to the Nullagine diggings and Roebourne in the Pilbara. He had some success, and after returning to Perth, returned to Southern Cross. Hearing that gold had been found on the Ashburton, Bayley returned to the north and found good gold at Ford's Creek. While prospecting the Murchison River he found Bayley's Island in Lake Austin which also yielded good returns. Back at Southern Cross in mid-1892, Bayley encountered a prospector he had met previously in Queensland, William Ford, who had also heard of gold being found to the east. In June, the two men set out from Southern Cross with five horses to find it. Soon after reaching an area known as Fly Flat (the future site of Coolgardie), Bayley and Ford found a nugget, and within a few days had picked up about of gold. After more rich alluvial gold was found, the two men were compelled to return to Southern Cross for supplies. On returning to the field a quartz outcrop with gold in it was found, which became the famous Bayley's Reward mine. The two men returned to Southern Cross with 554 ounces of gold, worth ¬£2,200 (or more than A$300,000 in 2015), which they showed to the warden, J. M. Finnerty, on 17 September 1892. A reward lease of was granted to them, and on 20 September 1892 the Coolgardie field was declared open. There was a tremendous rush to the field from Southern Cross, much gold was found, and in a few years Coolgardie was a thriving town. Bayley's reward claim proved to be a very profitable one indeed, and was continually worked until 1963. During the 70 years of its existence this mining claim recovered over 500,000 ounces of gold. Late life Bayley and Ford sold their claim to a company for ¬£6000 and a sixth interest and Bayley, having returned to Victoria, took up land near Avenel, and lived in prosperous circumstances. Though a strong athletic man he fell into ill health, possibly on account of privations he had suffered while a prospector, and died at Avenel of congestion of the lungs on 29 October 1896. He left a widow but no children. Notes References * External links *Pat Simpson, 'Bayley, Arthur Wellesley (1865 - 1896)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 7, MUP, 1979, pp 220‚Äì221.

An AudioTron can stream digital music files from personal computers or NAS devices without the need to install server software on these storage devices since the AudioTron is based on Windows CE and is therefore a computer that looks like audio hardware.https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1572231,00.asp Supported file formats include Wave, WMA, MP3 and MP3 playlists. These files can reside on a Microsoft Windows network share or on a Samba server. AudioTron reads music files over Ethernet or HPNA network, and generates analog audio via RCA connectors as well as digital audio via S/PDIF. An AudioTron can play streaming media from Internet radio stations. The formats supported are Windows Media, SHOUTcast and Icecast. The Windows Media support is limited to the features available before the release of Windows Media Player 10. Connecting to Internet radio stations was once supported through a free service called TurtleRadio. When TurtleRadio was shut down by Turtle Beach, Turtle Beach disclosed an alternative method available in the device's firmware (using a local file) to load one's Internet radio station list into the AudioTron. Users operate the AudioTron with a PC/laptop on the same network using the web interface from the built-in webserver, with a remote control, or on the device itself using buttons and a large \\"Turn & Push Selector Knob\\" on its front panel. The knob is used to navigate song selection menu on a green two-line LCD display. Users can select songs by turning and pushing the knob, based on various combinations of Genre, Album, Title and Artist tags. The knob also serves as volume control and playhead control while a song is being played. Standard Play, Pause, Stop, Forward and Rewind buttons can be used to control playback. An infrared remote control comes with AudioTron and can be used instead of the front panel.http://www.controlav.com/audiotron.asp AudioTron obtains an IP address from DHCP server by default. The AudioTron can be configured via buttons on the front panel or remotely from a web browser. AudioTron runs a web server which can be accessed via any standard browser. The web server also allows users to access the complete collection of songs online. Users can play songs or send them to AudioTron's play queue, without using the front panel or remote control. The AudioTron is also able to determine the type of device the web server was being accessed from, and devices such as PDAs will display a simplified remote control screen more suitable to the smaller size of a PDA screen. First released in 2001, AudioTron was ahead of its time in providing driverless music streaming, S/PDIF and Internet radio support. The AudioTron operated as a standalone music player by making use of the Microsoft SMB file server protocol; that is, it could load music from any SMB file server (although, the Audiotron uses NTLMv1 for authentication and so the Audiotron does not work well in modern SMB environments).http://connectedmag.net/Audio/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=22602 Production of this device stopped in 2004. Turtle Beach continued to support TurtleRadio until March 2007. After that time, the TurtleRadio website was retired and users had to change the configuration of their AudioTron to use a local file to set the list of radio stations that their AudioTron could stream. In March 2010, Turtle Beach implemented a redirect that allows the AudioTron to be used with the Webstation Radio Database. Similar to the TurtleRadio website, users can create accounts and select their own favorites from thousands of radio stations which will then be available on the AudioTron. Otherwise change the default TURTLERADIO PLAYER ID to read as 'Audiotron' which will give 1000 radio stations under 56 categories.

Political career Having stood unsuccessfully for Hackney North and Stoke Newington in 1983, Booth succeeded Margaret Thatcher as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Finchley from the 1992 general election until the constituency was abolished in the 1997 general election. Booth resigned in February 1994 as a parliamentary private secretary to Douglas Hogg, then the Foreign Office minister of state, after newspaper reports of a relationship with House of Commons researcher Emily Barr.I Resign Despite his resignation, Booth insists that \\"there was no sexual impropriety\\" between himself and Barr. This was politically embarrassing to the John Major government of the time, following the backlash of Major's Back to Basics initiative, and in January 2015, the satirical magazine Private Eye criticised Booth for his alleged hypocrisy, saying it went against his recommendations in the newly released 1985 memo that the government should instil values of \\"personal responsibility, basic honesty, [and respect for] the law and the police\\" from an early age. Barr went on to be a successful journalist and novelist. Booth lost a bruising nomination battle with the Hendon South MP John Marshall for the new Finchley and Golders Green constituency, and was unsuccessful in finding another seat before the election. Marshall lost the 1997 general election to Labour's Rudi Vis. Booth was a co-author of a 1985 memo by former Number 10 adviser Oliver Letwin, advising that the then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ought not to regenerate certain inner cities, claiming that black youths would use the money for the \\"discotheque and drug trade\\", and added: \\"So long as these bad moral attitudes remain, efforts to improve the inner cities will flounder.\\" However, Booth has \\"largely escaped notice\\" with regards to co-authoring the memo.

He usually captained his teams but nothing is known about his ability as a player. There is uncertainty about his name because his forename has been rendered \\"Edwin\\", \\"Edwyn\\" or \\"Edward\\"; his surname \\"Stead\\", \\"Stede\\" or \\"Steed\\". In the various sources, \\"Edwin Stead\\" is the most common version. He was born at Harrietsham in Kent and died in London. Cricket career Stead, a landowner, was a compulsive gambler who frequently bet on the outcome of cricket matches.Birley, p. 19. Like other patrons, he sought to improve his chances of winning by underwriting select XIs usually made up of players from several Kent parish teams; his teams were therefore of, or near enough, county strength.Altham, p. 31. Dartford Cricket Club, which featured William Bedle, had arguably the best parish team in the game at the time and it is certain that Stead used several Dartford players in his Kent teams, of which he was also the captain.Underdown, pp. 42‚Äì43. Stead's teams are recorded in several significant matches from 1724 to 1731. His first known match was probably at Chingford in 1724Maun, p. 29. and it became the subject of a court case after the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Kent had the advantage.Underdown, p. 83. The court, presided over by Lord Chief Justice Pratt, ruled that the match must be played out so that all wagers could be fulfilled. The match resumed and was completed at Dartford Brent on 5 September 1726, though it seems that was not the original venue.Maun, p. 33. A week earlier, on 29 August 1726, Kent had played a combined London and Surrey team on Kennington Common for 25 guineas but the result is unknown. Stead was a strong rival to the two noted Sussex patrons, Sir William Gage and the 2nd Duke of Richmond.Marshall, p. 41. He was very successful in 1728 when the report of a game in August said of Kent's latest victory: \\"the third time this summer that the Kentish men have been too expert for those of Sussex\\".Waghorn, Dawn of Cricket, p. 7. But Stead was less successful on 28 August the following year when Gage's XI defeated Kent at Penshurst Park, apparently by an innings.McCann, p. 9.Maun, p. 39. There was a return match in September, possibly at or near Lewes, but the result is unknown.Maun, p. 40. Stead was active in single wicket cricket which became popular during his lifetime. He led a Kent team in three four-a-side matches in 1730. The sources record that \\"a considerable wager\\" was at stake in the decider and Kent lost.Buckley, p. 4.Waghorn, Cricket Scores, pp. 3‚Äì4.Wilson, p. 44. The last definite mentions of Stead in a cricket context are in the 1730s concerning his presence at certain matches, although Kent remained prominent in the records for the last five years of his life. Stead's last known involvement in a match was on Saturday, 26 June 1731 when he led a Kent team against Sunbury on Sunbury Common, a game which the home team won.Maun, p. 42. Personal life and early death Edwin Stead was the grandson of Sir Edwyn Stede (sic), who had been knighted by Charles II. He inherited the family estate when he was still only eighteen and became a compulsive gambler, being a keen player of dice and cards in addition to cricket, but John Marshall's summary is that \\"he is said to have lost heavily at all\\".Marshall, p. 40. John Major wrote that Stead lived the \\"proverbial short life but a merry one\\".Major, p. 46. His recklessness caused him financial difficulties in 1723 and he was obliged to mortgage some of his land to settle his debts. Stead was, nevertheless, a \\"graceful loser\\" and Major asserts that \\"his nonchalance\\" gained him powerful friends including Frederick, Prince of Wales.Major, p. 48. Stead's death on 28 August 1735 was reported in the Grub Street Journal on Thursday, 4 September 1735. The report says there were two accounts of his death: one that he died \\"near Charing Cross\\"; the other that he died \\"in Scotland Yard\\".Buckley, p. 12.

Kalinaki, who swore a charge-and-caution statement under pending charges of forgery and uttering a false document, was later released on non-cash bond of UGX:10 million. That case was dismissed for lack of evidence on 7 February 2012. That was the second time in 2009 that Kalinaki had been summoned to the CID to answer questions over stories published by the Daily Monitor Publication Limited. No charges were referred in the earlier case, which followed a story that was critical of the conduct of the operation against the Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army.

It initially belonged to the House of Rennes. Alan III, Duke of Brittany, gave it to his brother Eudes in 1035, and his descendants formed a cadet branch of the ducal house. The geographical region of Brittany that constituted the holdings of Penthi√®vre correlate closely with the territories that constituted the early Breton kingdom of Domnon√©e. The history of the title Count of Penthi√®vre included frequent dispossessions and restorations. Henri d'Avaugour, heir of this family, was dispossessed of the countship in 1235. The Duke of Brittany, Pierre Mauclerc, founder of the Breton House of Dreux, gave it as dowry to his daughter, Yolande, on her marriage in 1238 to Hugh XI of Lusignan, Count of La Marche. John I, Duke of Brittany, Yolande's brother, seized the countship on her death in 1272. After the Breton War of Succession the title was dispossessed twice by the reigning Dukes of Brittany, once by John V and another time by Francis II. Disputed Heirs to the Ducal Crown of Brittany In 1337 Joan the Lame, Duchess of Brittany, brought Penthi√®vre to her husband, Charles de Ch√¢tillon, Count of Blois. Joan was the daughter of Guy de Penthi√®vre, the younger full brother of John III. When John III died a dispute emerged regarding the inheritance of the Duchy of Brittany. John III had tried to prevent the inheritance of the duchy by his half brother John of Montfort. Joan and Charles claimed the ducal crown and were subsequently proclaimed the Duchess and Duke of Brittany, which John of Montfort also claimed. Their dispute prompted the War of the Breton Succession. In 1352, during that war, the Estates of Brittany were established. In 1364, Charles died and John IV, Duke of Brittany, John of Montfort's son, was confirmed as duke. Joan was permitted to keep Penthi√®vre and use the title Duchess of Brittany until her death. Under the Treaty of Guerande (1365), Joan recognized John IV as the undisputed duke. When John went into exile in England in 1373, Charles V of France named his brother Louis, Duke of Anjou lieutenant-general of Brittany. Louis was also a son-in- law of Joan de Penthi√®vre. Under the Second Treaty of Guerande (1381), it was agreed that, in the event the House of Montfort failed to produce a male heir, the senior male heir of Joan would be recognized as duke. Joan died in 1384 and left Penthi√®vre to her oldest son, John (1340‚Äì1404). In turn, John left the county to his son, Olivier, Count of Penthi√®vre (1389‚Äì1433), who forfeited the title in 1421 after kidnapping and attempting to blackmail John V, Duke of Brittany. Olivier's brother John II (1393‚Äì1454) recovered the county but died childless, passing his titles on to Nicole (1424‚Äì1480), daughter of his brother Charles, Lord of Avaugour (1396‚Äì1434). In 1437, Nicole married Jean II de Brosse. She was deprived of Penthi√®vre by Francis II, Duke of Brittany in 1465, thus undermining the Penthi√®vre family's position in the duchy. When Francis died in 1488, Nicole's eldest son Jean III de Brosse (d. 1502) asserted his family's claim to the duchy against those of Anne, Duchess of Brittany, who ultimately ascended to the title. As Dukes of Penthi√®vre The countship of Penthi√®vre was restored to Sebastian of Luxemburg, heir of the Brosse family through his mother, Charlotte de Brosse (1506-1540), great- granddaughter of Nicole de Blois through her son Jean (d. 1502) and grandson Rene (1470-1524). The countship was erected for him into a duchy in the peerage of France in 1569. Afterwards it was held by Sebastian's daughter, Marie de Luxembourg, (1562-1623), who also became Duchess of Merc≈ìur by marriage. Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc≈ìur, brother-in-law of Henry III of France (last living male-line grandson of Claude, Duchess of Brittany), and a leader of the Catholic League, was made governor of Brittany by the king in 1582. Invoking the hereditary rights of his wife, Marie de Luxembourg, he endeavoured to make himself independent in that province from 1589 onwards, and organized a government at Nantes, proclaiming their young son, Philippe de Lorraine-Merc≈ìur, (d. 1590), \\"prince and duke of Brittany\\". He allied with Spain and defeated Henry IV of France's attempts to subjugate Brittany until 20 March 1598 when Merc≈ìur was forced to surrender and subsequently went in exile to Hungary. Philippe died young, leaving his sister, Fran√ßoise de Lorraine-Merc≈ìur the duchy of Penthi√®vre. Later dukes from various houses The Duchess of Vend√¥me's grandson, Louis Joseph, duc de Vend√¥me, inherited Penthi√®vre in 1669, but it was taken from him by decree in 1687 and adjudged to Marie Anne de Bourbon, Princess de Conti. In 1696, it was sold to Louis- Alexandre de Bourbon, Count de Toulouse, whose son, Louis de Bourbon, bore the title Duke de Penthi√®vre. This title passed by inheritance to the House of Orl√©ans.

The canal's construction was initiated by Union forces during the American Civil War to bypass a meander loop of the river around a peninsula known as Farrar's Island that was controlled by Confederate artillery. The canal was completed after the war and is now the main channel of the James River in this area. Today, the area south of the canal is the location of the Dutch Gap Conservation Area and Henricus Historical Park. Origin of Name The Dutch Gap Canal was named for its location at Dutch Gap, which was formerly a neck of land that joined Farrar's Island to the mainland. The James River around Farrar's Island, from Drewry's Bluff to the confluence of the Appomattox River below Bermuda Hundred, originally had a number of meandering loops. The Dutch Gap was the isthmus between the narrowest of these loops. Here, the James River on the west bank of the isthmus created what was called the \\"Seven Mile Loop\\" that formed Farrar's Island before returning to the east bank. However, the distance between the east and west banks at this point was less than 200 yards wide. and the elevation ranged from 3 feet to 39 feet above the level of the river. The name \\"Dutch Gap\\" has been historically associated with the founding of Henricus by the Virginia Company of London in 1611 by Sir Thomas Dale, and it was also known as \\"Dale's Dutch Gap\\". The name is attributed to a palisaded fosse that Dale is thought to have built across the neck to protect the town from attack on the north side of the river. It is claimed to have been named the \\"Dutch Gap\\" because Dale is thought to have learned the fortification technique when he served as a mercenary for the Dutch Republic prior to his employment with the Virginia Company. Between 1619 and 1624, Dutch Gap was part of the City of Henrico. In 1637, it became part of a patent claimed as an inheritance by the son of councillor and commissioner, William Farrar. As a result of this patent, the land enclosed by the loop of the James just below Dutch Gap eventually got its name, Farrar's Island. Civil War History Confederate Columbiad overlooking Farrar's Island During the American Civil War in late August, 1864, General Benjamin Butler, commander of the Union Army of the James, ordered the construction of a canal at Dutch Gap. One purpose of the canal was to allow ships to bypass the loop of the James river around Farrar's Island, which was controlled by Confederate batteries. Of particular threat was Battery Dantzler at the northern end of the Howlett Line where Confederate forces had installed two seven-inch Brooke rifles, two ten- inch Columbiad guns, and two siege mortars that had a half mile field of fire on the James River that lay on the east side of Farrar's Island. Another purpose was to continue military activity as part of the larger Petersburg Campaign to ensure that Confederate manpower resources remained strained in Eastern Virginia and unable to redeploy to other sectors. Completed canal as it looked on April 1865 Due to the geography of the area, the canal was dug just south of the narrowest point of Dutch Gap, and was about 175 yards long when completed. The construction was often performed under fire, as batteries from both sides engaged in daily duels. At times, the Confederate artillery was effective in slowing down the rate of construction with indirect fire, as when it sank the Union dredge being used to deepen the canal. In January 1865, the cut across the isthmus was complete, but the explosion used to remove the bulkhead to open the canal threw much of the bulkhead's earth back into the canal. Dredging had to continue to the end of the war and the canal remained unusable for armed ships. =Role of African-Americans at the Dutch Gap Canal= The greater part of the construction of the Dutch Gap Canal was done by United States Colored Troops (USCT), many of whom were freedmen. Up to 40% of the personnel in the Army of the James were in USCT units, which was the highest percent of any command military in the Civil War. At least seven USCT infantry regiments were engaged in military, excavation and fatigue duties specifically related to action at Dutch Gap. In general, the Union army often treated the men of USCT units as second-class citizens relegating them primarily to fatigue duty, and this was also a concern during the building of the Dutch Gap Canal.. However, the Army of the James was noteworthy in striving to ensure that soldiers in USCT units were treated similarly to other soldiers in the army. Initially, General Butler recruited both African- American and white soldiers for excavation duty for the canal, which required 7 and a half hours of hard labor daily; but all volunteers were compensated by pay that nearly doubled their salary and a daily ration of whiskey or its cash equivalent. Soldiers from a United States Colored Troops unit on picket duty at Dutch Gap However, Butler underestimated the time and resources needed to complete the canal, and he had abandoned the volunteer system as well as seek addition labor from other sources. This additional need often led to inequities in the treatment of men USCT units, who were frequently assigned more fatigue duties than white soldiers. The need to acquire labor for the canal created other inequities, including the treatment of African-American laborers from the Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island. Initially, these men had been freed by Union forces, but then they unwillingly taken from North Carolina and impressed into service excavating the canal. They wrote a letter protesting their impressment, as well as a failure to receive promised pay. Due to their protest, the freedmen did eventually get paid; however, their compensation as civilian laborers was small and less regular than men doing similar work in the USCT units Soldiers from the United States Colored Troops excavating the Dutch Gap Canal =Dutch Gap Canal Affair= The Dutch Gap Canal also became a focal point for negotiating the treatment of black soldiers captured by the Confederates during the Petersburg Campaign. In 1863, A joint resolution by the Confederate Congress declared captured black soldiers agents of servile insurrection who were subject to execution or enslavement. In response, the Lincoln administration ordered that an equal number of Confederate soldiers be put to death for each black soldier executed and that for every black soldier enslaved, a Confederate soldier forced into menial labor. In October 1864, When Benjamin Butler found out that captured black Union soldiers were being enslaved to build Confederate emplacements that were under Union artillery bombardment, he ordered Confederate prisoners to be forced to work on the Dutch Gap Canal even as it was being bombarded by Confederate artillery. In response to Butler's action, General Robert E. Lee informed General Ulysses S. Grant a week later that captured African-American soldiers who were not originally freedmen would be treated as regular prisoners of war. Lee also informed Grant that captured African-American soldiers were no longer working on the fortifications; in turn, Grant ordered Butler to release the Confederates from digging the canal. Post-Civil War Development Even during the Civil War, the positive economic impact of the canal on water transportation to Richmond was foreseen. However, immediately after the war, the canal was so undeveloped that it was called a \\"One Horse Ditch\\" by one traveler. Even so, the commercial potential of the Dutch Gap Canal was demonstrated when the steamer Clyde passed through it on a journey from Fort Monroe to Richmond in May 1865. Nevertheless, the canal remained undeveloped for the next five years because the owner of Farrar's Island filled in the canal's northern end to create a causeway; however, a flood in 1870 washed out the causeway, allowing the canal to be further developed and converted into the main channel of the James River. After 1871, improvements to the canal, such as deepening and widening, began under the oversight of the Army Corps of Engineers, and continued at least through to the end of the 1870s. The challenges with improving the canal and the rest of the James River to accommodate larger ships may have played a role in hindering Richmond's post-Civil War development as an inland port. In the twentieth century, the canal has continued to be improved. By 1916, the channel of the James, including the Dutch Gap Canal, was 22 feet deep; since 1940, it had obtained its current depth of 25 feet. Currently, the canal's commercial traffic consists of primarily of container barges and feeder ships transporting goods between Hampton Roads and Richmond. Dutch Gap Canal and Paleobotany The excavation of the Dutch Gap Canal exposed an accessible area of Potomac Formation, which contains many fossils dating to the Cretaceous period has made it a site for the study of paleobotany In 2013, the fossil of a previously unknown flowering plant , Potomacapnos apeleutheron from the Early Cretaceous age was discovered. This fossil may be one of the earliest eudicots found in North America, as the geological deposits it was embedded in were about 120 million years old. The ancient flowering plant was named, Potomacapnos apeleutheron, in honor of the freedmen who dug the canal: Potomacapnos defines the area where the fossil was found apeleutheron is the Greek for freedmen. Dutch Gap Canal Area Today Contemporary map of Dutch Gap Canal and surrounding waterways Farrar's Island, which is just south of the Dutch Gap Canal, is now the site of the Dutch Gap Conservation Area and Boat Landing and the Henricus Historical Park. An electricity-generating facility owned by Dominion Energy is located nearby on the south shore of the James River near an extension of the canal, the Dutch Gap Cutoff, that created Hatcher Island out of another, wider bend.

Prior to the release it was discovered that there was a country band by the name of The Rangers. Blades had written the song \\"Night Ranger\\" for the album so the band changed their name to Night Ranger to avoid any potential problems. Night Ranger went on through the '80s releasing albums which sold by the millions, as well as several hit singles. The band toured constantly both in the US and in Japan where they continue to be popular today. In 1989, Blades left Night Ranger and formed the Damn Yankees.

He subsequently served in the United States Senate and was known as the \\"Blond Boss\\" in Chicago. In 1912, however, the Senate held Lorimer's election invalid due to the use of corrupt methods and practices including vote-buying. Biography Lorimer was born in Manchester, England. His family immigrated to the United States in 1866, first settling in Michigan and then moving to Chicago in 1870. Lorimer was self-educated. He had been apprenticed to a sign painter when he was ten. He worked in the Chicago meat-packing houses and for a street railroad company. In 1894, Lorimer was elected to the first of two non-consecutive tenures (1895-1901, 1903‚Äì09) in the US House of Representatives. In 1909, he helped to engineer the blocking of the re-election of US Senator Albert J. Hopkins, a Republican who had been Lorimer's ally, but was now a political foe. With Hopkins' re-election bid finished, Lorimer seemed surprised when a coalition of 55 Illinois state House Republicans and 53 state House Democrats pushed his name to fill the now- vacant seat. Lorimer's name went before the state Senate, and he was elected to the US Senate. He took his seat in March 1909. In 1910, The Chicago Tribune published an admission by Illinois Assemblyman Charles A. White that Lorimer had paid $1,000 for White's vote in the election for U.S. Senator (prior to the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, selection of U.S. Senators rested with state legislatures, rather than popular vote).A Study in Boss Politics: William Lorimer of Chicago at www.questia.com On July 13, 1912, after a Senate investigation and acrimonious debate, the Senate adopted a resolution declaring \\"that corrupt methods and practices were employed in his election, and that the election, therefore, was invalid.\\" Many in Chicago believed that Lorimer's ouster was politically inspired and that he was wrongfully deprived of his seat. When he returned to Chicago he was greeted by a parade and a throng at a meeting in Orchestra Hall. One of the speakers at the meeting was attorney Charles Lederer of Adler & Lederer (now known as Arnstein & Lehr, LLP) and a former member of the Illinois General Assembly. He presented a resolution to the meeting reciting the wrong done to Mr. Lorimer, his fight for his seat and the faith of his friends in him.Chicago Daily Tribune, July 24, 1912. Lorimer served as president of La Salle Street Trust & Savings Bank from 1910 to 1915, and then entered the lumber business. He died in Chicago at age 73.

On this release, Apollyon switched to playing the drums instead of guitar. Some time after the release of the EP, Galder and Cerberus would depart from the band. The following year D√∏dheimsgard recorded their next album entitled 666 International, which was released in 1999.

The signatories were Burgundy, France, England, the Holy Roman Empire, the Netherlands, the Papal States and Spain, all of whom agreed not to attack one another and to come to the aid of any that were under attack.Tudor History. Treaty of London The treaty was designed by Cardinal Wolsey and so came to be signed by the ambassadors of the nations concerned in London.Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey, History at University of Wisconsin Pope Leo X originally called for a five-year peace while the monarchs of Europe helped him fight back the rising power of the Ottoman Empire, which was encroaching into the Balkans. Wolsey was very keen on instead making lasting peace and persuaded Henry VIII to avoid war and to take a more diplomatic route in foreign affairs. Background In the 15th century, peace was established for 50 years in the Italian Peninsula, which was divided into many small city- states. Only the small War of Ferrara between the Republic of Venice and the Papal States for the control of Ferrara caused a temporary lapse in the peace. The mostly-peaceful period came to an end with the French invasion of 1494. A succession of small wars followed, and in 1518, the political possibilities of a peace treaty seemed a realisation. Terms The treaty reflected considerable glory upon the reign of King Henry VIII All European countries were invited to London (the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the Ottoman Empire were then considered to be in not Europe but of Asia). The treaty hoped to bind the 20 leading states of Europe into peace with one another and thus end warfare between the states of Europe. In October 1518, it was initiated between representatives from England and France. It was then ratified by other European nations and the Pope. The agreement established a defensive league based upon the following: The terms committed states with an active foreign policy to commit to a stance of non-aggression and to promise to make war upon any state that broke the terms of the treaty. At the time, the treaty was considered a triumph for Thomas Wolsey and allowed Henry VIII to increase his standing so greatly in European political circles that England became seen as a third major power. Legacy  The peace brought by the treaty brought was very brief. Wars broke out in a few years, including wars between Denmark and Sweden and also an alliance of England and Spain against France. The peace movement, however, continued for next centuries and became part of the Enlightenment movement in the 18th century.

Situated near the Mississippi River, Coffman anchors the south end of Northrop Mall, a grassy area at the center of campus that is bordered by the university's physics, mathematics, chemistry, and administration buildings, plus Walter Library. Northrop Auditorium sits at the north end of the mall, opposite Coffman across Washington Avenue.  History  Coffman Memorial Union was built between 1939 and 1940 as a new \\"center of social life\\" for the University of Minnesota campus, a role that had previously been filled by Shevlin Hall and Nicholson Hall in the Old Campus Historic District. Designed by architect Clarence H. Johnston Jr, the new building opened in September 1940 and was dedicated on October 25th of the same year. It was named in memory of Lotus D. Coffman, President of the University of Minnesota between 1920 and 1938. Since opening, the building has undergone two significant renovations. The first major renovation, completed in 1976, was widely criticized for its adverse effect on the building's exterior. However, this was largely corrected between 1999 and 2003 during the second major renovation. The second renovation restored the exterior, thoroughly renovated the interior, and greatly expanded the basement floors to include the main University of Minnesota Bookstore, food vendors, offices, lounges, and the glass \\"Cube\\" which sits adjacent to Washington Avenue.\\"University of Minnesota Coffman Memorial Union Renovation Comments\\", Retrieved on 19 April 2016. The project required the building to be closed for a period of three years. In 2019, after 16 months of study, a University task force recommended removing Lotus Coffman's name from the building due to his racist and anti-Semitic policies.  Services and amenities  The building hosts a variety of services including the University of Minnesota Bookstore, Minnesota Marketplace Food Court, US Postal Service, IT Student Lab, administration services, and student group services. While the main lounge and theater are located on the main floor of the building, the lower level offers access to the bookstore, Great Hall, and several dining options.\\"Coffman Memorial Union Campus Maps\\", Retrieved on 24 April 2016. The basement features the Whole Music Club and an entertainment center called Goldy's Gameroom (which also features a bowling alley). The building's upper floors are largely reserved for student and administration use, with student groups occupying much of the second floor.
