Such influence can be of different types, but OECSs invariably create a short-term coherent trajectory pattern for which they serve as a theoretical centerpiece. While LCSs are intrinsically tied to a specific finite time interval, OECSs can be computed at any time instant regardless of the multiple and generally unknown time scales of the system. In observations of tracer patterns in nature, one readily identifies short-term variability in material structures such as emerging and dissolving coherent features. However, it is often the underlying structure creating these features that is of interest. While individual tracer trajectories forming coherent patterns are generally sensitive with respect to changes in their initial conditions and the system parameters, OECSs are robust and reveal the instantaneous time-varying skeleton of complex dynamical systems. Despite OECSs are defined for general dynamical systems, their role in creating coherent patterns is perhaps most readily observable in fluid flows. Therefore, OECSs are suitable in a number of applications ranging from flow control to environmental assessment such as now-casting or short-term forecasting of pattern evolution, where quick operational decisions need to be made. Examples include floating debris, oil spills, surface drifters, and control of unsteady flow separation.

Typical for the band's music was staccato-type playing technique, shredding guitar riffs, fast-fingered distorted bass parts and drum play in 6/8 rhythm. The name Hyste'riah was taken from a leftover track title from a previous band and had nothing to do with a certain album by an English rock band. History =Formation and Attempt The Life (1987‚Äì1988)= Hyste'riah was formed by bassplayer J. B. Krown (from D.T.A.L.), drummer T. C. Hagen and guitarist Cliff T (later in Darkane and Terror 2000) at a local music festival in Landskrona. The band soon recorded the 4-song compact cassette Attempt The life which sold worldwide. These four songs brought Hyste'riah a lot of attention from underground zines and contact from the label Wild Rags in Montebello, California. =Jeremiad Of The Living (1988‚Äì1989)= Drummer problems resulted that the recording of what became the Jeremiad Of The Living 4-song compact cassette was done as a 2-piece act. This did not stop the band from writing more music. Wild Rags, who sold about 10% of their tapes now offered them a deal for their upcoming 4-song 12-inch single. =Hymns Of The Dead Vol 1 (1989)= In 1989 Hyste'riah appeared on the legendary compilation Hymns Of The Dead Vol 1 with Grave (band), Nihilist (band), Obscurity, Merciless, Leprosy, Treblinka...now known as Tiamat (band), Dismember (band), Atrocity, Macrodex and Kentic brosk. =Joining with another band and ending (1989)= Late in 1989 Hyste'riah joined forces with the remains of Helsingborg thrashers GOD. B. C. The result was a softer, doomier and more technical sound which made an end to their thrashy hardcore signum. The offered deal with Wild Rags was (for unknown reasons) rejected by some members in the new line-up and instead the band signed for Hellhound Records under their new name Hyste'riah G.B.C. =To The Death (2016)= In 2016 the recordings from 1987 and 1988 were freshened up in Darkane studios and re- released by To The Death Records.

The memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, one of 15 instances of his War Cross and the only one commissioned by a regiment. The memorial, dedicated to members of the Leeds Rifles who fell in the First World War (with later additions for the Second World War), was unveiled on Remembrance Sunday, 13 November 1921, and is today a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' civic war memorials. As well as civic memorials, Lutyens designed multiple war memorials for private companies and individual regiments. The Leeds Rifles was the only regiment to choose Lutyens' War Cross design for its memorial, a design used mostly for civic memorials in towns and villages.Skelton, p. 91. History and design Leeds Minster, with the Leeds Rifles memorial visible in the foreground to the left The memorial is a comparatively small version of the War Cross, set into the church wall of Leeds Minster and facing out onto Kirkgate. The Portland stone of the war memorial creates a contrast with the sandstone of the church wall. Because of the difference in level between the churchyard and the street, the memorial incorporates a stone bench which doubles as a platform for wreaths. At the height of the wall, the cross is surrounded on three sides by decorative iron railings with arrowhead finials.Skelton, p. 170. The base of the cross in inscribed \\"7TH AND 8TH BATTALIONS / WEST YORKSHIRE REGIMENT / THE PRINCE OF WALES'S OWN / LEEDS RIFLES / 45TH (LEEDS RIFLES) BATTALION / ROYAL TANK REGIMENT / 66TH (LEEDS RIFLES) HAA REGIMENT / ROYAL ARTILLERY\\"; at the level of the churchyard wall is the further inscription \\"TO THE MEN OF THE LEEDS RIFLES WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES / 1914-1918 / 1939-1945\\" (the dates of the Second World War were added later). In bronze above the inscription is the cap badge of the Leeds Rifles, and below it are the regimental cap badges of the Royal Artillery, the Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire Regiment), and the Royal Tank Regiment, in which volunteers of the Leeds Rifles served. Just to the east of the memorial is the East Bar stone, marking the former location of a bar (gate) in the town walls; the wall and bar stone are part of the same listing as the war memorial. The memorial was unveiled on Remembrance Sunday, 13 November 1921, by Captain George Sanders, an officer of the Leeds Rifles who had earned a Victoria Cross in the war. The Leeds Rifles War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 8 May 1974. In March 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free- standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

The diploma was drafted by Mikl√≥s Bethlen, Chancellor of Transylvania. The Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, sanctioned it in Vienna on 16 October 1690. The diploma announced on 4th December 1691. The diploma restored civil administration in the principality, and confirmed the traditional liberties of the Three Nations of Transylvania, including the freedom of the four \\"received\\" religions. Background Until 1683, it stood at the peak of the Ottoman Empire's power in Hungary. Mih√°ly I Apafi was promoted to princely position against J√°nos Kem√©ny. In 1681, in exchange for abundant gifts, the Porta recognized the election of Michael Apafi as prince. However, in 1682, Sertar Pasha Ibrahim proclaimed Imre Th√∂k√∂ly the prince of Hungary. In 1683, the Turks besieged Vienna, where the Transylvanian armies lined up alongside the Turks, yet it was feared that after the conquest of Vienna, the Turks would make Th√∂k√∂ly the prince of Transylvania instead of Apafi. However, after the unsuccessful siege of Vienna, the Turkish fortunes of war reversed quickly and permanently, the imperial troops went into a counterattack and by 1684 they had already besieged Buda. In this situation Apafi began a diplomatic groping towards Vienna, from where in 1685 a Jesuit ambassador was sent to his court. The ambassador signed a secret contract with Mih√°ly Teleki, according to which Teleki will settle the agreement between Transylvania and Vienna. At the urging of Teleki and as a result of the preparations for the siege of Buda in 1686, an agreement was finally reached, Haller's diploma (June 28, 1686), according to which the German emperor and Hungarian king also exercised supreme power over Transylvania, Transylvania renounced its independent foreign policy, in exchange for which 1/6 of the German army is stationed in Transylvania to protect Transylvania, and privileges and freedom of religion remain undisturbed. Transylvania pays the military ‚Äúmilitary service‚Äù instead of Turkish taxes. In exchange for formal dependence, Lip√≥t confirmed Apafi Jr.'s right to inherit. However, its statehood remained and it regained some of the territories that Transylvania had lost in the peace of Vasv√°r. Apparently, Apafi signed this treaty for two reasons: on the one hand, the closure of Buda had already been completed, Turkish assistance could not be counted from then on, and on the other hand, the Turks still supported Th√∂k√∂ly against him. In 1687, the Imperial army, which had stopped the Turkish counterattack (August 12, 1687), marched to Transylvania in September, according to Haller's diploma, which practically meant the occupation of Transylvania. After the occupation of Somly√≥, Kolozsvar and Szamos√∫jv√°r, they stopped negotiating at Szeben. He was inducted into the princely dignity on September 17, II. Mih√°ly Apafi. Charles of Lorraine cared more for the food of his soldiers than for the interests of the Habsburgs, so he concluded with the elder Apafi the pact of Bal√°zsfalva (October 27, 1687), in which the principality swore to the emperor and received German garrisons. In return for leaving Apafi independent, he committed himself to supplying the army. At the same time (October 31, 1687), the Diet of Pozsony declared the Habsburgs' inherited right to the crown of St. Stephen, which Lip√≥t interpreted together with Transylvania. The Bal√°zsfalva pact was, of course, not accepted by Vienna, and in 1688 Caraffa was sent to Transylvania with the appointment of commander-in-chief. By May, Transylvania had returned to Hungary in the Fogaras Declaration and the Turkish patronage would be terminated, placing Transylvania under the protection of Lip√≥t(Leopold I). Transylvania pays a tax to Lip√≥t and the imperial army can enlist. In return, Lip√≥t promised only the maintenance of religious freedom. Transylvania became a de facto province not a quasi separate state with freedom rights but where the arbitrary of the king or the army what was matter. Mih√°ly Apafi died in 1690, II. However, Suleiman did not confirm Apafi Jr.'s ferman of 1681, but sent an athname to Th√∂k√∂ly. In response, the Transylvanian orders asked Lip√≥t to confirm Apafi. The content of the ratification document was considered for a long time in Vienna, and according to Caraffahttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Caraffa's draft, Transylvania would have become a simple Habsburg province in exchange for ratification. The milder tone of the Diploma Leopoldinum is due to the fact that in 1689 Lieutenant General Donat Heisslerhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donat_John,_Count_Heissler_of_Heitersheim was defeated by Th√∂k√∂ly in the battle of Zernyestihttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Zernest , who was elected prince by the Transylvanians. The imperial army sent to relieve N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r had to be turned back against Th√∂k√∂ly in Transylvania, so in early October 1690 N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r was recaptured by the Turks with a short siege. In this crisis, Lip√≥t signed the charter, which left Transylvania's internal independence. Until his adulthood, Apafi set up a gubernium (governorate) in which the Transylvanian orders elect the governor, Lip√≥t only confirms the election.

The diocese was also re-established despite the fact that the former episcopal property had long been secularized. However, some churches and schools, as well as other property issues, remained unresolved. According to the Diploma Leopoldinum, if the gubernium is unable to perform the tasks assigned to it, the Viennese court will decide for them. Therefore, a supplementary diploma was issued on 9 April 1693, according to which (also quoted *1 All 4 established religions are freely practiced; the property of the churches remains intact. *2 For Catholics, hand over the Cluj-Napoca ref. church and the dormitory of the Unitarians, as well as the sheer church of Krist√≥f B√°thory in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, and Cluj-Napoca will be redeemed for them for 15,000 frt. *3 The Majesty shall ensure that the cat. young people should be brought up by trustworthy ecclesiastical persons, as well as that Catholics have an apostolic vicar suitable for the performance of their episcopal duties. *4 Catholics, without prejudice to other religions, are free to build churches anywhere in their home. On May 14, 1693, another document was issued, which, because it was a response to the submissions of P√©ter Alvinczi, the instructed ambassador of the Transylvanian orders, was commonly referred to as the Alvincziana resolution. *The government resolved several issues, including Saxon complaints about fair taxation, but other unresolved issues remained, such as those of the Jesuits. The Catholics also demanded the restoration of monastic orders, but Transylvania refused to release the Jesuits. Eventually, B√°nffy allowed their return by direct imperial order. About religious and nationality reasons The Leopold Diploma of 1691, promulgated by Emperor Leopold I on December 4, 1691, was the act by which the Principality of Transylvania was directly subordinated to the Court of Vienna following military and political successes against the Ottoman Empire, which from 1541(or 1529 by Zapolya) until once held political suzerainty over the principality. At the base of the Leopoldine Diploma of 1691 is the Treaty of Vienna of 1686 (Hallerian Treaty), by which Transylvania was placed under the protection of Vienna, which recognized Michael Apafi II as prince. At the same time, the Ottoman High Gate appointed Emeric Th√∂k√∂ly as prince of Transylvania. Through the Leopoldine Diploma of 1691, Transylvania obtained a separate political status from that of the Kingdom of Hungary, of which it was a part before the Ottoman occupation. The legislation of the Kingdom of Hungary (Approved, Compiled, and Werb√∂czi's Code) remained in force, and the privileges of the nobility, the Saxons, and the Szeklers were recognized by the emperor. In religious matters, the provisions of the Edict of Torda of 1568, which proclaimed freedom of conscience and religious tolerance, with four prescribed confessions, as opposed to the decisions of the Diet of Pozsony of 1608 and 1647 (valid in Hungary), where they were recognized only three confessions (the Roman, the Augustan and the Swiss denominations). In Transylvania there is the fourth received confession, namely that of the Unitarian Church in Transylvania. The practice of Greek religion, Zwinglianism, Anabaptism and Mosaic religion was tolerated in both Hungary and Transylvania. The anti-Trinitarian cult, received in Transylvania, had in Hungary the status of tolerated cult, like the four cults tolerated in Transylvania. At the same time, the Vienna Court used the religious union of the Transylvanian Romanians as an instrument for the dislocation of medieval autarchies, in its political effort to break historical monopolies. In this context, by the first Leopoldine diploma related to confessional matters of February 16, 1699, Emperor Leopold I recognized to the united clergy the same privileges as those of the Latin clergy, and the second of March 19, 1701, recognized all lay people - including peasants - who accept union with Rome, that they will no longer be treated as mere \\"tolerated\\", but will enjoy all \\"civil\\" rights. This imperial attempt to undermine the privileges of the nobles, the Saxons and the Szeklers could not be implemented because the Romanians were not at that time in a position to offer a consistent social elite. The hostility of the nobility (mostly Calvinist) towards the United Romanian Church came as a result of the perception of union with Rome as an instrument of Vienna's policy of overthrowing the political system in Transylvania, a possibility legally anchored even by the Diploma of 1691.

He represented the Hindus in the Bombay quadrangular and led Madras against Bombay in the final of the second edition of the Ranji Trophy. https://cricketarchive.com/Players/38/38230/38230.html The Bhatt Brothers The Bhatt brothers blossomed in to great cricketers from early ages of 13 to 16, when they joined wesley High school. Before long , they began to dominate inter-collegiate matches, hitting hundreds at will. They possessed the unique record of three brothers playing at the same time for MUC and Presidency Indians. All three Captained Madras in the Ranji Trophy Tournament. The three progenies who in due course left their imprint on the game. The eldest of the siblings Venkatramanujalu alias bhatt was known for his pyrotechnics, he was only right-hander among the three talented \\"Bhat\\" brothers was an all-rounder in cricket. He opened the innings for Madras, following the footsteps of his father who founded the Madras polo riders club. M. Baliah was the second son of the bhatt brothers , On two occasions in the presidency match, Baliah turned the match around to great victoryx. Against a Jackryder's XI attack that included Mc Cartney, Ryder and Ron Oxenham, Baliah was brilliant, treating pace and spin alike with an \\"audacious brilliance\\". C. Ramaswami, the youngest son of the Buchi Babu Naidu, was one of the two Indian \\"Double Internationals\\". Ramaswami was one of the members of the Madras team that defeated Mysore within a day in the inaugural Ranji Trophy match in December 1934. Career Baliah's aggression against Charlie McCartney 1935‚Äì36 Madras comprised four of today's states: Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala. In the First Presidency match of 1915, bBaliah remained unbeaten on 70 in a second innings total. Baliah's golden moment was against the Marylebone Cricket Club, England who toured India under Douglas Jardine in 1933‚Äì34. While the other members of the Indian Cricket Federation team quailed before the leading fast bowlers, his 36-run knock brought out all the richness of his batting and evoked unstinted praise from E. H. D. Sewell in the coloumns of the Times of India. Baliah, who captained the Indian Cricket Federation (ICF), saved the innings from being an utter rout. In 1935, when Baliah captained Madras in their match against Delhi, he was the guest of the Viceroy of india, Lord Willingdon. His 55 against the team led by Jack Ryder in 1936 was meritorious. Baliah Captained Madras in the Ranji Trophy finals in 1936 Baliah scored a superlative century in the Buchi Babu Memorial Tournament, playing for the Mylapore Recreation club against the Minerva Cricket Club. Hyder Ali, the versatile Hyderabad medium‚Äìpacer bowler, became desperate trying to contain Baliah's flow of strokes. Later, Baliah enhanced the day's cricket with two beautiful catches in the slips. About Baliah , P. N. Sundearesan, a cricketer and editor of Hindu wrote, \\"In October 1953 it would indeed be a hopeless task to put in words the sinuous grace of M. Baliah's skill off the field. His well-proportional figure dressed with an eye to style stood out and on it he ruled as a great benefactor distributing his charms lavishly. Baliah would play almost all the strokes in the game from the late cut to the leg glance and stamp every one of them with his genius.\\" Later life Baliah rode in hunt races, winning many prizes a good rider who won the South India Amateur Championship, held by the Cosmopolitan Club in 1940. In memory for contribution to Tamilnadu cricket, the Tamilnadu Cricket Association (TNCA) instituted a trophy after M. Baliah in revered memory awarded to the best collegiate cricketer in the state.

O'Higgins' PhD thesis has been described as \\"one of the most exceptional works in English legal literature\\". In 1959, O'Higgins became a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge and subsequently a lecturer, teaching constitutional law, administrative law, civil liberties and public international law.

Briggs, member of the clergy of The New Church, also known as Swedenborgianism. She was raised in the state of Maine and Newton, Massachusetts. Jean Briggs received her bachelor's degree from Vassar College in 1951. She then completed a master's degree from Boston University in 1960 and her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1967. In 1967, Briggs moved to the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador and joined the Department of Anthropology at Memorial University in St. John's, where she taught for 47 years. She was a student of Cora Du Bois, an American cultural and psychiatric anthropologist. In 1970, she published her best known book, Never in Anger: Portrait of an Eskimo Family, based on research conducted while living with an Inuit family along the Chantrey Inlet for 18-months during the 1960s. She documents the culture, language and practices of the family and the surrounding community in the book, which remains a landmark publication in the fields of ethnography and anthropology. By her own account, Briggs knew very few Inuit words when she arrived to conduct her research, \\"When I arrived in Chantrey Inlet in 1963, I knew only six words of Inuktitut: 'yes,' 'no,' ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know,‚Äô ‚Äòhave some tea,‚Äô 'have some more tea' and 'thank you'.\\" In 1988, Briggs published a second book, Inuit Morality Play: The Emotional Education of a Three-Year-Old. Her book won two awards, the Boyer Prize from the Society for Psychoanalytic Anthropology and the Victor Turner Prize from the Society for Humanistic Anthropology. Jean Briggs compiled a landmark, bilingual Utkuhiksalingmiut Inuktitut dictionary, which was published in 2015. Briggs had begun compiling Utkuhiksalingmiut Inuktitut words in 1970, ultimately gathering and preserving 34,000 words in the dictionary. Prior to its 2015 publication, no dictionary had ever documented the Utkuhiksalingmiut Inuktitut dialect. Several researches and colleagues from Memorial University and the University of Toronto joined her to create the dictionary, utilizing five grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). Briggs won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for Psychological Anthropology, as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of Bergen in Norway. She was also a Royal Society of Canada fellow. Jean Briggs died from congestive heart failure on July 27, 2016, at the age of 87.

It is an extinct relative of the contemporary paddlefish. History of discovery First described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1883, the first specimen consisted of an incomplete section of the fish's body and tail. In 1886, a partial skull was recovered by Cope. A nearly complete fossil wasn't recorded until 1980. This was due, in part, to the comparative rarity of the fossil as well as the similarities to other species found within the site. Classification A member of the family Polyodontidae, Crossopholis is most closely related to the American paddlefish. CrossopholisItalic text means \\"fringed scales\\"; a reference to the thousands of tiny (less than 0.5mm) scales which covered the body of the animal. Paleobiology The fossils of this fish are found in the Fossil Lake area of the Green River Formation. It is more commonly found in shallower deposits of the Thompson Ranch sandwich bed in the Northeast corner of the site than in the deeper midlake sediment deposits. As the species comprises less than .02% of fossils found in the formation, it is probable that Crossopholis spent much of its life in the connecting rivers that existed to the North. This is further evidenced by that lack of juvenile specimens found in the lake area. Crossopholis was a predator, with fossil evidence of it consuming small schooling fish such as Knightia eocaena. This is in contrast to the American paddlefish, which primarily consumes zooplankton. Research has indicated that the rostrum was an electro-sensory organ, similar to the function in extant relatives. This allowed it to find prey in poor lighting or murky water. With a maximum recorded length of 1.5m, it is smaller than its modern relatives.

Credit: Wellcome Collection Sir Alexander Haddow FRS FRSE (18 January 1907 ‚Äì 21 January 1976) was a Scottish physician and pathologist at the forefront of cancer research in the 1940s. He served as Director of the Institute of Cancer Research from 1946 to 1969. He was also President of the Universal Union Against Cancer. His most important discovery was the Haddow Effect, by which a carcinogenic compound can be used to arrest a cancer whose origin is an unrelated carcinogen.  Early life  Haddow was born on 18 January 1907 in Leven, Fife, Scotland to Margaret Docherty, daughter of a coachman, and William Haddow (d.1928) of Newharthill in Glasgow. His father and grandfather were coal-miners. The family moved to Broxburn, West Lothian where his father ran Green Tree Tavern, a small bar and hotel. At age 10, Haddow fell ill with scarlet fever and remained frail and introverted. By age of 11, Haddow also suffered from appendicitis. He was much impressed by the family GP, Dr Alexander Scott, who treated him on both occasions and became his role model. Dr Scott was known for his studies of skin cancers in the local mining population. Haddow attended Broxburn High School then he attended Broxburn Academy, winning the Dux Medal.  Education  In 1929, Haddow graduated with an MB ChB from the University of Edinburgh.  Career  Haddow was an assistant and as a Houseman to Prof Thomas Jones Mackie at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, also lecturing in bacteriology at the University of Edinburgh, where he became a full lecturer in 1932. The University awarded him with two doctorates (PhD 1937 and MD 1938). In 1936 he moved to London to join Ernest Kennaway's team at the Royal Cancer Hospital. In 1946 he succeeded Kennaway as Director of the Chester Beatty Research Institute, later renamed the Institute of Cancer Research. In 1958 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and in 1961 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, where his proposers were Alan William Greenwood, Robert Cruikshank, Richard Swain and George Lightbody Montgomery. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1966. In 1972 he retired to Chalfont St Giles. By this time he was almost totally blind due to diabetes, which also caused the loss of his limbs.  Personal life  In 1932, Haddow married Lucia Lindsay Crosby Black (d.1968), a medical practitioner. Their son William George Haddow was born in 1934. After the death of his first wife, he remarried in 1970 to Feo Standing, a scientific photographer. He gained two step-children. Haddow's suffered from diabetes and related blindness. On 21 January 1976, Haddow died at Amersham General Hospital in Amersham, England. He was cremated.

He composed them in Munich in 1902 and 1904. They were published by C. F. Peters in Leipzig in September 1904.  History and movements  The pieces are character pieces of medium difficulty, as a contrast to his major organ works. Reger had written such works already as a student in Wiesbaden. He turned to the organ in Weiden. On a request of the publisher Henri Hinrichsen of C. F. Peters, Reger composed 15 pieces in Munich in 1902. Peters published twelve in Leipzig in August 1902 as Zw√∂lf St√ºcke. Reger used the three still unpublished pieces (Fughette, Gigue, Intermezzo) and composed additional nine pieces in 1904, to form a similar set of works that can be played in sequence or individually. In Reger's lifetime, performers often combined movements from different collections. The twelve pieces were published by C. F. Peters in Leipzig in September 1904, in two books (Heft) of six pieces each. Reger dedicated the pieces of Heft 1 to Franz Grunicke, an organist in Berlin, and those of Heft 2 to Otto Burkert. The titles and keys are: # Pr√§ludium (Prelude), E minor # Fughette (Fugue), E minor # Canzonetta (Canzonetta), G minor # Gigue (Gigue), D minor # Ave Maria, D-flat minor # Intermezzo (Intermezzo), G minor # Scherzo (Scherzo), F-sharp minor # Romanze (Romance), A minor # Perpetuum mobile (Perpetuum mobile), F minor # Intermezzo, D major # Toccata (Toccata), A minor # Fuge (Fugue), A minor In the edition of Reger's complete works by the Max-Reger-Institute, they were published in volumes 5‚Äì7.

Pignalberi's beatification cause commenced under Pope John Paul II in 1992 after the late priest was titled as a Servant of God and he was proclaimed as Venerable on 3 March 2016 after Pope Francis confirmed her life of heroic virtue. Life Quirico Pignalberi was born on 11 July 1891 in Frosinone as the last of five children to the peasants Egidio Pignalberi and Caterina Proietti. He received his baptism on 12 July 1891 in the church of the Sacred Heart in La Forma ‚Äì a small district in Serrone. He received his Confirmation on 29 September 1893 at the age of two from Cardinal Angelo Bianchi. In his childhood while at school his teacher asked him to manage the classroom and left. Moments later a shot was heard and his teacher had killed themselves in order to avoid repercussions from Freemasons who had ordered them to assassinate King Umberto I. This had a profound effect on Pignalberi who decided to fight against the enemies of God where it was possible. Before the reception of his First Communion he decided to pursue the ecclesiastical life after a nun spoke about the dignities of such a life. Pignalberi joined the Franciscan Conventuals on 30 October 1908 in Zagarolo in Rome and made his religious profession on 14 November 1909 after the conclusion of his novitiate. He studied as the Pontifical Gregorian from 1911 to 1913 and later studied at the Saint Bonaventure institute that his order managed from 1914 until 1917. It was while he studied that he met and befriended Saint Maximilian Kolbe. He was ordained to the priesthood on 10 August 1917. During the onslaught that became World War I he worked as a medic on the frontlines (after being drafted) and after the war was stationed in Rome in 1920 as the rector of seminarians. He served as a novice master from 1925 first in Bagnoregio and then in the convent of San Lorenzo in Piglio where he served for almost five decades. He had been sent to a Franciscan house in 1919 in Capranica and then to Cave in Rome in 1920 before he was made as novice master. Pignalberi became a popular and sought after confessor and preacher who travelled across the region at the request of parish priests and bishops alike. He met with Maximilian Kolbe for the final time in 1937 when the priest returned from Japan to the Italian peninsula. The end of World War II saw him work for the reconstruction of communities and the search for lost or damaged assets as a result of the war. Father Pignalberi continued to cultivate a lifelong passion for repairing clocks and he liked to work with precision instruments and technologies that allowed him to craft and repair things. As such he participated in the European Exhibition of Cribs in Milan with an artistic crib that he himself made and received an award. In 1958 he took a pilgrimage to Lourdes. He travelled to Poland in 1971 in connection with the beatification of Maximilian Kolbe whom Pope Paul VI beatified and he visited the late priest's cell at the Auschwitz concentration camp. He suffered serious health issues as he aged and he was soon confined to a wheelchair though continued to work wherever it was possible for as long as he could manage to do so. He was admitted to the Hospital of Santo Spirito in Rome for pleurisy and then treated at a hospital in Anagni after he suffered from a fall at which point he was placed in a nursing home for greater care and rehabilitation. On 1 April 1979 he met Pope John Paul II who embraced the frail priest and recognized him as the last custodian of Maximilian Kolbe's life and works. Pignalberi died in 1982 at the nursing home of \\"La Francescana\\". His remains were interred in the Pignalberi plot in Frosinone but his remains were later re-interred on 30 March 1985 in the chapel of the San Lorenzo convent in Piglio. Beatification On 11 February 1992 the-then postulator for the Conventual Franciscans made a request to Bishop Dante Bernini of Albano to begin the cause of canonization for the late Pignalberi. The beatification process was set to commence on 27 March 1992 after the transfer of the competent forum from Albano to the Diocese of Anagni-Alatri. The diocesan process was inaugurated under Bishop Luigi Belloli on 20 June 1992 and closed on 1 July 2005 under Bishop Lorenzo Loppa. As the diocesan process took place he was proclaimed a Servant of God on 9 July 1992 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) to the cause. The C.C.S. validated the process on 9 February 2007. The Positio was taken to the C.C.S. in 2011 and passed onto consulting theologians on 3 February 2015 who voiced their approval while the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. also voiced their approval to the cause on 9 February 2016. On 3 March 2016 he was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope Francis confirmed that the late priest had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The current postulator assigned to the cause is Angelo Paleri.

Between 1925 and 1928 she sat as a Communist member of the national parliament (Reichstag). Life Agnes Jansen was born in Bardenberg, today a part of W√ºrselen, but then a small village to the north of Aachen, and close to the Dutch border. She attended school locally and then entered into domestic service. Sometime before 1905 she relocated to the economically dynamic Ruhr region and became an industrial worker. By this time she had been married twice, and had become Agnes Plum. 1905 was also the year in which she joined the Social Democratic Party. When war broke out in 1914 many party members opposed the leadership decision to operate a political truce, which in effect meant voting in the Reichstag in support of war credits to fund the war, and refraining from criticism of the government for its duration. Three years later, as economic destitution at home and industrial scale slaughter on the frontline mounted, and the threat of annexation from the east by an autocratic czarist government appeared less immediate, the SPD broke apart over the issue. In 1917 Agnes Plum was one of those who went with the breakaway faction which became the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). Three years later, when the USPD itself broke up, at the end of 1920 Plum was a delegate at the party conference at which a left-wing majority, of which she was a part, joined up with the newly formed German Communist Party. She was on the party's left wing. At this time Plum was living and working in the industrial Schonnebeck quarter of Essen, where she was also a member of the local council and, probably, of the regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\") in D√ºsseldorf. Within the local party leadership (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") she was leader in the women's section, also having involvement in the Roter Frauen und M√§dchen Bund (RFMB), the female section of the party's quasi-military wing. On 5 December 1925 Plum entered the national parliament (Reichstag) as the Communist member for D√ºsseldorf East. She entered as a replacement for her party comrade Artur K√∂nig who had been required by the party to give up his seat following financial losses for which he, as treasurer responsible for monies allocated to producing certain party newspapers, was blamed. There was no suggestion that Koenig had enriched himself personally, but a significant amount of money had nevertheless been lost. Plum remained a Reichstag member till 1928, but she was not re-elected at the next general election, and her sixtieth birthday, which she reached in 1929, appears to have put an end to any further high-profile political activity.

The first treaty included John, King of Denmark (Danish: Kong Hans) and Sweden. The other treaty dictated peace terms between the same King and the Free City of L√ºbeck. The rest was a formal demand to King Louis XII of France to settle his disputes with Pope Julius II. The original peace treaties are preserved in their entireties at the Danish National Archives in Copenhagen and at the Public Library of L√ºbeck. The French envoy Pierre Cordier's original report documenting his visit can be found in Malm√∂ and at the public library in Besan√ßon.  The peace agreements  = Denmark-L√ºbeck/The Hansa = The agreement between Denmark and L√ºbeck/The Hansa are written in Low German. It contains 17 points, the most important ones are listed here: * The damages suffered by both parties shall be deemed equal and all prisoners shall be released, * \\"vagabonds\\" shall no longer be kept at sea, meaning all privateering and hijackings shall cease, * confiscated property shall be released by both parties, * tolls in √ñresund shall be paid for by the Hansa according to the rules established by previous monarchs, * all in the kingdom (Denmark) and in the Wendish cities (the Hansa) shall have the right to free travel between each other, just like in old times, * citizens of [the] realm and cities shall have the right to freely maintain merchandise and trade wherever they travel, shall not be forced to sell or buy a certain good; they shall also have the right to carry their own goods on their person and travel wherever they wish; additionally, no new tolls or other charges shall be introduced. * Hostilities between the Wendish cities and the Dutch shall not lead to combat at sea (\\"the seas under Sk√•ne and Blekinge\\" and the Baltic Sea are mentioned), nor shall any hostilities endanger a monarch, * (The trading tax that apply to Hanseatic merchants in Stockholm shall be lowered from ten percent to five percent), * his Majesty and his dear son (referring to the Danish monarch and prince) in their realms and countries shall defend and protect \\"us and other Wendic cities\\", * earlier privileges shall be confirmed (by the king) and wishes of new privileges shall be presented \\"in a safe and comfortable location in Denmark\\", * no business (with the King) shall take place unless the Hansa approves of it, * the monarch shall not allow persons who rebel against us in their realms, * if a conflict were to ensue between the kingdom and the Wendic cities, both sides are to name four men each who shall together work out a peaceful solution. Swedish envoys, representatives from the Papacy and an envoy sent by James V of Scotland among others, were present at the signing of the treaty. In addition to the peace document, a letter which seems to have been kept secret was signed in Malm√∂. Its contents instructs the lone city of L√ºbeck to pay 30 000 Rhenish ducats to Denmark during a period of 12 years (2500 ducats per year). = Denmark-Sweden = The Dano-Swedish peace agreement is written in Danish and is not as detailed as the Dano-L√ºbeckian. The list of both sides' and foreign representatives along with their intents, is longer than in the Dano-L√ºbeckian, but the agreement addresses a meeting which is planned for the 24 June 1513 where 12 men from Denmark and Norway, and 12 men from Sweden shall decide whether or not Sweden will accept King John or his heir Christian as the true lord and King of the Swedish realm. If Sweden were not to accept, they should give King John \\"a sizable sum of money\\". How large this sum should be would be decided by the 24 men. If they would be unable to come to a unanimous decision, the Hansa would be tasked with acting as mediators.

Paris also was home to major expatriate writers from around the world, including Henry James, Ivan Turgenev, Oscar Wilde, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Leopold Senghor, James Baldwin, Richard Wright, and Milan Kundera. Few of the writers of Paris were actually born in Paris; they were attracted to the city first because of its university, then because it was the center of the French publishing industry, home of the major French newspapers and journals, of its important literary salons, and the company of the other writers, poets, and artists. A literary Emperor in Lutetia (4th century) Julian, who spent his winters writing in Paris Before Paris was Paris, while it was still Lutetia, a middle-sized provincial town of the Roman Empire, it was the home of an important writer and philosopher: the Roman Emperor Julian. The nephew of the Emperor Constantine, he arrived in Lutetia in February 358 at the age of twenty-five as commander of the Roman armies in Gaul. He was raised to the title of Emperor by his soldiers in 360, and thereafter spent his summers on military campaigns in different parts of the Empire, and his winters in Paris, in the Roman governor's palace on the Ile de la Cit√© where the Conciergerie is located today. His writings were mostly philosophical, largely criticism of the new religion of Christianity, which had recently appeared in Gaul, but he also wrote about nature, geography, and his philosophy of life. He was killed in battle against the Persians in 363; and later was given the posthumous title of Julian the Apostate by the Catholic Church.

One of the most important new schools was established on the left bank at the Abbey of Sainte-Genevieve; its teachers included the scholar Pierre Abelard (1079‚Äì1142), who taught five thousand students. Abelard was forced to leave the university because of the scandal caused by his romance with the nun Eloise. The schools trained not only clerics for the church, but also clerks who could read and write for the growing administration of the Kingdom. . In the 13th century there were between two and three thousand students living in the Left Bank, which became known as the Latin Quarter, because Latin was the language of instruction at the university. The number grew to about four thousand in the 14th century. In 1257, the chaplain of Louis IX, Robert de Sorbon, opened the most famous College of the University, which was later named after him, the Sorbonne.From the 13th to the 15th century, the University of Paris was the most important school of catholic theology in Western Europe, whose teachers included Roger Bacon from England, Saint Thomas Aquinas from Italy, and Saint Bonaventure from Germany. The teachings of the scholars, in Latin, were circulated widely, not only in France but throughout Europe. Erasmus also taught and wrote at the university, as did the religious reformer John Calvin, before he was forced to flee to Switzerland because his writings were considered heretical. The first illuminated manuscripts began to be produced by Paris workshops in the 11th century. At first they were created by monks in the Abbeys, particularly Saint-Denis, Saint-Maur-des-Foss√©s, Notre-Dame and Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s; the first recognized artist of the period was the monk Ingelard, who painted miniatures at the Abbey of Saint- Germain-des-Pr√©s between 1030 and 1060. As the Middle Ages progressed and the illuminated works became more valuable, they began to be produced by noted artists in workshops for the court and for the wealthy merchants. One notable example is the Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, made by Jean Pucelle for the third wife of Charles IV between 1325 and 1328, now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The first lnon-religious literary works, most romances, began to appear at about the same time, and were collected by the nobles and wealthy of Paris. The Roman de la Rose was the most famous of these works; four handmade copies made in Paris in the 1490s still exist. 16th Century ‚Äì Rabelais and Ronsard Fran√ßois Rabelais Pierre de Ronsard (1620 portrait by unknown artist) The most prominent Paris novelist of the period was Fran√ßois Rabelais (1494‚Äì1553) best known for his novel Gargantua and Pantagruel, which gave the word \\"Gargantuan\\" to the English language. He was admired by King Francis I, who protected him while he was alive, but after the King's death Rabelais and his works were condemned by the University of Paris and the Parlement of Paris, and he only survived because of the protection of high figures at court. He spent much of his life far from the city, but died in Paris. The most prominent poet was Pierre de Ronsard (1524‚Äì1585), from an aristocratic family of the Vend√¥me region. He settled in the Latin quarter, studied briefly at the College of Navarre, then became a Page to the Dauphin, the eldest son of Francis I. His first poem was published in 1547 by one of the many small publishing houses that had appeared around the University. He formed a literary circle with Joachim du Bellay and a group of other poets, and published a series of books of poetry on love and romance and a volume of erotic poems. The latter volume, Les Folastries, caused a scandal, and the Parlement of Paris ordered that all the copies be burned. Despite this (or because of this), Ronsard was a favorite of the Court during the reigns of Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III. He gave poetry-writing lessons to Charles IX. However, by 1574 and the reign of Henry III, as the wars of religion began, his poetry was less in royal favor. He continued to write peacefully within the Coll√®ge de Boncourt, attached to the Coll√®ge de Navarre, until his last days.Demeude, Hugues, Paris dans les pas des grands homes, L'Express Thema, October‚ÄìNovember 2015 Many of his poems had Paris settings; one poem from Sonnets pour H√©l√®ne, was set in the new Tuileries gardens, created by Catherine de' Medici: ::\\"Quand je pense √† ce jour o√π, pres d'une fontaine, ::Dans le jardin royal ravi de ta douceur ::Amour te decouvrit les secrets de mon coeur; ::Et de combien de maux j'avais mon √¢me pleine...\\" (When I think of that day when, near a fountain in the royal garden, enchanted by your gentleness.

Pierre Corneille was from Normandy, Descartes from the Touraine, Jean Racine and La Fontaine from Champagne; they were all drawn to Paris by the publishing houses, theaters, and literary salons of the city. The first literary academy, the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, was formally by Cardinal Richelieu on January 27, 1635 to honor but also to exert control over the literary figures of France . Writers knew that any published word critical of the King or court would lead their exile from Paris. This happened to one of the founding members of the Academy, Roger de Bussy-Rabutin, who in 1660 wrote a scandalous satirical novel about life at the court of Louis XIV, which was circulated privately to amuse his friends.Though it was never published, he was banished from Paris to his chateau in Burgundy. 18th Century File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) was Swiss, but became the most influential writer in Paris File:Nicolas de Largilli√®re, Fran√ßois-Marie Arouet dit Voltaire (vers 1724-1725) -001.jpg|Voltaire in 1724-25, spent most of his career in exile far from Pari, but returned to the city to die File:Schmidt Prevost.jpg|Antoine Fran√ßois Pr√©vost, the author of Manon Lescaut (1731) File:Les salons au XVIIIe si√®cle - Histoire Image.jpg|A reading of a work by Voltaire in the salon of Madame Geoffrin (1755) File:Laclos.jpg|Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, author of Liaisons Dangereuses Of the great French writers of the 18th century, the two most famous, Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, spent most of their careers far from Paris, either in exile or under strict censorship. Early in his career Voltaire had been welcomed to the salon of Madame Pompadour, and had been granted a government pension, which he did not touch for twelve years; the scholar and co-author of the first Encyclopedia, d'Alembert had been provided an apartment in the Louvre; and Rousseau had been feted and welcomed to the homes of the nobility. But under Louis XVI the royal attitudes changed. Voltaire very rarely visited Paris between 1760 and his death in 1784. Rousseau was allowed to return to Paris from exile only on the condition that he not publish any of his work. Nonetheless, the writing of both men was widely read, usually in clandestine editions, and shaped the ideas that led to the Revolution. In the first half of the 18th century, eminent French writers were invited to become members of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, but the Academy in practice served largely to glorify the royal family and to keep writers under gentle control, rather to stimulate innovation in literature. Neither Rousseau nor Voltaire were chosen; only one of the great Philosophes of the enlightenment, Montesquieu, was elected a member. His 1748 book The Spirit of the Laws, proposing a separation of powers between the executive, legislature and courts, had an enormous impact on political thinking outside France, especially in England and the United States. Despite censorship and restrictions, Paris was the leading book- publishing center of Europe, and provided books not only to France, but exported them to all the courts and aristocracies of Europe, where French was widely spoken. The plays of Voltaire, Pierre Beaumarchais and Pierre de Marivaux; the novels of Choderlos de Laclos (Les Liaisons dangereuses), Antoine Fran√ßois Pr√©vost (Manon Lescaut) and the poetry of Jacques Delille and √âvariste de Parny were read in all the major cities of the continent, as far away as Saint Petersburg. An important feature of the Paris literary world was the literary salon, where wives of the nobility invited their friends to their homes to hear readings of new books and to discuss literature, and, later in the century, politics. The first famous Paris salon of the 18th century was that of Madame de Lambert in her town house on rue Richelieu in 1710, followed by those of Madames de Tencin, Geoffrin, Du Deffand, d'√âpinay, Helv√©tius, and Necker. The Revolution brought an abrupt end to the literary salons, as the aristocrats were executed or forced into exile, and some of the most promising writers, including the poet Andr√© Chenier, went to the guillotine. The period of the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799) was not a good time for French literature. The most important poet, Andr√© Chenier, was sent to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror. His poems did not become well-known until after the Revolution. The Marquis de Sade had been imprisoned even before the Revolution for his scandalous writing. He was released during the French Directory, but under Napoleon he was sent to an insane asylum, where he died. Under Napoleon (1799‚Äì1815) Freedom of the press had been proclaimed at the beginning of the Revolution, but had quickly disappeared during the Reign of Terror, and was not restored by the succeeding governments or by Napoleon. In 1809, Napoleon told his Council of State: \\"The printing presses are an arsenal, and should not be put at the disposition of anyone...The right to publish is not a natural right; printing as a form of instruction is a public function, and therefore the State can prevent it.\\" Supervision of the press was the responsibility of the Ministry of the Police, which had separate bureaus to oversee newspapers, plays, publishers and printers, and bookstores. The Prefecture of Police had its own bureau which also kept an eye on printers, bookstores and newspapers. All books published had to be approved by the censors, and between 1800 and 1810 one-hundred sixty titles were banned and seized by the police. The number of bookstores in Paris dropped from 340 in 1789 to 302 in 1812; in 1811 the number of publishing houses was limited by law to no more than eighty, almost all in the neighborhood around the University. Censorship of newspapers and magazines was even stricter. in 1800 Napoleon closed down sixty political newspapers, leaving just thirteen. In February 1811 he decided that this was still too many, and reduced the number to just eight newspapers, almost supporting him. One relatively independent paper, the Journal de l'Empire continued to exist, and by 1812 was the most popular newspaper, with 32,000 subscriptions. Newspapers were also heavily taxed, and subscriptions were expensive; an annual subscription cost about 56 francs in 1814. Because of the high cost of newspapers, many Parisians went to cabinets litteraires or reading salons, which numbered about one hundred and fifty. For a subscription of about six francs a month, readers could find a selection of newspapers, plus billiards, cards or chess games. Some salons displayed caricatures of the leading figures of the day. The Restoration (1815‚Äì1830) Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand Victor Hugo in 1829 The dominant literary movement in Paris was romanticism, and the most prominent romantic was Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand, an essayist and diplomat. He began the Restoration as a committed defender of the Catholic faith and royalist, but gradually moved into the liberal opposition and became a fervent supporter of freedom of speech. The prominent romantics of the time included the poet and politician Alphonse de Lamartine, G√©rard de Nerval, Alfred de Musset, Th√©ophile Gautier, and Prosper M√©rim√©e. Despite limitations on press freedom, the Restoration was an extraordinary rich period for French literature. Paris editors published the first works of some of France's most famous writers. Honor√© de Balzac moved to Paris in 1814, studied at the University of Paris, wrote his first play in 1820, and published his first novel, Les Chouans, in 1829. Alexandre Dumas moved to Paris in 1822, and found a position working for the future King, Louis-Philippe, at the Palais-Royal. In 1829, At the age of 27, he published his first play, Henri III and his Courts. Stendhal, a pioneer of literary realism, published his first novel, The Red and the Black, in 1830. The young Victor Hugo declared that he wanted to be \\"Chateaubriand or nothing\\". His first book of poems, published in 1822 when he was twenty years old, earned him a royal prize from Louis XVIII. His second book of poems in 1826 established him as one of France's leading poets. He wrote his first plays, Cromwell and Hernani in 1827 and 1830, and his first short novel, The Last Days of a Condemned Man, in 1829. The premiere of the ultra-romantic Hernani (see theater section below) caused a riot in the audience.

The novel led to the restoration of the cathedral and other medieval monuments in Paris. In 1841, Louis-Philippe made Hugo a peer of France, a ceremonial position with a seat in the upper house of the French parliament. Hugo spoke out against the death penalty and for freedom of speech. While living in his house on the Place Royale (now Place des Vosges), he began working on his next novel, Les Mis√©rables. *Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand refused to swear allegiance to Louis-Philippe, and instead secluded himself in his apartment at 120 Rue du Bac and wrote his most famous work, M√©moires d'outre-tombe, which was not published until after his death. He died in Paris on 4 July 1848, during the French Revolution of 1848. * After writing several novels, in 1832 Honor√© de Balzac conceived the idea of a series of books that would paint a panoramic portrait of \\"all aspects of society;\\" eventually called La Com√©die Humaine. He declared to his sister, \\"I am about to become a genius.\\" He published Eug√©nie Grandet, his first bestseller, in 1833, followed by Le P√®re Goriot in 1835, the two-volume Illusions perdues in 1843, Splendeurs et mis√®res des courtisanes in 1847, Le Cousin Pons (1847) and La Cousine Bette (1848). In each of the novels, Paris is the setting and a major participant. * During the July Monarchy, the highly prolific Alexandre Dumas published The Three Musketeers (1844); Twenty Years After (1845); The Vicomte de Bragelonne (1847); The Count of Monte Cristo (1845‚Äì1846); La Reine Margot (1845); La Dame de Monsoreau (1846); and many more novels, in addition to many theatrical versions of his novels for the Paris stage. *Stendhal published his first major novel, Le Rouge et le Noir, in 1830, and his second, La Chartreuse de Parme, in 1839. Other major Paris writers of the July Monarchy included George Sand, Alfred de Musset, and Alphonse de Lamartine. The poet Charles Baudelaire, born in Paris, published his first works, essays of art criticism. The Second Republic and Second Empire (1848‚Äì1870) File:CharlesHugo.jpg|Victor Hugo was in exile on the island of Jersey during almost all of the Second Empire, but his works, including Les Miserables in 1862, were immensely popular in Paris.

The most famous Paris writer of the Second Empire, Victor Hugo, spent only a few days in the city during the course of the Empire. He was exiled shortly after Napoleon III seized power in 1852, and he did not return until after the fall of Napoleon III. The Emperor stated publicly that Hugo could return whenever he wanted, but Hugo refused on a matter of principle, and while in exile wrote books and articles ridiculing and denouncing Napoleon III. His novel Les Mis√©rables was published in Paris in April and May 1862, and was a huge popular success, though it was criticized by Gustave Flaubert who said he found \\"no truth or greatness in it.\\"Letter of G. Flaubert to Madame Roger des Genettes ‚Äì July 1862 Alexandre Dumas (1802‚Äì1870) left Paris in 1851, just before the Empire, partly because of political differences with Napoleon III, who was then Prince-President, but largely because he was deeply in debt and wanted to avoid creditors. After travelling to Belgium, Italy and Russia, he returned to Paris in 1864 and wrote his last major work, The Knight of Sainte-Hermine, before he died in 1870. The son of Dumas, Alexandre Dumas fils (1824‚Äì1895), became the most successful playwright of the Second Empire. His 1852 drama The Lady of the Camellias ran for one hundred performances, and was adapted by Giuseppe Verdi into the opera La Traviata in 1853. After Victor Hugo, he most prominent writer of the Second Empire was Gustave Flaubert (1821‚Äì1880). He published his first novel, Madame Bovary, in 1857, and followed it with Sentimental Education and Salammbo in 1869. He and his publisher were charged with immorality for Madame Bovary. Both were acquitted, and the publicity from the trial helped make the novel a notable artistic and commercial success. The most important poet of the Second Empire was Charles Baudelaire (1821‚Äì1867), who published Les fleurs du mal in 1860. He also ran into trouble with the censors, and was charged with an offense to public morality. He was convicted and fined, and six poems were suppressed, but he appealed, the fine was reduced, and the suppressed poems eventually appeared. His work was attacked by the critic of Le Figaro, who complained that \\"everything in it which is not hideous is incomprehensible\\", but Baudelaire's work and innovation had an enormous influence on the poets who followed him. The most prominent of the younger generation of writers in Paris was √âmile Zola (1840‚Äì1902). His first job in Paris was as a shipping clerk for the publisher Hachette, and later as the director of publicity for the firm. He published his first stories in 1864, his first novel in 1865, and had his first literary success in 1867 with his novel Th√©r√®se Raquin. Another important writer of the time was Alphonse Daudet (1840‚Äì1897), who became private secretary to the half-brother and senior advisor of Napoleon III. His book Lettres de mon moulin in 1866 became a French classic. One of the most popular writers of the Second Empire was Jules Verne (1828‚Äì1905), who lived on what is now Avenue Jules-Verne. He worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library. he wrote his first stories and novels in Paris, including Journey to the Center of the Earth !(1864), From the Earth to the Moon (1864) and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1865).

Victor Hugo was sixty- eight when he returned to Paris from Brussels in 1871 and took up residence on Avenue d'Eylau (now Avenue Victor Hugo) in the 16th arrondissement. He failed to be re-elected to the National Assembly, but in 1876 he was elected to the French Senate.http://www.senat.fr/senateur-3eme- republique/hugo_victor1354r3.html It was a difficult period for Hugo; his daughter Ad√®le was placed in an insane asylum, and he his longtime mistress, Juliette Drouet, died in 1883. When Hugo died May 28, 1885 at the age of eighty-three, hundreds of thousands of Parisians lined the streets to pay tribute as his coffin was taken to the Panth√©on, on 1 June 1885. On 1 June 1885, crowds line the streets of Paris as Victor Hugo's remains are taken to the Panth√©on. √âmile Zola was born in Paris in 1840, the son of an Italian engineer. He was raised by his mother in Aix-en-Provence, then returned to Paris in 1858 with his friend Paul C√©zanne to attempt a literary career. He worked as a mailing clerk for the publisher Hachette, and began attracting literary attention in 1865 with his novels in the new style of naturalism. He described in intimate details the workings of Paris department stores, markets, apartment buildings and other institutions, and the lives of the Parisians. By 1877, he had become famous and wealthy from his writing. He took a central role in the Dreyfus affair, helping win justice for Alfred Dreyfus, a French artillery officer of Alsatian Jewish background, who had falsely been accused of treason. Guy de Maupassant (1850‚Äì1893) moved to Paris in 1881 and worked as a clerk for the French Navy, then for the Ministry of Public Education, as he wrote short stories and novels at a furious pace. He became famous, but also became ill and depressed, then paranoid and suicidal, dying at the asylum of Saint-Esprit in Passy in 1893. Other writers who made a mark in the Paris literary world of the Third Republic's Belle √âpoque included Anatole France (1844‚Äì1924); Paul Claudel (1868‚Äì1955); Alphonse Allais (1854‚Äì1905); the poet Guillaume Apollinaire (1880‚Äì1918); Maurice Barr√®s (1862‚Äì1923); Ren√© Bazin (1853‚Äì1932); Colette (1873‚Äì1954); the poet and novelist Fran√ßois Copp√©e (1842‚Äì1908); Alphonse Daudet (1840‚Äì1897); Alain- Fournier (1886‚Äì1914), author of Le Grand Meaulnes (1913)- his only published novel-, who died on the battlefield in September 1914; Andr√© Gide (1869‚Äì1951); Pierre Lou√øs (1870‚Äì1925); Maurice Maeterlinck (1862‚Äì1949), a Belgian poet and essayist; the symbolist poet St√©phane Mallarm√© (1840‚Äì1898), who had a literary salon every Tuesday including the leading artists and writers of Paris; Octave Mirbeau (1848‚Äì1917); Anna de Noailles (1876‚Äì1933), poet and novelist; Charles P√©guy (1873‚Äì1914), killed at the front on 5 September 1914; Marcel Proust (1871‚Äì1922), born in the first year of the Belle √âpoque, completed in 1913 the first part of In Search of Lost Time, begun in 1902; Jules Renard (1864‚Äì1910); Arthur Rimbaud (1854‚Äì1891), the young poet with whom Verlaine had a passionate but disastrous affair; Romain Rolland (1866‚Äì1944); Edmond Rostand (1868‚Äì1918), author of the world-renowned Cyrano de Bergerac; Paul Verlaine (1844‚Äì1890). Paris was also the home of one of the greatest Russian writers of the period, Ivan Turgenev. The Irish playwright Oscar Wilde spent his last months in Paris, after his imprisonment in England and exile in other European cities. He wandered the streets alone, intoxicated and penniless. He died in the shabby Hotel d'Alsace (now called L'H√¥tel) on the rue des Beaux-Arts on the Left Bank, after pointing at the wallpaper and declaring \\"One of us has got to go.\\" (The same hotel was later the residence of another writer in Exile, Jorge Luis Borges). Wilde was first buried in the Cemetery of Bagneux outside the city; in 1909 his remains were transferred to Pere Lachaise Cemetery.

Marcel Proust was living at 102 Boulevard Haussmann, editing his most important work, In Search of Lost Time, which he had begun in 1909 but was not finished by the time of his death in 1922. It was finally published in 1929. Anatole France won the Nobel Prize for Literature for his novels and poetry in 1921; the philosopher Henri Bergson, won the Nobel Prize in 1927. Paris was the home of Colette, who lived in an apartment in the Palais Royal; of novelist Andr√© Gide, of the playwright-author-filmmaker Jean Cocteau, of the philosopher and novelist Jean-Paul Sartre, and his lifelong companion, Simone de Beauvoir. It was also home to a large community of expatriate writers from around the world. Ernest Hemingway, hired as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star, moved to Paris with his first wife Hadley in 1922 and made his first residence in a small upstairs apartment at 74 rue du Cardinal Lemoine. He remained until 1928, when he left with his second wife, Pauline. While there he wrote and published his first novel, The Sun Also Rises. Others in the literary expatriate community included the poet Ezra Pound, the writer and art patron Gertrude Stein, and the English poet, critic novelist and editor Ford Madox Ford. In 1920, the Irish author James Joyce received an invitation from the poet Ezra Pound to spend a week with him in Paris. He ended up remaining for twenty years, writing two of his major works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. After the war began, in late 1940, he moved to Zurich, where he died. The Russian √©migr√© Vladimir Nabokov lived in Paris from 1937 until 1940, when he left for the United States. Eric Arthur Blair, better known under his pen name George Orwell, lived in 1928 and 1929 on the rue du Pot de Fer in the fifth arrondissement, where he worked as a dishwasher in a Paris restaurant, an experience he immortalized in Down and Out in Paris and London. An important meeting point for expatriate writers was the bookstore Shakespeare and Company (not to be confused with the modern bookstore of that name near Place Saint-Michel), first located at 8 rue Dupuytren from 1919 to 1922, and then from 1922 to 1940 at 12 rue de l'Odeon. It was run by the American Sylvia Beach. Hemingway first met Ezra Pound here, and Beach published Jame's Joyce's Ulysses, which was banned in Britain and the United States. 1946‚Äì2000 -Existentialism and Expatriates File:Albert Camus, gagnant de prix Nobel, portrait en buste, pos√© au bureau, faisant face √† gauche, cigarette de tabagisme.jpg|Albert Camus (1957) File:Beauvoir Sartre - Che Guevara -1960 - Cuba.jpg|Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre meet with Che Guevara (1960) File:James Baldwin 37 Allan Warren.jpg|James Baldwin File:Marguerite Yourcenar.jpg|Marguerite Yourcenar The literary life of Paris after World War II was also centered in Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s on the left bank, where there was a large concentration of book stores and publishing houses. Because most writers lived in tiny rooms or apartments, they gathered in caf√©s, most famously the Caf√© de Flore, the Brasserie Lipp and Les Deux Magots, where the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and writer Simone de Beauvoir held court. Sartre (1905‚Äì1980) was the most prominent figure of the period; he was a philosopher, the founder of the school of existentialism, but also a novelist, playwright, and theater director. He also was very involved in the Paris politics of the left; after the war he was a follower (though not a member) of the Communist Party, then broke with the communists after the Soviet invasion of Hungary, and became an admirer of Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution, then of Mao-tse Tung. In 1968 he joined the demonstrations against the government, standing on a barrel to address striking workers at the Renault factory in Billancourt. The legends of Saint-Germain-des-Pres describe him a frequenting the jazz clubs of the neighborhood, but Sartre wrote that he rarely visited them, finding them too crowded, uncomfortable and loud. Simone de Beauvoir (1902‚Äì1986), the lifelong companion of Sartre, was another important literary figure, both as an early proponent of feminism and as an autobiographer and novelist. Other major literary figures in Paris during the period included Albert Camus (1913‚Äì1960), like Sartre a writer and novelist of the left but a vocal critic of Stalinism; Andr√© Maurois, Fran√ßois Mauriac, Andr√© Malraux and Marcel Pagnol. A new literary movement emerged in Paris in the 1950s, known as the Nouveau Roman, \\"the new novel\\", the \\"anti- novel\\", or \\"anti-romanticism.\\" Important new writers who emerged in Paris in the 1950s and 1960s included Alain Robbe-Grillet, Marguerite Duras, Nathalie Sarraute, Claude Mauriac, Michel Butor, Claude Simon, Henri Troyat, Maurice Druon, Marguerite Yourcenar, and Michel Tournier. Paris was also home for many notable international writers, including the African-American writers James Baldwin and Richard Wright, who found the city more welcoming than the U.S. in the early 1950s. The 21st century Several writers resident in Paris have distinguished themselves in world literature in the 21st century. Gao Xingjian, born in China in 1940, left his homeland in the 1980s after writing works which displeased the Chinese government. In France he became a prominent writer, playwright, and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2000. Other prominent Parisian writers include Patrick Modiano, the winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize for Literature, who was born in 1945 in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, and studied and made his literary career in Paris. Jean d'Ormesson, the senior member of the Academie Fran√ßaise was born in 1925; he is author of a long series of acclaimed autobiographical or partially autobiographical novels.

It is an Akkadian two-tablet composition dedicated to a woman's prognostication and is often considered a subsection or extension of the greater twenty-seven tablet work, Alamdimm√ª, concerning physiognomic omens in general. Synopsis The text as we now have it extends to around 265 lines based on the collation of four extant fragmentary exemplars. It seems to have been intended to draw a comparison between a woman's physical traits and her later, post-marital, personality, thus enabling a suitor to predict her suitability for betrothal.

Pope Francis announced its creation on 15 August 2016, effective 1 September 2016. It took over the functions and responsibilities of the Pontifical Council for the Laity and the Pontifical Council for the Family. It has responsibility \\"for the promotion of the life and apostolate of the lay faithful, for the pastoral care of the family and its mission according to God's plan and for the protection and support of human life.\\" History Pope Francis had announced that he intended to establish the new dicastery and replace two existing pontifical councils at the Synod of Bishops on the Family on 22 October 2015. The Council of Cardinals that he formed in April 2013 to advise him on the reform of the Roman curia had discussed the idea extensively and recommended it following a study by Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi, Archbishop emeritus of Milan. The statutes governing this new body had been approved on 4 June 2016. A revised statue was published on 8 May 2018, effective 13 May. It added to its mission promoting \\"ecclesial reflection on the identity and mission of women in the church and in society, promoting their participation\\"; specified at least two undersecretaries and no longer required organization into three divisions; and both developing \\"guidelines for training programs for engaged couples preparing for marriage, and for young married couples\\" and guiding the care of couples in unorthodox marital situations. As its first Prefect, Francis named Bishop Kevin Farrell of Dallas, Texas, whom Francis telephoned in May to propose his appointment before Farrell accepted it in June. He also appointed Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, President of the soon to be abolished Pontifical Council for the Family, to head the Pontifical Academy for Life and the John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family, which are academic centers associated with the new dicastery. Pope Francis instructed Paglia that the institutes' work should be \\"ever more clearly inscribed within the horizon of mercy\\" and that \\"in theological study, a pastoral perspective and attention to the wounds of humanity should never be missing\\". In 31 May 2017, Pope Francis named Schoenstatt Father Alexandre Awi Mello the Dicastery's Secretary. On 7 November he appointed Gabriella Gambino Sub-Secretary of the section on life and Linda Ghisoni Sub-Secretary of the section on laity. Both academics and laywomen, they became the highest ranking in the Vatican. In May 2018, Pope Francis updated the statutes of the Dicastery for Laity, the Family and Life, adding among other things a specific reference to the office's responsibility for promoting a deeper reflection on the role of women in the church and society. https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/pope-calls-dicastery-promote- reflection-role-women In April 2020, the Dicastery issued a letter calling attention to the plight of the elderly, especially during the coronavirus emergency.Wells, Christopher. \\"Covid-19: Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life calls for prayers for the elderly\\", Vatican News, 7 April 2020 While recognizing the necessity of appropriate health precautions, the letter mentioned alternate methods to address feelings of loneliness and abandonment. \\"The inability to continue making home visits has led to finding new and creative forms of presence.

History  The movement was founded on early 2012, adding up to more than 4000 supporters in the first week. They presented three candidates for the 2013 Chilean parliamentary election, winning one seat in the Chamber of Deputies, the former student leader Giorgio Jackson. They did not support any of the presidential candidates, although the majority of the movement decided to request the vote for Michelle Bachelet in the second round of the election. The same year, the movement elected their first National directive, led by Miguel Crispi and Sebasti√°n Depolo.

Built from 1912 to 1913, it is one of the oldest armories still standing in Minnesota and was the first one to be owned by the state upon its completion. It was designed in a restrained Gothic Revival style which captures a transition in Minnesota armory design from heavy, fortresslike buildings to the simpler designs of the 1920s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 for having local significance in the themes of architecture, military history, and social history. It was nominated for being an excellent example of Minnesota's pre-World War I armories, as well as for its early status, transitional architecture, and role in St. Peter as a center not only of military affairs but also social and recreational events. Origin The St. Peter Armory grew out of the Militia Act of 1903. The act laid out the circumstances in which the National Guard could be federalized, and organized the Guard like the regular army. In addition, the act provided funding for military training and the construction of National Guard armories. Eight years later a board to oversee armory construction in Minnesota was created. Three armories were to be built per year. The legislature eventually appropriated $15,000 for each new armory. The state shared construction costs with the host cities. Armories built before 1911 generally had been financed with city money and through private fundraising. The St. Peter Armory has a Medieval Revival-influenced design. A large number of the nation's pre-World War I armories were built in this style, which had fortress-like elements. It had been popular in armory design since the 1880s. In the 20th century, architects began moving away from the Medieval Revival style. Armories became less fortress-like and more civically oriented in their design. The St. Peter Armory has Medieval Revival, as well as civically influenced elements. It is an excellent example of the transition in armory design that was occurring at the time. The armory was designed by architect James F. Denson and built by Ole Fredricksen of St. Peter. Use St. Peter's Company K of the Second Infantry Regiment, Minnesota National Guard, was the first unit based at the armory. The unit served during the 1916‚Äì1917 height of the U.S.‚ÄìMexican Border War and World War I. After World War I the Minnesota National Guard reorganized. The Armory became home to Company D of the 205th Infantry Regiment. In the years between the World Wars the Minnesota National Guard was called to duty more than thirty times. During World War II the St. Peter unit was deployed to the Aleutian Islands. After World War II the Minnesota National Guard reorganized again. The St. Peter unit was designated a Service Battery of the First Battalion, 125th Field Artillery of the 47th Division. The unit was activated during the Korean War. The armory also served as a community center. Military clubs met there as well as the local American Legion post. The armory was one of the city's principal social and recreational facilities for about 65 years. Trade shows, conventions, sporting events, dances, roller skating parties, and educational activities were held there. The local National Guard unit eventually outgrew the St. Peter Armory. After World War II the size of guard units in the state expanded from an average of 66 to 135 men. In addition, the amount and size of military equipment grew. The Guard eventually replaced most of its so-called \\"60-man\\" armories like St. Peter's. The St. Peter Armory was used by the National Guard until about 1983 when a new armory was completed at the northern edge of the city. The former armory became a sales office for an athletic equipment manufacturer. The Armory was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. In March 2014 the property was for sale.

Biography  Nakhleh was born on May 8, 1974 to a Christian, Palestinian family in Israel. He currently lives with his Japanese wife and two children in Texas, and holds a U.S. citizenship (in addition to the Israeli citizenship). Nakhleh did his undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, earning a bachelor's degree in 1996. He earned a master's degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M; University in 1998, and a PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin, under the supervision of Prof. Tandy Warnow, in 2004. Nakhleh started his academic position at Rice University in July 2004, where he has been an Assistant Professor (2004-2010), Associate Professor (2010-2016), and a Full Professor (2016-current). As of January 2017, he serves as the Chair of the Computer Science Department. On July 1, 2018, he was named as the J.S. Abercrombie Professor of Computer Science.https://www.cs.rice.edu/news/nakhleh-vargas-named-endowed-chairs  Research  Nakhleh's research has been focused mainly on computational and statistical approaches to phylogenomics and comparative genomics under scenarios where the evolutionary history of the genomes is not treelike. His earlier work in this area focused on parsimonious phylogenetic networks: Networks that embed a given set of trees with the lowest number of reticulations, assuming all gene tree incongruence is due to reticulate evolution. He and his colleagues also applied similar approaches to language data to elucidate the (reticulate) evolutionary history of the Indo-European languages. Later, his work started focusing on statistical approaches, in order to account for other evolutionary processes that could be at play in genomic data sets, most notably incomplete lineage sorting. These approaches could be viewed as approximations of the multispecies coalescent with gene flow. Additionally, Nakhleh has done research on biological networks (modeling and evolution) and, more recently, on computational questions arising in cancer genomics. Nakhleh and his group have been developing PhyloNet,http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/~phylonet an open-source software package, implemented in Java, for inference and analysis of (explicit) phylogenetic networks.

He first appeared in Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy before starring in his own film Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial and its 2012 sequel Ultraman Saga. Introduced as an energetic, boastful, and stubborn warrior, Zero was sent into banishment by Ultraseven after his failed attempt to steal the Plasma Spark. Zero was trained under Ultraman Leo and was forced to wear the Techtor Gear. When Ultraman Belial returned to the Land of Light and steal the Plasma Spark, Zero redeemed himself by defeating Belial and retrieving the Plasma Spark, at the same time learned of his origin as the . Although he retained his hotheaded traits, Zero slowly went through character development and matured as his roles in the Ultra Series progressed. After helping to defeat Belial's invasion attempt in another dimension, he founded Ultimate Force Zero to protect the universe from evil threats and wiping out remnants of Belial's former army. Despite lacking a TV series of his own, Zero became one of the most iconic characters of the Ultra Series, becoming the main navigator of Ultraman Retsuden/Shin Ultraman Retsuden and made prominent guest appearances in New Generation Era series, notably becoming a supporting character in Ultraman Geed and was revealed in Ultraman Z to as a instructor to the titular hero. Ultraman Zero is voiced by , whose known for his role as Setsuna F. Seiei in Mobile Suit Gundam 00. In tribute to his voice actor, Ultraman Zero utters his pre-battle catchphrase, , which is based on Setsuna's infamous line, \\"I am Gundam!\\". In the English dub movies, he is voiced by Daniel Van Thomas. Character conception Movie producer Junya Okabe stated that Zero's involvement in Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy was to invoke the elements of a parent-child relationship. Ultraman Zero's title as \\"the son of Seven\\" laid a huge impact on the audience. The setting of Zero as Leo's pupil was made under suggestion of director Koichi Sakamoto incorporating elements of his favorite Kung fu films. His youthful and hot-blooded outlook is based on Joe Yabuki from Ashita no Joe while his fighting skills revolves around the combination of Ultraseven and Leo. In Ultraman Saga, a comical plot was suggested to the character as a new element and Zero's 5 meter-transformation is based on proposal made by VFX producer as part of an Ultra Warrior's relationship with humanity. Series main writer Otsuichi was dubious of Zero's involvement as part of the cast of Ultraman Geed, believing that he is a poor character but director Sakamoto managed to expand him by forming a senior- junior pair with the titular Ultra. Realizing that he is a powerful character, the director decided to include the destruction of Ultimate Bracelet as a handicap to Zero, which makes him all the more similar to Dan Moroboshi's situation in Ultraman Leo. His transformation style from Leito Igaguri was consciously modeled after Ultraseven's use of Ultra Eye. =Design= Ultraseven Ax, the initial draft of Ultraman Zero as photographed in a special event in Tokyo Dome City during 2010. Ultraman Zero was designed by Masayuki Gotoh under the initial draft name . The original design was based on a modernized variation of Ultraseven, being all-red in color and lacked a Color Timer. Due to how common the red color is among Ultra Warriors, blue was added as well to make him more attractive to new viewers. His mouth design is similar to Seven, but the whole face is composed of diagonal lines, and it has become possible to show different expressions according to the angle. Zero's suit was simultaneously made with Ultraman Belial, based on wetsuits with the materials shaped in a three-dimensional appearance. It was originally structured to fit the suit actor tightly in hopes of preventing wrinkles but was loosen a bit to increase mobility in Zero's actions. Although the mask was originally molded integrally with the head, Zero and Belial were structured out of plane. Because of the finalized design of Zero's head turned out to be different, his Zero Sluggers were forced to be redesigned after the first filming of Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy, thus making it bigger than the intended size. The LED emitters were placed at the center of his eyes, appearing in a similar manner to pupil. According to Ultra's Common Sense - Ultraseven, Ultraman Zero ver., the appearance of Zero's younger self is \\"suggested\\" to be identical to from episode 29 of Ultraman Leo. Designs of other forms were as follows: *Techtor Gear Zero: Originally dubbed as . Because of the difficulty in designing Zero, Techtor Gear Zero was made first to hide his original appearance. It was initially planned to have a sharp design but producer Junya Okabe proposed a daring appearance. Its suit is a separate molding from the original Zero while the orange tubes were portrayed to be able to expand and contracting itself. *Ultimate Zero: The Final Ultimate Zero configuration was taken from the original plan of having the Zero Sluggers into a bow instead of the Zero Twin Sword. In the beginning, this form is meant to be an armament than a mode change. The armor is designed after a pair of wings and its breastplate was meant to be worn on the left arm. Its relation to Ultraman Noa is a tribute to episode 7 of Ultraman, doing so in hopes of invoking the relationship of the Stone of Baraj to Noa. *Mode Change: Strong-Corona Zero and Luna-Miracle Zero, the two forms that appeared in Ultra Zero Fight were incorporated with elements from Ultramen Dyna and Cosmos. *Ultraman Zero Beyond: Masayuki Gotoh designs Zero completely different from any of his previous forms, this one only inheriting his face. The entire body was designed so as to not resemble Zero or even the components of the Ultra Capsule's Ultras themselves (Ginga, Victory, X, and Orb). Masayuki even decided to drop the idea of Quattro Sluggers, believing that said design is unfavorable but changes his mind after persuasion from Koichi Sakamoto. =Naming= Yuji Kobayashi revealed that the reason he named the character as \\"Zero\\" is to symbolize the \\"restart of Ultraman story from scratch\\". History =Galaxy Crisis Era= Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy Long ago, Zero was a young and powerful warrior, similar to Belial, and like him attempted to steal energy from the Plasma Spark. However, Zero was caught red handed by Ultraseven and the Ultra Brothers and was exiled, sent to be trained under the Leo Brothers in Planet K76. His training took place during Belial's second and successful attempted theft of Plasma Spark. Survivors of Belial's attack, Shin Hayata (Ultraman) and Mirai Hibino (Ultraman Mebius), considered recruiting Zero but Dan Moroboshi (Ultraseven) was against it, believing he wasn't ready. During his time training under Ultraman Leo, Zero was forced to wear the Techtor Gear armor that limited his movements and strength and befriended a Pigmon. After saving the Pigmon's life during a training session, Zero's actions proved to Leo and Ultraman King that he had matured and revealed to him his true origins as the son of Ultraseven, and when Seven stopped Zero from touching the Plasma Spark, he had saved Zero from following Belial's fallen path. Seven's Eye Slugger then landed at the training ground, Leo realized that Seven was calling for Zero's help against Belial at the Monster Graveyard, and King removed the locks on Zero's Techtor Gear. Redeemed and now freed from his armor, Ultraman Zero took off to the Monster Graveyard to confront Ultraman Belial, with his father's Eye Slugger. However Zero was too late too save his father, and Seven died from the exhaustion and injuries from his battle. Angered by the passing of his father, Zero proceeded to kill the remaining monsters of Belial's army in a mad fury before facing Belial and defeating him, however Belial quickly re-emerged as Belyudra. Zero tapped into the Plasma Spark's power, creating the Zero Twin Sword and decimated Belial with it. In aftermath of the battle, Zero returned the Plasma Spark to its position and reunited with his revived father. Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial During the events of The Revenge of Belial, an attack from a trio of Darklops prompted Zero to volunteer himself in an inter-dimensional exploration to track the source. He was given the Ultra Zero Bracelet by Ultraseven, which allowed him to transform three times in an alternate dimension and received help from residents of the Land of Light during the travel. Upon arrival, he fought against Legionoid armies on the Planet Anu and bonded with a local police miner named Run in order to save his life. However, Zero discovered that the man's consciousness was in comatose state, leaving the former in control of Run's body and took care of Nao, his younger brother. The two stowed away in the Jean-bird but was spared by Princess Emerana when they decided to help her search for the Shield of Baraj. Along the way, they met and allied with several factions that guide them towards the Shield of Baraj and helped out holding off Belial Galactic Empire's army. Upon arrival at Ultraman Noa's statue, Nao tried to install a shard piece he had to the shield but crumbled. With Belial's army approaching and the Planet of Mirrors shattering, Run saved Nao and Emerana at the cost of being captured and had his Ultra Zero Eye separated. The resistances arrived and Mirror Knight saved Run from Belial, allowing him to regain his Ultra Zero Eye and transformed into Zero. Both sworn enemies fought once more but Belial used all of the emeralds he stolen to transform into Arch Belial. Despite the resistant forces helping out as well, Zero died from the depletion of his energy while trying to shield Planet Esmeralda from Arch Belial until the hopes of the resistances of Belial Galactic Empire brought forth the spirit of Ultraman Noa, allowing him to revive Zero and grant him the true form of the Shield of Baraj: the Ultimate Aegis. Zero assumed Ultimate Zero form with it and destroyed Belial with the Final Ultimate Zero technique. In aftermath of the battle, he healed Run's injuries and left to form Ultimate Force Zero with the giant heroes he came across earlier. Ultraman Saga Zero still continued with his mission to wipe out the remnants of Belial's army and at that time, he was called into another Planet Earth by Shin Asuka/Ultraman Dyna, sensing a new threat in a form of Alien Bat. In that world, he discovered that the Earth's populations had mysteriously vanished and also fused with a dimensional-displaced Super GUTS member named Nozomu Taiga. Taiga himself had a hatred for Ultramen due to his past, which explained his reluctance to use Zero's power. Zero tend to act as the straight man to Taiga's antics and because of their lack of cooperation, Zero was incapable of summoning his full power, only appearing as a 5 m tall version of himself during their first transformation. Upon learning of Taiga's past and the latter deciding to overcome it, the two eventually settled their differences and finally being able to perform a successful transformation, joining forces with Ultraman Cosmos in facing Gigant Hyper Zetton and rescuing Ultraman Dyna. Although the three Ultra Warriors managed to destroy Gigant Zetton, Alien Bat made his final move by assimilating his ship into Zetton's corpse and form Imago Hyper Zetton. The monster was too much for the Ultra Warriors to handle and the monster quickly defeated them. While Dyna and Cosmos were forced to revert to their human hosts, Zero instead died once more but the three Ultra hosts managed to unite into Ultraman Saga and destroy the monster. In aftermath, Zero separated from Taiga and departed to space. In Ultraman Saga Super Complete Works magazine, Zero was mentioned to have visited the alternate Earth once more, with Anna of Team U wrote his arrival in her diary. Ultraman Ginga S Super Complete Works acknowledged that Zero's arrival on Team U's Earth is partly under orders from Zoffy due to the increasing negative energy of a Zetton (Hyper Zetton) in that dimension. Ultra Zero Fight Following his separation from Ultraman Saga, Zero gained the abilities of Ultraman Dyna and Cosmos, allowing him to transform into Strong-Corona Zero and Luna-Miracle Zero. Zero went to the Monster Graveyard to train and wonder about the purpose of obtaining such power. At that time, he faced of against Alien Bat Glacier and his army of revived monsters. Zero used his new powers to eliminate the monsters before facing the alien himself, now having absorbed the defeated monsters' souls. In the ensuing battle, Glacier used his life link to Pigmon as an advantage, forcing Zero to surrender until Pigmon's reassurance gave him the will to continue fighting, splitting himself into two bodies. Using Strong-Corona Zero he defeated Glacier and with Luna-Miracle Zero was able to purify the restless monsters' spirit and save Pigmon's life. In the end, Zero finally found the purpose of his powers before returning to his comrades. Shining Zero (above) and Zero Darkness (below), two of the miniseries-exclusive forms. In the second part, Zero faced off against the Darkness Five led by a mysterious benefactor. The Ultimate Force Zero held off the majority of their members their own while Zero faced against the Alien Mefilas Sly to rescue Pigmon. Later on, he faced the Armored Darkness, who was revealed to be his supposedly deceased enemy, Ultraman Belial. The two fought in a heated match but once Zero stabbed Belial with his sword, Belial quickly possessed Zero into , using his powers to assassinate the rest of the Ultimate Force Zero. The real Ultraman Zero was left powerless inside his own body, leaving Belial in control his body to lead the Darkness Five in their conquest. Pigmon tried to stop them despite its size but before Belial could kill it, his attacked mysteriously stopped. It was revealed that Zero's spirit had halted Belial from attacking or progress further. Within Zero's mind, fought Belial, bringing forth his strongest form, Shining Zero. With Belial expelled, Shining Zero regained control over his body and reverse the flow of time in the immediate area to undo the damages done by Belial and revive the Ultimate Force Zero. The act greatly exhausted him and was unable to recall earlier incidents but in the end joined his comrades in returning home as they tried to pick a new name for Pigmon. In the epilogue, it was revealed that Zero unknowingly resurrect Belial and Jathar from their deaths, the latter being his first kill in the second part of series in hopes of restoring the Ultimate Force Zero from their bronze petrifaction.

He appears to have hatred for carrots and in an aforementioned similarity, tends to act childish with Zero acting up as the straight man. During the 15 year anniversary of Asuka's sacrifice, Taiga participated in an aerial combat against a troop of leftover Sphires whom tried to attack the Mars Colony.

While originally preferring to watch Geed's battles from afar, his body occasionally taken by the impatient Zero and is forced to participate and assist the young warrior. During Zero's death at the hands of Galactron, Leito harbors a huge remorse for being helpless during that time until his new resolve allowed Zero to be revived and obtain the Riser to utilize Ultraman Zero Beyond. While fighting against Belial Atrocious, the injuries sustained from Zero was carried on towards Leito, forcing him to be hospitalized as Geed took over and emerged victorious. Leito and his family approached Zero for the last time before he return to his home world. Leito Igaguri was portrayed by and is named after the novelist Greg Egan. Yuta mentions that as a child, he always wanted to become Father of Ultra, yet his character transforms into Ultraman Zero.

They were very much working-class comedy, drawing on a vernacular, performative tradition, but at the same time their \\"Englishness\\" is characteristic of the kinds of satirical comedies found in the novels of Henry Fielding and Laurence Sterne. That earthy satire, based on everyday life, made these comedies unpalatable to middle class audiences but the Squibbs films were amongst the most interesting, and well shot, films in Britain in the 1920s.

He was a landowner, entrepreneur and inventor. He was Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Middlesex and Chairman of the Middlesex Quarter Sessions, a freemason, a radical politician and supporter of the great Irish statesman Daniel O'Connell. He was an early antivivisectionist and writer. Background John Lillie was the eldest son of Philip Lillie Esq., of Drumdoe Castle, Co. Roscommon and his wife Alicia, n√©e Stafford. One source gives his birth date as 1789. He was heir to properties in Roscommon, Dublin and Bath. The family were said to be related to the Duke of Portland through his mother, Henrietta daughter of General John Scott of Fife, but the connection has yet to be established. Burke, J. & J.B. The Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland, London: 1841, pp. 178‚Äì79. Lillie's sister, Alicia, married as his second wife, Hugh Mill Bunbury of Guyana; their daughter became a noted Carmelite nun, while their youngest son, Charles Thomas fought in the Crimean War and was promoted Colonel. Having completed his education, Lillie sought his fortune in the British army. On his return to civilian life, having been thrice wounded in the Peninsula Campaign, Lillie married Louisa Sutherland (b. 1791), daughter of Capt. Andrew Sutherland RN, Commissioner of Gibraltar and his wife Louisa Colebrooke, on 22 January 1820 at St. George Hanover Square, Middlesex. The Lillies had a daughter and three sons, the youngest of whom, George Arthur Howard, became a Buddhist while out in India as an officer.Burke, J. ‚Äì& J.B. The Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland, London: 1841, pp. 178‚Äì79. Military career Lillie joined the 6th Warwickshire Regiment of Foot in 1807 as an Ensign. The following year he embarked under Sir Brent Spencer in first expeditionary force to Portugal for service in Barbary, Cadiz and the Tagus. He joined the Lusitanian Legion of the Portuguese Army in the rank of Captain, when still only 19 years old, under the watchful eye of Lieutenant-General William Carr Beresford, who raised the famous √©lite corps of light infantry, the Ca√ßadores.Teixeira, Humberto. (2010) in Portuguese An Applied Analysis of the Cacadores Infantry Regiment in the Peninsular War annotated with illustrations for the Military Academy, Lisbon Having taken part in engagements in defence of Portugal, Lillie was promoted lieutenant in 1810. He fought at the Battle of Bussaco and took part in the retreat to the Torres Vedras Lines. In 1812 at the Battle of Salamanca, he was reputed to have personally seized the Colours of the 116th French Line Regiment during the struggle for Arapiles. As commander of the 7th Ca√ßadores, he led his troops into the Battle of the Pyrenees, Battle of Nivelle (1813), Battle of Orthez (1814) and finally, the Battle of Toulouse (1814), where he was gravely wounded (for the third time) and left for dead for 48 hours on the battlefield. He was awarded the Decoration of The Lily by the French. By the British he was awarded the Army Gold Cross, (later) he was honoured with the Military General Service Medal. In Wellington's army his progression was somewhat slow; he left the Peninsula Campaign in the rank of major and in 1816 he was knighted by patent. In the 1831 Coronation Honours, he was made a Companion of the Bath. Also that year, Pedro of Portugal, promoted him to the rank of Major General in the Portuguese Army. By the time he took formal retirement from the British Army, in 1855, he had attained the rank of lieutenant colonel with the commensurate pension. He left a record of his experiences in the war.Lillie John Scott A Narrative ... In the Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal, The entrepreneur and inventor 'the Hermitage' and Lodge c. 1840 Brompton Cemetery and Kensington Canal by William Cowen Still employed by the Army, but too disabled to serve and so on half pay, and recently married, he was received into the Prince of Wales (Freemasonry) Lodge (1923). On 'sick leave', Sir John sought to apply his energy and experience in London society. In 1822, he had bought 'the Hermitage', a grand villa once owned by the dramatist, Samuel Foote, with a fourteen-acre estate at North End, in the Parish of Fulham in the County of Middlesex.Fulham: Walham Green and North End British History online At that time, his new neighbours, the Edwardes and the Gunters were engaged in catching up with the canal boom and the burgeoning transportation revolution. Lillie, who was already a shareholder in the Hammersmith Bridge project,The New Monthly Magazine, April 1829, vol. XXVII, pp. 177‚Äì78. next became a major investor and actor in the Kensington Canal company, a scheme eventually bitterly opposed by Lord Holland. His strategy was to link the new Hammersmith river crossing with the village of Brompton, further downriver and closer to London. For that purpose, he donated some of his land in 1825 for a new stretch of public highway, joining Crown Lane and North End Lane to Counter's Creek (which was then being developed into the Kensington Canal), and the new canal bridge, built by Gunter. 'The Lillie Arms' public house built by Sir John Scott Lillie, 1835 To service the canal and wharf construction on land that are today's Langtry Place, Rickett Street and Roxby Place, he laid out two further stretches of unmade road either side of the new highway, named initially as the Richmond Road. The unmade roads were eventually called Richmond Gardens ‚Äì later Empress Place ‚Äì and Seagrave Road in Fulham.Stanford's 1862 Library map of South West London, showing 'Lillie's roads' and structures, note: Walham Green is erroneously referred to as 'Waltham Green' in the heading of the map section. Around 1830, he also built the 'North End Brewery' and tavern to the South of the highway, together with a maltings to the north on the shorter stretch, initially managed by a Miss Goslin.F√©ret, Charles (1900) Fulham Old and New, vol. III https://archive.org/details/fulhamoldandnew00frgoog pp. 20‚Äì22 To commemorate his development of the area and as its original freeholder, the 1835 tavern became known as the \\"Lillie Arms\\" (now renamed 'The Lillie Langtry', after the actress and mistress, among others, of the Prince Of Wales). The Fulham stretch of Richmond Road and the canal bridge were eventually renamed Lillie Road and Lillie Bridge respectively. The canal project was dogged by financial difficulties and was an ill-considered venture, whose time had passed. It eventually gave way to the railways, as first one track was laid along the canal, and in the 1860s that was filled in and a second rail track put down.The Kensington Canal, railways and related developments pp. 322‚Äì338 Survey of London: Volume 42, Kensington Square To Earl's Court. Originally published by London County Council, London, 1986. Sir John Lillie decided to leave North End in 1837 and moved with his family to Chelsea in the County of Middlesex, where he occupied 12, Cheyne Walk, a 'noble' Georgian mansion, to which he made major structural additions.Godfrey, Walter H. 'Cheyne Walk: No. 1', in Survey of London: Volume 2, Chelsea, Pt I (London, 1909), pp. 31‚Äì33. British History Online [accessed 14 October 2016]. From there, he moved to Kensington, probably in the late 1840s, where he remained to the end of his days. =Patent holder= During his lifetime, Sir John Scott Lillie took out upwards of 30 patents for all manner of improvements ranging from mechanisms for kneading dough, tilling fields, the chemical composition of stucco to propulsion engines on land and in the water. In 1836, he designed a power unit intended for propelling carriages and barges for which he was granted a patent.Sherwood, William Newton, Gilbert, and Piper, (1836) The London Journal of Arts and Sciences, and Repertory of Patent Inventions, Volume 8 His military background influenced his design of the 'Lillie Rifle battery' an early form of machine gun.F√©ret, Charles (1900) Fulham Old and New vol. II, p. 179. Aware of the challenges for transport caused by the transformation of open fields into industrialised areas, Lillie applied himself to the creation of durable street paving. He designed a system using layers of wood and asphalt to make it weather-proof and was granted a patent.Robertson, J.C. Ed. Mechanics, Museum, Register, Journal and Gazette 1 July ‚Äì 30 December 1843, vol. XXXIX, London: publ. James Bonsall. In 1863, he was a founding member of the 'Institute of Inventors' and took the chair at the first annual general meeting, styled as 'General Sir John Scott Lillie'.The Building News and Engineering Journal Volume 10, p. 401 The politician and activist While living in North End, Fulham, Lillie took up civic duties. He was swept up in the debate over parliamentary reform. In 1831, with the accession of a new king, he published a pamphlet about the redistribution of power in Parliament and the curbing of corruption in the electoral system.JSL. (1831) An Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress of Parliamentary Corruption, and of the evils arising therefrom; in order to prove the ... necessity of parliamentary reform. He was connected with the Whig politician, John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford.Escott, Margaret. In January 1835 Sir John Lillie stood for election as a burgess in the borough (constituency) of King's Lynn in the County of Norfolk, but despite loud support, he only managed to come third.Thew, John.

By John Thew Books.google.co.uk His Irish roots and connections led Lillie to an active interest in Catholic emancipation. He was a friend and supporter of Daniel O'Connell.Grant, James. Portraits of Public Characters, volume 1, London: Saunders and Otley, 1841, pp. 182‚Äì84. Haynes, Matthew. ed. Penny Catholic Magazine, vol.1. 1840. In his role as magistrate, Sir John intervened in 1840 in the matter of 'non-restraint of lunatics' at Hanwell Asylum, where it was reported that a lax approach was leading to self-harm by some patients. The matter was taken up in the press and in The Lancet.The Lancet 1840‚Äì41, vol.1, p. 759. [Books.google.co.uk] Even in advanced old age, Lillie took a stance against the cruel treatment of animals in experiments, witness his letter to The Lancet in January 1861. He was still writing to the press on the power of musketry in 1866. Sir John Lillie was widowed in May 1860, when his wife Dame Louisa died at Dover. He then married widow Elisabeth Hannah Carew on 26 June 1862 at the British Embassy in Paris. She survived him. See under Lillie, Lady Elizabeth Hannah, widow, (n√©e Clarke) He himself died at his residence in Norfolk Terrace, Kensington on 29 June 1868 and was buried at Brompton Cemetery, very close to his earlier efforts on behalf of transport development in Fulham.

The boat seems to have disintegrated and sank immediately, leaving passengers and crew in the water. Other craft were quickly despatched to rescue the luckless victims and Lillie, being a strong swimmer, assisted a nine-year-old boy who had been with the party and could not swim. They were both picked and taken to safety. For this act of bravery, Sir John Scott Lillie was honoured by the Royal Humane Society in January 1827. Bibliography * Lillie, J.S. and Mayne, William.

In the series, the titular character's body bonded with Daigo Madoka, a man who was a descendant of Super Ancient Civilization to fight against monstrous threats during the series' course. Tiga's case is regarded as a , due to his host Daigo controlling his body instead of Tiga being in control of himself. Following the destruction of the dark ruler Gatanothor, Daigo lost his ability to transform into Tiga, signifying that the ancient warrior's role on Earth was over. His own movie The Final Odyssey further revealed his backstory as an incredibly powerful evil Ultraman in the past known by the name until he defected to the light after falling in love with a human named Yuzare. During the run of the series, Tsuburaya Prods. celebrated the 30th anniversary of Ultra Series, by having Ultraman Tiga meet with an alternate version of the original Ultraman. Aside from that, Tiga's appearance laid a huge impact on the Ultra Series, as not only being the first Heisei Era Ultra Warrior, but also introduced the ability for Ultra Warriors to change their forms and appearances. Tiga himself enjoyed a huge popularity among fans and started to appear in succeeding media of the Ultra Series, either as himself (without proper explanation) or as an alternate reality version of the character. His series in fact won the Best Dramatic Presentation of Seiun Award in 1998. Ultraman Tiga's grunts were provided by during his series, who would later become the narrator of Ultraman Dyna, the succeeding series after Tiga. His grunts were recorded and recycled for Tiga's future appearances. During the movie Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey and Superior Ultraman 8 Brothers, his grunts were provided by Hiroshi Nagano, Daigo Madoka's actor. Meanwhile, his suit actors were in Multi and Power Type and in Multi and Sky Type. Character conception The design of Ultraman Tiga was meant to be a break from the traditional red colored Ultras. His proposed coloring was red, blue, purple and silver, a trend that would be passed on to succeeding Ultra Warriors of Heisei Era Series. Tiga's first archetypal design was made in a form of a clay statue by Marbling Fine Arts company. Two other prototypes were also submitted by said company, and in the end one of them was chosen as Tiga's default design. The other two statues were however incorporated to the story line as stone bodies of Tiga's past allies, who fought alongside him to protect the ancient civilization but unlike Tiga, their bodies were destroyed by Golza and Melba before Tiga's body would merge with Daigo. Also the original setting for the pyramid was supposedly to house five instead of three Ultras, with two statues being destroyed and the other two merged with Tiga to bestow him his Type Change abilities. The crystal on his forehead was meant as a trademark to reflect the sunlight along his crest during lighting effect. One of his NG design was recycled by Maruyama into Evil Tiga, an Ultraman that appeared in episode 44 of his series, who went rogue after a forced merger with his human host, Keigo Masaki. The very first suit to be made was the Multi Type, where it lacks peepholes for the suit actor and photography was taken by the Yomiuri Advertising for the promotional campaign. His Color Timer changes thanks to the built-in diode. His gold/silver striped Protector was crafted through die-cutting and due to the initial one had its color easily wear off, the new one has become part of the suit's fabric since the shooting of episode 5 and 6. In the original planning, Tiga's Protector (as well as the Tiga Slicer attack) was meant to be used as a removable boomerang. Unlike Showa Era series, Tiga's aerial combat scene was done with combination of Chroma key, doll props and CGI. According to designer Hiroshi Maruyama, the Spark Lence (Ultraman Tiga's transformation item) was designed by Bandai and denied any participation in its creation. Since the suit actors of Ultraman Tiga have different physique, his suit for each Type Change was produced twice and differently for them: *Due to being heavily trained in stamina, Koji Nakamura is assigned to portray the muscular and thicker image. Also because of said physique, Nakamura is well suited to portray Power Type and his proficiency in Kenp≈ç gives a sharp movement. There is also a variation of Sky Type suit made for Koji Nakamura, but it was never used in the series and only appear in the show's opening sequence. *On the other hand, Shunsuke Gondo has a sleeker body type akin to Bin Furuya, the actor of original Ultraman. He also portray the latter character in episode 49 as part of a crossover with Tiga. In Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey, the three newer forms that appeared in the movie, Tiga Dark, Tiga Tornado and Tiga Blast supposedly would have had their design separated from Tiga's Type Change forms. But because of time constraints, it was decided to simply have them recolored from original costume designs. =Naming= Tiga's name is the Malaysian language for the digit number 3, referring to Tiga's Type Change ability, which revolves around him changing into three forms. In episode 2 of the series, after Tiga first appeared, GUTS tried to find a suitable name for the giant. With sub-captain Munakata's suggestion being rejected, it was Daigo who gives the giant his actual name, which was accepted by the rest of GUTS' members. The rejected name Mountain Gulliver seems to be based on the 1726 Irish novel Gulliver's Travels. History =Ultraman Tiga= Ultraman Tiga facing against his final opponent, Gatanothor. 30,000,000 years prior to the series, Ultraman Tiga and two other Ultra Warriors were giants that protected the ancient Earth from countless catastrophes and numerous dark forces. With their deed done, the giants left their bodies as stone statues in the , while their essence departed to space. In the present day, two ancient monsters, Golza and Melba awakened and attempted to destroy the giant statues. GUTS members (under guidance by Yuzare's hologram) discovered these statues in the pyramid as well but during Golza and Melba's attack, one of the officers, Daigo, merged with Tiga's statue and reanimated the giant once more, fighting against Golza and Melba. Although Golza managed to escape, Tiga nonetheless killed Melba. Starting from that point, Tiga would return once again to battle against other monsters and alien threats, including a returned Golza and those who responsible for the destruction of the ancient civilization. At one point, Daigo/Tiga was brought into the past and met an alternate incarnation of the original Ultraman, joining forces to destroy the sealed monster Yanakagi. Near the finale, Daigo revealed his identity to Rena and Captain Iruma before facing against the great destroyer Gatanothor. The giant monster was too great for Tiga to handle and in the end, he was petrified into a stone statue. It was then the light of humanity was able to revive Tiga and turn him into Glitter Tiga, giving him the power to defeat Gatanothor and save the Earth. However, Tiga's victory came at a cost: Daigo was no longer able to become Tiga after the Spark Lence disintegrated into dust after his final battle. =Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey= Taking place two years after the series finale, this film revealed another part of Tiga's past: long ago, Tiga was one of the ancient giants to be swayed by the darkness and rose to prominence when several of the ancient giants corrupted due to the stresses of the civil war. He was considered to be the strongest of all Dark Giants in existence and had defeated many of the heroic Ultras in the past but after falling in love with a human named Yuzare, Tiga switched sides. He betrayed his own comrades and stole their powers for his own before sealing them as stone statues. In the present day, after TPC awakened the dark giants by accident, Daigo (who had lost his ability to transform and was about to marry Rena) was haunted by Camearra's dreams, for she was intent on luring him into R'lyeh and transforming into Tiga Dark. Although Daigo was forced to comply to their and thus, breaking Yuzare's protective barrier, Daigo refused to join them and in a similar fashion to the original Tiga, slowly regained his light by absorbing Darramb's strength and Hudra's speed before killing them. Facing Camearra in his partially restored light form, Tiga was on the verge of defeat until Rena appeared and provided assistance. When shielding Rena from Camearra's attack, this fully restored his light form but his actions of saving Rena (which is a sign of genuine love) had made Camearra even outraged and she turned into Demonthor, killing Tiga with relative ease until the remains of ancient giants revived him into Glitter Tiga to finish the monster. Although Daigo had returned to his normal life, what happened to Tiga is unknown as of his Dark Spark Lence was either retained or lost in a similar fashion to the original. As mentioned above, Tiga's grunt was provided by Hiroshi Nagano in conjunction with Daigo's speaking voice but when the movie was featured in episode 8 of Shin Ultraman Retsuden, Tiga's scene was re-dubbed with Y≈´ji Machi's grunts instead. =Ultraman Dyna= Although not appearing, the giant was mentioned and referenced several times in the series. Ultraman Dyna, the series' titular Ultra Warrior is considered by many (both in-series and by fans) to be a spiritual successor to Ultraman Tiga, due to sharing the similar ability to Type Change, and his combat style in Flash Type (his basic form) was near identical to that of Tiga's default Multi Type. =Ultraman Tiga & Ultraman Dyna: Warriors of the Star of Light= In this crossover movie, Tiga was summoned by the hopes of survivors from Queen Monera's attack after Ultraman Dyna was captured and killed by the villain. The giant rescued and revived his successor and they team up and saved the Earth from Queen Monera's reign of terror. After the battle, the two disappeared into glittering lights and Tiga gave Dyna his own light, therefore further cementing the latter as his official successor. In this movie, Tiga Multi Type demonstrated the technique called , combining his Zeperion Ray with Dyna's Empowered Solgent Ray. =Ultraman Tiga Gaiden: Revival of the Ancient Giant= Sometime in the past, the sorcerer Dogramagma threatened the peace of Sakimoria village with a giant Dog≈´ statue monster Degouf until Ultraman Tiga saved the village. In the present day, which took place 20 years after the end of Ultraman Dyna, Tsubasa Madoka (the son of Daigo and Rena) was involved in a time slip by the same sorcerer who tried to bring Jomonoid into the past, thus bringing Tsubasa by accident. When Tsubasa discovered a Spark Lence, he tried to transform, bringing forth the giant like his father but due to his incompatibility, Tsubasa wasn't able to fully utilize Tiga's strength, whose height was almost as half as the original with a shorter time limit. In his second transformation, Tsubasa as Tiga managed to destroy Jomonoid but was knocked out by Dogouf, another Dog≈´ monster made by Dogramagma until Amui realized his compatibility with the Spark Lence and used it instead, successfully bringing the giant in his full power and destroying both Dogouf and Dogramagma. With the battle ended, Tsubasa returned to his era and Amui became the Tiga Village's protector. =Subsequent history= *Ultraman Gaia: The Battle in Hyperspace (1999): Tiga and his successor Dyna were summoned by Tsutomu via the Red Sphere when Ultraman Gaia was brutally defeated by King of Mons and its servants, Basiliss and Sculla.

In the aftermath of Ginga's battle with Lugiel, Ultraman Tiga and other Spark Dolls were freed from their curse and return to space. In the Extra Episode, a copy of Ultraman Tiga's Spark Doll was utilized by Kenta again to fight Zetton, who was controlled by Dark Lugiel's former minion, Alien Magma. In the original plan, Tiga Dark was meant to be used by Tomoya's father instead of being a corrupted version of himself. **Ultraman Ginga Theater Special (2013): Ultraman Tiga's Spark Doll was briefly used by Hikaru in order to fight against Tyrant, who was \\"Darklived\\" by Alien Icarus.

However, when a greedy adventurer named Carlos Kurosaki stole the blue stone that was used to seal Zaigorg, the monster reawakened once more. Tiga's statue was scanned by Dr. Guruman of Xio, who planned to create his Cyber Card alongside that of the original Ultraman. Tiga was reawakened once more in the modern times when Yuuto's will to save his mother activated the Spark Lence, allowing Yuuto to use Tiga's power and join Ultraman X and the original Ultraman to fight against Zaigorg.

In certain situations, Daigo Madoka transforms by placing the Spark Lence in the same position as his chest before pressing the button and the Spark Lence's \\"wing\\" appendages form Tiga's Protector before forming the whole body. This technique was briefly shown transforming him into a human-sized Tiga, which was once used against the Alien Raybeak platoon.

In episode 43, the Spark Lence can respond to any nearby giant of light statues and was stolen in the following story by Keigo Masaki to merge with Evil Tiga.

Yuuto's bravely once more allowed him to become Tiga and repaired the X Devizer for Daichi to use again to become X before the two were joined by the original Ultraman and fight against Zaigorg's army. The device is nowhere to be seen after Tiga returned Yuuto to his mother and disappears. *: A variation that was summoned through the use of Ultraman Tiga's Cyber Card.

This was however enough to defeat Jomonoid in his second transformation before being knocked out by Dogouf. Nonetheless, the final enemy was destroyed by Amui, who managed to draw out the full power of Tiga. In aftermath of the battle, Tsubasa met Mahoroba for the last time and noted her similarities to his sister, Hikari, hinting that she may be his ancestor. He soon repaired the GUTS Eagle Alpha Superior and return to his proper timeline through unknown means. Tsubasa Madoka was portrayed by . His name was under suggestion by Hiroshi Nagano, Daigo's actor. =Amui= is an 11-year-old Sakimori villager and is the supporting protagonist of Revival of the Ancient Giant. He used the pronunciation when addressing himself and was given the headdress by Izare that would serve as an important plot to the story. Amui was the resident who discovered Tsubasa's crashed GUTS Eagle before saving him and had the other villagers nurse him to health. When Tsubasa was unable to fight as Tiga against Jomonoid, Tsubasa senses the link between himself and Tiga. He took up the bronze Spark Lence, which prompted him to transform into Tiga, successfully bringing out his full power and put an end to Dogramagma's tyranny. He was hailed as the village hero for his bravery but while trying to find Tsubasa, he discovered that the crashed GUTS Eagle Alpha Superior was gone, knowing that Tsubasa had returned to his proper time. Amui was portrayed by . He was originally the youngest actor to portray an Ultra Host until Yuuto Tamaki in Ultraman X The Movie would break his record, who also shared the same Ultra Warrior. =Yuuto Tamaki= is one of the characters in Ultraman X The Movie. He is described as an adventurous boy who aspires to become his mother's assistant in archaeological works. After Zaigorg was released and Xio were sent into Operation Hell No.3, Yuuto was left behind in the Lab Team's care. During that time, he provided them with several artifacts he found and among them was a petrified Spark Lens. When discovering that his mother was in danger, his desire to save her resonated with the Spark Lence, X Devizer and the blue stone that was used to seal Zaigorg. Seeing this, Guruman had Rui escort him to his mother, and the Spark Lence endowed him the strength needed to lift up a steel beam and save her. As Yuuto and Tsukasa were about to be trampled by a wall, the boy quickly raised the Spark Lence and transformed into Ultraman Tiga, simultaneously fixing the damaged X Devizer for Daichi to transform into X. After the battle, Tiga vanished and returned Yuuto to his mother, where she commended him for his bravery. Yuuto was portrayed by . In an original plan, his mother, Tsukasa was meant to use the Spark Lence instead due to her actress, Takami Yoshimoto being known for playing Rena Yanase in Ultraman Tiga before Kiyotaka Taguchi changed the plans. =Other hosts= *In Ultraman Ginga, Ultraman Tiga was transformed into a Spark Doll and was among those in Dark Lugiel's possession. It later ended up in Hikaru's possession, Ultraman Tiga would later be freed once Dark Lugiel was defeated, although another Tiga Spark Doll appeared certain times after the series: **During the Theatre Special, , the host of Ultraman Ginga used Tiga's Spark Doll to fight against Tyrant but as it seemed that he would be defeated due to his time limit, Tomoya summoned Jean-nine, assisting the Ultra Warrior in defeating Tyrant. **Tiga's original doll was at first was reanimated by Lugiel into Tiga Dark to attack both Hikaru and Tomoya before Taro moved them to safety. After Tiga Dark was defeated by Jean-nine, his doll was collected by Hikaru returning to its proper state. **In order to assist Ultraman Ginga in rescuing Misuzu from Gray's influence, Tiga's Spark Doll was used by to help delay Super Grand King while Hikaru tried to reach Misuzu. He would later use the Spark Doll copy of Tiga against Alien Magma and Zetton in the extra episode. **During the events of Ultraman Ginga Theater Special: Ultra Monster ‚òÜ Hero Battle Royal!, Tiga's Spark Doll was among the copies which created when Tomoya's sketchbook of Ultra Monsters radiated by strange cosmic waves. would later use the Spark Doll when playing with her comrades but later participated in a fight against a group of five evil Ultramen, facing Evil Tiga. Ultraman Tiga and the other fake Spark Dolls would later reverted into Tomoya's sketchbook once the effects of cosmic ray radiation dried out. Reception =Popularity= In 2006, a character popularity poll was launched in response to the 40th anniversary of Ultra Series. Based on Oricon's list, Ultraman Tiga was placed seventh in the list in according to the total of voters. He is ranked fourth place in by female voters and tenth place by of male voters. Five years later in the Ultra Series' 45th anniversary, Tiga was placed fourth in the popularity poll after losing to Zero (the first-place winner), who scored the first place and ranked first in 2013 with a total of 9369 voters. Tiga's host, Daigo, shared his surname Madoka with the main character of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Madoka Kaname. Because of this, the Japanese fandom (especially in the pixiv site) tends to illustrate Madoka with the Spark Lence and/or having her wearing the GUTS uniform. Ultraman Tiga is also one of the guest of honors in the annual Act Against Aids (AAA) charity concert in Japan, as the character himself appeared during the concert when the songs from his series were played. He was also present in an award ceremony when the Ultra Series was nominated by Guinness World Records as the series with most spin-offs and sequels. =Merchandise= Ultraman Tiga was released multiple times as soft vinyl dolls by Bandai. His first ULTRA-ACT figure (Tsuburaya's official toy- line of poseable action figures) was released on March 26, 2011 with Tiga Sky Type and Tiga Dark's figure was released on April 23 of the same year. In August 2014, Tiga Power Type was released, followed by a reissue of the original Tiga Multi Type, which was meant to coincide with the Blu-Ray release of Ultraman Tiga. There is also a promotion picture which featured the actual character playing his own ULTRA ACT figure. In 2015, two exclusive figure releases were made: first is the re-release of Tiga Power Type and Sky Type bundled in the same box and later in November 2015 for Glitter Tiga bundled with Camearra.

He succeeded his father Kirttivarman as the ruler of the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh). The inscriptions of his descendants suggest that he achieved military successes against the Paramaras, the Kalachuris of Tripuri and the ruler of Kanyakubja.  Military career  The partially illegible Mau inscription of Sallakshana's descendant Madana-varman appears to credit him with successful campaigns in \\"Antarvedi vishaya\\". Kalhana's writings suggest that Antarvedi was a name for the land between the Ganga and the Yamuna rivers, centered around Kanyakubja (Kannauj). Because of the fragmentary nature of the inscription, different scholars have interpreted it in different ways. Alexander Cunningham believed that Sallakshana's forces merely carried out a brief raid in this region. H. C. Ray speculated that Sallakshana fought with a Kannauj Rashtrakuta prince (possibly Gopala or one of his predecessors) before aborting his campaign. S. K. Mitra theorized that he unsuccessfully tried to capture Kannauj. D. C. Ganguly, on the other hand, proposed that the Chandelas defeated the rulers of Kannauj, which was subsequently ruled by the Gahadavalas. N. S. Bose theorized that the Gahadavalas invaded the Chandela territory; the military success mentioned in the inscription was Sallakshana's repulsion of this attack. According to R. K. Dikshit, the Ghaznavids under Masud III invaded Kannauj region during the reign and defeated the Gahadavalas and their Rashtrakuta feudatories. Taking advantage of this situation, Sallakshana may have captured Antarvedi. Sallakshana-varman is also mentioned in the Ajaygarh rock inscription of Kalyanidevi, the wife of his descendant Viravarman. According to this inscription, Sallakshana's sword \\"took away to the fortune of the Malavas and the Chedis. The success against the Malavas may have been a raid against the Paramara king Naravarman. The success against the Chedis (the Kalachuris of Tripuri) was probably refers to an expedition against the Kalachuri king Yashah-Karna.\\" An inscription of Jajalla-deva, the Kalachuri king of Ratanpur, dated to 1110s CE, states that he was \\"honoured like a friend\\" by the ruler of Jejakabhukti. F. Kielhorn identified this Jejakabhukti ruler with Sallakshana's father Kirttivarman. But V. V. Mirashi believed that this ruler was Sallakshana himself, because Jajalla appears to have imitated his copper coins.  Administration  The Mau inscription suggests that Sallakshana- varman was well-versed with arts and literature. It indicates that his father's chief minister Ananta continued to hold the post during his reign. Some sons of Ananta were also appointed to important posts, after having been tested by the king. The Ajaygarh inscription mentions another hereditary minister, Yashahpala of Gauda family. Sallakshana-varman issued gold and copper coins. Unlike the Chandela inscriptions, these coins mention his name as \\"Hallakshana-varman\\" (Srimat-Hallakshana-Varma-Deva). This anomaly can possibly attributed to inefficient minting, although the exact reason is not certain. A copper-plate inscription of his descendant Paramardi-deva mentions a place called \\"Sallakshana-Vilasapura\\". This place was probably named after Sallakshana-Varman, and is identified with the modern Pachar near Jhansi. Sallakshana-varman was succeeded by Jayavarman.

A self described feminist, she is known for her critique of American feminism, dominance feminism and left legalism, as well as her work on family law and the regulation of sexuality. She has also been a prominent voice in the public debate regarding sexual conduct codes on campuses in the United States in recent years, arguing against the broadening of the definition sexual assault and the adoption of the affirmative consent standard. She was the first expert on gender and sexuality in the legal system to receive a position at Harvard University and is the Royall law professor at Harvard Law School.  Education and legal career  Halley received a Bachelor's degree summa cum laude in English literature from Princeton University in 1974. In 1980 she earned a PhD in English literature from the University of California at Los Angeles, focusing on seventeenth century English poetry. Before pursuing legal education, she taught English for five years at Hamilton College as an assistant professor. Halley received her J.D. from Yale University in 1988, and then clerked for judge Gilbert S. Merritt Jr. at the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. She worked two years as a litigator for the Boston office of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, before joining the Stanford Law School. She taught at Stanford from 1991 until 2000, and then joined the Harvard law school. In 2006 she was appointed to the Royall chair in the institution.  Research and academic activity  Halley has written on a wide variety of issues, but is widely known for her criticism of left legalism, radical dominance feminist thought and cultural feminism. She argues that left legal identitarian projects, such as feminist ones, have \\"bestowed sacred cow status\\" on certain reforms and deployed \\"identity-based claims in the form of rights, supposedly trumping all competing normative claims\\". Such legal projects, according to her, include, among others, affirmative action, sexual harassment and racial justice legal reforms. Much of her critical writing is directed towards legal projects of dominance feminism and cultural feminism, branches of feminism which she says hold on to a self-perception of political powerlessness, despite gaining many achievements and influence in governance since the 1980s, especially in the legal realm. According to her, this self-perception prevents American feminism from examining social issues through other theories of sexual life and politics, such as queer theory and the knowledge-power theory of Michel Foucault, as well as making it difficult for feminists to acknowledge other just causes and harm to men. By focusing on legal projects and sanctions on issues such as rape, pornography and commercial sex, Halley claims radical feminism has adopted a sentimental and moralizing view of legal action, and created alliances with conservative and paternalistic male elites. She argues that seeking State-centered and legal solutions is a narrow point of view and many times an obstacle to finding pragmatic solutions to wide social problems such as sexual inequality, and that this approach often fosters weakness in the group it is trying to protect, enforcing traditional social norms of female fragility. In her book Split Decisions: How and Why to Take a Break from Feminism she calls to reexamine politics of sexuality by putting aside the feminist perspective, and to appreciate and learn from the splits and contradictions among different theories of sexuality. In the past Halley stated that she identifies increasingly with and as a gay man and published an article on queer theory under the name Ian Halley. In Split Decisions she described herself as: > A sex-positive postmodernist, only rarely and intermittently feminist, a > skeptic about identity politics, with a strong attraction to \\"queer\\" > revelations of the strangeness and unknowability of social and sexual life, > and a deep distrust of slave-moralistic pretensions to identity-political > \\"powerlessness\\". = Governance feminism = The term \\"governance feminism\\" was first coined in Halley's book Split Decisions and later developed it in several articles, defining it as the new muscular feminist organizational style of the \\"quite noticeable installation of feminists and feminist ideas in actual legal- institutional power\\". Examples of such power according to her are the numerous sexual harassment programs in educational institutions and corporations in the United States and the development of feminist expertise that is used by special offices on gender equality and Non-governmental organizations. The name of the term was derived from the similarities Halley and colleagues identified between the powerful network-like non governmental organization establishments that feminists adopted, and the law produced by the school of new governance. (The latter is a movement in governance aimed at problem- solving through public participation in deliberations, which is intended to legitimize governing and make it more efficient). Halley claims that governance feminism, led mainly by radical and cultural feminists, fails to acknowledge its will to power and the power it has acquired, and still views itself as the underdog through a theory of male domination and female subordination. She also points out a paradox in the fact that feminists work against male violence by envisioning solutions that are muscular and top-down in their power formation: > In Foucault's terms, they have not learned - they do not want to learn - how > to cut off the head of the king. They seek to wield the sovereign's scepter > and especially his sword. Criminal law is their preferred vehicle for reform > and enforcement; and their idea of what to do with criminal law is not to > manage populations, not to warn and deter, but to end impunity and abolish. The term is to be further developed in the forthcoming book Governance Feminism: an Introduction, to be published by Minnesota University press, co- authored by Halley, Hila Shamir, Prabha Kotiswaran and Rachel Rebouche. = War rape and international law = One of the key feminist legal projects that are subject of Halley's writing is the criminalization of rape in international law. Governance feminism, according to her, had many achievements in this area, mainly in the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, international criminal tribunal for Rwanda and Rome statute of the international criminal court, where a wide range of feminist legal rules were accepted. This has created what Halley names \\"the war rape antinomy\\": a dilemma among two separate feminist projects, one aimed at moving sex crimes higher up the hierarchy of the international courts' criminality, and the other at isolating sexual assault on women for separate prosecution. \\"To put it bluntly\\", Halley writes, \\"making rape visible contextualised sexual assaults in war ‚Äî while framing sexual violence as an independent predicate crime reclassified rape as war. The former placed the rape of women in visible proximity to the death of men; the latter exceptionalised the rape of women, detached it from other aspects of the armed conflict in which it occurred, and focused prosecution, conviction and punishment on rape alone\\". Through a close literary reading of the memoir A Women in Berlin, Halley raises several legal questions regarding the criminalization of rape. The memoir describes the efforts of a German women to survive the occupation of Berlin by the Red Army in 1945, and the widespread rapes committed by soviet soldiers. Halley suggests that a special condemnation of rape, which emphesises sexual crimes in war over others, may weaponise rape and make it a tool of war or a casus belli. She also draws attention to the possibility that the idea that rape in war is a fate worse than death, which is advocated by some feminist circles, has downsides. These include a tendency to classify some armed conflicts in which war rapes occurred as \\"wars against women\\", despite the clear suffering they have inflicted on men too. She urges for suspicion towards such comparisons in legal advocacy. = Sexual conduct codes on campuses = Halley has voiced criticism on the shift of policies at several higher education institutions enforcing the anti-sex discrimination law, Title IX, and was one of the leaders of the opposition to a new sexual conduct code at Harvard in 2014. She claims that at some campuses the requirements for conviction of sexual assault were loosened, and that this was influenced by dominance feminist ideas coming from the department of education office for civil rights and student movements. These changes, according to Halley, include allowing complaints on the basis of subjective unwantedness of the sexual conduct, and the disregard of the objective reasonableness requirement of the supreme court, which ruled that the conduct must be sufficiently severe or pervasive and to have a detrimental impact on the complainant in the eyes of the reasonable person. She also argues that the new requirements of affirmative consent in policies and procedures in some institutions, including Harvard, will foster a repressive and sex-negative moral order, and wrote that: > They will enable people who enthusiastically participated in sex to deny it > later and punish their partners. They will function as protective > legislation that encourages weakness among those they protect. They will > install traditional social norms of male responsibility and female > helplessness. Halley was one of 28 Harvard law school faculty members to sign a statement objecting to changes to the sexual harassment policy and procedures of the university in 2014. The statement claimed that the new policy and procedures \\"lack the most basic elements of fairness and due process\\" and \\"expanded the scope of forbidden conduct\\", so that it includes rules that are bluntly one- sided in favor of complainants. In a memo sent to her colleagues in Harvard, following the reform, Halley acknowledged a need to change the former \\"slipshod, dismissive and actively malign handling of sexual harassment claims\\", but warned that the new code threatens stigmatized minorities, lacks support for accused students and harms equal procedural treatment. In the following year after Halley and colleagues raised their concerns, the Harvard law school announced it will implement its own policy and procedures on prevention of sexual harassment, which unlike the general policy of the university, provides a lawyer to accused students and includes a separate adjudicatory panel to determine guilt, whose members are not associated with Harvard. Halley has visited several universities to share her ideas and views on changes to sexual conduct codes on campuses.  Criticism  Several feminist legal scholars have criticized Halley's work, and particularly her call to \\"take a break from feminism\\". In her book Reshaping the Work-Family Debate, Joan Williams writes that this call is \\"not a play date that women subjected to domestic violence, rape, impoverishment upon divorce, sex discrimination at work, and other subjects at the center of feminism would care to attend\\". Williams argues that Halley's work is focused more on an assimilation-desire to resemble men, than on women's issues. She also hints that there is a connection between what she terms as Halley's \\"celebration of masculinity\\" and her position at Harvard, writing that \\"it is intriguing that Harvard has chosen a gender theorist who makes a name for herself by telling women not to make demands on men\\". Michele Dauber from the Stanford law school objects to Halley's claim that legal procedure is a potentially harmful tool which is used too frequently by feminists to regulate sexuality. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine she said that \\"The actual lived experience of real women is that they often are the victims of sexual violence. It's absurd to say that it undermines women's agency to give them a tool to stop that bad thing from happening. People are suffering from harm, you provide them with a remedy, and somehow that's infantilizing? No, it's empowering.\\" Robin West criticized Halley's work on left legalism and named it part of a neo-critical legal movement. West argues that unlike the traditional critical legal studies, which suggested utopian possibilities of less alienated forms of existence, neo-critics such as Halley write against attempts to advance such possibilities, targeting the \\"expanded civil rights world, with its focus on the injuries sustained by various minorities, cultures, sexually harassed working women, disabled adults, and badly educated and learning-disabled children\\". She claims that Halley and her colleagues refuse to acknowledge human suffering and its causes as a subject for left- legal theoretical scholarship, and that this brings the new critical movement closer to libertarian goals that it might want to admit.

Like similar animal tales written a few years later by Thornton Burgess, her stories often carry a moral, hinted at in titles such as \\"The Thrifty Deer-Mouse\\". The \\"Among the People\\" books were illustrated by F.C. Gordon. Another of her series features the adventures of the three Miller children and a house called Pencroft, which was also the name of the summer home in Omena, Michigan, that Pierson built with her income as a writer. Personal life She married hardware store owner John Williams Smith Pierson in 1894, and they resided in Stanton, Michigan, in the early 1900s. They had a child who died shortly after birth, and they later adopted two sons, John Howard Pierson and Harold Dillingham. Their home on Lincoln Street in Stanton (built in 1904) is now a church. Pierson and her husband moved to Grand Rapids in 1930, where she resided until her death in 1952. Her papers‚Äîincluding story drafts, correspondence, and an unpublished autobiography‚Äîare held by the University of Michigan.

Thomas worked closely with them both in administering the region for the Crown, and became a significant player in the turbulent regional politics of northern England in the early 1450s, especially in the Neville family's growing local rivalry with the House of Percy. His wedding in August 1453 is said to have marked the beginning of the armed feud between both houses, in which Thomas and his brother John led a series of raids, ambushes and skirmishes across Yorkshire against the Percy family. Historians describe the feud as setting the stage for the Wars of the Roses, the dynastic struggle between the houses of Lancaster and York for the English throne, and Thomas played a large role in the Neville family's alliance with his uncle, Richard, Duke of York. Thomas took part in his father's battles, being present at the Battle of Blore Heath in September 1459, where he was captured with his younger brother John by the Lancastrians. As a result, he was imprisoned and later attainted along with his father, brothers, and the Yorkists at the 1459 Parliament of Devils. Being imprisoned, he did not share Salisbury's and Warwick's exile in Calais. On their return, however, the following year, he was released when Warwick and the future Edward IV together won the Battle of Northampton. When the Duke of York also returned from his exile and claimed the throne from Henry VI, it appears that it was Thomas who was personally responsible for informing the duke of the Neville's collective disapproval of his plans. Joining his father Salisbury, and York's army, which travelled to Yorkshire in December 1460 with the purpose of suppressing Lancastrian-inspired disorder, he took part in the disastrous Battle of Wakefield. The Yorkists went down to a crushing defeat; Thomas was killed in the fighting, and, alongside his father and uncle, his head was impaled above one of the gates of the city of York. Early career, knighthood and marriage Thomas Neville was the second son of Richard Neville (1400‚Äì1460) and his wife Alice Montagu, 5th Countess of Salisbury (c. 1406‚Äì1462), and was probably born soon after his elder brother Richard in 1428, and certainly by 1431. By this time, so historian Michael Hicks says, his parents had had a further two more sons after Thomas: John, and George, who was to have a career in the Church. His first mention in government records is in 1448 when he was appointed steward of the Bishopric of Durham by his uncle, Robert, the Bishop, receiving ¬£20 per annum from diocesan revenues. He became Sheriff of Glamorgan, on 24 March 1450, in which capacity he witnessed a charter of his brother, Warwick the 'Kingmaker', 12 March the next year, during the latter's dispute over the Despenser inheritance. Warwick also appointed Thomas to assist in the management of his Warwickshire estates, for which he received an annuity. Thomas Neville was knighted by King Henry VI, alongside the King's two half-brothers, Edmund and Jasper Tudor, on 5 January 1453 in the Tower of London, an occasion that Griffiths has called \\"an attempt to retain a loyalty [of the Nevilles] that had recently been strained\\". Thomas Neville was licensed by the King on 1 May 1453 to marry Maud Stanhope, the widow of Robert, Lord Willoughby and as such a wealthy heiress. Ralph A. Griffiths has suggested that the announcement of Neville's marriage was the immediate cause of the feud with the Percys. Maud was also niece and joint- heiress of Ralph, Lord Cromwell, one of the richest men in the kingdom, and who was involved in at least two feuds with powerful men at this time. Connecting his family to the Nevilles, it has been said, provided \\"a counterbalance to Cromwell's enemies\\". It was a marriage which cost him the massive sum of nearly ¬£2,000 in loans to Salisbury, and \\"the price the Nevilles could extract was a measure of Cromwell's desperation\\". Not only, says Griffiths, was any further Neville aggrandisement anathema to the Percys, but the new Cromwell connection gave the Nevilles access to the ex-Percy manors of Wressle and Burwell, which doubtless they still hoped to reclaim. Feud with the Percy family Stamford Bridge in 2006 The Nevilles were one of four major landowners in the north, along with Richard, 3rd Duke of York, the Crown (as the Duke of Lancaster), and the Percy family, who were the earls of Northumberland. York and the King, however, were effectively absentee landlords so any tension would have existed solely between the Percys and the Nevilles. By 1453, this tension seems to have spilled over into outright violence, with Thomas and his brother John actively seeking out the younger sons of the Earl of Northumberland (the hotheaded Thomas, Lord Egremont and his younger brother Sir Richard Percy) and their retainers. It was Thomas Neville's wedding party, returning from Cromwell's Tattershall Castle, that was attacked by Egremont at Heworth, York on 24 August 1453 as the Nevilles returned to Yorkshire with his new bride, by a Percy force of supposedly 5,000 men. There were to be further encounters before the Percys were defeated at Stamford Bridge on 31 October 1454, when the Percy brothers, Egremont and Sir Richard, were ambushed by Thomas and John Neville and subsequently imprisoned in Newgate. Final years In 1457, Neville was appointed Chamberlain of the Exchequer, along with a co-heir of Ralph, Lord Cromwell. Later that year his father and brother appointed Thomas their deputy on the West March, where they were joint Wardens. For this he received a salary of 500 marks ‚Äì which, R.L. Storey points out, was \\"less than a quarter of their official salary\\". A few months later, he stood as surety for his uncle William, Lord Fauconberg's good behaviour (whom Michael Hicks speculates may have been involved in piracy at this time). By 1459 the domestic political situation had descended into outright civil war; when the earl of Salisbury marched south from his castle at Middleham in September to join up with the duke of York at Ludlow, Thomas marched with him in a 5,000-strong army. On 23 September 1459, they encountered a larger royal force at Blore Heath, which Salisbury defeated, killing its leader, James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley. Thomas and John, though, were somehow captured near Tarporley, Cheshire, the next day. Hicks has suggested that this was due to their being wounded in battle and sent home; Rosemary Horrox on the other hand posits that they ventured too far from the main army in pursuit of fleeing Lancastrians. Attainted in the Parliament of Devils the next month, they were imprisoned in Chester Castle and not released until their brother Warwick was victorious at the Battle of Northampton in June 1460. Thomas Neville was appointed, jointly with his father, to Keeper of the Royal Mews as part of the Nevilles' policy of filling the positions of political importance with their own sympathisers.; Hicks has called it \\"decidedly a Neville dominated regime\\". He was immediately, on his release, appointed to commissions to arrest and imprison any who disturbed the peace, and received grants of Duchy of Lancaster estates at the same time. The remains of Sandal Castle, where Thomas Neville spent the last few weeks of his life, in 2008. When the duke of York joined them and claimed the throne in October 1460, the Nevilles were as set against his claim as every other member of the nobility present for the coming parliament. Thomas Neville appears to have been fundamental to Salisbury's resistance to York's claims: possibly with Warwick, it was certainly Thomas who met York at Westminster Palace (where he had evicted the King from his lodgings), and informed the duke that his position was untenable \\"to both lords and people\\"; According to P.A. Johnson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Bourchier refused to confront the duke of York, so on two occasions \\"Thomas Neville was sent instead\\". Two days later, on 13 October 1460, he again went to York: \\"whatever was then said is unknown, but Neville's mandate must have been both blunt and bluntly delivered\\". York acquiesced to a compromise. In the meantime, Lancastrian forces were regrouping in Yorkshire and raiding York's and Salisbury's estates and tenants. Thomas Neville accompanied them when they marched out of London on 2 December 1460 to restore a semblance of order to the region; they arrived at York's Sandal Castle on 21 of the month. It is possible that a Christmas Truce was arranged; in any case, nine days later, York, his son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, Salisbury, Thomas, and many of their closest retainers led a sortie in strength to attack a Lancastrian army gathered near the castle. Here, at the Battle of Wakefield, they went down to a crushing defeat, and Thomas died in combat, his father was subsequently executed, and their heads were displayed above the gates of York. His remains were removed from the Micklegate Bar after the Yorkists' decisive victory at the Battle of Towton three months later, and buried at the Dominican Priory in York. Along with his father, he was subsequently reinterred with his mother on her death in February 1463 in Bisham Priory.

It was operated by the Reading Company and owned by two of its subsidiaries, the North Pennsylvania Railroad and the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad. It formed part of the Reading's route from Philadelphia to New York City, used by the famed Crusader. The line was transferred to Conrail in 1976 and was split into the Neshaminy Line and Trenton Line. SEPTA continues to operate commuter trains to West Trenton as part of its West Trenton Line.  Route  The North Pennsylvania Railroad portion began at Jenkintown, where it split from the Bethlehem Branch. The line ran west-northwest through Montgomery County and Bucks County, eventually crossing the Delaware River at West Trenton, New Jersey. At the middle of the bridge, Delaware and Bound Brook ownership began. The line continued northwest into New Jersey to Bound Brook Junction, where it joined the Central of New Jersey Railroad's main line.  History  The New York Branch was a cooperative effort between the North Pennsylvania Railroad, founded in 1852, and the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad, a new company and part of the National Railway scheme. The goal was to construct a \\"New Line\\" between New York and Philadelphia which could compete with the Pennsylvania Railroad. The North Pennsylvania extended its line north from Jenkintown to Yardley, on the Delaware River, while the Delaware and Bound Brook constructed a new line from West Trenton to Bound Brook, New Jersey, where it joined the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The line opened for through traffic on May 1, 1876, in time for the Centennial Exposition. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, forerunner of the Reading Company, leased the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad and North Pennsylvania Railroad on May 14, 1879, thus acquiring control of the \\"New Line\\" between Philadelphia and New York. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, involved in perennial disputes with the PRR, re-routed its passenger trains over the branch on October 1, 1880. The Reading electrified the New York Branch between Jenkintown and West Trenton in 1931; electric trains began operating from the Reading Terminal on July 26, 1931. The onset of the Great Depression forestalled further electrification. The Reading Company and its subsidiaries were incorporated into Conrail; the New York Branch was designated to Conrail as part of the United States Railway Association's \\"Final System Plan\\". Under Conrail the branch was split: the section between Neshaminy Falls and Bound Brook was combined with the New York Short Line, the Low Grade Branch, and the Richmond Branch to form the Trenton Line, while the section between Neshaminy and Jenkintown was designated the Neshaminy Line and is now owned by SEPTA. Conrail continued to operate commuter service under contract until 1983 when SEPTA assumed full control; passenger service north of West Trenton ended on August 1, 1981. SEPTA service between West Trenton and Philadelphia continues as the West Trenton Line.

Of Jewish Romanian background, he lived much of his life in the port city of Gala»õi, which provided him with poetic inspiration, but whose provincial life sparked in him intellectual revolt. Orphaned and leaving school at an early age, then diagnosed with tuberculosis, he found meager employment as a clerk, but, throughout, maintained confidence in his poetic genius. Nem»õeanu's Symbolism blended with socialism, but also with a lasting admiration for his adoptive Romanian culture, allowing him to publish pseudonymous work in traditionalist- antisemitic reviews such as Neamul Rom√¢nesc. He was also one of the Symbolists who frequented the Convorbiri Critice circle, becoming personal friends with its leader, Mihail Dragomirescu. Nem»õeanu was prolific as a translator of Weimar classics, German romanticists, and Yiddish literature, and then expanded his reach, learning French and contribution Romanian renditions of works by Charles Baudelaire, Tristan Klingsor, and Oscar Wilde. He continued to write despite his mounting financial problems, a bankruptcy audit, and recurrent hospitalization, even contributing a set of sanitarium-themed elegies. Sponsored by his literary friends, he survived through World War I, but died only months after the November Armistice, while recovering from surgery on his lungs. In its final stage, his Symbolism had transitioned into one of the \\"intimist\\" poems, unpretentiously versifying the rhythms of bland life, but on a progressively experimental pattern. Published by mainstream reviews such as FlacƒÉra, they were for a while the center of a literary controversy, attacked by the classicist Duiliu Zamfirescu, and ridiculed by the more radical modernists. Biography =Debut years= Nem»õeanu was born Benjamin Deutsch into a Jewish family, either in Gala»õiIrina Petra»ô, \\"Nem»õeanu Barbu\\", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, Vol. II, p. 214.

As reported by editor H. Fischer-Gala»õi, who was the poet's close friend, Barbu was \\"small and pale\\", with the \\"unfortunate heredity of a drunkard father\\".Guy, \\"Poetul Barbu Nem»õeanu. Amintirile prietenului sƒÉu Fischer-Gala»õi\\", in AdevƒÉrul, April 28, 1934, p. 2 Benjamin considered himself assimilated, to the point of espousing Romanian nationalism. As Fischer-Gala»õi recounts, Nem»õeanu stated that he felt jealousy toward natives and antisemites such as A. C. Cuza, because they could claim Romania as their country. After his father died prematurely, ca. 1901, Nem»õeanu was the family's sole breadwinner, finding employment as an office intern. He managed to attend high school in Gala»õi, his first published work appearing in the local weekly √énainte, in 1904, followed by contributions in the Bucharest review Dumineca.Podoleanu, p. 97 He continued to educate himself at night school although, by then, he was already showing signs of tuberculosis. An optimist, he believed that he would eventually be cured. Nem»õeanu also frequented the local literary circles of Gala»õi and Western Moldavia at large, befriending writers Avram Steuerman-Rodion and Ion Pribeagu, and later also Barbu LƒÉzƒÉreanu, Eugeniu Botez and Constantin Graur.Ionescu, p. 30 He wanted to achieve literary fame on his own, and organized a poetry festival with funds collected from the community of merchants and artisans. When one complained that the tickets were expensive, at 5 lei a piece, Nem»õeanu answered back: \\"pay 5 now or in two years you'll be paying 20 for my statue.\\" According to a 1921 note in Cele Trei Cri»ôuri, \\"dropped into a world of misery from his adolescent years, he took all that fate threw at him with the resignation of his kind soul and with a gentle smile‚Äîthat was often ironic, jaded‚Äîon his apparently serene face.\\"\\"Note. Barbu Nem»õeanu\\", in Cele Trei Cri»ôuri, Nr. 12/1921, p. 384 At Via»õa LiterarƒÉ, Ilarie Chendi published his translations from Friedrich Schiller.Gherghel, p. 286 He also sent some of his first poems to Cuza's political partner, Nicolae Iorga, who reportedly enjoyed them. Some were published in Neamul Rom√¢nesc, with Nem»õeanu hiding under the pen name Cire»ôeanu, followed by samples from Goethe's elegies in Floarea Darurilor, where he used the names Ion Corbu or Vasile Cr√¢ngu.Gherghel, p. 354 By then, Nem»õeanu was a reporter at the Gala»õi- based Tribuna LiberalƒÉ newspaper, then a clerk, putting out his own socialist magazine, Pagini Libere (\\"Free Pages\\"), in 1908. For a while, he lived in Ploie»ôti, and relocated his magazine there. When one of his Pagini Libere poems was panned in the Convorbiri Critice magazine, Nem»õeanu visited the editor Mihail Dragomirescu in Bucharest.Ionescu II, p. 31 They soon became friends, with Dragomirescu impressed, as he put it, by Nem»õeanu's \\"elegance\\" and \\"nobility\\"; Nem»õeanu became a regular of the affiliate circle, taking notes on how to improve his language and expand his range. =In Bucharest and Switzerland= Moving to Bucharest in 1910,Ionescu I, p. 31; III, p. 30 Nem»õeanu had a stint at AdevƒÉrul, where he mainly contributed to the humor supplement (using the pen names Barbu Exoticul and Germanicul Galitiensis). Rallying with the Romanian Symbolist movement, his poetry, signed Luca Zimbru, also saw print in Viea»õa NouƒÉ.Ionescu I, p. 31; Lovinescu, p. 225; Podoleanu, p. 97 His translations, original verses, prose, articles and reviews were also hosted in, among others, FlacƒÉra, Rampa, Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, Diminea»õa, Belgia Orientului, Floare AlbastrƒÉ, and in the socialist venues Rom√¢nia Muncitoare, Facla, Via»õa SocialƒÉ, and Viitorul Social.Ionescu I, p. 31; Podoleanu, p. 98 His pseudonyms also included B. Askenazi, I. Tedescul, and Tedesco.Ionescu I, p. 31; Podoleanu, p. 97 Nem»õeanu's first standalone book was Poezii alese (\\"Selected Poetry\\", 1910). This included his versions of seven Roman Elegies, as well as samples from Schiller, Nikolaus Lenau, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, and Heinrich Heine.Gherghel, pp. 354‚Äì355 It was followed by O cƒÉlƒÉtorie √Æn lumea albinelor (\\"A Journey into the Land of the Bees\\", 1911) and Stropi de soare (\\"Sun-drops\\", 1915). As noted by critic Irina Petra»ô, these placed him among the \\"troubadour and humorist\\" authors, illustrating a sentimental-ironic lyric verse. Nem»õeanu, she notes, bridged Symbolism with modernism. The poetry works were complemented by a volume of prose, undated, called Povestea unei idile (\\"History of an Idyll\\"), and by undated translations from Max Bernstein (Der goldene Schl√ºssel) and Paul Heyse.Podoleanu, pp. 97, 98 In 1911, under contract with Biblioteca pentru to»õi, Nem»õeanu produced a version of Hans Christian Andersen's Garden of Paradise.\\"CƒÉr»õi »ôi reviste\\", in AdevƒÉrul, May 10, 1911, p. 1 Also that year, Editura Lumen company issued a book comprising two of his translations from Leo Tolstoy: After the Ball and My Dream.\\"Efemeride. »òtiri literare\\", in Gazeta IlustratƒÉ, Nr. 1/1911, p. 16 At some point in this period, Nem»õeanu also went into business as a clothing retailer, but ended up overspending. Sued by his creditors, Fischer-Gala»õi claims that he was only spared bankruptcy by a sympathetic judge, who enjoyed his poetry. By then, Nem»õeanu's disease was interfering with his lifestyle, causing him to write in the supine position, on couches, as the only way in which he could prevent exhaustion. His friends and readers pooled their money and sent him to a sanitarium in Lausanne, where he arrived in November 1913.Ionescu I, p. 31; II, p. 30 For a couple of months afterward, he wrote at home to his female friend, Emilia Weissbluth, keeping her informed of his health. This correspondence ended abruptly, possibly because her parents rejected his marriage proposal.Ionescu II, p. 30 In Lausanne, Nem»õeanu learned French and began writing poetry in that language, producing scattered or undated translations from Tristan Klingsor and Oscar Wilde. His poetry took a more experimental and markedly modernist turn ca. 1915, when he published free verse with unusual imagery, becoming relatively famous for his metaphor of \\"chocolate cows\\".Iorga, p. 242; Lovinescu, pp. 224‚Äì225 The work, often taken up in the mainstream review FlacƒÉra, infuriated classicist poet Duiliu Zamfirescu, who used it as his focal point for a critique of modernist tendencies.Ionescu, p. 51; Iorga, pp. 242‚Äì243; Lovinescu, p. 225 Modernist colleagues, however, were also unsure about Nem»õeanu‚Äîperplexed by his mundane \\"bourgeois\\" subjects, rather than his poetic formats.Paul Cernat, Avangarda rom√¢neascƒÉ »ôi complexul periferiei: primul val, pp. 107‚Äì108. Bucharest: Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, 2007. The radical Symbolists at Chemarea parodied his railway themed poetry: the \\"victorious\\" lyrical ego visits the hopper toilet, reflects on whether defecation makes him lose weight, and (as a political statement) wipes himself on the Bukarester Tagblatt. According to literary historian Paul Cernat, this inversion of Nem»õeanu's themes is \\"the first scatological 'poem' in modern Romanian literature\\". =Wartime and death= Nem»õeanu's stay in Lausanne ended with Romania's entry into World War I, when his colleagues were no longer able to support him. He was forced to move closer to home, in the sanitariums of Bu»ôteni, then Moine»ôti. This period coincided with the battles on the Romanian front, during which Bucharest fell to the Germans. During the interval in which Romania sued for peace, and before the defeat of Germany, he collaborated with the literary newspaper Scena, put out in Bucharest by A. de Herz.Lucian Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\". Elita intelectualƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ √Æn anii Primului RƒÉzboi Mondial, p. 105. Bucharest: Humanitas, 2010. Eventually, Nem»õeanu checked into the Phthisiology Institute on »òoseaua Viilor, Bucharest,CƒÉlinescu, p. 709 where he was operated upon by »òtefan Irimescu, who hoped to stabilize his condition. He died on his hospital bed while recovering from surgery, from a severe pulmonary hemorrhage. He was buried at Filantropia cemetery under a marble column, with no inscription. As noted by Fischer- Gala»õi in April 1934, an unknown was still leaving fresh flowers on the grave. One of his late writings takes the form of a poetic testament, leaving behind to his unnamed child, conceived in a moment of \\"madness\\", no fortune other than his √©lan vital, and asking for forgiveness.C. V. Gerota, \\"√énsemnƒÉri. Poetul B. Nem»õeanu\\", in SburƒÉtorul, Nr. 9/1919, pp. 206‚Äì207 In fact, he was married to a Tony BƒÉnescu, who organized charities in his name and, responding to his explicit request, refused to accept money from the state. Nem»õeanu left numerous translations of Heine, many published in the Jewish community's Lumea Evree, appearing as Melodii ebraice in 1919. These Judaic-themed lieder were a sample of Nem»õeanu's other such work‚Äîhe was also a noted translator of Yiddish poetry by Eliezer Steinbarg and Iacob Ashel Groper. His manuscripts, including his \\"Sanitarium Elegies\\", were collected and preserved by LƒÉzƒÉreanu,Podoleanu, pp. 97‚Äì98 who also published a biographical notice in AdevƒÉrul Literar »ôi Artistic, May 1925.CƒÉlinescu, p. 1017 That issue also included a lyrical prose piece by I. Peltz, reflecting on Nem»õeanu's illness and death. A full corpus of his renditions from Goethe, Schiller, Lenau, Charles Baudelaire and Victor Hugo, as well as sampled early poetry of his own,Felix Aderca, \\"Revista cƒÉr»õilor. B. Nem»õeanu, Antologie\\", in SburƒÉtorul, Nr. 2/1926, p. 21 was first collected in book form posthumously, as Antologie (1926). The editor was Dragomirescu. Overall, however, \\"his oeuvre [remained] scattered just about everywhere, in various newspapers or magazines, without anyone feeling the imperious duty of collecting it.\\" A Barbu Nem»õeanu literary society and magazine existed for a while in the 1920s. In May 1934, Tony Nem»õeanu hosted in Gala»õi a festival honoring her late husband;Ionescu III, p. 30 her and Barbu's two daughters were by then locally famous as a vaudeville act at the Alhambra.\\"Surorile Nem»õeanu, fiicele poetului Barbu Nem»õeanu, care au fost angajate la Teatrul Alhambra\\", captioned photograph, in Realitatea IlustratƒÉ, Nr. 399, 1934, p. 7 The following year, Gala»õi poet Emil Maur authored a piece calling Nem»õeanu \\"one of the few whose names honor this city\\", claiming: \\"He died because he was a destitute poet in a well-off society, one which still won't comprehend its obligations toward the exponents of Romanian culture.\\"Ionescu III, p. 31 However, Nem»õeanu's Jewish origin resulted in a posthumous ban of his poetry, as ordered by the Ion Antonescu regime during most of World War II. Fascist censorship was defied by George CƒÉlinescu, who covered Nem»õeanu and other Jewish writers in his 1941 tract on Romanian literature.Rotman, pp. 174‚Äì175 Nem»õeanu's life and work were revisited during the late stages of Romanian communism by researcher Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu, as one of CrohmƒÉlniceanu's main contributions in Revista Cultului Mozaic. Such works marked CrohmƒÉlniceanu's return to his Jewish roots, and included memoirs of his own childhood in Gala»õi.Geo »òerban, \\"Prefa»õƒÉ\\", in Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu, Evreii √Æn mi»ôcarea de avangardƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ, pp. 28‚Äì29. Bucharest: Editura Hasefer, 2001. Work Beyond its rejection by Zamfirescu, Nem»õeanu's work was also given poor ratings by other critics of the period. Already in 1927, Eugen Lovinescu included him among the \\"troubadours\\" whose poetic matter was \\"perishable\\", \\"unacceptable in this day.\\" Lovinescu finds that only the \\"chocolate-cow\\" lyrics showed an ability to meet modernist standards, but that they came too late in Nem»õeanu's life.Lovinescu, pp. 223‚Äì224 The same was noted by Felix Aderca, Lovinescu's colleague, who divided Nem»õeanu's work into alive and dead \\"elements\\", noting that the classicist Dragomirescu had given undue weight to the latter. At his worst, Aderca notes, Nem»õeanu had embodied \\"the mediocrity of his age\\", \\"whatever was inevitable in the poetry of Carol Scrob\\". His Goethe translations were panned by the Germanist Ion Gherghel, who noted that they sacrificed meter and added imagery to the original text: \\"One can tell that Benjamin Deutsch, disguised as Barbu Nem»õeanu, is in over his head, his meager powers of no use here\\".Gherghel, p. 355 However, Nem»õeanu has also gathered favorable notice, in particular for his \\"poems in pencil, capturing the pathos of everyday life and of the tiny bourgeois provinces\\". In 1919, publicist Constantin V. Gerota confessed: \\"I had rarely seen such sincerity and so little gravitas, such little affectation [as in Nem»õeanu's poems]. Nem»õeanu was a jester in his poetry. He did not spend hour upon hour with his hand to his temple, only to produce the same as what others have said before him.\\" A \\"delicate, affable, intimate poet\\", he \\"had no great concept of life\\", but rather focused on \\"sentimental attitudes\\". Contrarily, Albert Honigman, the reviewer at Universul Literar, saw Nem»õeanu as a Romanian Heine, who, beyond a \\"note of sentiment\\" and a \\"delicacy of expression\\", poured conscious thought into his poetry.Albert (Honigman), \\"Ex-libris\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 15/1915, p. 7 Dragomirescu suggests the same, also noting that, had he lived to produce more works, Nem»õeanu could have entered a \\"realm of the great poetry.\\" Described as \\"the only real poet of family life\\", and a \\"gentle intimist\\", Nem»õeanu contributed fragments such as a humorous ode to Crasna‚ÄìHu»ôi railway. Included in Stropi de soare, and described as \\"flawless\\" by Honigman, it reads: Employing the same favorite setting, other pieces were darker, and show instances of Nem»õeanu visualizing his death: Various portions of Nem»õeanu's lyric poetry reference his home city. As noted by George CƒÉlinescu, they make Gala»õi a version of Bruges-la-Morte, \\"but preserve the atmosphere which slugs down all movements and the melancholy of industrial embankments\\". Some take the form of libel, expressing Nem»õeanu's desperation with its citizens' materialistic focus‚Äîaccording to Lovinescu, this is \\"rather more virile\\" poetry, but in a \\"format that cannot stand to the test.\\"Lovinescu, p. 224 Relevant lyrics include an apocalyptic vision of this \\"Sodom of the poets\\" atoning for its sins: Notes References *George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne de la origini p√ÆnƒÉ √Æn prezent.

A glacier in Novaya Zemlya, part of the Nordenski√∂ld Glacier Group, was named after him. Life After having attended the Naval Cadet School in 1902, Peter Novopashenny served as a naval officer on several Russian warships, firstly on the monitor Admiral Greig (Russian: –ê–¥–º–∏—Ä–∞–ª –ì—Ä–µ–π–≥) in 1903 and a year later on the battleship Sevastopol. In the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), he participated in the battle with the Japanese fleet in part. He fell into Japanese captivity, from which he was dismissed, however, after a short time. Thereafter he served on other ships as the gunboat Sivuch . In 1910 he graduated from the Nikolaev Naval Academy in St. Petersburg. Later, from 1913 to 1915, he commanded the icebreaker Vaygach () during the Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition.The Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition 1910‚Äì1915 From 1915 during World War I, Novopashenny commanded the modern Novik class destroyer Desna (Russian: –î–µ—Å–Ω–∞). In 1916 he became commander of the destroyer \\"Constantine\\" (Russian: –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω). For his services before and during the war, he was awarded the Imperial Russian Order of Saint Anna (Russian: –û—Ä–¥–µ–Ω—ä –°–≤—è—Ç–æ–π –ê–Ω–Ω—ã) for service (4th stage on 5 May 1904, 3rd stage on 12 August 1907, 2nd stage 12 November 1915). After the October Revolution, he served briefly in the Soviet Navy, and took in April 1918 under the Centrobalt in the negotiations between the German Navy and the Baltic Fleet in Helsinki in part that in Hang√∂ Agreement culminated. Shortly thereafter, he made a break with his Soviet expectant home and went into exile, first travelling to London and then in 1921 to Germany. In the spring of the same year, Peter Novopashenny became acquainted with the ten year younger German, Wilhelm Fenner, who was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia and who was also fluent in the Russian language. The two immediately hit it off. Novopashenny asked Fenner to help with the planned move to Berlin and confided to him that he successfully worked during the war as director of the Russian cryptanalytic service, breaking the ciphers of the German Baltic Fleet and he intended to provide his experiences to the German General Staff. That same year, he offered a course in cryptology and cryptanalysis to Wilhelm Fenner. Novopashenny worked diligently, often late into the night and after some weeks was successful; the cipher of the current Russian Military Attache was solved by Fenner. In autumn 1922, Novopashenny and Fenner officially started as an employees of the cipher bureau of the Reichswehr. Both stayed employed there for next two decades and continued working through the 1938 founding of the (OKW) High Command of the Wehrmacht, working within the cipher bureau, OKW/Chi. While Wilhelm Fenner eventually became Director (German:Ministerialrat (Min.Rat.)) of the Main Group B, while Peter Novopashenny ran the Russian desk and became a successful cryptanalyst, working on the cryptanalysis of Soviet radio traffic. After the ending of the war, he was arrested by Soviet secret agents in the town of Ringleben in Thuringia in Autumn 1945 and was detained and later interrogated until 1946 in Berlin. He died in 1950, in a camp near the Belarusian city of Orsha. References External links * German-Russian Treaty of Helsinki (English translation) signed by Novopaschenny.

Biography Chilingarian was born in Akhalkalak in Georgia's southern region of Samtskhe-Javakheti. After his studies in the Russian Secondary School in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, he continued his studies in universities in Heidelberg and Munich, eventually graduating from the Faculty of Law in Moscow. Politically active in the ARF, he contributed to a number of prominent Armenian publications like Mshak and Murdj. Pursued by the Russian tsarist authorities, he sought asylum in Constantinople in 1909 where he continued to contribute to the prominent Azadamard Armenian newspaper. In 1913, he moved to Germany and in order to avoid further suspicions from the German intelligence, he applied for a passport under the alias of Ruben Darbinian (in Western Armenian Roupen Tarpinian). Chilingarian continued using the new name from thereon until his death. In Berlin, he was a founder of the Armenian-German Society. In 1914, he returned to the Caucasus and resided in Tbilisi and Baku. He was editor of Arev in Baku from 1914 to 1916 and starting 1917 in Gordz, an Armenian monthly. In 1917, he became the secretary of the Armenian National Council that worked for the independence of Armenia. With the establishment of the Republic of Armenia, he moved to Yerevan and served as Minister of Justice of the First Republic of Armenia from spring 1920 until the collapse of the republic with the onslaught of the Red Army. He was arrested soon after during the purge of Armenian nationalists with the establishment of communist rule. Darbinyan was freed during the short February Uprising in 1921 against the communists, and soon after moved to Tehran, Persia and later to the United States, where he resided in Boston, Massachusetts, becoming the editor of ARF's Hairenik daily and monthly. He continued his activism and published memoirs and a number of studies documenting events in the First Republic of Armenia and the later Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic particularly under the Leninist and Stalinist eras.

It was founded in 1935 and was led by directors Nicholas J. Spykman and later Frederick S. Dunn, under whom there was also an associate director, William T. R. Fox. The institute was influential in the development of international relations theory; in particular, it was considered a bastion of international relations realism. The institute came to an end in 1951 due to a conflict with the university administration. Dunn and five of his colleagues left Yale and formed a successor organization, the Center of International Studies, at Princeton University that same year. Origins The Yale Institute of International Studies was founded in 1935 by several faculty members at Yale. Its first director was Nicholas J. Spykman, who organized the new entity, and the other founding members were Arnold Wolfers and Frederick S. Dunn. Dunn later wrote that the timing was not accidental, as the rise of Fascism in Europe during the early 1930s was clearly threatening the security of the United States. The new institute had the support of the President of Yale, Charles Seymour, and was initially funded by a five-year, $100,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. Under Spykman, the institute explored all the avenues in which research could help formulate the country's foreign policy. The goal was to investigate the historical, theoretical, and applied aspects of the international relations field. This last was especially important; unlike some other academic efforts in this area, the institute explicitly attempted to both study and influence the decisions of the present. As one of Spykman's mission statements at the time said: Members of the research staff at the institute during the 1930s included A. Whitney Griswold and George T. Davis. Spykman held the directorship until 1940, when he fell ill. He was replaced by Dunn, who held the position the remainder of the institute's span. Activities and influence Journalist Fred Kaplan has written, \\"In the 1940s, there was no more exciting and stimulating place in the academic world for an international relations scholar to reside than at the Institute of International Studies at Yale.\\" Similarly, Lucian W. Pye has written that during this time the institute became \\"the preeminent such center in the country.\\" Regarding schools of thought, the Yale Institute was considered a bastion of international relations realism. Wolfers started out in the mindset, then converted the previously idealist Spykman, and Dunn, a disillusioned former legal officer at the U.S. Department of State who had become a scholar of international law, followed suit. Under Dunn, the institute continued to focus on work that would clarify choices faced by American foreign policy and determine ways in which American power could best be deployed. This did not mean the studies should make policy themselves or attempt to settle difficult policy questions; Dunn believed that government officials had access to the most information and were in the best position to do that. As part of its emphasis on the present, the institute sent hundreds of copies of its studies to officials in relevant areas of government, where they found a welcome audience. The institute also created a \\"memorandum series\\" of treatments of contemporary research problems; these were longer than journal articles but kept shorter than books so that they could be more easily read by time-pressed officials. Reproduced by mimeograph, some thirty- five issues of this series were made and the recipient list grew to 1,500 names. In 1940‚Äì41 the institute was funded again by the Rockefeller Foundation, but this time for three years, to the amount of $51,500; the foundation's goal was that the institute become self-supporting after that. By then the faculty members had built up enough connections to help supply such sources. Under Dunn, the institute had a loose, informal organization that one of its members likened to \\"a band of brothers\\". The institute began expanding its staff in 1943, adding seven permanent research associates over the next four years. A key addition was that of William T. R. Fox, who joined Yale University in 1943 and was associate director of the institute from 1943 to 1950. Dunn proved to be a significant influence on Fox, while Fox in turn became a significant influence on the institute, in part by recruiting people from the University of Chicago, the behavioralism-centered school where he had done his graduate work. Also joining in 1943 were David N. Rowe and Percy E. Corbett. Bernard Brodie came to both Yale and the institute in 1945 and quickly became a well-known nuclear strategist. Klaus Knorr joined that year as well, and in 1947 the institute added Gabriel Almond and Frederick C. Barghoorn. In addition to the regular staff, a dozen or so other scholars would be attached to the institute for temporary appointments to carry out particular research projects; these included Harold D. Lasswell, Robert A. Dahl, Annette Baker Fox, and Ellen Hammer. The noted historian Samuel F. Bemis was also affiliated with the institute. At the same time the institute was created, an undergraduate international major in international relations was established at Yale, and the members of the institute often taught the courses for that major. The themes of the courses revolved around national security and war; this sometimes upset undergraduates who were interested in going into missionary work or in joining efforts towards building world peace, but it accurately reflected the realist perspective of the institute. By the mid-1940s, the number of international relations majors at Yale had increased by a factor of five, which helped justify the expansion of the faculty. The institute was funded again in 1944 by the Rockefeller Foundation, this time for $125,000 to run over five years. Again this was augmented by funding from other sources, with Yale University undertaking the responsibility for finding such funding to the sum of $145,000 for the interval. Many books on U.S. security policy came out of the institute, with Far East and Anglo-American relations particular areas of focus. Some of the more important such works included: Griswold, The Far Eastern Policy of the United States (1938); Davis, A Navy Second to None (1940); Wolfers, Britain and France Between Two Wars (1940); Almond, The American People and Foreign Policy (1950); and Dahl, Congress and Foreign Policy (1950). Perhaps the two most influential were Spykman's America's Strategy in World Politics: The United States and the Balance of Power (1942) and Fox's The Super-Powers: The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union ‚Äì Their Responsibility for Peace (1944), the former selling some 10,000 copies within the first three months of publication and the latter being credited with coining the term \\"superpower\\". Also quite influential was one that Brodie wrote along with Dunn, Wolfers, Corbett, and Fox, The Absolute Weapon: Atomic Power and World Order, published in 1946, which laid down the fundamentals of nuclear deterrence strategy and explored ways the A-bomb might be put under international control without idealistic notions of world government being in place. Dunn urged that books be written with clarity and be kept relatively short. In 1948, the quarterly academic journal World Politics was founded under the auspices of the institute. Its focus was on the political processes by which governments and leaders interact when there is no central authority. It remains one of the most highly ranked journals in the international relations field well into the 2010s. End In 1950‚Äì51, the institute ran into conflict with the new President of Yale, their former colleague A. Whitney Griswold, who felt that scholars should conduct research as individuals rather than in cooperative groups. He also thought that the institute should do more historical, detached analysis rather than focus on current issues and recommendations on policy. In the estimation of political scientist Annette Baker Fox, the creation of an institute such as the Yale one, which is separate from the usual departmental structure, \\"alters the making of choices by undergirding particular intellectual activities, thus changing academic priorities and who gets to rank them ... [the Yale Institute] foundered on this rock of university structure.\\" Finally, there was some personal animosity involved, related to Griswold believing that institute members had argued against him receiving tenure. In 1949 the Rockefeller Foundation had agreed to another term of funding for the institute, $75,000 over three years, but it, like the previous grant, was dependent upon Yale University committing to raise an even greater sum on its own. Some of that funding had already been arranged with the Carnegie Corporation, but when the institute applied to the university for the balance of these additional funds, Griswold declined support. The associate director, Fox, departed in 1950 and went to Columbia University, where he founded the Institute of War and Peace Studies. Some of the Carnegie funding followed him there. In April 1951, Dunn (who was a Princeton alumnus), together with five of his political science colleagues ‚Äì Corbett, Almond, Knorr, William Kaufmann, and Bernard C. Cohen ‚Äì all left Yale and went to Princeton. With the goal of strengthening the international studies area within that university's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, the Center of International Studies was created. It was initially funded by donations, including a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, which had similarly sponsored the Yale institute. Dunn became the first director of the new body. The news of the shift from Yale to Princeton made the front page of the New York Times. The new center became known as the continuation of the old institute; one government publication later termed it a \\"reincarnation\\". The Princeton center also took over from the Yale institute the sponsorship of the World Politics journal. Pye has termed it \\"one of the most dramatic personnel changes in the history of political science\\". Or as the President of Princeton, Harold W. Dodds, put it at the time, using a metaphor from American football to summarize the events, \\"Yale fumbled and Princeton recovered the ball.\\" Of two other major figures at the Yale Institute, Brodie went to the RAND Corporation, while Wolfers stayed at Yale (but left six years later to become director of the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research at Johns Hopkins University). The Yale political science department was left \\"in shambles\\", according to one observer; James W. Fesler was hired as chairman, and eventually the upheaval led to reforms being put into place at the department. Nor was it always smooth sailing at Princeton, for Dodds had not apprised the existing political science department there of the newcomers. Almond soon departed, and Kaufman and Cohen left later in the decade as well. Nevertheless, the center carried on, with Knorr assuming the directorship for much of the 1960s. William T. R. Fox later noted that the Yale Institute of International Studies became the model for other international relations research entities to follow, with former colleagues at Yale leading not just the Princeton center and his institute as Columbia and the Washington Center at Johns Hopkins but also the MIT Center for International Studies as well. Overall some 600 students majored in international relations at Yale during the 1935‚Äì1951 period, and several alumni became well-known academics. A number of others went from the exposure to the institute into the State Department or into other foreign policy- related organizations, thus showing that the influence that the Yale Institute of International Studies had extended beyond academia and beyond its span.

In the 1871 treatise, he explains the effect of the luminescence in some elements and in the 1873 one he talks about the visible spectrum of the sun's light. In the 1871 treatise, Sekuliƒá also predicted the existence of electromagnetic oscillations at different frequencies. During the period in which Martin Sekuliƒá was the custodian of the science cabinet of his high school, he would inform his students of the very latest discoveries in the world of physics, and by the school year 1880/81 they had amassed a total of 277 machines for demonstration purposes, including a spectroscope modified by Sekuliƒá himself.

The BMC currently maintains a presence in several villages west of Manbij, though its stated goal is to capture al-Bab, currently under the Turkish occupation of northern Syria.  History  The al-Bab Military Council was formed on 14 August 2016 by seven small SDF- affiliated factions with the goal of capturing the city of al-Bab, which they described as \\"a symbol of the revolution and the foundation for a democratic, free and plural Syria\\". It called for US military support. Afrin-based SDF forces, cut off from the rest of the SDF by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, launched an offensive in the countryside west of al-Bab in September. Amid the Battle of al-Bab and the wider Operation Euphrates Shield, the BMC fought alongside the People's Protection Units (YPG) against the Islamic State and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (TFSA) in an attempt to capture al-Bab before Turkey did. The BMC and its allies were unable to reach the city, however, and al-Bab and its surroundings consequently became part of the Turkish occupation zone in northern Syria. Since then, the BMC has frequently reiterated its intention to end the Turkish occupation of the region. As clashes between the SDF and the Turkish-backed forces increased in March 2017, the SDF made a deal with the Syrian government and agreed to the posting of loyalist Syrian border guards in SDF-held areas to defuse tensions. The BMC coordinated with these border guards to counter attacks by the TFSA. The group maintained a presence in several villages that bordered on Turkish-held territories, and repeatedly clashed with Turkish-backed forces. After the village of Arima was formally placed under Syrian Army control on 25 December 2018 following a deal between the SDF and the Syrian government, the BMC (along with the Manbij Military Council and Kurdish Front) was one of the SDF units which maintained a presence in the village. In early January 2019, several clashes took place between the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA, previously known as the TFSA) and the BMC near Arima. In response, BMC fighters, led by their commander Jamal Abu Juma, conducted joint patrols with Russian Armed Forces soldiers in the area where the joint SDF-Syrian Army zone bordered on Turkish-held territories. Sporadic fighting continued between the BMC and SNA.  Structure  The BMC initially consisted of seven militias, two Arab units (Al-Bab Revolutionary Front and Free Arima Battalion), two Kurdish groups (Qebasin Martyrs Brigade and Kieba Martyrs Brigade), one Turkmen militia (Seljuq Brigade), and two ethnically mixed units (Al-Bab Countryside Martyrs Battalion and Martyr Silo al-Rai Brigade). In October 2016, an all-female battalion was established. This unit started to recruit women among the refugees from al-Bab, especially those who had suffered at the hands of ISIL. Jamal Abu Juma is the commander of the BMC. By February 2019, he had survived 15 assassination attempts.

It is situated at the top of Pa Hang Mountain, above sea level. Three hominin fossils have been discovered in the cave: TPL1, a skull belonging to an anatomically modern human; TPL2, a mandible with both modern and archaic traits; and TPL3, a partial mandible with both modern and archaic traits. The three fossils represent three separate individuals and date from around 70,000 to 46,000 years old. The discoveries indicate that modern humans may have migrated to Southeast Asia by 60,000 BP. Location and geology Tam Pa Ling has a single, south-facing opening and descends to its main gallery. It is part of a network of karst caves, formed by the dissolution of limestone beds that were laid down between the Upper Carboniferous and Permian periods. The main gallery measures from north to south and from east to west. Fossils Excavations at the eastern end of the cave's main gallery, at the base of the sloped entrance, were conducted by a team of American, French and Laotian researchers starting in 2009.F. Demeter et al., \\"Early Modern Humans and Morphological Variation in Southeast Asia: Fossil Evidence from Tam Pa Ling, Laos\\", PLOS One, 7 April 2015, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0121193. The first fossil find, a hominin skull dubbed TPL1, was recovered at a depth of in December 2009. A mandible, TPL2, was found the following year at a depth of . Radiocarbon and luminescence dating of the sediments established a minimum age of 51,000 to 46,000 years, and direct uranium-thorium dating of the fossils indicated a maximum age of 63,000 years. TPL1 includes the frontal, partial occipital, right parietal, and temporal bone, as well as the right and left maxillae and a largely complete dentition. It was identified as belonging to an anatomically modern human with distinct Sub-Saharan African features. , it provides the earliest skeletal evidence for the presence of Homo sapiens in mainland Southeast Asia. TPL2 mandible The TPL2 mandible was found lower down in the same stratigraphic unit as TPL1, and represents a mature adult that combines archaic human features such as a robust mandibular corpus and small overall size, with modern human traits like a developed chin. In 2013, researchers recovered the partial mandible of a third fossil find, TPL3, at a depth of , from the same area as the previous finds. The bone fragment likely belonged to an adult. Like TPL2, TPL3 exhibits a mix of archaic and anatomically modern human traits, exhibiting modern human features such as having a developed chin but not having a robust mandibular corpus; however, TPL3 also retains archaic human features such as having a broad anterior mandibular arch. Luminescence dating of the TPL3 sediment layer provides a date range from around 70,000 to 48,000 years old. = Significance = The timing of modern human migration from Africa to East Asia is not known with certainty; because bone is poorly preserved in tropical climates, human fossils from the region are rare. Recent discoveries in China, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Australia had previously established that archaic human fossils were present between 125,000 and 100,000 BP, and those of modern humans from about 40,000 BP. The discovery of the fully modern TPL1 specimen was therefore considered a major discovery because it filled in a 60,000-year gap in the fossil record, demonstrating the presence of modern humans in Southeast Asia from at least 60,000 BP. Additionally, as Tam Pa Ling lies a thousand miles inland, the finds challenged previous assumptions that humans migrated out of Africa by following coastlines. They suggest that the migration may also have proceeded along river valleys, which served as natural corridors through the continent. The fossils were temporarily removed to the United States for study by paleoanthropologist Laura Shackleford, Fabrice Demeter and the team. In April 2016 they were returned to Laos, and are now housed in a new building of the Lao National Museum in Vientiane.

Through the Windshield  When he was twenty, he moved to Cleveland's Southside, also known as Tremont, the neighborhood where he set Through the Windshield, his first novel. Through the Windshield was conceived as a depiction of a year on the Southside. Through the Windshield was begun in earnest with the encouragement of Susie Hulme, (who he'd met through Tony Maimone, Pere Ubu). After a romantic correspondence Mike moved to London. Susie bought him an Olivetti typewriter, and he began work in earnest while she attended art school. They moved to Williamsburgh, Brooklyn and married in 1987. The novel was finished in 1990. Excerpts from DeCapite's Through the Windshield first appeared in CUZ, a literary magazine edited by Richard Hell and published under the auspices of the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, in New York. Excerpts from Through the Windshield appeared in three issues of CUZ, between 1988 and 1989. DeCapite did his first reading in January 1988 at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church. Through the Windshield circulated widely in manuscript and was excerpted in numerous small magazines. In 1998, DeCapite, living in San Francisco, started Sparkle Street Books and published it himself.  Ruined for Life!  In 1995, DeCapite started work on a second novel, Ruined for Life!, still unpublished, which he worked on for the next dozen years. By the time he put it aside, DeCapite was back in New York, to which he'd returned in 2005. Excerpts from the book have appeared in 3:AM, angle magazine, and Sensitive Skin. In 1999, DeCapite‚Äôs story \\"Sitting Pretty,\\" an outtake from Ruined for Life!, was published as a CUZ Edition, a series of chapbooks edited by Richard Hell that included books by Maggie Dubris, Hell, Susan Noel, Ron Padgett, Will Patton, Rene Ricard, and Nick Tosches. In 2003, \\"Sitting Pretty\\" was anthologized, along with novel-excerpts by his father, Raymond DeCapite, in The Italian American Reader.  Creamsicle Blue  In 2012, DeCapite published his essay Creamsicle Blue as a chapbook. Novelist Karen Lillis reviewed Creamsicle Blue for her blog Karen the Small Press Librarian. She called it \\"a spectacular piece of writing\\" and, in an interview with DeCapite, described it as a \\"27 page piece of nonfiction with the scope of a novel and the depth of a meditation.\\"  Radiant Fog  In 2003 and 2004, while living in San Francisco, DeCapite wrote a personal-essay column for an arts magazine in Cleveland called angle. Most of these pieces were later collected in DeCapite's Radiant Fog (Sparkle Street Books, 2013).  Sparkle Street Social & Athletic Club  In 2016, DeCapite‚Äîwith photographer Ted Barron‚Äîpresented Sparkle Street Social & Athletic Club, a series of three events featuring readings, photographs, and films, whose participants included DeCapite, Barron, Maggie Dubris, Max Blagg, Vincent Katz, and Luc Sante.  Inspirations  Through the Windshield has inspired the 1993 Pere Ubu Story of My Life outtake Through the Windshield (released as a bonus track on the Story of My Life reissue, Mercury, 2007), the Chargers Street Gang LP Through the Windshield (Get Hip Records, 2003), and the Disturbances of Spring song Through the Windshield (Blurring in the Corner of Your Eye, Disturbances of Spring, 2015).)

The museum now holds her botanical diary, notes, books, records and specimens.  Early life  She was the eldest child of Winifred and Charles Tanfield Vachell, a physician in Cardiff where she was born in 1879, followed in the 1890s by her brother Eustace and sister Sylvia. She went to school in Cardiff, Malvern, and Brighton. Her father was a keen amateur botanist, and from childhood she went with him on botanical trips across the UK and Ireland as well as in Brittany, Norway and Switzerland.Marilyn Ogilvie, Joy Harvey, The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science , Routledge 2003, p1316 She started keeping a botanical diary when she was twelve and used it throughout her life to record expeditions and finds. Her ambition was to see in situ every plant recognised as a British species and she ticked off her finds by colouring illustrations in a reference book. This eventually led to her building up an almost unrivalled knowledge of UK and Irish plants in their native habitats.H.A.Hyde, 'Obituaries: Miss Eleanor Vachell', in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London, Volume 161, Issue 2,, p252, , December 1949 It is believed she saw all but thirteen species during her life.  Botanical interests  Limosella aquatica, closely related to Vachell's discovery, Limosella aquatica x subulata From 1903 Vachell was the honorary secretary of a committee preparing the first volume of the Flora of Glamorgan. The editor A. H. Trow, was Professor of Botany at University College, Cardiff from 1905 to 1919, and he offered encouragement to her in her botanical work. As well as contributing to that volume and acting as Recorder for continuing plant-finding in Glamorgan, she contributed extensively to the Transactions of the Cardiff Naturalists Society where she was the first woman elected to membership of their Biological and Geological Section 'Obituary: Eleanor Vachell, F.L.S., 1878‚Äì1948', Reports and transactions (Cardiff Naturalists' Society), 1900‚Äì1981, Vol. LXXX 1948‚Äì1950 and, in 1936-7, was the society's first woman president. She was elected a Fellow of the Linnaean Society in 1917. She belonged to the Wild Flower Society and the Botanical Exchange Club and went on plant-hunting trips with friends who were also members, including Gertrude Foggitt and Joanna Charlotte Davy. Like them, she had a private income. Her companions and their travels together are described in Vachell's diary. In 1926 she was asked by the British Museum to investigate a report of the Ghost Orchid. This is one of Britain's rarest plants and for many years the Amgueddfa Cymru (National Museum of Wales) had only a small rhizome that had been gathered by Vachell on 29 May 1926.Ghost orchids ‚Äì a fleeting occurrence in dark, shaded woods, 3 July 2013, Museum of Wales. Retrieved 21 August 2016 In the 1930s she discovered the hybrid Limosella aquatica x subulata with Dr Kathleen B. Blackburn.'The Limosella plants of Glamorgan', Journal of Botany, 1939, pp65-71 Every week from 1921 to 1948 she contributed a column on wild flowers to the Western Mail and in the 1920s she broadcast talks on wild flowers on BBC radio.  Other activities  During both world wars she suspended her botanical interests to do voluntary work. She was said to be a \\"keen churchwoman\\" and was active in the Red Cross where she became a Commandant and then a Vice-President. In World War I she was a VAD at a military hospital, the 3rd Western General Hospital in Cardiff. In the Second World War she acted as deputy chairman of the Women's Land Army for Glamorgan and was its visiting representative. She also took charge of the library at the Rookwood Hospital, Llandaff.  Legacy  She died on 6 December 1948. One of her obituarists, H. A. Hyde, keeper of botany at the National Museum of Wales, said she gave much help and encouragement to younger botanists and shared her expertise generously. She left a herbarium she had assembled along with her father to the National Museum of Wales, to be called the C. T. & E. Vachell herbarium. She also left her diary, books, records, notes and ¬£500 for the upkeep of her bequest. Her will specified an additional ¬£500 \\"to form a fund to assist amateur botanical research\\" and the expenses of publishing a future \\"Flora of Glamorgan\\" making use of her manuscripts.'Wills and bequests', The Times, 25 April 1949, p7 In 2012 she was one of thirteen women featured in an exhibition called \\"Inspirational Botanists ‚Äì Women of Wales\\" at the National Botanic Garden of Wales.Inspirational botanists, Welsh Icons News, 23 Feb 2012 The standard author abbreviation Vachell is used to indicate her as the author when citing a botanical name.

It was built in 1938‚Äì40 and obtained its Grade II status on 9 March 1982. The church's denomination is the Church of England. History In 1881, the unused Tuffley School building was declared as a church and dedicated to Saint Barnabas. In 1922, a large wooden building was constructed next to the old school, which became the temporary church of St Barnabas. This building is still present today and is used for various church activities. In 1930, St Barnabas separated from the parish of Tuffley to become its own independent parish. The stone church present today was built in 1938-1940 designed by Nugent Cachemaille-Day. It is built in the traditional form with some Gothic architecture, with the main structure provided by a reinforced concrete frame. It was built to replace St Aldate Church and it also replaced the temporary church. Architecture The church is made from C20 concrete, and constructed in the traditional form with some Gothic architecture around the windows. The style was influenced by the Liturgical Movement, and both traditional and modern materials were used. The construction itself includes reinforced frames, with external brick walls, concrete window frames, and a flat roof. There is a single belfry tower on the South-West side, with a concrete crucifix on top. The east and west sides of the tower have supporting corbels, and there are two windows on each of the four sides. Internal layout The entrance to the building is on the northwest side and leads into a porch. This then leads to the largest part of the church which is a long rectangular nave. The chapel is located on the north side of the building, and vestries are on the east. At the south end of the building is the pulpit with the altar and chancel, above this is the organ loft which is inside the belfry tower.
