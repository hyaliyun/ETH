In usage, to bind and to loose simply means to forbid by an indisputable authority and to permit by an indisputable authority. One example of this is Isaiah 58:5-6 which relates proper fasting to loosing the chains of injustice. The poseks had, by virtue of their ordination, the power of deciding disputes relating to Jewish law. Hence, the difference between the two main schools of thought in early classical Judaism were summed up by the phrase the school of Shammai binds; the school of Hillel looses. Theoretically, however, the authority of the poseks proceeded from the Sanhedrin, and there is therefore a Talmudic statement that there were three decisions made by the lower house of judgment (the Sanhedrin) to which the upper house of judgment (the heavenly one) gave its supreme sanction.Massoth, 23b The claim that whatsoever [a disciple] bind[s] or loose[s] on earth shall be bound or loosed in heaven, which the Gospel of Matthew attributes to Jesus, is probably therefore just an adoption of a phrase popular at the time. This is also the meaning of the phrase when it is applied in the text to Simon Peter and the other apostles in particular when they are invested with the power to bind and loose by Christ. This also serves as the scriptural and traditional foundation for the Catholic Church's conception of papal authority, stemming from such an investiture of St. Peter, since, according to Roman Catholic doctrine, the Popes are the Successors of St. Peter.  Phrase in context  First evidence of binding and loosening Acts chapter 15 expresses the first documented instance of loosening and binding; what has been later termed the Council at Jerusalem. Here the early controversy of circumcision was resolved, and loosened from being a qualification for salvation and acceptance into the community of believers. In the depiction below, we see an appeal to follow what has been revealed by the Holy Spirit, and not what opinions of men would suppose. Four things are bound while one thing is loosened: Controversy still exists today whether the authority to loosen or bind is still in effect, if it passed at some point during the church's early development, or to what extent Gospel and doctrine have been loosened or bound by either the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox, Protestant and other traditions.  References   External links  *Jewish Encyclopedia: Binding and Loosing *Catholic Encyclopedia: The Pope: \\"The expressions binding and loosing here employed are derived from the current terminology of the Rabbinic schools. A doctor who declared a thing to be prohibited by the law was said to bind, for thereby he imposed an obligation on the conscience.

It refers to the process by which a prospective donor is moved from cultivation to solicitation. ‚ÄúMoves‚Äù are the actions an organization takes to bring in donors, establish relationships, and renew contributions. David Dunlop, the Cornell University senior development officer who developed the concept of moves management, described the idea as ‚Äúchanging people‚Äôs attitudes so they want to give.‚Äù Implementation An organization implementing moves management should have a system of policies, procedures, and practices that direct the actions of the organization towards bringing in donors, forging relationships, and generating major gifts. These systems should be focused on donors, rather than donations. They should also emphasize documenting the relationship between the donor and the organization. Information Tracked Moves management requires a baseline of personally identifiable information for each donor. Because moves management attempts to leverage personal relationships with donors, an organization should be tracking the following: *Donor's biographical information *Donor's actions *Donor's interests *Donor's relationships *Donor's giving history Using this data and any other additional information in your information tracking system is the foundation for enhancing donor communication and improving solicitation strategies under the moves management philosophy. Social Data Moves management‚Äôs heavy focus on donor relationships has led to social data transforming the way organizations are able to interact with donors. Organizations have primarily begun incorporating social data into their moves management strategies in two ways: prospecting and engagement. Prospecting Uses The donor prospecting phase has been enhanced through the ability of constituent relationship management (CRM) technology to import social data. This data also helps inform solicitation strategies, pipeline management, and overall outreach execution for the entire organization. Engagement Uses Donor engagement has benefitted from the use of social data by providing development officers with additional methods of communication. The variety of ways that social media is disseminated has created. CRM software is commonly used to parse the large quantities of social data to turn it into something that is actionable for development officers who are reaching out and nurturing donor relationships.

Born in Jacksonville, North Carolina, Common spent most of his youth in Pensacola, Florida. When he was thirteen years old, Common found his older brother's Epiphone acoustic guitar in a closet and began writing songs. While in Pensacola, Common founded and fronted the psychedelic roots rock band Bunkhouse Jones. Featuring drummer Matthew Baranowski, guitarists Aaron Monte and Richard Abercrombie, Bunkhouse Jones released two records and toured clubs and small venues in the South. After finishing school, he traveled around the country to New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Burlington, and other towns writing, busking, playing shows and making lo-fi recordings. After a stint working on a small family farm in Denmark, Kansas, he made his way to Colorado. As the singer, songwriter and guitarist for the Denver-based roots rock/alt-country band Rainville, he built a reputation for writing gritty, honest songs. Rainville released two albums to critical acclaim nationally and in Europe, and toured from 1999 to 2004. Common began exploring different musical and lyrical territory in 2005. This new creative direction surfaced on Good To Be Born and Why Birds Fly ‚Äì the first two records released under his name on Free School Records in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Those two records established Common in the Denver music scene as an independent artist and songwriter. He continued to evolve his sound by releasing a record entitled Beautiful Empty under the name John Common and Blinding Flashes of Light in 2011. That full length was quickly followed by an EP named Side 3. Common's band, Blinding Flashes of Light, was a large collective of musicians, artists and friends drawn from Denver's indie music scene. They toured across the United States multiple times in support of Beautiful Empty and Side 3. The musical collective evolved into John Common Superheart in 2014, and in 2015 Common released an EP named Two Rivers, again on Free School Records. Two Rivers was co-produced by John Common and Steve Vidaic. John Common Superheart tracked a full length record with Steve Vidaic as co-producer and engineer that hasn't been released yet. In 2017, Common began exploring a more stripped down direction and returned to playing and recording under his name. The current musical configuration features John Common on vocals, guitars and keys, Jess DeNicola on backing vocals, and Joe Mazza on guitars and sounds.

The park includes Ngwenya Mountain, Eswatini's second highest mountain (1,829 m), and Malolotja Falls which drop , the highest in Eswatini. Habitats include short grassland to thick riverine scrub, bushveld and Afromontane forest. Malolotja National Park adjoins the Songimvelo Game Reserve in South Africa, and together they form the Songimvelo-Malolotja Transboundary Protected Area or Peace Park, which in turn is part of the Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area. History The region was identified as important by the Swaziland National Trust Commission in the early 1970s. At that time most of the area was sheep grazing land and much was privately owned. However, the area had little agricultural potential and residents were resettled on good agricultural land adjacent to Malolotja. Flora and fauna Animals in the park include zebra, wildebeest, reedbuck, blesbok, red hartebeest, oribi, leopard, serval, aardwolf, jackal and bushpig. The Natal ghost frog, plaintive rain frog and the gray's stream frog are native to Eswatini, South Africa and Lesotho. In Eswatini they have only been found in Afromontane mist belt forest. Bird species include louries, sunbirds, sugarbirds, blue cranes and swallows. Bald ibises nest in colony on cliffs near Malolotja Falls. A number of bird species are of conservation importance, because their habitat is limited and threatened outside the park. They are the orange ground-thrush, brown robin, bush blackcap, chorister robin-chat, white-starred robin, grey cuckoo-shrike, olive bush shrike, southern boubou, Narina trogon and Knysna lourie. There are tall grasses, orchids, lilies, and ancient cycads. Climate Most rain falls in summer thunderstorms from December to April. Frost is common in June and July. Ngwenya Mine The Ngwenya iron ore mine is located within the park, near the Hawane Dam. Salgaocar is the company that is contracted to extract over 32 million tons of ore, amid much protest from locals over environmental repercussions and the detriment to one of the nation's main water supplies. Tourism There are only of road in the park, but much more can be explored on 4√ó4s, mountain bike or by hiking. There are a number of designated camping sites.

Females are between 20 and 52 mm long and with a subterminal genital pore and males usually have two testes, which is unique in the Fessisentis genus. * Fessisentis friedi Nickol, 1972 F. friedi has been found infecting the grass pickerel (Esox americanus) and the White sucker (Catostomus commersoni). It has a limited distribution, being found only in southeastern New Hampshire, southeastern Massachusetts (by Haley and Bullock in 1953), and from Northampton County, Pennsylvania (by Fried, Kitchen, and Koplin in 1964). F. friedi possesses lemnisci shorter than those of F. fessus and F. vancleavei, but longer than those of F. necturorum. It is the only species of Fessisentis in which branched lemnisci have not been observed. Although proboscis shape is variable, F. friedi differs from other species of the genus by possession, in general, of a long, cylindrical proboscis armed, especially in females, with more hooks per longitudinal row. The intermediate host is the isopod Caecidotea communis where F. friedi is free and unencysted in the hemocoel as cystacanths. The transfer of Acanthocephalus vancleavei to F. vancleavei required renaming the original F. vancleavei to be renamed F. friedi by Nickol in 1972 to avoid duplication. The species name friedi was chosen to honour Dr. Bernard Fried who contributed to research on this species. * Fessisentis necturorum Nickol, 1967 F. necturorum was found parasitizing the Marbled salamander (Ambystoma opacum) larvae near Athens, Georgia and the Gulf Coast waterdog (Necturus beyeri) from southern Louisiana.

F. tichiganensis has been found parasitizing 11 species of fish. The species name was given after the location where it first discovered: Tichigan Lake in Racine County, Wisconsin. The proboscis is 448-616 um long in males and 616-826 um in females. The proboscis hook rows with 11-13 hooks in males and 12-15 in females. * Fessisentis vancleavei (Hughes and Moore, 1943) F. vancleavei has been found infecting the Oklahoma salamander (Eurycea tynerensis) in Oklahoma.

Early life Aaron Columbus Burr was born in New York City on September 15, 1808, purportedly the son of Count Verdi de Lesle. Historians Nathan Schachner and Milton Lomask maintain that Aaron Columbus Burr was Aaron Burr's son by a mistress in New York City and was born during Burr's period of living there.Nathan Schachner, Aaron Burr: A Biography (New York: A.

Career The younger Burr moved to the United States after living in Florida and was adopted by Aaron Burr. He was a goldsmith and silversmith, and engaged in the diamond and jewellery business in New York City. He retired in about 1862. In August 1860, Burr received a letter from James Grant of British Honduras (known today as Belize), offering land for sale in the Stann Creek District. During the American Civil War, Burr and Anna Ella Carroll lobbied Abraham Lincoln to fund what they proposed to call \\"the Lincoln Colony\\" for freedmen. This colony, to be located in British Honduras, would have been similar to colonies established in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Africa by Great Britain in Sierra Leone and by the American Colonization Society in Liberia. The colonization plan failed, but Burr and Grant successfully founded the American Honduras Company to harvest and export mahogany as a trade product.Coryell, Janet L. \\"The Lincoln Colony: Aaron Columbus Burr's Proposed Colonization of British Honduras\\", Civil War History 43 (March 1997): 5‚Äì16 This tropical hardwood became widely used in fine furniture.

They are caused by direct trauma to the iliac wing, and are generally stable fractures as they do not disrupt the weight bearing pelvic ring. The fracture is named after the French surgeon Joseph Guichard Duverney who described the injury in his book Maladies des Os which was published posthumously in 1751. Presentation  Complications  Malunion and deformity of the iliac wing can occur. Injury to the internal iliac artery can occur, leading to hypovolaemic shock. Perforation of the bowel can occur, leading to sepsis. Damage to the adjacent nerves of the lumbosacral plexus has also been described.  Diagnosis  Duverney fractures can usually be seen on pelvic X-rays, but CT scans are required to fully delineate the fracture and to look for associated fractures involving the pelvic ring.  Management  Since fractures that do not involve the weight bearing part of the pelvic ring tend to be stable fractures, they can often be managed without surgery. These fractures tend to be very painful, so walking aids such as crutches or walking frames may be needed until the pain settles.

The National City acquisition by PNC was the deal by PNC Financial Services to acquire National City Corp. on October 24, 2008 following National City's untenable loan losses during the subprime mortgage crisis. The deal received much controversy due to PNC using TARP funds to buy National City only hours after accepting the funds while National City itself was denied funds, as well as civic pride for the city of Cleveland, Ohio, where National City was based. Pre-merger history Both PNC and National City's corporate histories date to the mid-19th century. National City was founded as the City Bank of Cleveland in 1845, while PNC was founded in longtime Cleveland rival, Pittsburgh, as the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company, in 1852. Both banks would later receive national charters under the National Banking Act, with National City being able to print U.S. currency until the United States Treasury assumed operations in the 1920s. Both would have strong bases in their home markets, although PNC would until the 1980s be dwarfed in Pittsburgh by Mellon Bank (now The Bank of New York Mellon) and the massive influence of the Mellon family. Both banks began interstate expansion in the 1980s, with the two eventually competing in Cincinnati and Louisville by the end of the decade. In late 1992, PNC announced plans to acquire Youngstown, Ohio-based Ohio Bancorp. PNC later backed out of the deal, and National City acquired Ohio Bancorp instead in 1993, with the same branches and even some employees of Ohio Bancorp still employed with National City at the time of the PNC deal. Although PNC would never enter the Cleveland market on its own before the National City deal, National City did enter Pittsburgh in late 1995 with its acquisition of Pittsburgh-based Integra Bank, putting it in third in market share behind PNC and Mellon, and eventually second after Mellon sold off its retail banking division to RBS-owned Citizens Financial Group in 2001. As early as 2003, there were talks of a potential PNC-National City merger down the road, with National City being the surviving entity. However, PNC CEO & Chairman Jim Rohr, a Cleveland native who would later orchestrate PNC's acquisition of National City, insisted at the time that PNC was not for sale. National City problems The downfall of National City began in 2007 when the United States housing bubble began to burst, and consumers defaulted on subprime mortgages. Although National City was otherwise healthy on paper, the mortgage business was dragging down profits into losses, with CEO Peter Raskind even fearing that the bank might fail. National City then put itself up for sale in March 2008. Adding to the bank's problems, The Wall Street Journal reported on June 6, 2008, that National City had entered into a memorandum of understanding with federal regulators, effectively putting the bank on probation. Terms of the confidential agreement, entered into a month earlier with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (which regulates nationally chartered banks), were not known. On June 10, 2008, National City Corp. confirmed that it had reached agreements with regulators \\"regarding capital levels, risk-management practices and other aspects of its business.\\" The company stated that there had been no material developments in these areas since these memorandums of understanding were signed in April and May 2008. By October 2008, National City was in serious sale discussions following the failure of Washington Mutual and the forced sale of Wachovia to Wells Fargo. Among the publicly known front-runners were Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, Toronto-based Scotiabank, and eventual buyer PNC. Scotiabank, which has long stayed out of the U.S. market unlike its Canadian rivals, was considered the best option for the local government since Scotiabank didn't have a pre-existing presence in the United States, allowing most of the National City operations to stay in Cleveland. Although National City and PNC had minimal overlap, the close proximity of Cleveland to Pittsburgh meant massive layoffs in both cities. Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bank, and crosstown rival KeyBank all also expressed interest in National City, with Fifth Third even offering to move its corporate headquarters to Cleveland from across the state in Cincinnati if it were to buy National City. Like U.S. Bancorp, Fifth Third had a redundant footprint with National City, while Wells Fargo (even after its acquisition of Wachovia) had virtually no overlap with National City at all. KeyBank and National City had very little overlap outside Ohio, although some branches in Northeast Ohio would've likely required divesture. Takeover by PNC Shenango Township, Pennsylvania near New Castle on September 19, 2009 just before its conversion to PNC Bank, complete with the new PNC sign being covered up by tarpaulin with the National City logo. This National City branch (originally an Integra Bank branch before their acquisition by National City in late 1995) was one of the few National City branches in Western Pennsylvania that PNC wasn't required to divest by order of the United States Department of Justice. In early October 2008, PNC had offered a deal with National City, but backed out. Combined with Scotiabank's decision to once again not enter the U.S. market, National City began preliminary merger talks with U.S. Bancorp. Meanwhile, the U.S. government began to issue out TARP funds from the $700 billion bailout plan to banks to help stabilize their funds and issue out loans again. On October 23, 2008, when the National City board of directors were about to decide on the U.S Bancorp deal, PNC made an 11th hour offer to buy National City and be its white knight. The following day, after National City was denied TARP funds by the U.S. government, they accepted PNC's offer at about $5.2 billion in stock. The acquisition was a stock purchase transaction completed before the end of 2008. The deal initially made PNC the largest bank in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, as well as the second largest bank in Maryland and Indiana. It greatly expanded the PNC presence in the Midwest as well as entering the Florida market. Pittsburgh, Louisville, Kentucky, and Cincinnati were the only three markets before the acquisition deal that both banks had a major presence in. Overall, the deal made PNC the fifth-largest bank in the United States. After the acquisition, PNC conducted a review of National City's balance sheet and took write-offs and reserves of $12.6 billion on the loan portfolio, indicating how severe the problems were at National City.https://www.pnc.com/webapp/unsec/Requester?resource=/wps/wcm/connect/f38b79004e5c6ed48e898ffc6d630ad7/IR_AR_2008_PNC_Chairman_Letter.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID;=f38b79004e5c6ed48e898ffc6d630ad7 Criticism While some Clevelanders didn't like the fact that National City was being taken over by a Pittsburgh-based rival because of the longstanding NFL rivalry between the two cities, many of the reactions to the PNC-National City deal involved the fact that TARP funds were used by PNC to buy National City. U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland unsuccessfully fought against the merger, arguing that National City's TARP funds application was never seriously considered, PNC actually took National City's own allotment of TARP funds in addition to its own, and the effects on the local economy.Questions remain on PNC-National City deal - Cleveland.com In addition, National City was the only one of the 25 largest U.S. banks eligible to receive TARP funds to be denied TARP funds, with Omaha, Nebraska-based Lauritzen Corporation (ranked 37th nationally) being the next-largest bank denied funds. (Banks owned by foreign companies such as Citizens Financial Group, HSBC Bank USA, and TD Bank, N.A. were automatically disqualified from receiving TARP funds.) Many Cleveland-based local businesses also had an unsuccessful grassroots movement to save National City.YouTube There was also criticism from National City shareholders. The deal was described as a \\"take- under,\\" meaning the purchase price was below National City's market value. Shareholders felt that they were being undervalued for their National City stock. Eight National City stockholders received a settlement from PNC on July 31, 2009. Under terms of the settlement, investors dropped their claims in return for the release of more than 400 pages of documents in Delaware State Court. Nonetheless, the deal was approved by shareholders of both banks on December 23, 2008, and finalized on December 31, 2008.PNC completes National City acquisition, Associated Press via Yahoo! Finance, December 31, 2008 Aftermath In the case of Pittsburgh, the two banks had significant overlap to the point it would pose antitrust issues in Western Pennsylvania since both banks had the top two market shares in the Pittsburgh region. As a result, the United States Department of Justice required PNC to sell off 50 National City branches in the Pittsburgh area and 11 more branches in and around Erie to competitors. Wells Fargo, KeyBank, and Fifth Third‚Äîwhich had inquired about acquiring National City as a whole and in the case of Fifth Third had existing branches in Pittsburgh‚Äîwere all interested in buying the National City branches. JPMorgan Chase, Huntington Bancshares, First Niagara Bank and FNB Corporation were also in discussions for the branches, with Huntington and FNB, like Fifth Third, having existing branches in Pittsburgh. On April 7, 2009, PNC reached a deal with Buffalo-based First Niagara Bank to buy 57 of the branches.http://kdka.com/business/PNC.First.Niagara.2.978660.html First Niagara officially took over those branches on September 8 after the signs were changed over from National City during Labor Day Weekend. The branches not purchased by First Niagara were the four in Crawford County, Pennsylvania that PNC had to divest; of those four, one branch in Titusville was sold to Emclaire Financial Group while the other three (one in Conneaut Lake, the other two in Meadville, including the branch inside Wal-Mart) were sold to Marquette Savings Bank. Although employees at the branches being sold off were retained (First Niagara, in fact, established a regional office in Pittsburgh at 11 Stanwix Street near National City's Pittsburgh headquarters at 20 Stanwix Street, adding more jobs there.), there were still heavy layoffs at National City's headquarters in Cleveland. Because of the significant overlap in Pittsburgh that remains, PNC closed seven National City branches & five PNC branches on November 6, 2009, and later closed two more PNC branches on April 23, 2010, with the accounts at those branches being moved to the nearby PNC branch that will remain.http://kdka.com/local/PNC.Consolidation.Closing.2.1198598.html As part of the agreement to buy the 57 National City branches from PNC, First Niagara has the right of first refusal to buy the National City branches PNC closes. Despite the branch closures and the sale of others to First Niagara, PNC still ended up with a 46% market share in Pittsburgh, over three and a half times the market share of second-place Citizens Financial Group with 13%. By July 2012, PNC's market share in Pittsburgh increased to 48%, more than the rest of the top ten banks in Pittsburgh by deposits combined; it further increased to a virtual 50% by October 2013. By the time Bank of America announced plans for an organic expansion into Pittsburgh in January 2018, PNC's market share in the area had slipped to 42.8%. Although experts had expected more TARP funds to be used by stronger banks to buy out weaker rivals, no more deals were ultimately done involving TARP funds. Conversion to PNC The National City name, as expected, lasted well into 2009 since it would take PNC some time to integrate the two banks together.http://kdka.com/business/National.City.PNC.2.894007.html PNC began to phase out the National City name in favor of PNC on November 7, 2009, starting with Pennsylvania (where the two had the most overlap), Florida, and the Youngstown & Steubenville, Ohio regions. That day also saw the rebranding of National City Mortgage into PNC Mortgage and NatCity Investments fully merged into PNC Investments. In addition, National City's bank charter was merged into PNC's, effectively having the retail banking branches having yet to convert being legally known as PNC Bank, N.A., d/b/a National City Bank. The conversion of National City to PNC was completed in June 2010, in the following phases: *February 19, 2010 Central & Southern Ohio (including Cincinnati, Dayton, and the state capital of Columbus), Southeastern Indiana, and all of Kentucky. *April 12, 2010 Northern Ohio (including National City's home market of Cleveland, Akron, Canton, and Toledo) and all of Michigan. *June 14, 2010 The rest of Indiana and all of Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Legacy Despite becoming the largest bank in Ohio upon acquiring National City, PNC has since slipped to second-largest in the state behind Fifth Third Bank, and is neck-and-neck with third place Huntington Bancshares for the second-place spot. Much of the losses for PNC came in Cleveland, where many Clevelanders left PNC upon the April 2010 conversion of National City in the area for other banks, most notably KeyBank, which became the Cleveland market's largest bank by deposits. While National City was Cleveland's top bank at the time of PNC's acquisition, PNC slipped to fourth overall in the area behind KeyBank, locally owned Third Federal Savings & Loan, and Citizens Financial Group's Charter One brand. PNC has, however, been able to regain some of the losses back, and is currently second in the Cleveland market behind KeyBank. In 2011, PNC opened a museum dedicated to the history of National City within National City's former headquarters in Cleveland. With the 2016 announcement that Huntington would acquire FirstMerit Bank, PNC will slip to number three in market share in both Ohio and specifically Cleveland, with Huntington taking over for Fifth Third as the largest bank in Ohio. Outside of Greater Cleveland, PNC's acquisition of National City has been considered a success by experts. The move allowed PNC to experience growth in Chicago, and was able to use the Florida footprint acquired from National City to expand in the Southern United States. In 2011, PNC expanded its Florida presence by acquiring branches from BankAtlantic in the Tampa Bay Area, and later acquired the Atlanta-area branches of Flagstar Bank and, in a major expansion in the South, RBC Bank from the Royal Bank of Canada. Since the RBC deal was completed, PNC has been mentioned as a possible buyer of Regions Financial Corporation and/or SunTrust BanksFactSet Revere ‚Äî FactSet Research Systems in order to boost its Southern presence. PNC ultimately paid back its TARP funds in full in February 2010 while the National City conversion was still underway. However, it required the bank to sell its Global Investment Servicing division to BNY Mellon in order to have the funds to buy back its shares. First Niagara Bank, which had mostly been a semi-regional bank within Western New York before acquiring the National City branches in the Pittsburgh area that PNC had to divest, used the National City branches it bought as a launching pad to expand into other markets, acquiring banks in Philadelphia and New England before acquiring HSBC Bank USA's Upstate New York branches. In 2015, KeyBank acquired First Niagara, bringing the former National City branches into the fold that it tried to acquire from PNC.

The linear to spathulate leaves, are alternate set along the branches, but are shedded early so the plants look leafless most of the time.  Inflorescence  The flower heads are set individually at the tip of the branches. The lilac to purple corollas of the disc florets are deeply split, creating five coiled lobes. The anthers have stump tips, long pilose tails, and produce pollen that is higher than wide. The branches of the style are finely grainy on the outside. The one-seeded, indehiscent fruits (called cypselas) may have long-pilose hairs or lack hair altogether, but are not bristly or barbed.

History   Origins  In 1148 the Cistercian Valbuena Abbey, of the filiation of Morimond, founded a daughter house in a small former hermitage in Quintanajuar, in the P√°ramo de Masa. In 1171 this new community received as a gift from the heirs of the nobleman Martino Martini de Uizozes the ancient monastery of Rioseco, the previous history of which is unrecorded. After a temporary relocation in the late 12th century to San Cipriano de Montes de Oca (La Rioja), the Cistercians moved to the Valle de Manzanedo at the beginning of the 13th century, and probably in 1204, to occupy the old monastery of Rioseco. The site of the old monastery can still be seen by the ruins of the old conventual church. It seems that after a serious flood the new community had definitely established itself by 1236 at the latest on a new site a little to the north, on higher ground. After the move the former conventual church was put to use as the parish church of Nuestra Se√±ora de Parrales. Mid-term By the 14th century Rioseco had become one of the most powerful economies among the Castilian Cistercians. From the middle of the 15th century however, in common in fact with most other monasteries, it experienced years of penury and crisis, before once again entering upon a period of further growth and prosperity in the 17th century. Dissolution During the Peninsular War, from 1808 to 1809 the French troops stationed in Medina de Pomar appropriated a large part of the monastery's stores and from 1809 until 29 June 1814 the monks were dispossessed. Nor after their return did they stay very long, for on 29 October 1820, during the Trienio Liberal, the commissars of the revolutionary government took possession of the monastery. At a public auction held in Villarcayo, most of the community's goods were sold. The monastery itself however found no buyer, and thereafter stood abandoned. The local populace continued to make some use of the premises as store-houses, parish church and cemetery. In the 1850s the surviving buildings, especially the extremely well preserved church, still magnificently equipped and furnished, were deliberately and systematically stripped by the Arquiaga family of everything of any value that survived, and reduced to ruins.  Description  The monastery is in the Herreriano style. An impressive spiral staircase is still preserved, the stone walls of the church still stand, and the b√≥vedas retain some traces of polychromy. The cartulary is now in the Archivo Hist√≥rico Nacional (codex 91B).  Conservation  On account of its state of dereliction the monastery features in the Lista roja de patrimonio en peligro (\\"Red List of Imperilled Buildings\\"), to which it was added at the instance of the association Hispania Nostra in 2006.

He was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent in 2012. Jefferson played college football for the LSU Tigers of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), where he was the starting quarterback for 32 games from 2008 to 2011. High school career Jefferson lived in St. Rose, Louisiana and attended Destrehan High School in Destrehan, Louisiana, where he was one of the top prep quarterbacks in the country.Biography at LSU Sports 2006 season As a junior in 2006, Jefferson guided Destrehan to an undefeated 6‚Äì0 start before suffering a broken wrist after slamming it into the helmet of another player. Jefferson completed 81 of 143 (56.6%) passes for 1,666 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 4 interceptions. Jefferson had a passer rating of 195.1. 2007 season As a senior in 2007, Jefferson helped Destrehan High School clinch the Class 5A state championship, finishing with a 15‚Äì0 record. He completed 188 of 290 (64.8%) passes for 2,846 yards, 24 touchdowns, and only 3 interceptions during Destrehan's championship season. Jefferson had a passer rating of 172.5. Jefferson was the Class 5A Offensive Player of the Year, and he was named to the Class 5A All-State first team. Jefferson finished his high school career with a perfect record (21‚Äì0) as a starter. He was named a high school All-America by SuperPrep Magazine. Scout.com named him a Top 20 quarterback. Rivals.com gave him four stars, rated him as a Top 10 pro-style quarterback, and listed him in their Top 250 and Louisiana Top 40. Jefferson was named a 2008 Baton Rouge Advocate Super Dozen selection. College career 2008 season As a true freshman in 2008, Jefferson appeared in seven games, starting two of them including the 2008 Chick-fil-A Bowl of which he was the offensive MVP in a 38‚Äì3 win over Georgia Tech. 2009 season As a sophomore in 2009, Jefferson was the youngest starting quarterback in the SEC and the youngest to start a season-opener for LSU since Y. A. Tittle in 1945. He started 12 of LSU's 13 games, missing the game against Louisiana Tech due to injury. He was 8‚Äì4 as a starter, throwing for 2,166 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions. Jefferson and the LSU Tigers lost the 2010 Capital One Bowl to the Penn State Nittany Lions 19‚Äì17. 2010 season In the 2010 regular season, Jefferson threw for 1,253 yards, 4 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions while sharing the quarterback duties with Jarrett Lee. He also rushed for 450 yards and 7 touchdowns; both are LSU records for a quarterback. Jefferson led the Tigers to a 10‚Äì2 record in the regular season and beat the Texas A&M; Aggies in the 2011 Cotton Bowl Classic with a final score of 41‚Äì24. In that game, Jefferson threw for 158 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also rushed for 67 yards and 1 touchdown. Jefferson threw a key pass to running back Stevan Ridley in the LSU game with Alabama on November 6. The Tigers prevailed over the Crimson Tide, 24-21.Chet Hilburn, The Mystique of Tiger Stadium: 25 Greatest Games: The Ascension of LSU Football (Bloomington, Indiana: WestBow Press, 2012), p. 69 2011 season Jefferson was suspended for the first part of the 2011 season after being charged by the Baton Rouge Police with second-degree battery, but he was reinstated to the team after a Grand Jury reduced the charge from a felony to a misdemeanor. Jefferson entered a plea of innocent to the misdemeanor charge. Jefferson returned to play in the fifth game (Kentucky). On his very first play (fourth down), he scored LSU's first touchdown of the game and gave LSU a lead which it never relinquished. Over the course of his first four games back (Kentucky, Florida, Tennessee, and Auburn), Jefferson completed 6 of 10 (60%) passes for 123 yards, 2 touchdowns, and no interceptions for a passer rating of 229.3. He also rushed for 111 yards and 2 touchdowns. November 5 game at Alabama Jefferson was briefly substituted for Jarrett Lee to pick up a third and one on the fifth play of the game. Following a Lee interception which led to a blocked field goal attempt by Alabama, Jefferson came in for Lee again. Jefferson closed out the first half by driving LSU 74 yards to tie the game. Lee was given another chance on LSU's second possession of the second half, but he immediately threw his second interception of the game which led to an Alabama field goal and lead. In overtime, Jefferson executed a short-side option to Michael Ford to set up the game-winning field goal. Lee was pulled after the November game against Alabama for his performance. Lee finished the game 3 of 7 (43%) for 24 yards with two interceptions and a passer rating of 14.5. Jefferson started the final five games of the year. Final three regular season games Jefferson's final three regular season games were LSU's most productive games in 2011 for total yards and yards per play. In all three games, LSU gained over 450 yards; LSU had gained over 450 yards only once in the prior nine games. Jefferson had a perfect game passing against Ole Miss, and he passed for over 200 yards against Arkansas. LSU averaged nearly 10 points more per game and nearly doubled the rushing yards when Jefferson started as QB. Jefferson finished the regular season with a passer rating of 163.5, highest among SEC starting QBs. Of LSU's final three regular season opponents, one-third of the opponents were ranked in the Top 25 at the end of the season. Arkansas was ranked 3rd. Of LSU's first eight regular season opponents, only one-fourth of the opponents were ranked. Oregon was ranked 4th, and West Virginia was ranked 17th. Auburn was the only other team to receive a Top 25 vote. Northwestern State is an FCS school. Post-season games Jefferson led LSU to a 42‚Äì10 win over Georgia in the 2011 SEC Championship Game. In the 2011 BCS National Championship Game, Jefferson struggled against an Alabama defense seeking redemption from a regular season loss against a Jefferson led LSU Tiger team at Alabama's home field. Although Jefferson completed nearly 65% of his passes, he was ineffective in executing the option and moving the LSU offense. College career statistics Jefferson threw for 4,733 yards and 34 touchdowns during his career. As of 2020, he ranks sixth for career wins by a starting quarterback at LSU with 24, and is tied for seventh in LSU history in passing touchdowns (34) and as of the end of his career was sixth in rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (12). As of 2020, he is eighth in LSU history in career passing yards (4,733), and at the end of his career was eighth in completion percentage (58.7), sixth in career completions (398), and sixth in attempts (678). Jefferson holds the LSU record for rushing yards by a quarterback with 1,018 yards. Jefferson‚Äôs ability to run the ball forced opposing defenses to account for him which allowed LSU to defeat opponents through its rushing attack. LSU‚Äôs emphasis on its ground game coupled with Jefferson sharing time with Jarrett Lee reduced Jefferson‚Äôs passing yardage. Thus, Jefferson threw for less than 100 yards in 11 games, or 34% of all games he started. However, of those 11 games, LSU only lost 3 games. {border=0 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=0 style=\\"text- align:center; text-indent:1em;\\" |- style=\\"background-color: #ddddff;\\" ! rowspan=2 Year !! colspan=7 Passing !! colspan=4 Rushing |- style=\\"background-color: #ddddff;\\" !

Although he had the lowest grade prior to the Combine, Jefferson was the only quarterback to finish among the top five in each test during the event. Among the quarterbacks, Jefferson finished first in the 20-yard shuttle, tied for first in the bench press, and finished third in the 40-yard dash and the vertical jump. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Jefferson went undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft, but was invited to try out at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' rookie minicamp. The team signed Jefferson to a contract on May 7, 2012, but was waived four days later so that Tampa Bay could have a replacement for Da'Quan Bowers, a projected starter who suffered a probable season-ending injury. Montreal Alouettes On August 10, 2012, Jefferson signed with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League and was assigned to the practice squad. On October 25, 2012, ESPN reported, citing WAFB in Baton Rouge, LA, that Jefferson was arrested and charged with simple possession of marijuana,http://www.wafb.com/story/19918447/former-lsu-stars-arrested-on- drug-charges along with 3 other former LSU football players, including former Heisman Trophy finalist Tyrann Mathieu.http://espn.go.com/college- football/story/_/id/8552111/tyrann-mathieu-former-lsu-tigers-cornerback- arrested-drug-charges-report On October 30, 2012, Louisiana State Judge Chip Moore revoked Jefferson's bond in his 2011 simple battery case and ordered him to report to parish prison by 2 p.m. (that day) due to his arrest on a marijuana charge. Jefferson was subsequently released by the Alouettes. Pittsburgh Power Jefferson signed with the Pittsburgh Power of the Arena Football League for the 2013 season. He was named the starter one week before the Power began the season. Omaha Mammoths Jefferson signed with the Omaha Mammoths of the Fall Experimental Football League for the 2014 season, where he was the starting quarterback. The Mammoths finished their first and only season in second place with a record of 3‚Äì1, declining to play a championship game.

After securing a remarkable election victory he served in Parliament in the early-1930s, being an unpaid assistant to Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. His mining constituency suffered particular difficulties in the depression and despite his efforts to help, he was defeated in his bid for re-election. Medical training Worthington's family came from Lowestoft, Suffolk,\\"Sir John Worthington\\" (obituary), The Times, 18 June 1951, p. 6. and his father was a surgeon. He was sent to public school, beginning at Woodbridge School and then at Haileybury.Michael Stenton and Stephen Lees, \\"Who's Who of British Members of Parliament\\" Volume III (Harvester, 1979), p. 392-3. Worthington initially sought to follow his father's profession, studying medicine at London Hospital Medicine School. In 1892 Worthington won a ¬£3 prize in practical anatomy;\\"The Medical Schools, Prizes\\", The Times, 29 August 1892, p. 5. he qualified as a surgeon in 1895 by taking the conjoint diploma. He found employment as an assistant demonstrator in anatomy at the school, and was also official surgeon to the Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen.\\"The Times House of Commons, 1931\\", p. 75. Business career Dissatisfied with medicine as a career, in 1901 Worthington left to join Dunlop Rubber Company with whom he remained for 20 years. He worked as a technical superintendent of factories, and in March 1916 was appointed as a Director of the company;\\"Sir William Goff and Dunlops\\", The Times, 21 March 1916, p. 10. he also became a Director of Dunlop America. He was technical superintendent of the company for two years, but owing to ill health he was forced to resign from that position and from his directorships in October 1920.\\"Dunlop Rubber Troubles\\", The Times, 3 February 1921, p. 15. He was later associated with the Moran Tea Company.WORTHINGTON, Sir John Vigers, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edn, OUP, Dec 2007, accessed 17 Oct 2009. Politics According to Worthington's obituary in The Times, he was dissatisfied with the economic policies of the Labour government, a dissatisfaction which increased after the report of the May Committee. He decided to stand for Parliament and joined with the group of Labour Party members who supported Ramsay MacDonald's decision to form the National Government. After a general election was called in October 1931, Worthington was adopted as the National Labour candidate for Forest of Dean division; simultaneously the division's adopted Conservative Party candidate Richard Tufnell, withdrew from the election.\\"New Candidates\\", The Times, 16 October 1931, p. 9. Worthington had a straight fight with the sitting Labour MP, David Vaughan, and succeeded in winning the election with a majority of 1,524, regarded as an \\"outstanding result\\" by The Times;\\"The West Country\\", The Times, 29 October 1931, p. 8. four years later it was described as the most remarkable victory in the West of England.\\"National Labour in the West\\", The Times, 8 November 1935, p. 9. Parliament Soon after the new Parliament assembled, in December 1931 Worthington accepted the offer from Ramsay MacDonald to act as his Parliamentary Private Secretary, an unpaid post which required him to keep in touch with the opinion of Government-supporting backbencher Members of Parliament about MacDonald and advise MacDonald how to maintain support. Busy with this duty it was not until April 1932 that he made his maiden speech in support of the Wheat Bill which brought in a subsidy to farmers growing wheat.Hansard, HC 5ser vol 264 cols 400-4. The next month he called attention to the good example set by Parliament using smokeless fuel and said that he would support legislation to make smokeless fuel compulsory for London houses above a certain rental level.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 4 May 1932, p. 8. Worthington also strongly supported the use of hire purchase as \\"thoroughly good and sound business\\".\\"Hire Purchase\\" (letter), The Times, 29 June 1932, p. 8. A serious illness in 1933 restricted Worthington's political activity,\\"Invalids\\", The Times, 30 August 1933, p. 10. and early in 1934 he had to deal with a severe economic blow to his constituency when the owners of Lightmoor Colliery at Cinderford gave notice of its closure. Worthington arranged a conference with their representatives, who agreed to delay closure in the hope that the workers could transfer to the nearby Northern United Colliery when it was ready to open.\\"Forest of Dean Pit Closing\\", The Times, 26 February 1934, p. 11. He strongly supported the Depressed Areas (Development and Improvement) Bill late in 1934, while calling for its scope to be extended to include his own constituency.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 4 December 1934, p. 7. He supported increased import duties on steel, criticising the steelmakers for their \\"complete indifference\\" to the ore miners and hoping that the increased duties would get the mines in the Forest of Dean working again.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 13 April 1935, p. 7. Defeat In the early summer of 1934, Worthington took the initiative in setting up a \\"National Committee\\" in Forest of Dean which would allow his own supporters in National Labour to meet with local members of the Conservative Party and Liberal Nationals, with a view to making co-operation easier.\\"'National Committees'\\", The Times, 10 July 1934, p. 11. When Ramsay MacDonald retired as Prime Minister in June 1935, Worthington (who had remained his Parliamentary Private Secretary throughout) was given a Knighthood in MacDonald's retirement honours list. He faced strong opposition at the 1935 general election, given the Labour Party tradition of the constituency and the adoption of a local candidate. Against Worthington's help for local industries, his Labour opponents pointed to the means test, economic difficulties in the mines, and the need for a reorganisation in the mining industry. Worthington was defeated by 4,431 votes.\\"The Times House of Commons 1935\\", p. 98. Worthington remained interested in politics and worried in 1936 that the National Government would struggle to retain its support among progressive voters, especially if its candidates had to stand as Conservatives.\\"The Left Front\\" (letter), The Times, 30 May 1936, p. 8. When the National Labour minister J. H. Thomas resigned his seat at Derby shortly afterwards, Worthington was expected to be named as the National Labour candidate for the ensuing by-election.\\"The Derby Contest\\", The Times, 18 June 1936, p. 9.

(67); and nine prisoners were taken. A few days later, in retaliation, the natives attacked Church at Cape Elizabeth on Purpooduc Point, killing 7 of his men and wounding 24 others.Drake, p. .(p.69). After Queen Anne's War, Fort George was built in 1715 by Captain John Gyles in Brunswick.The New York genealogical and Biographical Society, 1898 p.3 The fort was underground with a wall base, standing at least high above ground, laid with lime mortar. The barracks housed fifteen men. A large two-story dwelling house, appearing above the walls, made living possible. The range of its cannon protected the dwellings within their reach. During Father Rale's War, the inhabitants of Brunswick were hospitably gathered within the refuge. Many times this hospitality was strained to its most generous capacity as the onslaughts of Indian attacks were incessant. The most significant attack was when the fort was under siege during the early days of Father Rale's War (1722).Gyles captivity narrative, p. 108 Fort George, Brunswick, Maine by Cyprian Southack, 1720 map inset In 1725, Captain William Woodside took command of the fort and Gyles was sent to Fort St. George (Thomaston, Maine).Gyles memoire, p.44 In 1730, Rev. Benjamin Kent became the minister. In 1736, the Great and General Court of Massachusetts decided to dismantle Fort George, which would ultimately leave the town vulnerable to Indian attacks. An earnest supplication, from the people, was sent to Gov. Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts, begging to have the fort remain. A petition was then signed by twenty Brunswick families and twenty Topsham families, at the Brunswick meeting house on April 25, 1737. All to no avail, the state legislature was deaf to the appeal and proceeded to have the fort dismantled. The order was effective immediately, and the property was to revert to the proprietors. During the French and Indian War, at a meeting of the Penobscot proprietors held October 8, 1761, a deed was executed to split the land between Jeremiah Moulton and Captain David Dunning.p. 10 On November 19, 1761, a written order was given to surrender the fort and buildings to either Moulton or Dunning according to the Penobscot Papers. The ruins of this historical fort were standing until 1802.

Ma serves as the 2nd Chief Justice of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal‚Äîthe court of last resort in Hong Kong. Between 2001 and 2010, he held various positions in the High Court of Hong Kong, including Chief Judge, Justice of Appeal, and Judge of the Court of First Instance. Before his judicial career, he was a barrister-at-law in private practice, and was qualified to practice in England and Wales, Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore. Early life and education Born in Hong Kong, Geoffrey Ma received his education near Manchester, England. In 1974, he started his studies at the University of Birmingham and graduated with an LLB in 1977.Mr Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-Li Birmingham Law School Legal career In 1978, Ma was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn in London and commenced his practice as a Barrister in England and Wales; he was then called to Bar in Hong Kong, State of Victoria, Australia and Singapore in 1980, 1983 and 1990 respectively. He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1993. During his time as a barrister, Ma was instructed for many high-profile cases. He was the senior counsel representing the Director of Immigration in the right of abode cases. He was the Head of Chambers of Temple Chambers in Hong Kong prior to his judicial appointment. He was appointed by the Hong Kong Judiciary as Recorder of the Court of First Instance of the High Court in December 2000. In December 2001, Ma became a Judge of the Court of First Instance of the High Court. In 2002, Ma was elevated to the position of Justice of Appeal of the Court of Appeal of the High Court. In July 2003, he was appointed as Chief Judge of the High Court. Ma was also a member of the Working Party on Civil Justice Reform, which came into effect in April 2009 and is aimed at lowering legal costs and improving assess to justice. Addressing almost 200 legal professionals at a forum in April 2010, Ma criticised judges for being too lenient in civil proceedings with time-wasting parties and encouraged judges to fully use their new case management power under the Civil Justice Reform to ensure expediency. He also warned lawyers against devising new tactics to make civil proceedings unnecessarily lengthy and inefficient. On 8 April 2010, it was announced that the Chief Executive Donald Tsang accepted the recommendation of the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission to appoint Ma as the successor to the current Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal Andrew Li. Ma was succeeded by Andrew Cheung as Chief Judge of the High Court. On 9 June 2010, Ma's appointment was approved by the Legislative Council by a majority vote. Ma had a number of public appointments, which include serving as an associate member of the London Maritime Arbitrators Association, an honorary lecturer of the Department of Professional Legal Education of the University of Hong Kong, a member of the Criminal and Law Enforcement Injuries Compensation Board, a member of the High Court Civil Court Users Committee, a member of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange Disciplinary Appeal Tribunal, chairman of the Appeal Tribunal Panel (Buildings), deputy chairman of the SFC Appeals Panel, and deputy chairman of the SFC Takeovers Appeals Committee. Ma is a patron of the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law; he is also a patron of the International Advocacy Training Council. He was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal in June 2012 by the Hong Kong Government, and the title of Officier de l‚ÄôOrdre de la Legion d‚ÄôHonneur was conferred on him by the French Government in 2015. He was elected an honorary bencher of Gray's Inn in 2004, making him the third person in Hong Kong conferred with such honour. He was made an honorary fellow of Harris Manchester College, Oxford in 2012; he also serves as a member of the advisory board of the Commercial Law Centre at the college. In October 2019, Ma announced his intention to step down from his position as Chief Justice in January 2021, when he turns 65. Reception Legislator and Senior Counsel Audrey Eu and Ronny Tong believed Ma will continue to defend the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary, but described him as sometimes a little too \\"conservative.\\" Tong cited an appeal from September 2009 when Ma and fellow judges criticised the government for not disclosing information but eventually ruled in favour of an Immigration Department decision to deny entry to Falun Gong practitioners on \\"security grounds.\\" Also, in December 2008, he was part of a Court of Appeal panel that overturned a lower court ruling that acquitted the operators of Citizens' Radio of unlicensed broadcasting. Nevertheless, the Hong Kong Bar Association stressed that Ma commands \\"deep respect\\" and is \\"eminently qualified\\". Similarly, Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor Director Law Yuk-kai said he was pleased to see Ma's rich experience in public law. \\"He is strong in public law. He has the competence to protect constitutional rights,\\" Law said. \\"Of course we were disappointed about some cases, but I don't think he is going out of the way to side with the government. I hope he understands that his role is very important. Hong Kong doesn't have democracy. We expect there is at least one branch of government that serves as the last protector of our rights and interests.\\" At the International Bar Association conference in Seoul, Ma spoke about the rule of law including human rights protections built into Hong Kong‚Äôs legal system, saying that judges must not be influenced by \\"extraneous factors such as politics\\". After Ma's speech, a representative from mainland Chinese firm AllBright Law Offices and co-sponsor of the lunch event, rushed to the podium to object to Ma's speech which he called political. After Ma announced his retirement as Chief Justice, Carrie Lam thanked him for his staunch commitment and relentless efforts in safeguarding the rule of law and promoting the international status of the Judiciary, particularly amongst common law jurisdictions. She also commended his sterling contribution in enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of judicial administration. Family Ma is married to Maria Yuen, who is a Justice of Appeal of the Court of Appeal of the High Court. They have one daughter. To avoid any possible conflict of interest, Ma would not hear appeals from cases in which Yuen has sat. Nor would he deal with any administrative matter concerning her.

It is about 6 km to the northwest of the regional centre of Padum, a gentle two-hour walk. Like Dzongkhul Monastery, it belongs to the Drukpa Kargyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, and is the only one of this order in Zanskar which has nuns.Gutschow(2004), p. 99. It is thought to be the oldest religious site in the whole region of Ladakh and Zanskar.Rizvi (1998), p. 254. History The gompa is built to accommodate an ancient chorten 6 m (20 ft) highOsada, Allwright and Kanamaru (2000), p. 302. and of unusual shape, known as the Kanika Chorten, is presumed to date back to the time of the famous Kushan emperor, Kanishka.Rizvi (1998), p. 254. Kanishka's era is now thought to have begun in 127 CE. 'Kanika' is a commonly used form of Emperor Kanishka's name. He is famous in Buddhist literature as a promoter of Buddhism and he is said to have sponsored an important Buddhist conference in nearby Kashmir. This seems to be the only monastery in the region other than Gandhola Monastery in Lahaul which has a history which purportedly goes back to Kushan times. The 17th century Chronicle of Za·πÖs-dkar (Zanskar) says that the (semi?) mythical, > \\". . . high King Ge-sar Gesar of Gli·πÖ came to this blessed Za·πÖs-dkar, where > the religion of heaven and earth arose, and he broke the whole earth with > his feet. 'U-rgyan-pa-dma Padmasambhava came, and exorcised the demons; he > kept down the bad Sa-bkra [= Sa-dgra, 'enemy of the earth'?]. The female > ogre was as if she had fallen on her back. The Sa-ni and Ka-ni-ka > monasteries were erected at the head of the region, the G√±a-nam-gu-ru > monastery of Pi-pi-ti·πÖ on the heart, and the G√±a-nam-gu-ru [monastery] of > Byams-gli·πÖ on the feet.\\" Francke (1926), p. 156. It is of interest to note that, although they are dated here to the time of Padmasambhava (late 8th to early 9th centuries), the Sani and Kanika monasteries are the first ones mentioned. Padmasambhava, or Guru Rinpoche, is said to have dwelt for five years in the small 'Gamshot Lhakang' squeezed between the main building and the corridor, to the right of the Kanika chorten. Inside may be seen a figure of Guru Rinpoche and historical scenes in half relief on both sides of the statue.Schettler (1981), p. 153. Apparently, one can just see the white opening to a cave in a cliff across the river from the monastery where Padmasambhava is also said to have meditated for several years and it is still used as a meditation cell.Loram (2004), p. 196. The monastery is also claimed to be connected with the famous Indian Yogi Naropa (956-1041 CE). There is now small room next to the Kanika chorten where it is thought that Naropa meditated in which there is a veiled bronze statue of the yogi. A group of Kargyu nuns established a small retreat centre at \\"Starkhugnza\\" in the 1990s. It is a site above Sani which was founded by Ngawang Tsering (1657-1732), a famous Zanskar meditator. All of the nunneries in Zanskar are under the spiritual authority of the monks and few have much in the way of endowments.Gutschow(2004), p. 101. Description Unusually, the gompa is not built on a hill or mountain but on flat land. It is in the form of a castle and the Kanika chorten is in the backyard of the enclosing stone walls with chortens mounted at intervals. Next to the Kanika chorten are ten standing stones with engravings of deities in a pre-Tibetan style.Rizvi (1998), p. 254.Schettler (1981), p. 152. One enters the rectangular compound of the gompa through a gate chorten with prayer wheels. As well as the usual depictions of protective deities there is a goat's head filled jewels and prayer cards with \\"Om mani padme hum\\" written on them.Schettler (1981), p. 152. The Assembly Hall or Dukhang has 16 columns and houses images of Chamba, Chenren and Padmasambhava as well as others. Behind the altar is the Gongkhang, a small room containing an ancient figure of Cho Rinpoche and a bookshelf holding the sacred volumes of the Kangyur.Schettler (1981), p. 153. The smaller temple dedicated to Naropa is decorated with unique bas-reliefs in stucco painted in bright colours and with niches for the images. There is also \\"a magnificent plantation of huge old poplars\\" adjoining the gompa - a rare treat in the mostly treeless Zanskar.Rizvi (1998), p. 254. One of the eight most important cremation grounds of Tibetan Buddhists is outside the monastery complex and the cemetery is ringed with ancient rock-carvings which show Indian influences. In the cremation ground is a two-metre-high boulder with a painting of Maitrya on it which shines from the sacrificial oil poured over it by pilgrims. There is also a nearby mast with prayer flags on it.Schettler (1981), p. 154. Holy crematory grounds of Sani monastery Festivals Nungnes has no fixed date but usually takes place in July. Sani Naro-Nasjal is usually in the first week of August, between the 15th and the 20th of the sixth Tibetan month. It takes place during the blooming of the 'Guru Neropa Flower'.Schettler (1981), p. 145. Every year the statue of Naropa is unveiled in late July or early August on the eve of the Naro-Nasjal Festival. Lamas from Bardan Monastery perform masked dances as ritual offering. There is an annual ritual reading of the Tibetan canon, the 'Great Prayer Festival', held at the monastery during winter with the firewood provided by villagers in the regionGutschow (2004), p. 118. From time to time the monks boil up goats' heads in a long ceremony in which symbols of fortune and other garnishings are added according to the wealth of the person sponsoring this activity. These goats' heads hang outside the houses of almost every house in Leh and are thought to bring good fortune. Normally, these symbols are changed annually.Schettler (1981), p. 152.

While at Princeton he was voted the \\"most outstanding senior in the American Whig Cliosophic Literary and Debating Society; president of the Woodrow Wilson Honorary Debate Panel; director of the on- topic program this year; Vendevelt award for most outstanding junior in his policy conference; and a David Lawrence scholarship, awarded by U.S. News and World Report, for his junior year.\\"Tallahassee Democrat, Tallahassee, Florida, June 21, 1981 He subsequently graduated with honors from Georgetown University Law Center in 1984, and was an Editor of the Georgetown Law Journal. He passed the California Bar in 1984,California Bar Association and has been practicing law ever since then. Moore represents individuals, partnerships, and corporations in a wide variety of business disputes. He is also a licensed real estate broker. Moore and his wife Judy, an international property manager, live in Pasadena and own a townhouse in the South of France. They have no children. Politics In 2009, Moore challenged Antonio Villaraigosa. Moore's mayoral platform included repealing the City's business income tax; ending what he called \\"corporate welfare\\" in the form of subsidies and special tax breaks for politically connected businesses; abolishing programs he considered wasteful (such as calligraphy and anti-gang programs that give tax dollars to ex-gang members); hiring enough police to make every neighborhood safe; opposing increased housing density; opposing rate hikes, fee hikes and tax hikes; and making the City's animal shelters \\"no kill.\\" In the 2009 election, Moore raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for his campaign, which was enough to qualify for matching funds. However, Villaraigosa raised 15 times more money, and received twice as many votes. Despite being relatively unknown at the time of the election, Moore received the endorsements of several organizations. Besides running for mayor, Moore has written the official ballot argument against various City propositions that would raise taxes. He also wrote and gathered signatures to support \\"Jamiel's Law,\\" a proposal to deny \\"sanctuary city\\" protection to gang members who are in the country illegally.

The county formed part of the nation's Pushmataha District, or Third District, one of three administrative super- regions. Kiamitia County was formed in 1850 by the General Council of the Choctaw Nation. It was one of 19 counties established. The county took its name from the Kiamichi River. Historians debate the origin and correct spelling of this word, but most have concluded that it was derived from the French word kamichi, meaning \\"horned-screamer,\\" a species of water bird. They say it was named by French explorers during the 1700s.\\"Organization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, pp. 317-318, 323. The county seat of Kiamitia County was Goodland. The original Choctaw settlement of Goodland was four miles north of present-day Hugo, Oklahoma. A United States Post Office operated at Goodland, Indian Territory from August 21, 1871 to February 28, 1902. The community centered at the county seat no longer exists. Modern Goodland is located three miles south of Hugo. A post office called \\"Goodland, Oklahoma,\\" located in the building of the Goodland Indian Orphanage, operated there from April 5, 1915 to July 31, 1944.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 90. Etymology The spelling and rendering of the county's official name appears to have been Kiamitia, reflecting the fact that the name of the Kiamichi River‚Äîfor which it was named‚Äîwas not standardized as such until the 20th century. The Choctaw Nation labeled the county as \\"Kiamitia,\\" as did Angie Debo, the Nation's preeminent historian. She used the term Kiamitia County in her epic history, The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic (1934). Edwin C. McReynolds, in his landmark Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (1965), renders the spelling of the county as \\"Kiamichi\\". Boundaries Kiamitia County's boundaries were designated according to easily recognizable natural landmarks, as was done for all the Choctaw counties. Much of its northern boundary, south of Antlers, was formed by Dumpling Creek. Much of its western boundary was Muddy Boggy Creek. Its eastern boundary, in part, was formed by the Kiamichi River, and its southern boundary was the Red River of the South.Edwin C. McReynolds (1965), Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, plate 38. Establishment As Oklahoma's admission to statehood approached, its representatives participating in the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention and laying out the future state's counties, realized that Kiamitia County could not exist as an economically viable political subdivision. By the time of Oklahoma's statehood in 1907, its county seat existed as the site to hold county court, as well as for educational and religious purposes, but it had not developed as a population center. Hugo, although by then the area's largest town, was until statehood cut off from some of its natural economic hinterland. This area fell within neighboring Red River and Towson counties of the Choctaw Nation. Framers of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who met in 1905 to propose statehood for the Indian Territory, also recognized the difficulties with some of the Choctaw counties. As proposed by the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention, the State of Seqyoyan would abolish the Choctaw county boundaries and establish new ones. In this case, Kiamitia County was generally retained as a jurisdiction, but was to be expanded to the east and west; it was renamed as Hitchcock County, and the proposed county seat was the population center - Hugo. Oklahoma's framers largely adopted the proposed boundaries for Hitchcock County but called it Choctaw County, Oklahoma, and designated Hugo as its county seat. Like all Choctaw counties, Kiamitia County served as an election district for members of the National Council, and as a unit of local administration. Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger. The judge's duties included oversight of overall county administration. The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census. The county ranger advertised and sold livestock that was collected after straying from its owner's territory.Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152.

In those inscriptions his name appears as Tanenu or Tanuu, 'the inert land', a name which characterizes him as a deity of the primeval condition of the earth. Middle Kingdom texts provide the first examples of the form Tatenen. With a staff, Tatenen repelled the evil serpent Apep from the Primeval Mound. He also had a magical mace dedicated to the falcon, venerated as \\"The Great White of the Earth Creator\\".Intersexed and Androgynous Deities in Religion or Mythology. Retrieved 2009-10-21. In one interpretation, Tatenen brought the Djed-pillars of stability to the country, although this is more commonly attributed to Ptah. Ptah-Tatenen Ramesses II (left) with Ptah-Tatenen (right) Both Tatenen and Ptah were Memphite deities. Tatenen was the more ancient, combined in the Old Kingdom with Ptah as Ptah-Tatenen, in their capacity as creator deities. By the Nineteenth Dynasty Ptah-Tatenen is his sole form, and he is worshiped as royal creator god. Ptah-Tatenen can be seen as father of the Ogdoad of Hermopolis, the eight deities who themselves embody the primeval elements from before creation. Portrayal Tatenen's ambiguous portrayal may be a result of his being merged with Ptah. He was always in human form, usually seated with a pharaonic beard, wearing either an Atef- crown (as Ptah-Sokar) or, more commonly, a pair of ram's horns surmounted by a sun disk and two tall feathers. As Tanenu or Tanuu, obviously a chthonic deity, he carried two snakes on his head. He was both feminine and masculine because of his status as a primeval, creator deity. Some depictions show Tatenen with a green complexion (face and arms), as he had connections to fertility and a chthonic association with plants.

Coppola (born May 18, 1946), also known as \\"Mikey Cigars\\", is an American mobster and captain in the Genovese crime family. He has been a key figure in the Genovese crime family New Jersey faction. It is unknown if he is related to Michael \\"Trigger Mike\\" Coppola, who was also a member of the Genovese family. He made national headlines when he went into hiding for 11 years to avoid a possible murder conviction. Early criminal career Michael Coppola has been working for the Genovese family since the 1960s. He became a made man in the late 1970s and was part of a notorious Genovese hit team known as \\"The Fist\\", according to government documents. This team performed murders ordered by the Genovese administration in the late 1970s and 1980s. Coppola was involved in labor racketeering in the trucking industry and New Jersey docks. Coppola served almost five years in prison from 1979 to 1983 for conspiracy and extortion. Coppola became an acting caporegime (captain) while Tino Fiumara was in prison in the 1980s and 1990s,The Changing Face of Organized Crime in New Jersey A Status Report. May 2004. (pg 105-114) running the day-to-day activities of the New Jersey faction Fiurama had orders relayed to him. Alleged murder In 1996 Coppola was charged in the 1977 killing of John \\"Johnny Cokes\\" Lardiere. According to authorities, Lardiere was released for 26 hours from prison to spend the Easter holidays with his family. The reason for his sanctioned killing aren't fully known, but is speculated that he had turned against the mob and was going to give the FBI information on the mob's influence on garbage hauling.http://www.nysun.com/national/alleged-mobster-coppola-is- captured/50323/ Another story has it that Lardiere got into a heated argument with Ralph \\"Blackie\\" Napoli, a caporegime in the Philadelphia crime family and his death was ordered. When Lardiere got out of his car at a Bridgewater, New Jersey motel, The killer was standing in front of him with a .22 automatic pistol, complete with a silencer. When the gunman squeezed the trigger, the gun jammed. Lardiere was both amused and annoyed by the man and allegedly said \\"What're you gonna do now, tough guy?\\". The gunman responded by pulling up his pant leg, and removing a .38 revolver from an ankle holster and shooting Lardiere four times. When police arrived at the crime scene, they knew immediately it was a mob hit. The shooter had left behind his weapons and a hat. In 1996 Lucchese crime family mobster Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Ricciardi who had been arrested on murder and extortion charges, decided to cooperate with authorities. He told the FBI that Lardiere's killer was Coppola. Ricciardi told police that he heard the entire story of Lardiere's murder from Coppola while talking about mob murders with Michael Taccetta at a party in 1983. Fugitive and arrest A gun and hat were left at the murder scene. Since the advancement of forensics since 1977, a judge ordered Coppola to submit a DNA test. When the FBI requested a DNA sample on August 8, 1996 which could have proved he was at the murder scene, Coppola fled his Spring Lake, New Jersey home with his wife. He spent most his time moving between apartments in San Francisco and New York City. During his time on the run, he was featured on America's Most Wanted. Although on the run, authorities believed he was still holding power over organized crime in New Jersey as a fugitive. A fellow New Jersey mobster for the Genovese family and a Furmara/Coppola associate, was charged by the FBI with illegally harboring Coppola during the months before he was caught and arrested.Tino Looks For Chrismas Past, (Sic: Spelling) By Jerry Capeci. The Huffington Post In April 2002, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey obtained an indictment against Fiumara for conspiring to assist Coppola in Coppola's flight. In March 2003, he pleaded guilty to conspiring to conceal and failing to report that he had been in contact with Coppola. In November, a federal judge ordered Fiumara back to prison for eight months for concealing Coppola's whereabouts. While on the run investigators were searching for him in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Florida, Canada, Italy, and Costa Rica. On March 9, 2007, after 11 years on the run Coppola and his wife Linda were found and arrested. While conducting a search of their Upper West Side home they found a book entitled \\"The Methods of Attacking Scientific Evidence\\". Coppola pleaded guilty to fugitive charges and was given a 42-month (3 and a half years) sentence. His wife Linda also pleaded guilty to harboring a fugitive and received probation. Louis James Rizzo Jr., Coppola's step son, was also convicted for conspiracy to harbor a fugitive and sentenced to 3 years in prison.http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/05/longtime_fugitive_michael_copp.html Rizzo was released on November 10, 2009. Trial In 2009 the FBI believed that Coppola was going to turn state's evidence against the Genovese family and cooperate with the FBI. The FBI was willing to give him immunity from prosecution and enter him in the Witness Protection Program if he cooperated. The FBI believed he was involved in the killing of Lawrence Ricci (along with his son and stepson) on orders of Tino Fiumara, one of the men the FBI was hoping to prosecute with Coppola's cooperation. Coppola waived a speedy arraignment and spent the next two nights sleeping at FBI headquarters in lower Manhattan at an undisclosed hotel. He also met with a government arranged lawyer known as a shadow counsel. On the third day, however, Coppola refused to cooperate. His defense lawyer Henry Mazurek said that Coppola only dragged out the process out of concern for his wife, who he feared would also be arrested and charged. In July 2009, Coppola was put on trial for murder, racketeering and extorting the Local 1235 of the International Longshoremen's Association for over 30 years. If found guilty of all counts, he could have faced life imprisonment. Defense lawyer Henry Mazurek told jurors that Coppola admitted to making a \\"rash\\" decision to flee, but that it didn't prove he's a killer. \\"He didn't want to stand trial for a murder he didn't commit,\\" Mazurek said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Dennehy told the jury not to be fooled by Coppola's claims and that Coppola \\"ran because he didn't want to face a jury like you. He hid because he didn't want to face a jury like you.\\" Thomas Riccardi testified that Coppola said he did not agree with the Lardiere murder, but that he followed the orders given to him by Tino Fiumara (who was never charged). Genovese family member turned government witness George Barone was also called to aid the prosecution. Barone was such a difficult witness that the prosecutor apparently decided not to ask him about the Lardiere murder. A witness to the murder, Raymond Zychlinski, was called on as a defense witness in the case. Zychlinski refuted the prosecutor's story that Lardiere's killer taunted him and said all he heard was a \\"horrifying scream\\". On July 21, 2009 Coppola was acquitted of the murder, partially due to the DNA test proving inconclusive since it matched 11 million white men in America. However, he was found guilty of violating the RICO Act for extortion and possessing false identification while he was a fugitive, which could have imprisoned him for up to 20 years. Coppola nodded and mouthed the words, \\"It's O.K.,\\" to his wife after the verdict. Coppola was then taken into custody already serving time for his original fugitive sentence in the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn.http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/12/murder_charge_dismissed_agains.html On December 18, 2009 Judge John Gleeson sentenced Coppola to 16 years in prison.

These organizations include the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, the Society of St. Peter the Apostle, the Holy Childhood Association and the Missionary Union of Priests and Religious. Since 1922, Missio has been the Catholic Church's official support organisation for overseas missions. The Pope specifically asks the Pontifical Mission Societies to help bring the messages of Christ to the world, especially in countries where Christianity is new, young or poor. The societies care for and support the younger churches until they are able to be self-sufficient. Missio raises awareness and fosters prayer and cooperation in the whole Catholic Church, with 120 offices worldwide.

Criticism  David DeVore Jr. has received criticism for exploiting his son. DeVore has stated that he appreciates the concern, but feels that it was innocent and has been a very positive experience for his family.  Medical explanation  In the video, David states that he sees four fingers when looking at his two pointer fingers. He later adds, \\"I don't see anything\\", after which he tells his father: \\"you have four eyes\\". David may have experienced well-known, and extraordinarily disturbing, side effects (blurred and double vision) of the dental anaesthesia. In the medical literature, several ocular complications such as diplopia (blurred and double vision) and dizziness have been reported as a consequence of improperly administered local intraoral anaesthesia. It is estimated that ophthalmologic complications occur in approximately 1 in 1,000 local intraoral anesthetic injections; the majority of documented symptomatic responses arise within 5 minutes and may last for several minutes to hours.

The convention, meeting in Muskogee, Indian Territory in 1905, established the political and administrative layout of a prospective U.S. state it called the State of Sequoyah. Sequoyah was an attempt by the Five Civilized Tribes and others in the Indian Territory‚Äîwho did not wish to be incorporated into an American state‚Äîto establish full statehood for the territory. Although their attempt to achieve statehood was unsuccessful, many of their deliberations in establishing proposed counties proved useful to the framers of Oklahoma, who met just two years later for the purpose of establishing the State of Oklahoma. The boundaries of modern-day Choctaw, Pushmataha and McCurtain counties in Oklahoma are derived largely from the work of the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention. Edwin C. McReynolds, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, 1965. Hitchcock County, with Hugo as its county seat, was proposed, in general, to take the place of Kiamitia County (Kiamichi County), Choctaw Nation, which would be abolished with the advent of Sequoyah statehood. The county was named in honor of Ethan Allen Hitchcock (1835-1909), the federal Commissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes, formerly the American minister (ambassador) to the Russian Empire. Hitchcock County was created and sized appropriate to the economic heft of Hugo merchants, whose trade territory was to be included, more or less whole, in the new county. The usefulness of these arrangements did not escape the attention of Oklahoma‚Äôs framers, who in 1907 borrowed, largely intact, the concept and proposed boundaries of Hitchcock County for Choctaw County, Oklahoma. The recorded minutes of the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention‚Äôs committee on counties have been lost, so no additional information on the proposed Hitchcock County is available.

(2011) Nanotechnology For Dummies. 2 Ed., p.172., For Dummies, . Retrieved July 2011 It provides thrust by emitting charged particles. These particles are cylindrical carbon nanotubes which can either be contained in tanks or manufactured in-flight. By varying the size of these particles, the nanoFET can vary its fuel efficiency (specific impulse), and consequently the amount of thrust output, while maintaining high power efficiency. This adjustability gives the nanoFET the performance characteristics of all the electric thrusters in one. Like other electric propulsion systems, the nanoFET is not intended for operation inside earth's atmosphere but for operations in orbit and deep space. Principle The nanoFET's adjustable force and specific impulse make it extremely versatile. It can produce more thrust while using less power and fuel than any other electronic thrust system. In addition, no charge is built up within the system as a whole; any negative charge built up on one charging pad is canceled by the positive charge built up on another. The high level of integration with its fuel containers makes it extremely compact and easy to place in a space ship. Unfortunately, like all other electronic thrusters, it produces nowhere near the amount of thrust that current chemical rockets produce (a few hundred Newtons compared to ~15 million Newtons). Although the fact that it doesn't need a few million pounds of fuel does significantly offset this power difference, in their current form, nanoFETs are not suitable for earth based launches. A nanoFET works in a fairly straightforward manner. It consists of three main parts: a particle storage area, a charging pad, and an acceleration grid. To start, it transports cylindrical particles to the charging pad which then imposes a charge on the particles. As the particle gains charge, the pulling force from the acceleration grid increases. Eventually, this pulling force overpowers the electro-magnetic and surface adhesion forces between the particles and charging pad. Now the particle begins accelerating towards the acceleration grid until it is shot out of the nanoFET, consequently pushing the nanoFET in the opposite direction. There are two types of nanoFET, a dry- nanoFET and the \\"normal\\" wet-nanoFET. The prefix refers to their method of particle transportation, a wet-nanoFET uses liquid whereas a dry does not.  Wet-NanoFET  Most prototypes and testing up to now has been done on a wet- nanoFET. This design uses a low surface-tension, low viscosity, and non- conductive liquid to transport and/or store cylindrical particles. These particles are carbon-nano-tubes ranging in size from 1 nm to 100 nm. Issues with this design involve the potential for colloid formation, the liquid vaporizing in space, and the increased space and weight. Dry-NanoFET This variation looks to be better than the wet-nanoFET as it has none of the liquid based problems of the wet-nanoFET. Unfortunately, not much information has been released on how it manages to transport particles to the charging pad. Once at the charging pad, it uses a piezoelectric layer to get the particles moving and to get them off the charging pad. This breaks the adhesion force and severely reduces their attraction to the charging pad, allowing the acceleration grid to start pulling them out. Challenges As can be imagined, there were plenty of challenges encountered while designing the nanoFET. One of the main ones was how to transport particles to the charging pad. While a liquid is the easiest way to transport the particles, it can form tiny cones (Taylor cones) and charged droplets (colloids), which severely affect a nanoFET's ability to fine tune its thrust. Initially, non- conductive liquids with low surface tension and viscosity, such as 100cSt silicon oil, were found to be able to withstand a large electro-magnetic field without forming colloids. Later on, prototypes using dry mechanisms to transport the particles were developed. These dry-nanoFET configurations use electronically actuated materials (piezoelectrics) to break surface tension and get the particles moving. Similarly, spherical particles were used in early prototypes but were later substituted with cylindrical particles. This is mainly because cylindrical particles gain much more charge than spherical particles, as they stand on end when being charged. Given also that cylinders penetrate a liquid's surface more easily and take less liquid with them, they are the ideal shape for a nanoFET. These properties allow cylindrical nano- particles to be extracted, whereas the smallest extractable spheres are on the order of millimeters.

Manna worked in the missions in Burma and even served as the Superior General for PIME. Manna did much in his life to promote the missions and the evangelic and apostolic zeal that accompanied it and he established newspapers and movements to help promote this charismatic apostolate. He also held several leadership positions in PIME and used that standing in order to further engage with prospective missionaries. Manna's beatification cause started on 23 August 1973 under Pope Paul VI in which he was titled as a Servant of God while Pope John Paul II both named him as Venerable in 1989 and beatified him in 2001. Life Paolo Manna was born on 16 January 1872 in Avellino as the fifth of six children to Vincenzo Manna and Lorenza Ruggiero. Two uncles were priests as was an older brother; one uncle was stationed in Naples and the other was in Avellino at the church of San Stefano del Sole. His mother died in 1874. Manna was baptized in the Avellino Cathedral on 17 January and he received his Confirmation and First Communion both in 1886. He received his initial education in Avellino and in Naples where he studied both the Latin and Greek languages. Manna underwent philosophical studies at the Gregorian college in Rome from 1889 and in 1891 entered began his theological education in Milan. Manna received his ordination to the priesthood in the Milan Duomo on 19 May 1894 from the former Archbishop of Milan Paolo Angelo Ballerini. Manna left on 27 September 1895 for the missions at Toungoo in Burma and headed to Trieste which he left on 3 October to arrive at his destination on 26 October. He worked there until 4 July 1907 and on three separate occasions had to return to his homeland since he suffered from bouts of tuberculosis. In 1908 he became the editor of the magazine \\"Le Missioni Cattoliche\\" (the Catholic Missions) and in 1914 started publication of \\"Propaganda Missionaria\\" which became a popular broadsheet newspaper. In 1916 he established a religious movement in order to promote and foster greater knowledge for the missions and he sought advice from Guido Maria Conforti who himself founded a similar sort of movement. This congregation spread at a rapid pace more so after Pope Benedict XV recommended its presence in all dioceses in \\"Maximum Illud\\" issued in 1919. In 1919 he founded \\"Italia Missionaria\\" for adolescents to learn and know about the missions and also founded an educational institute for seminarians in Ducenta in Caserta in an effort to foster vocations to the missions. For a decade ‚Äì from 25 August 1924 until 25 October 1934 ‚Äì he served as the Superior General for PIME in Milan. In 1926 ‚Äì at the instigation of Pope Pius XI ‚Äì the Milanese PIME united a branch for missions in Rome to form one collective PIME movement that was more universal. From 9 November 1927 until 14 February 1929 he undertook a long trip to the missions in both Africa and the United States of America. In 1943 he established the magazine \\"Vegna il Tuo regno\\". The order he founded received the title \\"Pontifical\\" after Pope Pius XII allowed for that title to be conferred in a 1956 decree. Manna died in Naples on 15 September 1952; his remains were interred in Ducenta after exhumation and transferral on 23 June 1961. Manna suffered ill health in 1952 and underwent an operation on 13 September but died following complications. Pope John Paul II paid a visit to the late priest's tomb on 13 December 1990. Beatification The beatification process opened on 23 August 1973 under Pope Paul VI after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled Manna as a Servant of God. Cardinal Corrado Ursi inaugurated the cognitional process in Naples on 4 May 1973 and later oversaw its successful closure in 1976; theologians approved his spiritual writings on 15 February 1980 after determining his writings did not contravene official doctrine while the C.C.S. later validated the cognitional process in 1981. The C.C.S. later received the Positio in 1985 from the postulation. Theologians approved the cause on 10 May 1988 as did the C.C.S. on 10 January 1989 while Pope John Paul II confirmed the late priest's life of heroic virtue and titled him as Venerable on 18 February 1989. The miracle for beatification was investigated and later received C.C.S. validation on 29 September 1995. The medical board approved this on 9 March 2000 as did theologians on 27 October 2000 and the C.C.S. sometime later; John Paul II approved the healing to be a miracle and beatified Manna in Saint Peter's Square on 4 November 2001. Publications Manna wrote a number of books and booklets. His proposals regarding work in the missions anticipated the developments at the Second Vatican Council more so the declarations \\"Ad Gentes\\" 2: 39. He spent his entire life promoting the missions while at the same time opposing all forms of cultural imperialism.

Bethmann in MGH Scriptores VII, 490.), bishop of Cambrai as Gerard I, had formerly been chaplain to Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, and helpful to the latter in his political negotiations with Robert the Pious, King of France. In 1024 Gerard called a synod in Arras to confront a purported heresy fomented by the Gundulfian heretics, who denied the efficacy of the Eucharist. The records of this synod, the Acta Synodi Atrebatensis,Patrologia Latina 142, cols. 1269‚Äì1312. preserve a summary of orthodox Christian doctrine of the early eleventh century, as well contemporary peace-making practices. According to this text's author, the heretics were convinced by Gerard's explanation of orthodoxy, renounced their heresy, and were reconciled with the church. Gerard was apparently a member of the high nobility of the Low Countries. He the second son of Arnold, seigneur of Florennes in the county of Namur, who was the son of a Count Godfrey, count of Hainaut, possibly Godfrey I, Duke of Lower Lorraine. His mother was Ermentrude, daughter of Count Godfrey \\"the captive\\". He was a student of the great Gerbert of Aurillac, the leading theologian of the tenth century, and a supporter of the monastic reformer Richard of Verdun, abbot of Saint- Vanne.Diane Reilly, Art of Reform in Eleventh-Century Flanders: Gerard of Cambrai, Richard of Saint-Vanne and the Saint-Vaast Bible, Studies in the history of Christian traditions 128 (Leiden) 2006. Between 1002 and 1010, while he was a canon at Reims he founded the Abbey of St John the Baptist on his father's estate at Florennes, with Richard as its first abbot.Ursmer Berli√®re, Monasticon Belge, vol. 1 (Maredsous, 1897), pp. 5-6. At Florennes, on 12 September 1015, Godfrey II, Duke of Lower Lorraine, whose appointment Gerard had recommended to the Emperor, defeated both of his rivals, Lambert I, Count of Leuven, brother-in-law of Otto, and Reginar IV, count of Mons killing Lambert and forcing Reginar to make peace. In 1015, Gerard transferred the abbey of Florennes to the church of Li√®ge.The abbey church was consecrated in 1026. The early history of the abbey is known via the Miracula S. Gengulfi, written in 1028/1045 by Abbot Gonzo. The abbey was completely destroyed during the French Revolution. (Florennes (Municipality)). drawing together a community of monks from Verdun. Texts from the scriptorium show the innovative separation of words with spaces.Paul Saenger, Space Between Words: the origins of silent reading 2000, p 192, and note 78. Gerard was the earliest known theorist to provide a justification of the division of European society into the three so-called estates of the realm.Georges Duby, (Arthur Goldhammer, tr.) The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined (1980), part 1, chapter 2. Writing between 1023 and 1025, he observed, in the words of Georges Duby, \\"that there were distinctions between men, an essential inequality which could be compensated only by charity, mercy and mutual service\\" within the framework of divinely ordained natural law.Quoted in Rodney Bruce Hall, \\"Moral Authority as a Power Resource\\" International Organization 51, 4 (1997): 591‚Äì622, at p. 598. In addition to his role in the Investiture Controversy, Gerard was a voice in the implementation of the Peace and Truce of God movement to limit warfare.David C. Van Meter, \\"The Peace of Amiens-Corbie and Gerard of Cambrai's oration of the three functional orders: the date, the context, the rhetoric\\", Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire 74 (1996:633-57), esp. pp 644-57.

Koziol (1987), \\"Monks, Feuds, and the Making of Peace in Eleventh-Century Flanders,\\" Historical Reflections, 14(3):531. The traditional date is 1036, but Georges Duby has argued for a re-dating to 1024. During his episcopacy, the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Cambrai was reconsecrated on 18 October 1030. In 1023‚Äì25, Gerard was working on his Vita Gaugerici, a life of Gaugericus, one of the early bishops of Cambrai. He made extensive use of the library of Marchiennes, a former nunnery converted into a male monastery in 1024. Its abbot, Leduin, was a close ally of Gerard's in the campaign for monastic reform in the diocese. Leduin possessed a manuscript, used by Gerard, containing Gregory the Great's Regula pastoralis and extracts from Taius of Zaragoza's De malorum concordia, and Bachiarius' De paenitentia.Steven Vanderputten and Diane J.

It is the European member of the Wanhua Chemical Group. The company specializes in isocyanates (MDI, TDI), PVC and chlor-alkali (vinyl) businesses. The main production site is located in Kazincbarcika, Hungary but the production is also supported by other European production capacities located in Ostrava, the Czech Republic and Kƒôdzierzyn-Ko≈∫le, Poland. Several branch offices are available in Hungary, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Italy and Poland. Since 2008 a new R&D; and technical support center was established in G√∂d√∂ll≈ë. History  Beginnings  The establishment of the Borsodi Vegyi Kombin√°t (BVK) the predecessor of Wanhua-BorsodChem, was decided at the end of 1949, based on the Borsod coal, the water of the Saj√≥, the proximity of the road and the railway. In the new industrial area, a decision was made to build a coal classifier, a coking plant, a coal-fired power plant and a Lignite-based chemical plant (nitrogen plant), as well as service plants, with a budget allocation of HUF 1 billion. The giant investment took place between 1950 and 1955, and was inaugurated on 10 December 1955. It became the largest industrial facility in the country at the time. Deficiencies and errors made during construction delayed the start of continuous production for 3 years.  PVC era  The year 1963 brought the biggest changes in BVK's life to date. They switched to the production of natural gas-based synthesis gas, and in parallel, coke-based operations were discontinued. They merged with the Berente Chemical Works and launched the Olefin I program, under which the production of thermoplastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) began for the first time in the country. They built their mercury cathode chlorine and hydrochloric acid plant. The second expansion of the nitrogen plant began in 1964, during which the construction of their urea plant was also started. In 1969, the PVC-II Factory, which also produces PVC powder, was put into operation. At that time, BVK was the 6th largest company in the Hungarian chemical industry in terms of headcount. A modern plastic factory capable of producing 150,000 tons of PVC per year was built in 1971. This became the largest chemical investment in Hungary to date. Three years later, the expansion continued with the construction of a new PVC plant (PVC III), which was built on oil instead of natural gas and processed ethylene purchased from the Tiszai Vegyi Kombin√°t (TVK). From the early 1980s, great emphasis was placed on plastic processing. In 1983, the mixing plant and the PVC window plant, the last plants in the program, were put into operation and the installation of the phosgene plant was completed.  BorsodChem   Stock market membership in Budapest and London  On 1 August 1991, as the legal successor to the 1949-founded Borsodi Vegyi Kombin√°t, the company BorsodChem was officially established. BorsodChem has become one of the largest chemical companies in Hungary. In 1996, it became the first company to register its shares on the Budapest Stock Exchange as well as the London Stock Exchange. In 2000, he bought 28.5 percent of the shares of Tiszai Vegyi Kombin√°t, which were later resold to MOL. M&A; incident in 2000 Irish- registered offshore company Milford Holdings purchased a 24.7% stake in 2000. It sold the stake to CIB, the Hungarian subsidiary of Banca Commerciale Italiana. Vienna Capital Partners was involved in the affair. Hungarian prime minister called for an investigation into the deal of M&A; (Mergers and Acquisitions) .Corporate Governance Risk Survey in Hungary. Merit Research Working ePapers, No 5, June 2002  Wanhua Industrial Group  In 2006, the majority ownership of the company was acquired by Permira Venture Capital Fund, which delisted the shares from the stock exchange in the following year. Since 2011, BorsodChem Zrt. has been managed by the Chinese Wanhua Industrial Group the fastest growing group of companies producing and selling polyurethane raw materials in the world. Today, Wanhua ‚Äì BorsodChem is Hungary's leading chemical company and one of Europe's leading producers of MDI, TDI and PVC raw materials and a leading manufacturer of specialty chemical products.  Developments  At the end of 2018, Wanhua ‚Äì BorsodChem decided to invest in brownfields and had begun to build an aniline factory. Of the cost of 142.2 million euros, 45 million is covered by the Hungarian state subsidy. The handover of the factory is expected in 2021. With the start-up of the new plant, the company will create about fifty new jobs.  Again on the stock market  In 2019, a successor of Wanhua Industrial Group, injected the shares of BorsodChem into the listed associate company Wanhua Chemical Group.  Administrative changes  Thanks to the establishment of Borsodi Vegyi Kombin√°t and the huge number of workers attracted here, Kazincbarcika was awarded the city's rank and became one of the first so called 'socialist city' in 1954. Its location in Berente, a village annexed to Kazincbarcika in 1954, caused several residents resenting the fact that they receive only a small part of the local taxes the factory pays. This led to the secession of Berente in 1999.

The county was often referred to as Chuala County.Cyrus Byington, A Dictionary of the Choctaw Language. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1978. Cedar County was established by the Choctaw Nation‚Äôs Doaksville Constitution of 1860. It ceased to exist on November 16, 1907, along with the Choctaw Nation and the Indian Territory, upon the advent of Oklahoma‚Äôs statehood. The territory comprising the former county is now included in the Pushmataha County and McCurtain County in Oklahoma. The county seat of Cedar County was Sulphur Springs, located near present-day Rattan, Oklahoma in Pushmataha County. Like all Choctaw counties, Cedar County served as an election district for members of the National Council, and as a unit of local administration. Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger. The judge‚Äôs duties included oversight of overall county administration. The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census. The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152.

Tomar is one of Portugal's historical jewels and, more significantly, was the last Templar town to be commissioned for construction. Tomar was especially important in the 15th century when it was a centre of Portuguese overseas expansion under Henry the Navigator, the Grand Master of the Order of Christ, successor organization to the Templars in Portugal. Geography Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica (Republic Square) and Pa√ßos do Concelho (17th century Town Hall), in Tomar. The bronze statue represents Gualdim Pais, founder of the town. Tomar lies in the most fertile region of Portugal, and one of the most fertile in the whole of the Iberian Peninsula: the Ribatejo (\\"by the river Tagus\\") meadows. It is located in the district of Santar√©m. The predominant treescape is agricultural, consisting of olive, pine and fig trees. The seat of the municipality is the city of Tomar, which comprises the parishes of Santa Maria dos Olivais and S√£o Jo√£o Batista. Tomar is also the capital of the M√©dio Tejo (Mid-Tagus river) region. The Nab√£o River cuts across what was the ancient city of Nabantia: its inhabitants are called Nabantinos. Parishes Administratively, the municipality is divided into 11 civil parishes (freguesias): * Al√©m da Ribeira e Pedreira * Asseiceira * Carregueiros * Casais e Alviobeira * Madalena e Beselga * Olalhas * Paialvo * Sabacheira * S√£o Pedro de Tomar * Tomar (S√£o Jo√£o Baptista) e Santa Maria dos Olivais * Serra e Junceira History Castle and Convent of the Knights Templar of Tomar; transferred in 1344 to the Knights of the Order of Christ Under the modern city lies the Roman city of Sellium. After the conquest of the region from the Moors in the Portuguese Reconquista, the land was granted in 1159 as a fief to the Order of the Knights Templar. In 1160, Gualdim Pais, the Order's Grand Master in Portugal and Tomar's somewhat mythical founder, laid the first stone of the Castle and Convent of the Knights Templar that would become the headquarters of the Order in Portugal. Local traditional legends preach that the choice was for mystical reasons and by divine inspiration, and from practices by the Grand Master of geomancy, based on exercises taken from luck and predestination. Reinforcing this magical view is the setting of the site among a small chain of seven elevations (lugar dos sete montes), which became known as the city of seven hills, as the seven hills of Jerusalem, the seven hills of Rome or the seven columns of Constantinople. \\\\- TOMAR DOS TEMPL√ÅRIOS: A SEDE PORTUGUESA DA ORDEM DOS TEMPL√ÅRIOS - Ademir Luiz da Silva, Revista Mosaico, v.4, n.1, p.92-103, jan./jun. 2011 - in Portuguese The foral or feudal contract was granted in 1162 by the Grand Master to the people. The Templars ruled from Tomar a vast region of central Portugal which they pledged to defend from Moorish attacks and raids. Like many lords of the unpopulated former frontier region of central Portugal, the villagers were given relatively liberal conditions in comparison with those of the northern regions of Portugal, in order to attract new immigrants. Those inhabitants who could sustain a horse were obliged to pay military service in return for privileges. They were not allowed the title of Knight which was reserved to the Templars. Women were also admitted to the Order, although they did not fight. In 1190 Abu Yusuf al-Mansur, a Moroccan caliph, and his army attacked Tomar. However the crusader Knights and their 72-year-old leader, Gualdim Pais, kept them at bay. A plaque commemorates this bloody battle at the Porta do Sangue at the Castelo Templ√°rio (Castle of Tomar). In 1314, under pressure from the Pope Clement V, the order was suppressed. The French king (Philip IV), who owed the Templars huge debts, held the pope a virtual prisoner and coerced him to suppress the order on bases of false accusations and forced confessions. The Order was suppressed in most of Europe and its holdings were to be transferred to the Knights Hospitalers. Instead, King Dinis negotiated the transfer of the Order's possessions and personnel in Portugal to a newly created Order of Christ. This Order moved in 1319 to Castro Marim, but in 1356 it returned to Tomar. In the 15th century and thereafter, the (cleric) Grand Master of the Order was nominated by the Pope and the (lay) Master or Governor by the King, instead of being elected by the monks. Henry the Navigator was made the Governor of the Order, and it is believed that he used the resources and knowledge of the Order to succeed in his enterprises in Africa and in the Atlantic. The cross of the Order of Christ that was painted in the sails of the caravels that crossed the seas, and the Catholic missions in the new lands were under the authority of the Tomar clerics until 1514. Henry, enriched by his overseas enterprises, was the first ruler to ameliorate the buildings of the Convento de Cristo since its construction by Gualdim Pais. He also ordered dams to be built to control the river Nab√£o and swamps to be drained. This allowed the burgeoning town to attract more settlers. Henry ordered the new streets to be designed in a rational, geometrical fashion, as they can still be seen today. View of the round Templar church (12th century) of the Convent of the Order of Christ Church of Santa Maria do Olival, burial place for the Knights Templar of Tomar In 1438, King Duarte, who had fled Lisbon because of the Black Death, died here. Just after 1492 with the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, the town increased further with Jewish refugee artisans and traders. The very large Jewish minority dynamized the city with new trades and skills. Their experience was vital in the success of the new trade routes with Africa. The original synagogue still stands. In the reign of Manuel I of Portugal the convent took its final form within the Manueline renaissance style. With the growing importance of the town as master of Portugal's overseas empire, the leadership of the Order was granted to the King by the Pope. However, under pressure from the monarchs of Spain, the King soon proclaimed by Edict that all the Jews remaining within the territory of Portugal would be after a short period considered Christians, although simultaneously he forbade them to leave, fearing that the exodus of Jewish men of knowledge and capital would harm Portugal's burgeoning commercial empire. Jews were largely undisturbed as nominal Christians for several decades, until the establishment of a Tribunal of the Portuguese Inquisition by the initiative of the clergy in the town. Under persecution, wealthier Jews fled, while most others were forced to convert. Hundreds of both Jews and New Christians were arrested, tortured and about 1,000 were you executed in autos da f√©, in a frenzy of persecution that peaked around 1550. Many others (c. 38,000) were expropriated of their property or penance. Jewish ascendancy, more than Jewish religion, together with personal wealth determined whom would be persecuted, since the expropriations reverted to the institution of the Inquisition itself. The town lost then, with the persecution of its merchants and professionals, most of its relevance as a trading centre. New Christian names among the inhabitants are very common today. In 1581 the city was the seat of the Portuguese Cortes (Feudal Parliament) which acclaimed the King of Spain Felipe II as Portugal's Filipe I. During the 18th century Tomar was one of the first regions of Portugal to develop industry. In the reign of Maria I, with royal support, a textile factory of J√°come Ratton was established against the opposition of the Order. The hydraulic resources of the river Nab√£o were used to supply energy to this and many other factories, namely paper factories, foundries, glassworks, silks and soaps. Tomar was occupied by the French during the Napoleonic invasions, against which it rebelled. The Duke of Wellington, with his Portuguese and English troops, liberated the city afterwards. In 1834 all the religious orders, including the Order of Christ, were disbanded. International relations Tomar is twinned with: * Emden, Germany Attractions Church of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista (15-16th centuries) in the centre of Tomar. Nab√£o Tomar attracts many tourists because of its varied monuments. These include: *Castle and Convent of the Order of Christ - Unesco World Heritage Site : Magnificent ensemble of 12th- to 16th-century architecture and art, it is the main monument of the city and one of the most important in Portugal. *Aqueduct of Peg√µes - It was built in the sixteenth century and 17th century to bring water to the convent of Christ in Tomar under command of king Philip I. It's an amazing monument with 6 kilometers, and in places it reaches a height of 30 meters. The construction started in 1593 and finished in 1614 and it is the biggest and most important construction of the Philip I kingdom in Portugal. You can take the small \\"train tour bus\\" in the city center that takes you to the highest point of the monument. *Church of Santa Maria do Olival: This Gothic church (13th century) was built as burial ground for the Templar Knights and their treasure. The great importance of the church in medieval times is proven by the existence of a papal bull, even during the last period Templar, who put this temple is directly dependent on the Pope, outside the purview of any diocese. Later, through two bulls, one of Pope Nicholas V (1454) and another of Pope Callistus III (1456), was granted or obligation given to the Order of Christ to establish the spiritual duty on all lands found by the Kingdom of Portugal, territories as \\"DIOCESIS nullius\\", making this See of all the parish churches of the territories found in Asia, Africa and America mother and being given the honor of the cathedral. *Synagogue of Tomar: Tomar has the best preserved mediaeval synagogue of Portugal. It was built in the mid-15th century by Prince Henry The Navigator, and has an interesting interior with Gothic vaulting and columns with classic capitals. Since 1939 it houses the small Jewish Museum Abra√£o Zacuto, with interesting pieces related to Jewish history in Portugal. *Church of Saint John the Baptist (S√£o Jo√£o Baptista): The main church of Tomar is located in the main square of the town, in front of the Municipality (17th century) and a modern statue of Gualdim Pais. The church was built between the 15th and 16th centuries and has many interesting artistic details, like the flamboyant Gothic portal, the Manueline tower with a 16th-century clock, the decorated capitals of the inner columns of the nave and several panels painted in the 1530s by one of Portugal's best Renaissance artists, Greg√≥rio Lopes. *Chapel of Our Lady of the Conception (Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o): Chapel built between 1532 and 1540 in pure Renaissance style, begun by Jo√£o de Castilho and finished by Diogo de Torralva. It was intended to be the burial chapel of King John III. Its beautiful and clear architecture turns it into one of the best early Renaissance buildings in Portugal. It's one of the first Maneirist Monuments of all Europe. *Church and Convent of Saint Iria: Located near the Nab√£o river, this early 16th-century building has a nice Renaissance portal and altar, as well as Manueline architectonic details. * Museu dos Fosforos (Matchbox Museum) - The biggest private matchbox collection in Europe * Museu de Arte Moderna - Colec√ß√£o Jos√© Augusto Fran√ßa (Art Gallery) * Casa Museu Fernando Lopes Gra√ßa * Casa dos Cubos (Art Gallery) The streets and squares of the picturesque centre of Tomar are organised following a chessboard pattern, a rare feature for a mediaeval city, instituted by Prince Henry The Navigator, which later inspired the pattern used for the rebuilding of Lisbon after the earthquake in 1755. Scattered throughout the town there are many interesting houses with Renaissance, Baroque and Romantic fa√ßades. By the river Nab√£o, near the bridge, there is a park and garden that offer nice views of the city and surroundings.

Although it retained a lively community for decades following the railroad's construction in the 1880s, the towns along the railroad sapped it of potential commercial success. Nelson continues to be home to several families, and as such remains the area's oldest settlement.

Under the Arab Street, The New York Times, October 23, 2002. In some contexts it refers more specifically to the lower socioeconomic strata of Arab society. It is used primarily in the United States and Arab countries. While it is sometimes assumed, particularly in the United States, to have been borrowed from Arabic political discourse, its evolution has followed a circular course from Arabic to English and then back. Lebanese newspapers began referring to just \\"the street\\" during the 1950s; later in the decade reports in The New York Times used the term in English to explain Gamal Abdel Nasser's broad appeal not just in his native Egypt but across the Arab world. Later commentators added the \\"Arab\\" and eventually dropped the scare quotes to create the current usage, which became widespread in American media during the First Palestinian Intifada in 1987. Arab media began using it themselves a decade later.Regier and Khalidi, 26. However, its usage still differs between the two languages. In the Western English-language media, only Arab popular sentiment is referred to as the \\"street\\"; Arabic commentators use the expression in the same sense to refer to not just public opinion in their countries but in the West as well.Regier and Khalidi, 24. Due to the many negative connotations attached to the use of \\"street\\" as a modifier, the use of the term in English has been criticized as fostering stereotypes of a population easily roused to violence. The \\"Arab street\\" thus alternately justifies the need for an authoritarian ruler, or constrains the potentially moderate actions of those rulers. In the wake of the Arab Spring early in the 2010s, the concept of the Arab street has been revisited and challenged. The revolutions that toppled governments have, to some, shown how deficient and outdated Western understandings of Arab public opinion, shaped by the concept of the \\"Arab street\\", had been and have even led some to suggest it no longer be used. Others, including some Arabs, saw the uprisings as vindicating the importance of public opinion in their cultures and changing the popular concept of the street within them. Definition Attempts to directly define the Arab street have usually equated it with Arab public opinion. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, who once covered the Middle East and frequently writes about the region, called it \\"the broad mass of public opinion\\" there in 2002, as distinct from extremist opinion, which he calls the \\"Arab basement\\". As of 2013, Collins English Dictionary defines \\"the Arab street\\" as an informal term for \\"public opinion in the Arab world.\\"\\"Arab street\\", Collins English Dictionary, 2013, retrieved September 4, 2013 Nevertheless, even as the term came into wide use, there was disagreement about its exact meaning. In 2002 a U.S. State Department official, reporting on a meeting between President George W. Bush and the leaders of Japan and Pakistan, said that the latter, Pervez Musharraf, had referred to the \\"possibility of trouble in the Arab street, whatever that is\\"US State Department transcript: \\"Bush meets with leaders of Japan and Pakistan (Background briefing on issues raised in Sept. 12 consultations),\\" September 13, 2002; cited at Regier and Khalidi, 13 over the upcoming invasion of Iraq. This uncertainty has led to confusion over what the term represents. During the same period of time, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld later recalled, Arab leaders urged him to make sure the operation went quickly as they \\"were worried about the 'Arab street' erupting in anger at the West's invasion of a Muslim country. I was skeptical of the idea that a monolithic Arab street existed ... but I did understand that popular discontent could cause them difficulties.\\"Rumsfeld, Donald. Known and Unknown: A Memoir, Penguin Group, New York, 2011, p. 4449. A large street demonstration in alt=A street between medium-height modern white apartment blocks filled with people, some carrying signs According to a 2009 paper on the evolution and use of the term by professors Terry Regier and Muhammad Ali Khalidi, some of that confusion results from a frequent second meaning. encompassing the majority of Arab public opinion, they observe, another usage seems to associate it more specifically with \\"a presumed seething underclass within Arab society, one that is viewed primarily as a source of political trouble.\\" In a 1993 exploration of the Arab street's existence, David Pollock of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy began by acknowledging these connotations: \\"The very name evokes images of mystery, mobs and mullahs; it sounds vaguely subterranean, if not sinister; and it is most often regarded in the West with a peculiar mixture of fascination, dismissal and fear.\\"Pollock, David; The Arab Street? Public Opinion in the Arab World; 1992, p. 1. Retrieved September 4, 2013. In November 2001, a front-page story in The New York Times on the Arab street's rising power in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. two months earlier began by evoking the term's visual connotations and the corresponding power vested in it by fearful Western observers: \\"The Arab street: the well-worn phrase evokes men clustered around dusty coffeehouse tables, discussing the events of the day with well-earned cynicism between puffs on a hookah‚Äîyet suddenly able to turn into a mob, powerful enough to sweep away governments.\\" Ten years later, columnist Edwin Black wrote on the Fox News website, after protesters in Egypt began calling for longtime president Hosni Mubarak to step down, something that had previously been unthinkable, that the leader had fallen afoul of the Arab street, Arabic In Arabic, the word for street (ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿπ, ash-shƒÅri øThis transliteration reflects the difference between sun and moon letters in Arabic, under which when the article al- is followed by certain consonants, among them sh-\\", the \\"l\\" sound is elided.) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, the point of a weapon, and law or lawfulness and legitimacy in both the secular and religious sense. Among those words are sharia, the term for Islamic religious and moral law. ShƒÅri ø itself can also be used to refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the source of all religious law. According to Regier and Khalidi, Arabic commentators use the term much as it is used in the West, when they discuss public opinion in the Arab world. However, they also refer to the \\"streets\\" of other, non-Arab countries in much the same way‚Äî\\"feelings of anger and shock are running very high in the American street [after the September 11 attacks]\\", for example. And in contrast to the fear of political upheaval frequently implied by Western writers, their use of \\"the Arab street\\" often carries positive and respectful overtones, such as when Al-Ayyam praised \\"the great Egyptian street, which has always been the heart and conscience of the Arabs\\" in 1997. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah provided an example of both differences in usage when he praised \\"the Israeli street\\" for its reaction to the Winograd report on Israel's conduct of the 2006 Lebanon War. History \\"Arab street\\" arises originally from Arabic usage, but only became widely recognized through English adaptation. English In English, the earliest use of the word \\"street\\" in reference to the political role of popular opinion Regier and Khalidi found was that cited in the Oxford English Dictionary's (OED) entry on the word, where one of its definitions in the plural is \\"loosely as the realm of the common man, and esp. the source of popular political support.\\" Wyndham Lewis's 1931 book Hitler, a defense of the German dictator that he later disowned, credited Hitler's political success in part to his \\"mastery of the street\\",, cited by Regier and Khalidi, 23‚Äì24. which the OED reported as the earliest use of the word in that political sense. It did not enter widespread use at that time. The earliest use of \\"street\\" in a political context that Regier and Khalidi could find was a 1950 editorial in the Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar: \\"The street,\\" they wrote, \\"is here conceived as an aggrieved everyman, manipulated and exploited by the political class,\\" a sense that later manifested itself in Western discourse.Regier and Khalidi, 25. alt=A black and white image of a man at left waving to a crowd behind him in the rest of the image that is waving Egyptian flags and holding a picture of him This usage made its debut in the American media early in 1957. Times correspondent Hanson Baldwin, in an article on the personalities in the Middle East in the wake of the previous year's Suez Crisis, focused on Gamal Abdel Nasser, president and prime minister of Egypt. Baldwin credited Nasser's success to \\"his appeal to 'the street', which carries great political power in the Arab world.\\" He also inaugurated the concept of the street as a source of political danger to established hierarchies, saying Nasser's prestige was \\"probably at a new high with the Arab street mobs, by which Arab governments are so often made or broken.\\" Two years later, the title and subtitle of a Times Magazine article made explicitly clear that the Arab mob and the street were related: \\"Power of 'The Street' in the Arab World; Here is an analysis of that frightening phenomenon, the mob, and the role it plays in the contest between freedom and tyranny in the Mideast.\\"Regier and Khalidi, 21‚Äì22. Nasser himself, in speeches, often cited not the street but \\"al-gamƒÅhƒ´r\\"This transliteration reflects the pronunciation of the Arabic letter ÿ¨, often given the value , equivalent to an English soft \\"j\\", as or an English hard \\"g\\", in Egyptian Arabic. (ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖÿßŸáŸäÿ±) as his political base. The Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic defines it as \\"the masses\\", or \\"the people\\"; in the singular it can mean \\"the public\\" or a crowd or throng of people. Another form of the same root is jumh≈´rƒ´ah, the word for republic.Wehr, 163. GamƒÅhƒ´r, rendered in English as \\"the masses\\", carries Marxist overtones of class struggle. Northwestern University professor Joe Khalil, who studies the Arab media, explains that it can \\"refer to everything from the indoctrinated members of a political party to a group of enthusiasts at a pop performance.\\" Within a political context it most often denotes \\"several groups of people bound together by a common activity or ideology and easily recognizable within a larger population.\\" The term, like the Pan-Arabism it was also associated with, gradually fell into disuse after Egypt was defeated by Israel both in the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War of 1967. \\"Street\\" was first grammatically modified by \\"Arab\\" in English in a 1970 article in The Review of Politics, a political science journal. The writer, Robert Sullivan, alluded to the role of \\"radio propaganda aimed at mobilizing the Arab 'street'\\" during military conflicts. Seven years later, another journal article by Steve J. Rosen argued that Israel's development of nuclear weapons would lead to \\"a revolution of declining expectations in the Arab 'street.'\\" Regier and Khalidi speculate that the use of scare quotes by both Rosen and Sullivan suggest that they are using a term not familiar to them, something they may have adapted from a foreign language. Since both of them were academics specializing in Middle Eastern studies, it could be presumed that they had at least a reading knowledge of Arabic and were familiar with the term's use in Arabic media in the region, Regier and Khalidi argued. The two further speculated that Rosen, who often took strongly pro-Israel positions and later became policy director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, may have also perhaps picked up the term from Israeli media and scholars, as the \\"street\\" terminology for popular opinion is also used sometimes in Hebrew. alt=A black-and-white poster showing a boot with a Star of David at the heel stepping on an irregularly- shaped piece of land with spikes sticking up, one of which is piercing the boot An Israeli attorney's 1987 comment to The Christian Science Monitor, that his country had never \\"tried to root out the PLO in the Arab street\\" was the first modern use in its present sense without the scare quotes. By the end of the decade it came into wide use in both American academic and popular media, as coverage of the First Palestinian Intifada dominated news from the region. This may have been the result of geopolitical shifts taking place at the same time. The New York Times language columnist William Safire anonymously quoted a Middle East expert who told him that before the late 1980s the term \\"Arab masses\\" had been used instead. \\"With the eclipse of the Soviet Union, that phrase disappeared because [it] had too much of a Marxist‚ÄìSoviet‚ÄìCommunist tilt to it.\\" In his 1992 paper on the Arab street as a political phenomenon, David Pollock uses \\"Arab masses\\" only once, and in quotes.Pollock, 29. Arabic The first use of the term \\"Arab street\\" in Arabic media occurred in 1997. The two researchers were not certain whether it had seen any use prior to that year as the database they used only went as far back as 1995. It has become quite common in Arabic media since then, suggesting, according to Regier and Khalidi, that a term created in English from a borrowed Arabic term has been \\"re-imported\\" into Arabic.Regier and Khalidi, 26. Criticism Negative connotations While sometimes the American media used \\"Arab street\\" as to be interchangeable with \\"Arab public opinion,\\" suggesting rationality and calm, Regier and Khalidi found that most uses carried the connotations of incipient unrest. \\"We propose that a central association of the Arab street is indeed that of a volatile potential mob, dangerous to the established order of Arab states, and thus to any agreements Western powers may have with those states.\\" While users may not always have intended it that way, in many cases they did.Regier and Khalidi, 13‚Äì15. They identified three factors that gave rise to these connotations. First, other common English phrases such as \\"man in/on the street\\", \\"street smart\\" and \\"the word on the street\\" suggest the street is associated with uneducated and possibly misinformed opinion. The street is further associated with illegality through terms like \\"street crime\\" and the \\"street value\\" of contraband such as illicit drugs. Both of these, Regier and Khalidi observe, help strengthen the sense that the Arab street's opinions are uninfluenced and uncontrollable by any official source or body.Regier and Khalidi, 16‚Äì17. Lastly, terms like \\"street person\\" for one who is homeless and \\"streetwalker\\" for a prostitute link the street to desperate personal circumstances. Regier and Khalidi note that this has historical connections to the term \\"street Arab\\", for a homeless child, now out of regular use but still encountered by readers of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes mysteries, where the titular character relied at times on a network of such individuals as informants. Edward Said, a Palestinian- born professor of English literature at Columbia University who frequently spoke and wrote on behalf of his people's cause, along with casting a critical eye on Western \\"orientalism\\" and how it affected perceptions of non-Western cultures such as the Arab world, explicitly and critically drew the connection between the two terms, they note, quoting him as saying: Regier and Khalidi write that the view of the Arab street, and by extension all Arab public opinion, as that of a mob always poised to rise violently, does Western publics a disservice. Not only is it inaccurate, it confronts them with \\"something quite unlike Westerners' conception of their own publics ... It has the potential to contribute to an ongoing misreading of the Arab public among U.S. readers.\\" Harmful to Arab-American relations Before the war, U.S. officials like alt=A balding man with glasses, wearing a suit, sits on the left of a couch next to a hirsute man in traditional Arab headress and attire on the right. In front, on a coffee table, is a vase full of flowers; behind them is a man in desert camouflage and another man in a suit in front of a mirrored partition In late 1990 after Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait, ultimately leading to the Gulf War, American commentators and Middle East experts expressed concern about the possible consequences of the Arab street in the region rising up in support of Saddam against their own governments, many of whom (particularly Egypt) had joined the military coalition led by the United States. This did not happen when the actual war began, nor for the hundred days of combat before Iraqi forces retreated and surrendered. A year later, in 1992, David Pollock of the United States Information Agency (USIA) wrote a lengthy paper arguing that those commentators had seriously misunderstood the Arab street and, by extension, all Arab public opinion. As applied, Pollock saw two predominant conceptualizations of the Arab street. One, he called the \\"underrated\\" school, which usually claimed that \\"in the absence of Arab democratic institutions public opinion in those countries is politically irrelevant.\\"Pollock, 3. Other members of that school went further, claiming that Arab public opinion was \\"unknowable, and therefore unfit for serious discussion.\\" A small minority considered the Arab street a concept bound with Pan-Arabism, by then largely discredited, and by extension similarly irrelevant.Pollock, 7‚Äì8. On the opposite side was what he called the \\"exaggerated\\" school, which saw the Arab elites as \\"already hopelessly alienated from the masses ... As a result, popular revolution (or at least paralyzing instability) is always around the corner in the Arab world.\\" Proponents argued that, for that reason, the U.S. should turn its attention towards those who might hold power in a more democratic Arab world; otherwise, its relationships with Arab states will always be tenuous and unstable.Pollock, 9‚Äì10. A key foundation of the \\"underrated\\" school's argument, Pollock wrote, was the tendency of the media in most Arab countries to be under state control or influence to a greater degree than in the West and therefore filtering information to the public and not reporting public opinion accurately, an experience informed by contemporary events in Eastern Europe. However, even in Syria, a coalition country where the government had the greatest control over the media, citizens still listened to the BBC, Radio Monte Carlo and Israeli and Saudi radio stations. In other countries, particularly some in North Africa, the media was relatively unrestricted during the conflict. Those mystified by the quiet on the Arab street during the conflict, he said, \\"neglected ... the possibility that different Arab publics generally supported the different policies pursued by their own governments towards the crisis.\\"Pollock, 6‚Äì7. In addition, it was also entirely possible that those governments had based their policies in part on public opinion. Arab governments, Pollock observed, were not indifferent to public opinion despite the absence of real democratic institutions. Officials in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states held regular informal majlises (ŸÖÿ¨ŸÑÿ≥) and the Egyptian government took note of what was said at neighborhood discussion centers known as \\"listening posts.\\" Some also consulted opinion polls. It was data from those that led him to believe that Jordan and Yemen both stayed out of the coalition in part because their leaders were aware that popular sentiment in their countries was strongly against participating, and they might have faced destabilizing civil unrest if they had.Pollock, 32‚Äì33. Pollock was especially scornful of those who viewed the Arab street as irrelevant because it was unknowable. \\"This assumption sounds at once pathetic and presumptuous, a sorry combination of self-confessed intellectual ignorance and impotence ... For one thing, it should be self-evident that you cannot dismiss the Arab street just because you don't understand it.\\" As for the \\"exaggerated\\" school, he first observed that there was, in fact, little history of real popular revolutions deposing governments in the modern Middle East with what he called the \\"debatable\\" exception of the 1958 Lebanon crisis, and not even many more unsuccessful attempts to do so via street uprisings. So, he noted with some bemusement, \\"the beauty of this argument is that it is invulnerable to disproof‚Äîbecause its proof lies in the future, which of course always lies ahead.\\" At the beginning of the next decade, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks again made it likely that the U.S. would find itself fighting another war against a Muslim country, and again fears rose in the American media about the damage an angered Arab street could inflict on American interests in the region when actual combat began, especially with the Second Palestinian Intifada already underway. Another USIA employee, Nancy Snow, wrote about the problems created by the connotations of the term in 2011, when she had become a professor at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Public Communications: \\"In the narratives of the Western media,\\" Asef Bayat wrote in 2011, \\"the 'Arab street' is damned if it does and damned if it doesn't\\", echoing a theme of Pollock's critique. After fears of violence across the Arab world proved exaggerated following the beginning of the Afghan War, commentators dismissed the Arab street as apathetic and harmless, only to suddenly reclaim it as an object of fear when popular protests erupted all over the region in response to Israel's 2002 invasion of the West Bank. He denounced the term as a colonialist and Orientalist creation, similar to an earlier term \\"the Arab mind\\", which \\"reified the culture and collective conduct of an entire people in a violent abstraction.\\" While Tunisian writer Larbi Sadiki agrees that the negative connotations of \\"Arab street\\" are harmful to public discourse about the region in the West, he puts some of the blame for its widespread use on Arabs themselves. \\"It is no exaggeration to say that 'public opinion' has not had any presence to speak of in the Arabic political vocabulary,\\" he wrote in 2009. It did not emerge into Arabic political discussion alongside the idea of universal suffrage when that became a goal of Arab activists in the early 20th century, he notes, and polling organizations did not consequently form as they did in the West. Thus the notion of the Arab street filled the void. The Arabic term for public opinion, ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ°ÿ¶ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÖŸÖ (ar-ra æƒ´ al- øamm), is a direct translation of the English expression. \\"There is no other Arabic term that conveys an equivalent meaning.\\" To make the distinction between mainstream and extremist Arab opinion clear, in 2002 Jordanian journalist Rami George Khouri suggested calling the latter the \\"Arab basement.\\" New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman picked it up, noting that the Arab street, in opposition to the \\"basement\\", is \\"largely passive and nonviolent.\\" While the U.S. and the West had no choice but to defeat the basement, since it was beyond reason, he said it was not too late to work with Arab states to address the very real grievances that led from the street to the basement. \\"If America made clear that it was going into Iraq,\\" he wrote, \\"not just to disarm Iraq but to empower Iraq's people to implement the Arab Human Development Report, well, the Arab basement still wouldn't be with us, but the Arab street just might.\\" Arab Spring Beginning in 2011, popular uprisings that came to be collectively known as the Arab Spring deposed dictatorships in Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen. Similar mass movements were put down in Bahrain and touched off the Syrian Civil War Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi was killed after a civil war. \\"Those accustomed to the region's repressive status quo have been caught by surprise\\", wrote two editors of an anthology of writings by younger Arabs. \\"Young Middle Easterners‚Äîtypically viewed with trepidation as part of a reactionary 'Arab street' or simply overlooked as masses passively acquiescing to despots‚Äîhave shattered stereotypes by leading dignified struggles in the face of overwhelming repression.\\" alt=A young man and a woman carrying the tops of cardboard boxes in a crowded group of people.

He has a bandage on his forehead and she is wearing a headscarf and sunglasses. Western commentators, particularly after the protests in Egypt forced Hosni Mubarak to step down, reconsidered the concept of the Arab street and whether or not it had, indeed, ever been an accurate representation of public opinion in the region. \\"I'm convinced the country has what it takes to build a decent, representative society‚Äîone that gives the lie to all the stereotypes associated with that dismissive shorthand 'The Arab Street.'\\" Roger Cohen wrote from Cairo the day afterward in The New York Times. \\"In fact, post- Tahrir, let's retire that phrase.\\" \\"[F]arewell to it, once and for all,\\" agreed Fouad Ajami shortly afterwards, noting that Arabs had never risen up in response to violence against Kurds or Shiites, particularly the 1978 disappearance of popular Shiite Imam Musa al-Sadr, widely believed to have been ordered by Gaddafi. Arab commentators agreed. \\"[E]vents in Egypt and elsewhere have exposed the myth of 'the Arab street' as a shallow caricature of the complex reality behind the revolutionary movements now sweeping the Arab world,\\" wrote Hassan Malik, a Harvard graduate student. He noted that in both Tunisia and Egypt the protesters had been a diverse group in every way that had been motivated by a desire for political freedom, not the Islamic fundamentalism so often feared to be motivating the street in the West. \\"It is time for Washington and its allies to drop their fears of 'the Arab street' and unequivocally and genuinely support the popular revolution in Egypt‚Äîor to get out of the way.\\" On the English-language website of the Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar, Syrian journalist Ula Shaybeddine recalled how the uprisings had changed the meaning of the word \\"street\\" for his generation. Once, much as it had been in English, it had been \\"a space for thieves, drug addicts, prostitutes, beggars, and 'riffraff.'\\" But now there was \\"a new understanding of the Arab 'street,'\\" he wrote. \\"We are beginning to understand why the powers that be wanted us to believe all those lies about [it].\\" He said it had now become \\"a place of righteousness and honor, beauty and justice ... the space where our youth came of age, as they rebelled against injustice, abuse, and humiliation.\\" See also * Arab culture Notes References External links * Category:Arab Spring and the media Category:Politics of the Arab world Category:Political terminology Category:Calques ","title":"Arab street"},{"id":"24730668","text":"Rancho Saucos was a Mexican land grant in present-day Tehama County, California given in 1844 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Robert H.

R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. A professor at Wheaton College (Illinois) for most of his life, Dr. Kilby founded the Marion E. Wade Center there, making it a center for the study of the Inklings, their friends (such as Dorothy Sayers), and their influences (such as George MacDonald). Biography Kilby's parents, James Lafayette and Sophronia Kilby, lived along the Nolichuckey River in the north portion of East Tennessee's hill country. The youngest of eight children, he was the first of his family to graduate from college. While studying at the University of Arkansas, he worked part-time in the registrar's office at nearby John Brown University. Clyde graduated in 1929, and the next year married Martha Harris, a mathematics teacher at JBU. They moved to Minnesota, where Kilby earned a master's degree in 1931 from the University of Minnesota. In 1935, Kilby moved to Wheaton, Illinois, where he became an assistant professor of English. In 1938, he earned his Ph.D. by correspondence from NYU. He became chair of the English department at Wheaton in 1951, a post he retained until 1966. Dr. Kilby retired from teaching at Wheaton in 1981, and retired to Columbus, Mississippi, his wife's hometown, where he died on October 18, 1986. In his honour, the Clyde S. Kilby Award for Inkling Studies was issued (one notable winner is Colin Duriez), and also the Clyde S. Kilby Research Grant (Diana Pavlac Glyer is a recipient). There is a Clyde S. Kilby Chair at Wheaton College (currently Christina Bieber Lake). Lewis and Inkling scholarship Kilby became interested in the works of Lewis in 1943 after reading The Case for Christianity, the first part of the later-published Mere Christianity. He then read all of Lewis' works, designed a popular course around the mythopoetic works of Lewis and Tolkien, and began a long-term correspondence with Lewis that lasted until the author's death in 1963. The fourteen letters of his correspondence with Lewis became the core of a collection of papers on first Lewis, then the Inklings, and finally a set of seven connected British authors: * Owen Barfield * G. K. Chesterton * C. S. Lewis * George MacDonald * Dorothy L. Sayers * J. R. R. Tolkien * Charles Williams This collection developed into the Marion E. Wade Center at Wheaton College, today a major resource for twentieth-century British literature scholarship. Kilby's portrait hangs in the Kilby Reading Room at the Wade Center, along with a plaque which reads in part: Dr. Clyde S. Kilby (1902‚Äì1986) was the founder and first curator of the Marion E. Wade Collection. Dr. Kilby's career in the world of literature was a distinguished one. . . . In all [that he accomplished], Dr. Kilby was supported by his wife, Martha Harris Kilby. Mrs. Kilby's lively interest, wise counsel, and dedicated work were the foundation for everything that Dr. Kilby did.

This wagon road was heavily used by the U.S. Army from 1839 to 1848, especially during the war with Mexico. Spencerville, named for U.S. Secretary of War John C. Spencer, was home to Spencer Academy, a Choctaw Nation boarding school for boys. The trace of the military road today serves as the access road from Spencerville 1/4 mile north to the site of old Spencer Academy. A large Oklahoma Historical Society marker identifies the site. Spencer Academy was founded in 1844. It was here that Negro freedman \\"Uncle\\" Wallace Willis composed ‚ÄúSwing Low, Sweet Chariot‚Äù. He was inspired by the Red River which reminded him of the Jordan River and of the Prophet Elijah being taken to heaven by a chariot.

However, the local community has seen little benefit from oil extraction, and infrastructure is poor. In the 1990s, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People began a struggle against the degradation of their lands, which at times erupted into violence. In June 2001 an oil pipeline that passes through the Baraale community ruptured and spilled crude oil into nearby forests, farmlands and houses. There were delays in repair, and in October 2001 the spilled oil caught fire, causing extensive environmental damage. The region suffers from violence, kidnapping and arson.

The Montenegrin army burnt all of the Turkish katuns on the Sinja(je)vina, and razed the villages of Trebaljevo, Lipovo and ≈†titarica. The attack on Kola≈°in caused numerous political problems and diplomatic complications, which would later become known as the \\"Kola≈°in Affair\\" (Kola≈°inska afera). Disagreements were put aside with the engagement of diplomatic representatives of the Great Powers, who showed a great interest in the situation occurring in the Balkans. There are some disputes as to whether the attack was authorised by Montenegrin government. Prince Danilo was unaware of it, though there are some indications that his brother Grand Duke Mirko might have allowed it. Traditionally, it is held that attack came as a result of agreement between Duke of Drobnjaci Novica Ceroviƒá and Duke of Vasojeviƒái Miljan Vukov, with aim to avenge the death of Miljan's brother ƒêorƒëije who was killed in ambush laid by Kola≈°in's Muslims. Arhimandrite of Moraƒça Dimitrije Radojeviƒá supported the plan and was a key figure in mobilising the remaining clans to action. The town was almost completely destroyed during attack.

The membership in the MIFC was a somewhat unstable occurrence with membership ranging from 11 members when it formed in 1990 to 14 members in the final 1998 season. Membership history The MIFC formed as a result of the merger of the Heartland Conference with the GLIAC football playing members prior to the 1990 football season. The conference started play in 1990 with the following members. From the Heartland Conference: Saint Joseph's College, Ashland University, Valparaiso University, University of Indianapolis and Butler University. From the GLIAC: Ferris State University, Grand Valley State University, Hillsdale College, Northern Michigan University, Saginaw Valley State University and Wayne State University. Membership changes came quickly and often to the MIFC. The first change occurred after 1992 season when Butler and Valparaiso left and were replaced by Northwood University and the University of St. Francis for the 1993 season. The next change came in the 1994 season when Michigan Technological University joined the conference. The next change occurred after the 1995 season when St. Joseph's left the conference. The final membership change occurred in 1998 when the University of Findlay, Mercyhurst College, and Westminster College all joined the conference.

An older version of the program is available as the UltimateDefrag Freeware Edition. Overview Information regarding files is displayed in a circular graph representing the physical disk, indicating sections that are fragmented, compressed, reserved for system use, along with other information. From this, the user can select sections of the disk, see a list of the files in that section showing information regarding individual file fragmentation and location, and individually defragment files or drag and drop them to the desired section on the disk. Along with defragmentation, UltimateDefrag performs consolidation of both disk space and files within folders, arrangement of files by volatility (most often used files) or recency (most recently used files), and analysis of the disk. In addition, UltimateDefrag has the ability to defragment files based on manually entered wildcard expressions. The software comes with boot level defragmentation, allowing user-controlled relocation and placement of normally unmovable files, such as the page file. This reduces disk head movement resulting from a page file that is fragmented or located on the hard drive far from other frequently used files. However, the program recommends -- and indeed it is indispensable -- that the user make a backup (which should be a full partition backup, not just data backup) of any drive on which boot level defragmentation is attempted. If the program fails during boot level relocation of critical files such as $MFT, portions of the file structure may be damaged and the computer might no longer boot properly to the desktop screen.

Early life and education Washington was the first of four children born to John Washington and Lucy Wily Washington in Salem, Massachusetts in 1887. His location somewhat protected him from the open racism that inhibited that lives of his southern African American peers (Barrow, 2007). ‚ÄúWashington‚Äôs family raised him in this comparatively tolerant environment and was able to provide him with the opportunity for a rich education, one that was exceptional for African Americans of that era‚Äù (p. 201). His family moved to Boston where Washington graduated from South Boston High School in 1905. He graduated from Tufts College (now University) in 1909. He pursued a post-baccalaureate degree in economics at Harvard University from 1912 to 1914 and graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in social economy in 1917. He was married in 1918. Washington was a National Urban League (NUL) fellow and received his social work training at the New York School of Social Work, which subsequently launched him into his career (Barrow, 2007). Detroit Urban League and WWI In the following years Washington held a number of important leadership positions. In his first position he served as the first director of the Detroit Urban League (DUL). He led the DUL when the city experienced the rapid growth of its black population during the World War I era migration. Washington called for equal employment opportunities in Detroit while urging the black migrants to adjust to urban life. However, his leadership of the DUL was short-lived when he was drafted into the U.S. Army to fight World War I. Washington was later released from the army when Dr. George Edmond Haynes (another social welfare pioneer) obtained his release so that he could help assist Dr. Haynes with the newly created Division of Negro Economics within the U.S. Department of Labor (Barrow, 2007). Although defunded and short lived, according to Barrow (2007): Work in the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and Atlanta University School of Social Work Thereafter, Washington returned to Detroit where he would eventually become the director of the NUL affiliate in Philadelphia called the Armstrong Association of Philadelphia in 1923. He also became director of research for Associated Charities (Barrow, 2007). Three years later he became the director and educator at the Atlanta University School of Social Work (now the M. Whitney Young, Jr. School of Social Work). It was from this post that Washington would be recruited to become the director of Negro Work in the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) in February 1934 (2007). As it relates to his tenure at the Atlanta University Social of Social Work, Barrow states: > \\" Through his own work serving the social-welfare needs of the African > American population from 1917 to 1927, Washington discovered firsthand the > benefit of social services being provided to African Americans by people > within their own communities.\\" As such, Washington felt that it was important to train other African American social workers to work with their own people. Washington's work was meaningful, but in 1927 he reached a career plateau and desired a change. Washington understood that, although there had been a northward migration, most African Americans still lived in the South. They had many unmet needs and few people and institutions to help them. He wrote to an associate and described ‚Äúan epiphany‚Äù (Washington, January 5, 1928 as cited by Barrow, 2007). He had been encouraging other trained social workers to relocate to the South and finally recognized that ‚Äúthe only common sense thing [was for him] to practice what he preached‚Äù (Washington, January 5, 1928 as cited by Barrow, 2007). He made a decision to ‚Äúconsecrate his life to social work education‚Äù (Washington, January 5, 1928 as cited by Barrow, 2007) and accepted the position of Director of the Atlanta School of Social Work in 1927 (p. 177). This speaks to Washington's commitment to education, to his people, and to the social work profession. As aforementioned, this position led to Washington's subsequent position in the FERA during the great depression. The Great Depression called for new bold action to alleviate widespread suffering as a result of 1929 crash. This action came from the newly elected president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) in 1932. One of the biggest pieces of legislation of the New Deal was the FERA which disbursed $500 million in grants for direct relief. Over its three-year existence, FERA spent more than 4 billion dollars in relief. However, due to the discrimination of the time, African Americans were disadvantaged and sometimes did not fully benefit from this relief. As a result of their growing displeasure and political voice of the 1930s President Roosevelt created appointments of a diverse group of African American intellectuals known as ‚ÄúThe Black Cabinet‚Äù of which Washington was a member (Barrow, 2007). In 1934 Washington was appointed director of Negro Work in the FERA under FDR. As director, Washington criticized and publicized the unequal treatment of African Americans at the hands of state FERA administrators and white employers. Washington used his post to assert that the federal government had the responsibility of ensuring equal employment opportunities rather than allow them to develop dependency on federal relief. He called for equal employment and educational opportunities to insure that black workers would be self-supporting. He also called on fellow social workers to assume an activist political role in advocating both within the Roosevelt Administration and in the private sector for greater work opportunities for African Americans. In the face of continued silence and resistance from the Roosevelt administration, Washington resigned as director of Negro Work at FERA and returned to his post with the Atlanta School for Social Work in 1935. He remained there until his retirement in 1960. He died in 1963 in Atlanta, Georgia. Washington‚Äôs Social Work/Welfare Legacy and Conclusion As it relates to Washington's social welfare philosophy, it is inherent in his professional life as highlighted by his career above. However, Barrow (2007) sums it up the best: Washington was/is a social work and welfare pioneer who ‚Äúmodeled a principle response to social injustice‚Äù as a government advisor and who fought the unfair policies and the social welfare structures of the 1930s. Additionally, Gary & Gary, (1994) as cited by Barrow (2007) posit that: Thus, Washington life and contributions are an important part of social welfare history because it increases our understanding of the evolution of contemporary social welfare and social work education. It also expands knowledge about African American's contributions to social welfare policy and the social work profession as a whole. His contributions can encourage us (particularly African American social workers) to strive toward social justice, advocacy, and a stronger commitment to the profession.

Generic- case complexity is a way of measuring the complexity of a computational problem by neglecting a small set of unrepresentative inputs and considering worst-case complexity on the rest. Small is defined in terms of asymptotic density. The apparent efficacy of generic case complexity is because for a wide variety of concrete computational problems, the most difficult instances seem to be rare. Typical instances are relatively easy. This approach to complexity originated in combinatorial group theory, which has a computational tradition going back to the beginning of the last century. The notion of generic complexity was introduced in a 2003 paper,I. Kapovich, A. Myasnikov, P. Schupp and V. Shpilrain, Generic case complexity, decision problems in group theory and random walks, J. Algebra, vol 264 (2003), 665‚Äì694. where authors showed that for a large class of finitely generated groups the generic time complexity of some classical decision problems from combinatorial group theory, namely the word problem, conjugacy problem and membership problem, are linear. A detailed introduction of generic case complexity can be found in the surveys. R. Gilman, A. G. Miasnikov, A. D. Myasnikov, and A. Ushakov, Generic Case Complexity, unpublished first draft of a book, 143 pages. R. Gilman, A. G. Miasnikov, A. D. Myasnikov, and A. Ushakov, Report on generic case complexity, Herald of Omsk University, Special Issue, 2007, 103‚Äì110.  Basic definitions   Asymptotic density  Let I be an infinite set of inputs for a computational problem. Definition 1. A size function on I is a map \\\\sigma:I\\\\to \\\\mathbb{N} with infinite range. The ball of radius n is B_n=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in I \\\\mid \\\\sigma(x)\\\\le n \\\\\\\\}. If the inputs are coded as strings over a finite alphabet, size might be the string length. Let \\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_n\\\\\\\\} be an ensemble of probability distributions where \\\\mu_n is a probability distribution on B_n. If the balls B_n are finite, then each \\\\mu_n can be taken to be the equiprobable distribution which is the most common case. Notice that only finitely many B_n's can be empty or have \\\\mu_n(B_n) = 0; we ignore them. Definition 2. The asymptotic density of a subset X \\\\subset I is \\\\rho(X) = \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\mu_n(X \\\\cap B_n) when this limit exists. When the balls B_n are finite and \\\\mu_n is the equiprobable measure, : \\\\rho(X)=\\\\lim \\\\frac{|X\\\\cap B_n|}{|B_n|}. In this case it is often convenient to use spheres I_n=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in I\\\\mid \\\\sigma(x)=n\\\\\\\\} instead of balls and define \\\\rho'(X)=\\\\lim \\\\frac{|X\\\\cap I_n|}{|I_n|}. An argument using Stolz theorem shows that \\\\rho(X) exists if \\\\rho'(X) does, and in that case they are equal. Definition 3 X\\\\subseteq I is generic if \\\\rho(X)=1 and negligible if \\\\rho(X)=0. X is exponentially (superpolynomially) generic if the convergence to the limit in Definition 2 is exponentially (superpolynomially) fast, etc. A generic subset X is asymptotically large. Whether X appears large in practice depends on how fast \\\\mu_n(X\\\\cap B_n) converges to 1. Superpolynomial convergence seems to be fast enough.  Generic complexity classes  Definition 4 An algorithm is in GenP (generically polynomial time) if it never gives incorrect answers and if it gives correct answers in polynomial time on a generic set of inputs. A problem is in GenP if it admits an algorithm in GenP. Likewise for GenL (generically linear time), GenE (generically exponential time with a linear exponent) GenExp (generically exponential time), etc. ExpGenP is the subclass of GenP for which the relevant generic set is exponentially generic. More generally for any f : \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N} we can define the class Gen(f) corresponding to time complexity O(f) on a generic set of input. Definition 5. An algorithm solves a problem generically if it never gives incorrect answers and if it gives correct answers on a generic set of inputs. A problem is generically solvable if it is solved generically by some algorithm.

The generic point of view also suggests a kind of new attack called the quotient attack, and a more secure version of the Anshel‚ÄìAnshel‚ÄìGoldfeld protocol.  List of general theoretical results  *A famous Rice's theorem states that if F is a subset of the set of partial computable functions from \\\\mathbb{N} to \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}, then unless F or its complement is empty, the problem of deciding whether or not a particular Turing machine computes a function in F is undecidable. The following theorem gives a generic version. Theorem 1A. Miasnikov and A. Rybalov, Generic complexity of undecidable problems, Journal of Symbolic Logic 73 (2008), 656‚Äì673. Let I be the set of all Turing machines. If F is a subset of the set of all partial computable function from \\\\mathbb{N} to itself such that F and its complement are both non-empty, then the problem of deciding whether or not a given Turing machine computes a function from F is not decidable on any exponentially generic subset of I. * The following theorems are from: Theorem 2 The set of formal languages which are generically computable has measure zero. Theorem 3 There is an infinite hierarchy of generic complexity classes. More precisely for a proper complexity function f, Gen(f) \\\\subsetneq Gen(f^3). * The next theorem shows that just as there are average case complete problems within distributional NP problems, there are also generic case complete problems. The arguments in the generic case are similar to those in the average case, and the generic case complete problem is also average case complete. It is the distributional bounded halting problem. Theorem 4 There is a notion of generic-polynomial- time reduction with respect to which the distributional bounded halting problem is complete within class of distributional NP problems.  Comparisons with previous work   Almost polynomial time  Meyer and PatersonA. R. Meyer and M. S. Paterson, With what frequency are apparently intractable problems difficult?, M.I.T. Technical Report, MIT/LCS/TM-126, February, 1979. define an algorithm to be almost polynomial time, or APT, if it halts within p(n) steps on all but p(n) inputs of size n. Clearly, APT algorithms are included in our class GenP. We have seen several NP complete problems in GenP, but Meyer and Paterson show that this is not the case for APT. They prove that an NP complete problem is reducible to a problem in APT if and only if P = NP. Thus APT seems much more restrictive than GenP.  Average-case complexity  Generic case complexity is similar to average-case complexity. However, there are some significant differences. Generic case complexity is a direct measure of the performance of an algorithm on most inputs while average case complexity gives a measure of the balance between easy and difficult instances. In addition Generic-case complexity naturally applies to undecidable problems. Suppose \\\\mathcal{A} is an algorithm whose time complexity, T:I\\\\to \\\\mathbb{N} is polynomial on \\\\mu average. What can we infer about the behavior of \\\\mathcal{A} on typical inputs? Example 1 Let I be the set of all words over \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} and define the size \\\\sigma(w) to be word length, |w|. Define I_n to be the set of words of length n, and assume that each \\\\mu_n is the equiprobable measure. Suppose that T(w)=n for all but one word in each I_n, and T(w)=2^{2^n} on the exceptional words. In this example T is certainly polynomial on typical inputs, but T is not polynomial on average. T is in GenP. Example 2 Keep I and \\\\sigma(w) = |was before, but define \\\\mu(w)= 2^{-2|w|-1} and T(w) = 2^{|w|}. T is polynomial on average even though it is exponential on typical inputs. T is not in GenP. In these two examples the generic complexity is more closely related to behavior on typical inputs than average case complexity. Average case complexity measures something else: the balance between the frequency of difficult instances and the degree of difficulty,. Y. Gurevich, The challenger-solver game: variations on the theme of P =?NP, Logic in Computer Science Column, The Bulletin of the EATCS, October 1989, p.112-121. R. Impagliazzo, A personal view of average-case complexity, in Proceedings of the 10th Annual Structure in Complexity Theory Conference - SCT 1995, IEEE Computer Society, 1995, page 134. Roughly speaking an algorithm which is polynomial time on average can have only a subpolynomial fraction of inputs that require superpolynomial time to compute. Nevertheless, in some cases generic and average case complexity are quite close to each other. A function f:I\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R}^+ is polynomial on \\\\mu-average on spheres if there exists k \\\\geq 1 such that \\\\sum_{w\\\\in I_n} f^{1/k}(w) \\\\mu_n(w) = O(n) where \\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_n\\\\\\\\} is the ensemble induced by \\\\mu. If f is polynomial on \\\\mu-average on spheres, the f is polynomial on \\\\mu-average, and for many distributions the converse holds Y. Gurevich, Average case completeness, Journal of Computer and System Science, 42 (1991), 346‚Äì398. Theorem 5 If a function f:I\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^+ is polynomial on \\\\mu-average on spheres then f is generically polynomial relative to the spherical asymptotic density \\\\rho'. Theorem 6 Suppose a complete algorithm \\\\mathcal{A} has subexponential time bound T and a partial algorithm \\\\mathcal{B} for the same problem is in ExpGenP with respect to the ensemble \\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_n\\\\\\\\} corresponding to a probability measure \\\\mu on the inputs I for \\\\mathcal{A}. Then there is a complete algorithm which is \\\\mu-average time complexity.  Errorless heuristic algorithms  In a 2006 paper, Bogdanov and Trevisan came close to defining generic case complexity.A. Bogdanov, L. Trevisan, Average-case Complexity, Found. Trends Theor. Comput. Sci. 2, No. 1, 111 p. (2006).. Instead of partial algorithms, they consider so-called errorless heuristic algorithms. These are complete algorithms which may fail by halting with output \\"?\\". The class AvgnegP is defined to consist of all errorless heuristic algorithms A which run in polynomial time and for which the probability of failure on I_n is negligible, i.e., converges superpolynomially fast to 0. AvgnegP is a subset of GenP. Errorless heuristic algorithms are essentially the same as the algorithms with benign faults defined by Impagliazzo where polynomial time on average algorithms are characterized in terms of so-called benign algorithm schemes.

Often, \\"observation\\" is taken to be synonymous with quantum measurement and \\"observer\\" with a measurement apparatus. Moreover, the term \\"observable\\" has gained a technical meaning, denoting a Hermitian operator that represents a measurement. Thus, the quantum mechanical observer does not have to necessarily present or solve any problems over and above the issue of measurement in quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanical observer is also intimately tied to the issue of observer effect. A number of new-age religious or philosophical views give the observer a more special role, or place constraints on who or what can be an observer. There is no credible peer- reviewed research that backs such claims. As an example of such claims, Fritjof Capra declared, \\"The crucial feature of atomic physics is that the human observer is not only necessary to observe the properties of an object, but is necessary even to define these properties.\\"Fritjof Capra. The Tao of Physics, p. 127 However, mainstream physicists downplay any special role of human observers. For example, Werner Heisenberg wrote, > Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to > imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the > description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of > registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not > matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being; but the > registration, i.e., the transition from the \\"possible\\" to the \\"actual,\\" is > absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of > quantum theory.Werner Heisenberg, Physics and Philosophy, p. 137 Likewise, Asher Peres stated that \\"observers\\" in quantum physics are > similar to the ubiquitous \\"observers\\" who send and receive light signals in > special relativity. Obviously, this terminology does not imply the actual > presence of human beings. These fictitious physicists may as well be > inanimate automata that can perform all the required tasks, if suitably > programmed. Critics of the special role of the observer also point out that observers can themselves be observed, leading to paradoxes such as that of Wigner's friend; and that it is not clear how much consciousness is required. As John Bell inquired, \\"Was the wave function waiting to jump for thousands of millions of years until a single-celled living creature appeared? Or did it have to wait a little longer for some highly qualified measurer‚Äîwith a PhD?\\"John Stewart Bell, 1981, \\"Quantum Mechanics for Cosmologists\\". In C. J. Isham, R. Penrose and D.W.

He has done 'the first-ever Urdu translation' of the 12th century Sufi-poet Baba Farid‚Äôs shlokas and shabads and that too in verse. Early life Zahid Abrol was born in a Hindu Khatri family, to Mul Raj Abrol and Bimla Devi, in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, India. He did MSc in Physics from Panjab University, Chandigarh, Punjab (India). He picked up Urdu after leaving college for the love of Urdu poetry. He started learning Urdu in 1971 and became the author of his two poetry collections in the next 15 years. Poetic career 'Andha Khuda' was his first collection published in 1978 followed by 'Ek Saf-ha Purnam' in 1986. His recent publication is the poetic translated version ‚Äì 'Faridnama' ‚Äì exhibits the original Gurmukhi version, its Roman transcript, Urdu translation in verse in Urdu and Devnagari scripts in a well produced volume and has won accolades from experts. This way he has reproduced tributes paid to Sheikh Baba Farid's poetry in all the three languages. In his recent work ‚ÄòFaridnama‚Äô, Zahid Abrol has rendered the poetic translation of Farid bani into Urdu and presented it in both Urdu and Devnagri scripts. This is remarkably a great achievement as in the process, he has not deviated from the tenor and texture of the original composition. At some places, the Punjabi verses of Baba Farid defy attempts at easy comprehension and facile understanding. These require deep knowledge of the syntax of Punjabi language, rural imagery, concept of Sufi order, metaphysical metaphors and pithiness of expression. It is not possible for a devout reader to comprehend the meanings without bringing about a qualitative change in the atmosphere of his mind. On his part, Zahid Abrol has disciplined his mind thoroughly so as to remain within the bounds of close textual reading. He appears to have completely identified himself with the philosophy contained in the original work. It is very rare that a classic is translated in another language by retaining its linguistic pattern dexterously. This can happen only when the mind of the translator is fully attuned to the symphony of the original poetic diction. The words emerged from the inner recesses of his mind and took the form of rhyming verses in his work Faridnama; angels dictate him when he takes pen in his hands. Faridnama is indeed a marvel in translation. Personal life Zahid Abrol is a Bank Manager by profession. He is married to Professor Rita Abrol and they currently reside at Una, Himachal Pradesh. They have one son (Anees Abrol) and two daughters (Neha Abrol and Rabia Abrol). Being a hard- core secularist, he has named his son 'Anees' and daughter 'Rabia'. \\"I like the poetry of Mir Anees, so I named my son after him. Why not name our children like that, why can‚Äôt Kulsum be called Kusum and vice-versa?\\", he asks. He also feels that if the poems of Dr Iqbal are introduced in Hindi textbooks for children, it would bring the next generations closer. My job does not give me a lot of spare time, so it took me two years to complete the translation of these shlokas and shabads all of which are a part of the Guru Granth Sahib\\", he said.

Javanese House  Bird Kingdom houses the only authentic Javanese nobleman's house in North America. The house was hand carved with solid teak wood and constructed without nails. In the 19th century, houses like this were for the aristocratic class. The front door of the house faces south, supposedly facing the sea. The intricate carving on the roof shows visitors that the house was for a nobleman.  History  The Spirella Corset Company in 1900s. In 1908, the Spirella Corset Company built a four-story concrete building on the current site of the aviary. By 1958, the company had shrunk in size, resulting in the company's moving their location to a smaller facility. The building was purchased that year by Jacob Sherman, who owned the Niagara Falls Museum. Sherman then renovated the building extensively, adding a five-story viewing tower while also moving 700,000 artifacts to the building.Friendly Ghost Of The Museum & Corset Factory Retrieved 2010-12-27.

By that time of that discovery, however, the museum was closed and the mummy back in Egypt. The museum was operated by the Sherman family until 1999, when the maintenance of the building and artifacts became too costly. Most of the artifacts were sold or returned to their place of origin. Larry Vann, a resident of the Niagara area, purchased the museum building. Over the next few years, $15 million was spent on renovations to the building. The renovations included a large addition to the south side of the old museum building.

The county formed part of the nation's Pushmataha District, or Third District, one of three administrative super-regions. The county seat of Jack's Fork County was Many Springs, the modern community of Daisy, Oklahoma. The U.S. Government called it Etna, and a post office operated here using that name from 1884-1897.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 74. Jack's Fork County was organized by the General Council of the Choctaw Nation in 1850, as one of 19 original counties. It took its name from the stream by the same name, which in turn appears to have taken its name from an early-day settler or explorer, possibly French. The stream bore this name by at least 1819, when it appeared on a map drawn by explorer Thomas Nuttal.\\"Organization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, pp. 317-318, 324. Jack's Fork County's boundaries were, as were all Choctaw counties, designated according to easily recognizable natural landmarks. Much of its southern boundary, south of Antlers, Oklahoma was formed by Dumpling Creek. Much of its western boundary was Muddy Boggy Creek. Its eastern boundary, in part, was formed by the Kiamichi River and its northern boundary was, in part, Brushy Creek.John W. Morris, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, plates 38 & 56. As Oklahoma's statehood approached, its leading citizens, who were gathered for the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, realized in laying out the future state's counties that Jack's Fork County could not exist as an economically viable political subdivision. Its county seat existed generally for holding county court, and not as a population center. Most of its terrain was mountainous and still untamed; and its only sizeable town, Antlers, geographically isolated in Jack Fork County's extreme southeast corner, would be separated from much of the town's natural economic hinterland, which, at statehood, fell within neighboring Cedar County and Kiamitia County (Kiamichi County) of the Choctaw Nation. This conundrum was also recognized by the framers of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who met in 1905 to propose statehood for the Indian Territory. The county structure proposed by the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention also abolished the Choctaw counties. Jack's Fork County was divided principally into the proposed Bixby and Pushmataha counties, whose county seats would have been Atoka and Antlers, respectively. Much of this proposition was borrowed by Oklahoma's framers, who largely adopted the proposed boundaries for Bixby County but called it Atoka County, and also borrowed, with few changes, the boundaries of the proposed Pushmataha County, Sequoyah for its Oklahoma equivalent. Like all Choctaw counties, Jack's Fork County served as an election district for members of the National Council, and as a unit of local administration. Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger. The judge's duties included oversight of overall county administration. The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census. The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152. The territory formerly comprising Jack's Fork County now falls primarily within Atoka County and Pushmataha County, and to a small degree Pittsburg County, in Oklahoma. The county's name, corrupted after statehood to \\"Jackfork\\", lives on in the name of Jackfork Creek, a major tributary of the Kiamichi River.

Borchers. It is based on the 1977 short story of the same name by Stephen King and the eighth installment of the Children of the Corn series. Set primarily in 1975 in the fictional town of Gatlin, Nebraska, the film centers on traveling couple Burt and Vicky as they fight to survive a cult of murderous children who worship an entity known as He Who Walks Behind the Rows, which had years earlier manipulated the children into killing every adult in town. Plot In 1963, the town of Gatlin, Nebraska, is suffering a severe drought. In a tent, a boy preacher (Robert Gerdisch), claims that an Old Testament-era Canaanite god whom he calls \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\" has spoken to him in his dreams. He tells the other children that the sinful adults are the reason for the drought, prompting them to kill everybody over the age of nineteen in town. They then establish a death cult with the prime rule that, upon reaching the age of nineteen, one must be sacrificed to the cult's god. Twelve years later, a bickering couple, Vietnam veteran Burt (David Anders) and his wife Vicky (Kandyse McClure), are driving near Gatlin, planning their second honeymoon, when a boy named Joseph (Remington Jennings) stumbles out of the roadside corn in front of their car. After running Joseph over, Burt realizes the boy's throat was slashed. Wrapping and placing the body in the trunk, Burt tells Vicky to wait for him while he looks around. In the cornfield, Burt finds Joseph's bloodied suitcase. He and Vicky drive off in search of aid, not realizing they are being watched by Isaac (Preston Bailey), the 9-year old current cult leader, and 18-year-old warrior Malachai (Daniel Newman). After hearing a group of children giving an evangelical sermon over the radio, Burt and Vicky reach an abandoned gas station. Finding the phones non-functional Burt decides to go to Gatlin. While Burt drives, Vicky finds an amulet which she recognizes as a pagan creation. Meanwhile, in the cornfields, Isaac tells the others about Burt and Vicky and that they, like the \\"blue man\\" (a police officer who was crucified for trying to stop them) must be killed to appease \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\", who demanded Joseph be killed for trying to escape. Reaching the town, Burt and Vicky find it seemingly abandoned, with a calendar in a bar still reading 1963. Coming across a church with a sermon board dated last week, Burt goes in to investigate, ignoring Vicky's pleas that they should just leave. Inside the church, Burt finds various occult drawings, a larger version of the trinket in Joseph's suitcase and a book listing the birthdays of the town's inhabitants. As Burt reads the book, Vicky is surrounded and attacked by Malachai and several other boys. She manages to kill one of them with Burt's shotgun before Malachai stabs her. Burt rushes outside just as Malachai blows the car up. Chased by the children into an alleyway Burt is taunted by Isaac who throws a knife at him which hits him in the arm. Killing two of the older boys, Burt runs off into the cornfields. In the alleyway, Isaac confronts Malachai, telling him that by spilling Joseph's blood in the corn he angered He Who Walks Behind The Rows. Questioning Malachai's faith, Isaac has him pray before they regroup with their followers, who they tell must sacrifice Burt in the clearing where the blue man's corpse is held. Malachai and the children begin hunting Burt through the corn. Malachai is told by Nahum (Paul Butler, Jr.), one of the younger boys, that he had a vision of He Who Walks Behind the Rows, leading Malachai to believe Nahum will be the new prophet after Isaac. Malachai mentions that they must finish the search before dark, as that is He Who Walks Behind the Row's time. Burt begins having flashbacks to Vietnam and kills several of the children, including Nahum. At nightfall the worshipers abandon the search and return to the town. They have a feast prepared by the females, who seem concerned that Burt was not apprehended. Later that night, Isaac holds a sermon in the church based on the tenet of \\"be fruitful and multiply\\" and proclaims that the time of fertilization has come. He beckons a teenage girl (Zita Vass) and boy (Jake White) up to the front of the church and they immediately disrobe and have sex in front of the entire congregation. Burt, lost and delusional, has visions of all those he has killed, and begins wandering around aimlessly, searching for the road as the plant life begins attacking him. He finds the clearing and discovers Vicky, who has been made into a scarecrow. Hallucinating that Vicky's body is talking to him, Burt is faced by He Who Walks Behind The Rows, who proceeds to disembowel him and rip his eyes out in a form of ritual sacrifice. The next day, Isaac tells the children that He Who Walks Behind The Rows is displeased with their inability to kill Burt, who He had to dispose of Himself‚Äîlike the blue man (who, when killed, reduced the 'age of favor' from twenty to nineteen). Isaac informs everyone that the age of sacrifice has been lowered from nineteen to eighteen as punishment for their failure. After the children leave Isaac stands in front of a pile of the children's bodies and as he sets them on fire shouts \\"Scarecrow!\\". The scarecrow is revealed to be Burt. Later, Malachai and the other eighteen-year-olds enter the cornfields at dusk, offering themselves to He Who Walks Behind the Rows. While saying goodbye, Malachai's pregnant lover Ruth (Alexa Nikolas), whose faith had earlier been shaken, has a vision of herself setting fire to the corn.  Cast  * David Anders as Burt, the main protagonist along his wife. * Kandyse McClure as Vicky, Burt's wife. * Daniel Newman as Malachai. * Preston Bailey as Isaac, the 9-year-old \\"prophet\\" leader of the cult. * Alexa Nikolas as Ruth * Isabelle Fuhrman as Additional Voices * Leo Howard as Additional Voices * Chase Gruenwald as singing boy * Ryne Gruenwald as other singing boy Casting started two weeks before production began. Unlike in the original film, in which the bulk of the cultists were portrayed by actors over eighteen, Borchers decided to cast age-appropriate actors. Borchers has stated that dealing with the largely underage cast proved to be the most difficult part of making the film. *Bill Barker as the soldier in the flashback scene. *Austin Coobs as Mark/Big Boy Production Writing Having worked on the 1984 film as a producer, Donald P. Borchers was originally content with it, though in hindsight came to believe it was too \\"Hollywoodized\\" and not true enough to the original short story. Wanting Stephen King to be involved in the production of the new film, Borchers sent a copy of the script to him, only to receive a letter from King's attorney stating that King wanted no part in the film. Filming It was written, directed and produced by Donald Borchers, a producer on the original film, which was filmed in Lost Nation, Iowa and Rural Oxford Jct area. Borchers said he chose the Quad Cities Iowa/Illinois area after receiving a recommendation from the Iowa Film Office in the state Department of Economic Development. Shooting took place in and around the Quad Cities during September 2008. Release The film premiered on Syfy on September 26, 2009 and was released uncut on DVD by Anchor Bay on October 6, 2009. The DVD included such features as interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes footage. A Blu-ray release followed on November 16, 2010.

She was a large vessel of 1,463 tons (bm), launched in 1796 to replace a previous Hindostan that the Royal Navy had bought and turned into a Fourth Rate ship of the line. Her owner was Robert Williams, M.P., who had been the owner of the previous Hindostan. She made three complete voyages. She was lost on her fourth voyage, wrecking at Margate in January 1803. Voyages As was typical for East Indiamen during wartime, Hindostan made her voyages under a letter of marque, which authorized her to capture enemy vessels should the opportunity arise. First voyage (1797-1798) For her first voyage Hindostan was under Captain William Mackintosh, who sailed her to Bombay and China. Before leaving, she had the misfortune to run over Thomas and Alice in Blackwell Reach on 21 January 1797, sinking the smaller ship.Lloyd's List, 24 January 1797 Accessed 12 January 2014 Hindostan left for the Far East on 18 March 1797, via Bombay, Cochin, and Malacca, before arriving at Whampoa on 8 January 1798. For the return voyage she crossed Second Bar on 3 March, reached St Helena on 5 August, and the Downs on 18 October, finally anchoring on 22 October 1798. Mackintosh had made five earlier voyages for the East India Company, including three as captain of Indiamen. In 1792-94 he was captain of a different when he took George Macartney on Britain's first embassy to China. Mackintosh's letter of marque was dated 7 February 1797. Second voyage (1799-1800) For her second voyage, Hindostan was under Captain George Millett. She sailed to China, leaving Portsmouth on 18 June 1799. On the way out she reached Penang on 28 October and Whampoa on 16 January 1800. On her return trip, she reached Anger on 3 May, St Helena on 15 July, and the Downs on 23 September. Because her captain had changed, Hindostan required a new letter of marque; Millett's was dated 15 April 1799. It would remain valid for his subsequent voyages as well. Third voyage (1801-1802) For her third voyage Hindostan was again under Captain George Millet. This was his eighth voyage for the East India Company, and his fifth as a captain. She sailed to the Coast and China, leaving Portsmouth on 31 March 1801. She reached Madras on 26 July, Penang on 28 August, and Whampoa on 29 September. For her return trip she crossed Second Bar on 7 December. She reached St Helena on 12 April 1802 and the Downs on 10 June, before finally anchoring on 13 June. Fourth voyage and wreck (1803) Hondostans fourth voyage was for the Cape of Good Hope, Ceylon, the Coromandel Coast, and China. She carried mostly woolens and 45,000 ounces of silver bullion in 13 cases for private ventures, not the East India Company. For this voyage her captain was Edward Balston. Hindostan left London just after the turn of the new year. Unfortunately a severe gale caught her just off Margate on 11 January 1803 and wrecked her on the Wedge Sand. She had about 120 persons aboard, of whom about 20 or 25 lost their lives.Lloyd's List, - accessed 12 January 2014.Loss of the HINDOSTAN, Liverpool Mercury, 1913 A more precise accounting states that 24 lives were lost, including those of three midshipmen. On the morning of the 12th, the Margate hoy Lord Nelson and the pilot sloop Liberty saved the rest. The Court of Directors of the EIC presented the crew of Lord Nelson with 500 guineas for their \\"gallant and daring rescue of 105 men\\" from the wreck.Gentleman's Monthly Miscellany, Vol. 1, Issues 1-5, p.191. Wreck of the Hindostan in 1803 Eleven of the 13 cases of bullion were salvaged. Also 100 bales of wool were salvaged. The Company abandoned the wreck on 24 January.

It was the first film produced by CBS Films, the film division of CBS Corporation, who released the film on January 22, 2010. The film is about parents who form a biotechnology company to develop a drug to save the lives of their children, who have a life- threatening disease. The film is based on the true story of John and Aileen Crowley, whose children have Pompe's disease. The film was shot in St. Paul, Oregon; Portland, Oregon; the Corner Saloon in Tualatin, Oregon; Manzanita, Oregon; Beaverton, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington. Plot Brendan Fraser and Keri Russell play John Crowley and his wife, Aileen, a Portland couple with two of their three children suffering from Pompe disease, a genetic anomaly that typically kills most before a child's tenth birthday. John, an advertising executive, contacts Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford), a researcher in Nebraska who has done innovative research for an enzyme treatment for the rare disease. John and Aileen raise money to help Stonehill's research and the required clinical trials. John takes on the task full-time to save his children's lives, launching a biotechnology research company working with venture capitalists and then rival teams of researchers. This task proves very daunting for Stonehill, who already works around the clock. As time is running short, Stonehill's angry outburst hinders the company's faith in him, and the profit motive may upend John's hopes. The researchers race against time to save the children who have the disease.

Production Adapted by Robert Nelson Jacobs from the nonfiction book The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--and Bucked the Medical Establishment--in a Quest to Save His Children by the Pulitzer Prize journalist Geeta Anand, the film is also an examination of how medical research is conducted and financed. Filming in May 2009 at Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon Filming took place at several spots in and around Portland, Oregon, mostly at the OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Nike campus in Beaverton, Oregon. This was the first time Nike allowed filming on their campus and they donated the location payment to Doernbecher Children‚Äôs Hospital. During filming, the working title was The Untitled Crowley Project. In the film, the children are 9 and 7 years old. Their non-fiction counterparts were diagnosed at 15 months and 7 days old and received treatment at 5 and 4, respectively.Roger Ebert (January 20, 2010). Extraordinary Measures. Sun Times. Accessed 2011-08-01. Inspiration Myozyme, a drug developed for treating Pompe disease, was simultaneously approved for sale by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Henceforth, more than 1000 infants born worldwide every year with Pompe disease will no longer face the prospect of death before reaching their first birthday for lack of a treatment for the condition. The screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs is based on Geeta Anand's book The Cure (). Parts of the book first appeared as a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal. The small start-up company Priozyme was based on Oklahoma City-based Novazyme. The larger company, called Zymagen in the film, was based on Genzyme in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Novazyme was developing a protein therapeutic, with several biological patents pending, to treat Pompe Disease, when it was bought by Genzyme. The patent portfolio was cited in the press releases announcing the deal. Genzyme claims that Dr. Robert Stonehill's character is based upon scientist and researcher William Canfield, who founded Novazyme. According to Roger Ebert's review, the character is based on Yuan-Tsong Chen, a scientist and researcher from Duke University who collaborated with Genzyme in producing Myozyme, the drug which received FDA approval. Reception Critical response Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 29% based on reviews from 142 critics and an average rating of 4.88 out of 10. The site's general consensus is, \\"Despite a timely topic and a pair of heavyweight leads, Extraordinary Measures never feels like much more than a made-for-TV tearjerker.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 0‚Äì100 reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 45 based on 33 reviews. Richard Corliss of Time magazine wrote: \\"Fraser keeps the story anchored in reality. Meredith Droeger does too: as the Crowleys' afflicted daughter, she's a smart little bundle of fighting spirit. So is the movie, which keeps its head while digging into your heart. You have this critic's permission to cry in public.\\" The New York Times A. O. Scott said in his review: \\"The startling thing about Extraordinary Measures is not that it moves you. It's that you feel, at the end, that you have learned something about the way the world works.\\" Ramona Bates MD, writing for the health news organisation, EmaxHealth, stated that the film brings attention to Pompe disease. Peter Rainer from The Christian Science Monitor mentions that Big Pharma got a surprisingly free pass in the film and that it will come as a surprise to all those sufferers struggling to get orphan drugs developed. Jef Akst, writing for the journal The Scientist, stated that the film is good depiction of the \\"hard to swallow fiscal issues of drug development.\\" Box office The film opened at #8 on its opening weekend, taking in $6 million. The film remained in theaters for four weeks, earning $12 million.

History Before about 1940 all that was known about this endgame was based on some superficial analysis of a few positions from the time of Philidor (1726‚Äì95). Analysts gradually started to analyze the endgame. The endgame occurred in a 1944 game between Botvinnik and Ravinsky (below) and much analysis followed. Paul Keres published a large amount of analysis in 1947‚Äì49. This analysis was put to the test in the 1954 game between Botvinnik and Minev (below). Minev followed the suggestions of Keres and lost ‚Äì revealing major flaws in the analysis. In 1955, Shakhmaty v SSSR started a competition for the best analysis of this endgame. Several theorists had contributed useful analysis by the time the competition ended in 1959. Early analysts thought that the ending was almost always drawn with a knight pawn, but Yuri Averbakh questioned that in the 1950s. Averbakh, working with previous analysis, published his extensive analysis in 1962 . A complete analysis was not done until the advent of endgame tablebases, which showed that more positions can be won than was previously thought. Before tablebases, Averbach provided the best coverage, but the 70 pages of analysis in Comprehensive Chess Endgames mainly covered only simple positions with the pawn already on the seventh rank . John Nunn wrote three books based on the most important endgames in the five-piece endgame tablebases but omitted this endgame because \\"... it proved too hard to understand\\" . He also commented \\"This is the trickiest of all five-man endings, which is unfortunate as it is one of the most common to arise in practice.\\" General considerations According to Reuben Fine and Pal Benko, this ending is a draw unless the pawn is a bishop pawn or a central pawn (i.e. king pawn or queen pawn) and the pawn is in the seventh rank and is supported by its king. If the defending king can get in front of the pawn, the game is a draw; otherwise it is best for the defender to keep his king far away from the pawn. The defender should keep checking until he runs out of check, and then pin the pawn . Based on computer analysis, M√ºller and Lamprecht give a different description. According to them, normally the defending king needs to be in front of the pawn. A rook pawn or knight pawn is a theoretical draw if the defending king is in front or near the pawn or if the king is in the corner opposite the pawn's promotion square. A knight pawn has more practical winning chances than a rook pawn. A bishop pawn or central pawn is a win if the defending king is not in front of the pawn. A bishop pawn has better winning chances than a central pawn. The position of the defending king is especially important . John Nunn states that analysis since Fine's initial work (published in 1941 in Basic Chess Endings) has shown that there are many more winning positions than were known at that time (ignoring the fifty-move rule in some cases) . Wins by the side with the pawn take up to 59 moves . A cross-check may be necessary to win. Edmar Mednis gave this breakdown when the defending king is not able to help: * A bishop pawn is the best pawn to have. It is relatively easy to advance and is a win once it reaches the seventh rank. * A central pawn wins if it reaches the seventh rank, but it is difficult to get it there. Even if the pawn reaches the sixth rank, the position is usually a draw. * A knight pawn is relatively easy to get to the seventh rank, but the position may be a theoretical draw. * Positions with rook pawns are theoretical draws, but in practice it may be difficult to draw . John Nunn gives this summary for the defense: * with a central pawn, the defense has two possibilities: get the king in front of the pawn or get the king to corner nearest to the pawn's promotion square * with a bishop pawn, the defender's only chance is to get the king in front of the pawn * with a knight pawn, the defender must get the king in front of the pawn or in the corner furthest from the promotion square * a rook pawn is generally a draw and the defensive guidelines are the same as for a knight pawn. Naturally, the less advanced the pawn is, the better the defensive chances . Rook pawn In 1985 the chess computer Belle completed the endgame tablebase for this ending. The rook pawn is the most important for actual games since it arises the most frequently, since it is the least likely pawn to have been exchanged . A rook pawn needs to be on at least the sixth rank to have decent winning chances . Mednis gave these guidelines, based on his analysis of the tablebase. Assume that White has a pawn on the h-file. To draw: * The best area for the king is in the corner opposite the pawn's promotion square. This keeps it from blocking checks by its queen. * When the white queen is centralized, the safest place for the black king is probably b3. * Once the king is in the far corner it should stay there. * At certain points the king can be on other squares and still draw, but it is much more difficult to play correctly. * The queen should be centralized. * The queen checks on the central squares for more flexibility on future moves. * The queen checks in ways so that the white queen cannot be centralized. * The queen is used to keep the king in front of its pawn. * The queen is used to prevent the white queen from becoming active. * If the queen is on e5 it will draw against a pawn on h7 and queen on g6 or f7 if the black king is in the far corner. * The queen is kept active and in a flexible place. It will be more active on c2 than h7. * The queen on h7 is often good enough to draw. To win: *The worst place for the king is in front of the pawn. * There are two good places for the king: ** to the side of the pawn, e.g. f7, f8, or e8. ** close to the black king, which allows for counterchecks. * The pawn is advanced to the seventh rank only if the queen is in place to prevent perpetual check. * If the pawn is on h7, the best square for the queen is e4. In favorable circumstances, other squares (e.g. f5, d7) will also win . Knight pawn A knight pawn should be on at least the fifth rank to have good winning chances. A knight pawn on the fifth rank has better winning chances than a rook pawn on the sixth rank. There are two reasons for this: * the king has squares on the adjacent rook file to try to avoid perpetual check * the exchange of queens is less likely to lead to a drawn king and pawn versus king endgame. The best place for the defending king is in front of the pawn and the second-best place is in the corner opposite its promotion square . Bishop pawn A bishop pawn offers the best winning chances. One reason is that there is no drawing zone in the opposite corner for the black king if the pawn is on at least the fourth rank. If the pawn is on the fifth rank the defender's chances are small unless the king is in front of the pawn. A pawn on the sixth rank wins unless the defending king is in front of the pawn . Central pawn A central pawn has better chances to win than a rook pawn or knight pawn, but not as good as a bishop pawn. As with the bishop pawn, there is no drawing zone for the defending king in the opposite corner. It is better for the defending king to be on the \\"short side\\" of the pawn rather than the \\"long side\\" .

Queen and two pawns versus a queen {align=\\"right\\" |-valign=\\"top\\" |+Lputian vs. Haroutjunian, 2001  |} This is usually a win for the two pawns, but victory can be difficult to achieve even in winning positions, as even the slightest inaccuracy may lead to perpetual check. Positions in which one of the pawns is vulnerable to attack may be drawn, but they are unusual . There are a number of other drawing exceptions, most notably with connected rook and knight pawns (a- & b-pawns, or g- & h-pawns) in which the defending king is ahead of the pawns . One such an example is Smbat Lputian vs. Gevorg Haroutjunian, 2001. The position after 86.h6 (the last pawn move of the game) is a draw. Played continued until move 142, with inaccuracies on both sides swinging the position from a draw to a forcing win, and back again. Interestingly, Black could have claimed a draw by the fifty- move rule for the last several moves, including the final position in which he resigned, but he did not . Queen and two pawns versus a queen and pawn Normally this is a win for the two pawns, but a surprising result of seven- piece Lomonosov tablebases is that the longest possible win require 594 plies. However, in Kasparov versus the World, Kasparov was the side with a single pawn, but won because his pawn was far more advanced than the world team's pawns, which also hindered perpetual checks by them.

In addition to being a military training and mustering facility of the New Jersey National Guard (New Jersey National Guard 2/113 Infantry 250 Jersey City), the WPA era armory has long been used as a sports arena, particularly for boxing, basketball, and track and field events, and more recently mixed martial arts. Under the auspices of the New Jersey Department of Military and Veteran Affairs, the armory is leased to the city for community and political events and extracurricular sports programs. It has also been used as a film studio. Architecture The armory was built to replace the previous Fourth Regiment Armory which had burned down in 1927. An arch at Pershing Field park in Jersey City Heights is a portion of the entrance fa√ßade from the previous armory. The Works Progress Administration project was completed in 1937, the same year the city's other big sports venue, the since demolished Roosevelt Stadium. The three-story beaux-arts structure features English Renaissance details with a granite base, brick exterior wall, and terra cotta trim. The massive interior is 175,000 square feet. Between 2005 and 2009 the armory underwent a refurbishment which included state-of-the-art running surface, a new basketball court, new lighting and a four-sided scoreboard as well installation of new locker rooms and restrooms. In 2010, the sidewalks around the armory were repaired. Notable events The New Jersey National Guard maintains 64 armories within 46 communities, as part of New Jersey Department of Military and Veteran Affairs. Some are used for non-military activities, such as the Teaneck Armory, home to the New Jersey Nets in their first season.Wojnarowski, Adrian. \\"Twenty-five years later, Boe makes up for mistake\\", ESPN.com, June 3, 2003.

Trouble was, nobody bothered to check out the court.... Mikan declared the court unplayable, New Jersey had to forfeit the game, Kentucky advanced to the playoffs and New Jersey never played another game in Teaneck Armory.\\" Both the former and current armories in Jersey City have played an important role in Hudson County and New Jersey's pugilist past, which includes the 1921 Dempsey ‚Äì Carpentier world heavyweight championship at Boyle's Thirty Acres. The current armory has hosted many bouts, including those with James J. Braddock, Sonny Liston, and Chuck Wepner, aka Bayonne Bleeder. In a 1979 fund raiser for the Jersey City Medical Center then Mayor of Jersey City Thomas F. X. Smith challenged Muhammad Ali to an exhibition bout, and went three rounds before a crowd of 8,000. In 2010, the first fight card in three decades returned to the Armory with the mixed martial arts Urban Conflict Championship. Trials for the World Professional Jiu-Jitsu Cup 2011 took place in February 2011. The arena has also hosted basketball games, including those played by St. Anthony High School, ten-time winners of New Jersey's Tournament of Champions and considered one of the United States' top high school basketball teams. The school's long-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach, Bob Hurley, was instrumental in bringing about the renewal of the court and other renovations. Since 2005 the annual Dan Finn Classic, a day of basketball games, has taken place at the Armory. The event is in memory Dan Finn, a St. Peter's Preparatory School graduate who died in an accident and, as organ donor, was able to assist four other people after his death.Dan Finn Classic Prior to the opening of the Yanitelli Center on its campus nearby, Saint Peter¬¥s College used the venue for its home games, and still occasionally uses the venue for high-profile games. Many local, regional, and state (New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association) track meets are also held at the venue.NJ Runners.com Professional wrestling events produced by Jersey All Pro Wrestling have taken place in the arena as well. In 2004, the Armory was the site of memorial service for deceased Jersey City mayor Glenn Dale Cunningham attended by 5,000, and where in 2007 his wife Sandra Bolden Cunningham launched her political career. In 2006, a funeral attended by thousands took place at the armory for Jersey City Police officer Robert Nguyen. He and his partner, Shawn Carson, had died on December 25 after their patrol car plunged in the Hackensack River from the Lincoln Highway Hackensack River Bridge which they were not informed had been opened. Along with traditional bagpipes, Buddhist monks participated in the ceremony, reflecting Nguyen's Vietnamese- American background.

When the design was accepted it was found that the other letters in Novel Gothic were \\"too eccentric\\" for use on government posters, and so a new, simpler face was designed by Morris Fuller Benton, the co-designer of Novel Gothic, for use on NRA materials. Naturally, it was named for the NRA eagle. It was an all-capitals display font, cast in sizes from 18 to 96 point, and was available at least into the 1940s. The Font Bureau copied this font in 1989 and published lower-case letters for it. In 1990, \\"Eagle Book\\" was added to the family for starting text. \\"Eagle Light\\" and \\"Eagle Black\\" were added to the family in 1994, thus completing the series. Fame This font family has gained fame throughout the 1930s when \\"Eagle Bold\\" became a huge hit. This font family has even inspired the Turner Broadcasting System to use the Eagle Bold font for two logos created for one of their 24-hour cartoon channels (Cartoon Network), until May 29, 2010.

All three had previously worked together on The Machine Girl, and Nishimura worked on Tokyo Gore Police. The film premiered in theaters on October 3, 2009. The film's theme song is \\"Lost Control\\" by Art-School. The film is about two sisters named Yoshie and Kikue Kasuga, Geishas who get abducted by a steel manufacturer in an attempt to transform them into murderous cyborg assassins. Plot The film starts out with an assassination attempt on a political candidate by a Geisha (that turns out to be a robot) and two scantily-clad women wearing Tengu/Goblin masks. The goblin-clad women violently (and phallically) take out the body guards (notably shooting shuriken out their butts) as the politician is menaced and wounded by the robot geisha who has a circular saw blade in her mouth. Suddenly, another person named Yoshie (Aya Kiguchi) appears, reveals herself as a robogeisha, and destroys the villainous robot. We go back in time to see Yoshie as a servant for her sister Kikue (Hitomi Hasebe), who is a geisha in training. It is later revealed that the two sisters were orphaned, and though they used to be close (with Kikue being the favorite child), they are now enemies. Yoshie is klutzy and ruins Kikue's performance for Hikaru Kageno (Takumi Saito), heir to Kageno Steel Manufacturing. Despite her klutziness, Kageno is impressed with Yoshie's beauty and becomes more interested when he witnesses her display of superhuman strength when threatened by Kikue. Eventually, Kageno invites the two sisters to his house, where they are captured by the goblin ladies. The two are forced to fight to the death, and after Kikue wounds and actually threatens to kill her sister, Yoshie snaps and knocks out Kikue, once again displaying superhuman physical prowess. Accordingly, Kageno and his father begin training Yoshie to become an assassin for the company along with many other young Geisha-type women, and she quickly becomes the head assassin. They are told that Kageno Steel seeks to use them to kill terrorists and other national threats in an effort to create an \\"Ideal World\\". Kikue, meanwhile, is relegated to the role of servant to the organization. Nonetheless, Kikue strives to outdo her sister and shows a greater propensity for violence than Yoshie. Eventually, both sisters frequently undergo surgery to become cyborgs (Robogeisha), with machine-gun busts and other robotic enhancements. On their first mission, however, Kikue is severely wounded when she selflessly saves Yoshie from being killed by one of their target's bodyguards. Later, Kikue explains to Kageno that though Yoshie annoys her, she still loves her sister. Nonetheless, Kikue will never be able to recuperate sufficiently to serve as an assassin. The story reaches a turning point when Yoshie is sent on a mission to kill a small group of elderly people and their young caretaker living near the Kageno Steel building. The seniors then reveal that they are the relatives of the Kageno Steel's geisha and goblin assassins and that Kageno Steel has actually been abducting these girls to serve their own ends. Yoshie confronts Kageno and his father, who confirms the story. Then, the duo threatens to kill Kikue unless Yoshie completes what turns out to be a suicide mission. The other girls also have been devoid of a conscience and humanity for so long that they decline to return to their families, remaining geisha assassins. Yoshie barely makes it out of the building after an Explosion from the Suicide mission and her body is recovered by the senior group and she is rebuilt by the leader, who used to work for Kageno Steel. The protestors want a meeting to demand the return of their loved ones. They found a set of Kageno's blueprints for a bomb that's said to be \\"17 times more powerful than the atomic bomb\\" and intend to use to threaten Japan into ceding all power to them. The group then heads off to confront Kageno and his father and force them to return their cyborg relatives or reveal the bomb plot to the authorities. But the Meeting is revealed to be a trap as the father and son have also robotically modified themselves and kill most of the senior group. The leader, however, had installed a gun into his leg and uses it to kill Kageno's father. Hiraku, now freed from responsibility, activates a protocol that turns his family castle into a giant robot. Kageno reveals that he intends to drop the bomb into Mount Fuji, thus destroying Japan and himself and \\"freeing\\" everyone. The robot-castle is wired to mimic Kageno's every move. Yoshie launches an assault on the robot-castle, defeating her former geisha sisters and the goblin girls (in a battle featuring a butt-sword duel). She confronts Kageno, but is met by Kikue who has been upgraded into a superior model of robogeisha and who has had her mind wiped. Kikue defeats Yoshie. Knowing she has been bested, Yoshie reveals that, in fact, she was her father's favorite daughter because Kikue was actually born to their father's mistress and was looked down upon. Yoshie reminds Kikue that in fact, it was Yoshie who had defended Kikue's honor as a child and then also allowed Kikue to build their false history and become the family geisha. Finally, Yoshie confesses that she loves Kikue. These revelations manage to overcome Kikue's memory blocks and the two sisters reconcile and merge into one ultra-powerful robogeisha. The new robogeisha confronts Kageno and trick him during their fight to have the robot-castle (which mirrors his fighting moves) stop the bomb from being dropped into Mount Fuji and launch the bomb and robot-castle into space. Once airborne, the sisters defeat Kageno and the bomb detonates, destroying the robot-castle and all inside (including, presumably, our heroes). The film ends with Yoshie imagining she and her sister living happily as real geisha.

Carrie Johnston, writing in the Washington Post, reported that Ziaulhaq and two other Afghans, Bashir Ahmad and Mohammad Rafi accepted an invitation to come to a conference in the United States, that turned out to be a ploy to hold them in the USA as potential witnesses against their employers. The three men worked for Afghan construction firms that are suspected of bribing American GIs. She reported that the three Afghan men came to America in the summer of 2008. Since then they have shared a hotel suite in Chicago. She reported that the Prosecution finally said they would need to interview him for only an hour. Early life Ziaulhaq had once trained as a veterinary assistant. He is married, with six children. Employed by a firm with construction contracts on the American Air Base in Bagram Ziaulhaq worked as an office clerk and driver for an Afghan construction firm. The Washington Post reported that he was employed by the firm due to family ties. Apprehension by US officials Ziaulhaq, Bashir Ahmad, Mohammad Rafi, Assad John Ramin and several other Afghans, received invitations to travel to a conference in Columbus, Ohio, dedicated to celebrating the successes of Operation Enduring Freedom. When the Afghans arrived in the USA they were taken into custody. Assad John Ramin, and other more senior members of the Afghan construction firms, face bribery charges. Ziaulhaq, Bashir Ahmad, and Mohammad Rafi, the three Afghans who didn't face charges, were classed as material witnesses, and detained as flight risks. They were equipped with electronic monitoring cuffs, and required to report in on a daily basis. They receive an $88 a day per diem. Bribery case Air Force Master Sergeant Patrick W. Boyd, Major Christopher P. West and a third GI plead guilty shortly after the Afghans were apprehended. Afghans who faced charges include: Abdul Qudoos Bahkshi, Noor Alam, Tahir Ramin. Prosecutors said Boyd accepted $130,000, and that West accepted between $400,000 and $1 million. The Washington Post reported on October 22, 2009 that Ziaulhaq finally testified. The article described him as \\"gaunt\\", and stated he testified for two hours. He testified he had no knowledge of kickbacks, and that he had no signing authority or other responsibilities in the finances of the firm he worked for. Under cross examination by the contractors' defense counself he was asked to confirm an estimate that during the fourteen months he had been held as a material witness the prosecution may have spent $60,000 to $70,000 on his per diem, travel and other expenses associated with his detention.

Uta Ewa  History  Because of its location at the break in the mangrove swamp and rain forest of the eastern Niger River delta, it was a collecting point for slaves in the 19th century. in 1870, Jubo Juboha came to Ikot Abasi and founded the kingdom of Opobo. He was a former Igobo (Ibo) slave. Ikot Abasi, a community in then Calabar Province, for good reasons. Although Ikot Abasi, formerly part of the famed Opobo Kingdom, was already on the world map before 1929, the women's uprising against Nigeria's colonial rulers in 1929 was to provide a further push into prominence for this town, then already popular as the site of a famous boat yard, seat of a British consulate and part of the late King Jaja's area. Three-quarters of a century ago, Ikot Abasi was one of a number of towns in both Calabar and Owerri provinces, whose women bravely took exception to what they considered exploitative excesses of the British rulers of the then non-independent Nigeria. In 1995, the year of that famed Beijing conference, the National Gallery of Modern Art, Lagos (NGA) put out a very important book, The women's revolt of 1929. The book, which features contributions from notable academics like Prof. Monday E. Noah, Prof. Obaro Ikime and Chief N.U. Akpan, among others, reminds that one of the women killed by the colonial forces during the 1929 protest was the mother of a boy, Egbert. That lad would later grow into a famous jurist and administrator (Justice Egbert Udo Udoma). Such was the impact of the reforms that trailed the woman's protest that the March 8, 1933 issue of the Daily Times described the changes as \\"the great charter of liberty for the people\\". But the prize did not come easy. Prof. M. E. Ekpo, another of the book's contributors, revealed that in the Calabar Province alone, more than 53 people were killed beside over 50 others injured. Launched in 1989, in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the uprising, The women's revolt of 1929 is an anthology of select papers from a national symposium on the subject, which took place in Port-Harcourt in 1982. According to Dr Paul Chike Dike, editor of the anthology, \\"An attempt by the (protesting) women to move nearer the colonial troops led to the order to shoot, in which over 24 women were killed\\". The sculpture for the slain Women  Geography  Until the 1970s, the ancient Opobo Kingdom was part of then South Eastern State (later re-Christened Cross River). However, a boundary adjustment exercise split Opobo. Opobo Island was made part of Rivers State while the mainland part remained within Cross River. That area, renamed Ikot Abasi, now lies in present-day Akwa Ibom State. Sources say ancient Ikot Abasi referred to smaller settlement but the name has assumed a more or less generic dimension in recent times. In the larger sense, today's Ikot Abasi comprises five clans: Ikpa-Ibekwe, Ukpum-Ette, Ukpum-Okon, Edem-Aya and Ikpa Nnung Asang. The palace of the paramount ruler of Ikot Abasi is within Ukpum okon clan . Ikot Abasi once hosted a British Consulate, which is how one of the major streets here, Consulate Road, came by its name. At the roundabout leading to Consulate Road, the tourist would notice a statue of the late Justice Udo Udo Udoma, the first Nigerian to bag a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in law. The deceased legend's other achievements included his appointment as Chairman, Constituent Assembly (1977 to 79), Chief Justice of Uganda (1963‚Äì69) and Governor-General of that African Great Lakes country in 1963. Sauntering down Consulate Road, the wayfarer is likely to find one or two decent eateries not long after walking past Beracah Chambers, a law office. Further down this road, stands the Local Government Secretariat. Overlooking the river, which separates Ikot Abasi from Opobo Island, are a number of quaint bungalows. One or two of these blocks serve as offices of the Ikot Abasi Traditional Rulers Council. Opposite these chiefs' secretariat, across a narrow asphalt lane, is a monument that was unveiled on December 16, 1985 by Justice Udoma. The spot, where the sculpture has been installed, is believed to be the place that some of the brave women were martyred in 1929.  Tourism  The area is dotted with tourist attraction centres. Her beautiful beach front at Uta Ewa, the Berger Jetty along Uta Ewa creek and the coastline create attractive tourist resorts.  Natural resources  The abundant gas and oil deposits have attracted many establishments to the area. The oil fields include Utapate (onshore). Adna (offshore) and Asabo (offshore).  Agricultural resources  Arable agricultural produce include cassava, yam, sweet yam, taro and maize while cash crops are not limited to oil palm, coconut, raffia, rubber and palm kernel. There is abundant forest reserve for timber and wild life while commercial fishing thrives in the area. Although known for boat-building, a sand bar partially blocks the entrance to its port from the Gulf of Guinea. Ikot Abasi is also a home to Alscon, the biggest aluminium smelter plant in Africa.  Commerce  Fishing, trading, subsistence farming.

His work & thinking Shankar (his original name is not Shankar, but Dhiresh) was born in a middle-class family. His father's name was Heramba Kumar and mother's name Kalyani. He received his primary education at the village of Jamunamukh of the Naogaon district of Assam, and the beautiful natural scenario of Assam made him a lover of nature. He received his high-school education when he was living with his uncle in the Sanktoria coalfield area near Asansol. Looking closely at the lives of the coal-miners, he began to understand how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. While studying the Intermediate Science Course in Jalpaiguri, he got involved in student movement and became a devoted worker of Students' Federation. The wave of the food movement all over Bengal in 1959 swept him away. He got the membership of the undivided Communist Party of India as a skilful student organizer. As he was intensely involved in student politics, his results in the examination were not good. Yet he was allotted a seat for studying engineering in Jalpaiguri on the strength of family recommendation. But he considered it an undue privilege and deserted his home. It was the year 196I, when it was not difficult to find an employment in the BSP. I heard from Niyogi that the recruiting officer of the plant used to sit before a table at the Durg railway station, the purpose being to recruit for the plant those who had come from outside to seek employment. Dhiresh's age was then a few months less than eighteen, which was the minimum age for employment. So he had to wait for some time. Then he underwent a training course, after which he was employed as a skilled worker at the coke-oven department of the plant. He had nursed a desire for higher education, and hence began to study the BSc and AMIH courses at Durg's science college as a private student. Dhiresh gave leadership to the student movement of that college. Sweepers of the Durg municipality, informed of this skilful leader, came to him, and realized their demands after a successful strike under his leadership. The recognized union of the steel plant was affiliated to the INTUC. The next largest union was that of the AITUC. Niyogi, while remaining with the AITUC, went on organizing the workers independently for the solution of their various problems. In 1964, the CPI split into two, and Dhiresh joined the CPI (M). At that time, he studied classical Marxism‚ÄìLeninism under the guidance of Dr B S Yadu, a veteran communist physician. The . Naxalbari uprising of 1967 created a stir in Madhya Pradesh too, and almost all the CPI (M) activists of this province were influenced by it. Dhiresh came in contact with the All-India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries. After the formation of the CPI (ML) on 22 April 1969, he was associated with it for some time. But failure to adapt his own activities to the party line of boycott of mass organizations and mass lines led to his expulsion from the party. (It may be mentioned that the decision to expel Niyogi was taken in the presence of an elderly central leader and subsequently, that leader too opposed the party line on the same question.) Meanwhile, some events had taken place. Dhiresh lost his job after leading the first successful strike in the BSP. On the other hand, the police, having branded him a Naxalite, was looking for him. At that time, he went underground and began to take his thoughts to the ordinary workers by means of a Hindi weekly. Inspired by Lenin's Iskra, he named the weekly Sphulinga (Spark). Side by side, he began preparations for going to the villages. During this period, he came to the realization that for the victory of the working class movement, it was essential to form a bond between this class and the exploited Chhattisgarhi nationality. He wrote a booklet on the nationality problem of Chhattisgarh, which was proscribed by the police when it was coming to Chhattisgarh after getting printed in Maharashtra. In order to know Chhattisgarh and its people, in order to be integrated with them, he, from 1968, went on passing his days incognito in the villages. Sometimes he assumed the identity of a seller of goats, buying goats in the villages and selling them in Durg and Bhilai. He could in this way maintain his contacts with his comrades there. Sometimes he was a peddler, sometimes a fisherman or a PWD labourer. Alongside, he continued the work of organizing the people through movements, e.g. movement for the construction of the Daihan dam, movement of the peasants of Balod for irrigation water, movement of the adivasis against the construction of the Mongra dam. In 1971, he got employment as a contract labourer in Danitola Quartzite mine of the BSP; the skilled worker of coke- oven was now grinding stones, wearing shorts. This is the period when he assumed the name Shankar by which he became famous. Here he made his acquaintance with his future wife Asha, daughter of his co-labourer Siyaram. The first miners' union organized by him was also located in Danitola, although under the banner of the AITUC. Before his arrest under the MISA during the Emergency in 1975, Niyogi's organizational activities were in Danitola. The largest iron ore mines of the BSP were situated in Dalli- Rajhara. When Niyogi was imprisoned in Raipur Jail, contract miners of Dalli- Rajhara were vigorously engaged in a spontaneous movement. The leadership of the INTUC and the AITUC entered into an unjust agreement with the BSP management, according to which, permanent workers and contract labourers were to receive Rs 308 and Rs 70 per head respectively, although both categories of workers did the same type of work. Workers came out of the two unions in protest against this unjust agreement. It was the last phase of the Emergency. On 3 March, workers stopped work and started an indefinite dharna in the Lal Maidan. They were looking for an able commander who could lead them. Seeing the militant attitude of the workers, no union leader belonging to the CITU, HMS or BMS-‚Äîdared to face them. A few days later, as the Emergency came to an end, Shankar was released from prison. The distance between Dalli-Rajhara and Danitola is only 22 kilometres. Some workers, who had come out of the AITUC, knew Niyogi as an honest, lighting leader. Hence a team of representatives of Dalli-Rajhara workers went to Danitola in order to request him to give leadership to their movement. Niyogi, at their invitation, came to Dalli- Rajhara, and the independent organization of contract miners, Chhattisgarh Mines Shramik Sangh (CMSS) was formed. The flag of the new union was red- green, red standing for workers' self-sacrifice and green for the peasantry. The first struggle of miners under Shankar Guha Niyogi's leadership was a struggle for dignity; they would not obey the agreement signed by the leaders who were lackeys of the management. They accepted financial losses and took Rs 50 each, instead of Rs 70, as bonus from the management and contractors of the steel plant. In May 1977, began the movement for idle wage (the wage that a worker is entitled to, when the employer cannot provide him with work) and for Rs I00 as house repairing allowance. The pressure of the movement compelled the management and contractors to yield to these two demands in presence of the officers of the labour department. But on 1 June, when the workers went to take payment of the repairing allowance, the contractors refused to pay it. The workers again went on strike. At the night of 2 June, the next day, two jeeploads of policemen came to arrest Niyogi. They arrested Niyogi from the hovel of the union, and a jeep sped away with Niyogi. Before the other jeep started, workers, awakened from their sleep, surrounded the remaining policemen, demanding the release of their leader. In order to break the encirclement, the police opened fire, killing seven persons, including Anasuya Bai, a woman worker, and Sudama, a boy. But this did not prove enough for them to get out of the encirclement. Finally, on 3 June, a large police contingent arrived from Durg, killed four more workers and rescued the encircled policemen. But police atrocity failed to put down the workers' movement. After a continuous strike of as many as 18 days, the mine management and the contractors again agreed to the demands of the workers. Niyogi was released from prison. The enthusiasm generated by this victory led to the formation of branches of the CMSS in other captive mines of the BSP‚ÄîDanitola, Nandini, Hirri. All the branches together launched another wave of movement with further victories. Dalli-Rajhara falls within the district of Durg, and a neighbouring district was Bastar. The authorities took the initiative of full mechanization of the Bailadila iron-ore mines of Bastar, the inevitable consequence of which would be retrenchment of workers. On 5 April 1978 the police of the Janata Government opened fire on the workers struggling under the leadership of the AITUC to resist mechanization. Workers of Dalli-Rajhara stood by these struggling fellows. Side by side, Niyogi made Dalli-Rajhara workers aware of the impending danger of mechanization. The workers started the movement against mechanization, and compelled the management to accept the proposal of semi-mechanization, which would raise the quantity and quality of output without retrenching workers. They resisted mechanization till 1994. (In 1994, one section of the leadership behaved treacherously with the workers and handed over the Dalli mines to the management for full mechanization.) Successive victories of the union in economic movements led to large increases in the daily wages of the workers of Dalli-Rajhara. But that scarcely had any impact on their standards of living. Rather the adivasi workers increased their expenditure on alcohol. Niyogi asked, \\"Should the blood of martyrs then go down the drain of the wine shop?\\" The union initiated a novel sharab bandi (anti-liquor) movement, which freed about one hundred thousands of persons from this intoxicating habit. However, while continuing this movement, he had to be imprisoned under the National Security Act. Niyogi gave the trade union movement a new dimension. So long, no established trade union did anything except demanding higher pay or bonus or replying to charge-sheets. In other words, trade union activities covered only those subjects that were related with the work places of the workers. Niyogi held that a trade union's activity should not be confined to eight hours' (work time's) issues; it has to deal with twenty four hours' issues. With this idea, the new union launched many new experiments in Dalli-Rajhara. Mohalla Committees were set up in order to improve the housing conditions of the workers. In the schools run by the BSP, there was no provision for education of the children of contract labourers. Six primary schools were set up for these children under the leadership of the union, and an adult education programme for illiterate workers was undertaken. The pressure of the movement for education compelled the management to set up a number of primary, secondary and higher secondary schools. The health movement started in the form of cleansing (safai) movement. On 26 January 1982, the Shaheed Dispensary started functioning. On the Shaheed Divas (martyr's day) of 1983, the Shaheed Hospital was inaugurated. For the pastime of the workers and for the expansion of a healthy culture, naya anjor (morning sunshine) cultural troupe was set up. The Shaheed Sudama Football Club and the Red-Green Athletic Club were formed for the cultivation of health. The Mahila Mukti Morcha was formed for women's liberation movement. The CMM was built up with the aim of freeing Chhattisgarh from exploitation and for setting up the worker-peasant raj in Chhattisgarh. A model afforestation programme was implemented behind the union premises as a challenge to the anti-people forest policy of the government.

Department of Environment was formed in 1984 Women played an important role in the movement of the CMM. In the Mukhia meetings of the workers' organization, they participated in significant numbers, although they were somewhat less than 50%. The reason is that contract labourers in the mines used to do two types of work, raising (grinding stones) and transporting (loading trucks). The former type of work was done by both men and women, while the latter only by men. From every raising area, men and women were elected in equal numbers, and from a transporting area, only men. From a mohalla, women and men were elected in equal numbers. Consequently, the number of female participants in Mukhia meetings was taken as a whole, somewhat less than that of males. Women workers played important roles in the workers' organization, and in the Mahila Mukti Morcha. Women workers organized other women [Vide : Chandana Mitra, Sangharsh O Nirman (Struggle and Creation), Anustup Prakashan, Kolkata]. Attracted by the novel leadership of Niyogi, people inhabiting the vast stretches of Chhattisgarh began to take up the red‚Äìgreen flag. In those days Chhattisgarh comprised seven of Madhya Pradesh. In five among them, namely Durg, Bastar, Rajnandgaon, Raipur and Bilaspur, the organization and movement of the Mukti Morcha spread rapidly. Among those who fought under the banner of the Morcha were the workers of Bengal-Nagpur Cotton Mill of Rajnandgaon, the oldest factory of Chhattisgarh. On 12 September 1984, the police fired on them to put down their movement. Four workers courted martyrdom, but the movement was victorious. The last struggle fought under Niyogi's leadership was the Bhilai workers' struggle. Bhilai was the centre of exploitation of workers in Chhattisgarh. The struggle started from there, and it drove the factory owners into panic. Yet the demands were apparently very ordinary-living wages (salaries for minimum livelihood), permanent jobs in permanent industries, right to be organized in unions. Chhattisgarh, which is rich in mineral, forest and water resources, was also the supplier of cheap labour. The upshot of acceptance of such demands was hence far-reaching and dreadful to the owners. So, the police, the administration and almost all the political parties joined hands to crush the movement. The police and ruffians were employed to attack. Niyogi was kept in prison from 4 February 1991 to 3 April 1991 on the strength of various old warrants. Attempts were made to extern him from the five districts. But nothing could crush the movement. In order to mobilize public opinion in support of the movement, a large band of workers, led by Niyogi, went to Delhi and gave a deputation to the President and the Prime Minister. A fortnight later, on 28 September, secret assassins hired by the owners murdered Niyogi. Founder of Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha Niyogi was founder of Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha, a political party for his vision towards labour of Rajhara Mines. Now this party is working for development of Rajhara Town as well. Assassination Niyogi was shot and killed while asleep on 28 September 1991. The trial of his murder suspects generated tremendous controversy, as a lower court awarded strict punishments to all suspects, but higher courts later convicted just one suspect, and let off two industrialists.

A province that does not receive equalization payments is often referred to as a \\"have province\\", while one that does is called a \\"have not province\\". In 2020‚Äì21, five provinces will receive $20.573 billion in equalization payments from the federal government. Equalization payments are one example of what are often collectively referred to in Canada as \\"transfer payments\\", a term used in other jurisdictions to refer to cash payments to individuals (see Canadian transfer payments). The purpose of equalization payments is to enable the \\"have not\\" provinces to provide public services which are reasonably comparable to those in other provinces, at similar levels of taxation. The money the provinces receive through equalization can be spent in any way the provincial government desires and often help guarantee a standard level of health care, education, and welfare in all the provinces. The definition of \\"reasonably comparable levels\\", however, has been the subject of considerable debate among politicians, journalists and academics. Equalization payments are one form of transfer payments from the federal to the provincial governments which include the Canada Social Transfer (CST) and the Canada Health Transfer (CHT). The territories are not included in the equalization program. Federal funding for them are instead provided through the Territorial Formula Financing (TFF) program. History A mechanism for the Canadian federal government to provide funds through transfer payments to the provinces has existed since Canadian Confederation, and was first enshrined in the Constitution Act, 1867 Section 119 as a mechanism for the new federal government to provide further grants to the province of New Brunswick. The Constitution itself enshrines the federal government with significantly greater taxation authorities in Section 91, which is \\"The raising of Money by any Mode or System of Taxation\\", while the legislatures of the provinces are limited to \\"Direct Taxation within the Province in order to the raising of a Revenue for Provincial Purposes\\". A formal system of equalization payments was first introduced in 1957. Revised September 4, 2013The idea was based on the proposals of American economist James M. Buchanan and they were introduced mainly to help the struggling Atlantic provinces who were seeing low rates of growth and high rate of emigration to central Canada. The original program had the goal of giving each province the same per-capita revenue as the two wealthiest provinces, Ontario and British Columbia, in three tax bases: personal income taxes, corporate income taxes and succession duties (inheritance taxes). Five years later, 50 per cent of natural resource revenues were included as the fourth tax base. At the same time, however, the standard of the two wealthiest provinces was lowered to the national average. In 1967 the system was redesigned to work with every government revenue scheme with the exception of energy; this gave Canada by far the world's most generous system of equalization payments. The rise in energy prices and the resulting increase in provincial natural resource royalties in the late 1970s created several problems for the equalization formula. The need for amendments to the formula became clear when the traditional \\"have\\" province of Ontario qualified for equalization payments in 1978. This result went against the spirit of the system and would have led to substantial costs for the federal government; it was agreed that Ontario should be excluded from receiving payments. In 1982, the equalization standard was shifted from the national average to the average of the five \\"representative\\" provinces: British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. The Canada Act 1982, which amended the constitution, included the rights of the poorer provinces to equalization payments. Subsection 36(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982 states that \\"Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation\\" With this level of protection, equalization payments cannot \\"suddenly be axed\\". From 1983‚Äì84 to 2014, about 22 per cent of the federal government's spending went towards transfers to provincial and territorial governments. In 2004, the federal government and the provinces agreed to suspend the traditional formula that determined payment amounts and move to fixed funding levels, which were scheduled to grow at a fixed rate - regardless of the economic performance of the provinces. In March 2005, then federal Minister of Finance Ralph Goodale, in the last year of the Liberal Party Premiership of Jean Chr√©tien, established an expert panel, chaired by Al O'Brien‚Äîa former Government of Alberta deputy minister‚Äîto produce a report to review Canada's Equalization program and Territorial Formula Financing (TFF). The comprehensive report by the Expert Panel on Equalization and Territorial Formula Financing, was tabled in 2006. Following the 2006 Canadian federal election, the newly elected Conservative Party, under then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, committed to a \\"renewed and strengthened Equalization program\\", as outlined in the 2006 budget plan entitled, \\"Restoring Fiscal Balance in Canada.\\" Based on the Al O'Brien 2006 Expert Panel on Equalization and Territorial Formula Financing report, then Minister of Finance, Jim Flaherty reinstated the formula-driven calculations in the Equalization program and enhanced it by moving to a standard based on the national average. A fiscal capacity cap was added to ensure that equalization-receiving provinces couldn't be raised to a fiscal capacity above that of a non-receiving province (this could potentially arise due to the partial or non-inclusion of resource revenues). This faced criticism from Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador Danny Williams who criticized the Conservative government of breaking their promise of not changing the current formula. This led to the Anything But Conservative movement. In 2009, the fiscal capacity cap was modified and a ceiling and floor on aggregate payments were added. In 2009, under then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Finance Canada created the Total Transfer Protection (TTP) intended to be a temporary policy which would support provinces and territories \\"in transitioning through current economic challenges.\\" The TTP ensured that if a province experienced a total reduction in federal transfers from equalization payments, combined with Canada Health Transfer (CHT), the Canada Social Transfer (CST), the federal government would cover the loss. In 2010‚Äì11, the federal government, under then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, confirmed that every province would be guaranteed that their transfer would not be less than the previous fiscal year in combined CHT, CST, equalization and Territorial Formula Financing (TFF).The June 19, 2014 Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) report was produced at\\" the request of a parliamentarian\\" with a mandate to analyze \\"provincial and territorial entitlements with respect to the Canada Health Transfer, the Canada Social Transfer, Equalization and Territorial Formula Financing and Total Transfer Protection for the fiscal year 2014-15, comparing them with 2013-14 levels\\" with a specific focus on the Equalization program. Under Harper's TTP plan, from 2010 through 2013, seven provinces, including the four Atlantic provinces, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Quebec received a combined total of over $2.2-billion through the TTP program. Ottawa cancelled the program in 2014, a political decision said to be directed at pressuring Ontario's ruling Liberals by depriving them of $640 million. In 2017‚Äì2018, the total amount of the Equalization program was roughly 18.3 billion Canadian dollars. In the February 27, 2018 budget, the federal finance department proposed a five-year renewal of the previous equalization and Territorial Formula Financing (TFF)‚Äîwith changes related to the territories‚Äîbeginning April 1, 2019 until 2024. The Budget Implementation Act received royal assent on June 20, 2018. The Government of Alberta and Saskatchewan criticized the decision because they believed that there was no real consultation, discussion, or renegotiation on the formula. Under the renewed plan, the federal government will gradually increase the amount of equalization payments to the provinces from $18.3 billion in 2017‚Äì2018 to $22.1 billion by 2022‚Äì2023. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) September 3, 2020 report, in 2018-2019 total federal transfers‚Äîwhich included $38.6 billion through the Canada Health Transfer (CHT), $14.2 billion through the Canada Social Transfer (CST), and $19.0 billion through the Equalization transfer‚Äîhad increased over the ten-year period from $47.1 billion in 2008‚Äì2009 to $71.7 billion, which represents an average annual increase of 4.3 per cent with an inflation adjustment of 2.7 per cent a year.  Canada‚Äôs equalization formula  The fiscal capacity of provinces is measured using a representative tax system, a basic model of provincial and municipal tax systems, covering virtually all own source revenues. It is made up of estimates of provincial tax bases, actual provincial revenues and population. By using the same tax base definition across all provinces the representative tax system can be used to compare the ability of individual provinces to raise revenues. \\"Have provinces\\" are those able to generate more tax revenue per person than the national average, while have not provinces would have revenue per person below the national average. The individual revenue sources are grouped into five categories: personal income taxes, business income taxes, consumption taxes, up to 50 percent of natural resource revenue, and property taxes and miscellaneous. Each revenue category has a separate tax base. Each province is allocated an \\"equalization entitlement\\" equal to the amount by which its fiscal capacity is below the average fiscal capacity of all provinces. This is known as the \\"10 province standard\\". Provinces who have a fiscal capacity above the 10 province standard are known as the \\"have\\" provinces while those below are the \\"have not\\" provinces. Equalization payments are then determined based on the provinces' relation to this average. The payments are typically adjusted to ensure fairness between the provinces and are designed to provide a net fiscal benefit to receiving provinces from their resources equivalent to half of their per capita resource revenues. Equalization payments are further adjusted to ensure the program aligns with the overall growth of the Canadian economy (based on a three-year moving average of GDP). Note: According to the Department of Finance, \\"provinces get the greater of the amount they would receive by fully excluding natural resource revenues, or by excluding 50% of natural resource revenues.\\" Below are equalization payments from 2010‚Äì11 to 2019‚Äì20: { style=\\"text-align:right;\\" |+Table A ‚Äì Equalization payments to Canadian provinces !Province !2020-21 $M !2019-20 $M !2018-19 $M !2017-18 $M !2016-17 $M !2015-16 $M !2014-15 $M !2013-14 $M !2012-13 $M !2011-12 $M !2010-11 $M |- !Quebec |13 253 |13,124 |11,732 |11,081 |10,030 |9,521 |9,286 |7,833 |7,391 |7,815 |8,552 |- !Manitoba |2 510 |2,255 |2,037 |1,820 |1,736 |1,738 |1,750 |1,792 |1,671 |1,666 |1,826 |- !Nova Scotia |2 146 |2,015 |1,933 |1,779 |1,722 |1,690 |1,619 |1,458 |1,268 |1,167 |1,110 |- !New Brunswick |2 210 |2,023 |1,874 |1,760 |1,708 |1,669 |1,666 |1,513 |1,495 |1,483 |1,581 |- !Prince Edward Island |454 |419 |419 |390 |380 |361 |360 |340 |337 |329 |330 |- !Ontario |0 |0 |963 |1,424 |2,304 |2,363 |1,988 |3,169 |3,261 |2,200 |972 |- !Alberta |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |- !British Columbia |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |- !Newfoundland and Labrador |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |- !Saskatchewan |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |- !Total |20 573 |19,619 |18,958 |18,254 |17,880 |17,341 |16,669 |16,105 |16,423 |14,659 |14,372 |} Source: Department of Finance The following \\"have provinces\\" will not qualify for equalization payments in 2020‚Äì21: * Alberta * Ontario * British Columbia * Newfoundland and Labrador * Saskatchewan In 2020, for the first time in 55 years, Alberta will be a net receiver (getting more federal spending than federal taxes). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the province has taken a major hit, specifically in its main resource export, oil and gas. Regional fiscal disparities in Canada The ongoing gap between the \\"have\\" and \\"have not\\" provinces is an ongoing economic concern and cause of regional tensions. Much of the gap stems from huge differences in geography, population, and economic activity among provinces, which make any attempt to \\"equalize\\" these differences challenging. As shown in the table below, PEI's population is less than 1% of the Canadian total, while Ontario's population is close to 40%. Alberta's GDP per capita is 41% higher than the national average while PEI's is roughly 24% lower ‚Äì Alberta's GDP per capita is 185% that of PEI yet the average personal income in Alberta is 159% that of PEI. However, the stated goal of equalization in Canada is not to equalize economies or ensure that economic outcomes are equal. As stated above, it is to \\"ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation\\". Per capita data is central to measuring if provincial outcomes are comparable. { |- style=\\"background: #efefef;\\" |+Table D ‚Äì Economic activity by province  Province or Territory  Population (2017) !Share of Canadian total %  GDP (million 2007 CAD$, 2017)  GDP per capita (2007 CAD$, 2017) !GDP per capita difference from Canadian average %  Average Total Income (CAD$, 2015) !Average total income, difference from Canadian average % |- align=\\"right\\" bgcolor=\\"#e6e6e6\\" align=\\"left\\" |30px Canada||'''''' |100 |'||' |0||'''''' |0 |- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"left\\" ||13.5-3.8-2.3 |- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"left\\" ||11.6+41.0+29.9 |- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"left\\" ||3.1+26.6-0.5 |- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"left\\" ||3.7-8.3-10.5 |- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"left\\" ||38.6-0.15+3.7 |- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"left\\" ||22.7-16.7-11.3 |- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"left\\" ||2.1-20.9-16.9 |- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"left\\" ||0.4-23.9-18.2 |- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"left\\" ||2.6-23.0-12.2 |- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"left\\" ||1.4+2.8-14.1 |} Source: Statistics Canada: GDP (totals), Population, Canada Revenue Agency: Taxation Statistics 2015 taxation year Equalization debate by province According to economist Trevor Tombe, \\"[If] a province cannot raise an \\"average amount\\" with \\"average tax rates,\\" then the federal government will ‚Äì out of its own general revenue ‚Äì top up that province to the \\"average amount.\\" There are no transfers of funds between provinces.\\" Equalization payments have mostly been criticized by leaders and residents of the wealthier provinces. The premiers of the most prosperous provinces have criticized the drain on their finances. Recent negotiations surrounding the renewal of the program have created considerable tension among provinces. Due to the zero-sum nature of the formula, increases in entitlements for some provinces necessarily lead to decreases for others.Normally, under the equalization formula, equalization payments normally go down for every dollar increase in a province's ability to raise taxes. So, for example, if a province's economy booms and the provincial government's potential income tax revenues increase, equalization payments decrease. Economist Michael Smart has argued that this gives have-not provinces an incentive to raise taxes, because any harm higher taxes do to the economy is off-set by higher equalization payments. At a October 25, 2001 talk presented at the \\"Equalization: Welfare Trap or Helping Hand?\\" conference, the American economist James M. Buchanan, whose highly cited 1950 article in The American Economic Review, had introduced original concepts related to federalism and fiscal equity.In his 1950 article, \\"Federalism and Fiscal Equity\\", which has been cited 1038 times, Buchanan was responding to public policy issues in the United States regarding challenges facing fiscal relationships between the federal government and individual states that had become a focus of attention between 1930 through 1950. In those two decades more attention was being focused on federal/states intergovernmental fiscal structures between two constitutionally independent fiscal systems which ultimately affect \\"fiscal resources of individual citizens\\". At the 2001 conference, co-sponsored by AIMS/MEI/FCPP, Buchanan admitted that this idea had flaws, and that it had been criticized for creating a culture of dependence in provinces with relatively low fiscal capacities. Alberta Then Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci in a June 19, 2018 interview with The Globe and Mail, said that the equalization formula had not worked \\"for Alberta, even during the depths of our recession ‚Äì which started in late 2014 and continued ‚Äô15, ‚Äô16 and part of ‚Äô17. I‚Äôd like to see changes to it so that we as Albertans can get a better deal from equalization.\\" In 2018 Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador received no equalization payments. Provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan whose economies are \\"strongly linked to resource extraction\\" have expressed resentment that the equalization formula does not allow them to benefit fairly as it does not consider the weakened economies from 2014 onwards. This combined with the \\"opposition from municipal and provincial governments, or protests, in other parts of the country\\" that have succeeded in blocking and/or slowing down the implementation of \\"major energy infrastructure projects such as the Energy East pipeline and the Trans Mountain expansion\\", have caused added frustrations. According to a December 21, 2018 Edmonton Journal article, Jason Kenney (United Conservative Party (UCP) targeted the alleged inequity of the federal equalization program. He said that \\"[s]ince equalization was created (in 1957), Alberta has received 0.02% of all payments, the last of which was in 1964-1965.\\" Mr Kenney was previously a member of the Stephen Harper federal government which implemented the current as of 2020 equalization formula. According to an opinion column article by economist Trevor Tombe, Alberta \\"pay[s] more and receive[s] less\\" because of \\"unequal circumstances\\". Tombe said that Alberta has a younger population with more high-income earners. It is the province with the smallest number of people who are older than 65, which means that there are fewer CPP and OAS recipients. According to the census, \\"one in eight Albertans older than 15\\" earn over $100,000 annually. Only eleven per cent of Canadians live in Alberta. But 21 per cent of \\"Canada's $100,000-plus earners\\" live in Alberta. Alberta collects about 21 per cent of \\"Canada's corporate taxable income\\". The federal government collects more GST from Alberta because the families with higher incomes also spend more in Alberta. In 2015 Alberta had a net outflow of $27-billion. In spite of the high incomes and large income from corporate taxes, Alberta has a very low income tax rate, which is much lower than the Canadian average, but by 2017, it also has a $10.5-billion deficit. Tombe said that if Alberta had a tax rate similar to the Canadian average, the province would have a surplus not a deficit. Tombe said that Alberta has the strongest economy in Canada which means the province can raise revenue. In order for Alberta's economy to weaken to the point of qualifying for equalization payments, its economy would have to shrink by over 33 per cent which has not happened even during recessions when the price of oil dropped dramatically. Quebec Quebec's high provincial taxes account for its budget surplus, although without equalization Quebec would have had a deficit. Quebec residents pay the highest provincial tax in the country but the lowest federal Tax. Quebec residents pay 16.5% less federal income tax annually than other Canadian provinces due to the Quebec Abatement. This lower direct income tax for Quebec residents is factored in when the federal government transfers (Canada Health Transfer, Canada Social Transfer and Equalization) funds back to the Quebec government. Alberta Premier Kenney added that, since the inception in 1957 of equalization payments, \\"Quebec has received equalization money every year of the program, totaling 221 billion dollars or 51 per cent of all payments.\\" According to the Library of Parliament report, Quebec receives a larger proportion mainly because of the large population in Quebec representing almost a quarter of the population of Canada. It is much larger than most other equalization-receiving provinces,In the Population of Canada by province and territory, based on Statistics Canada data, Quebec's population in 2016 was 8,164,361 which represents 23.2 percent of the population of Canada. In 2007 changes were made to the equalization formula based in large part on the way the formula used property tax revenues as one of the factors. As a result, Quebec's proportion of the total amount increased even more since 2007. The equalization formula has been criticized for not factoring in a below market sale of hydro power to domestic users into the calculation of equalization payments. Between 2005 and 2010, Quebec was calculated to have received 51% more equalization ($42.4 B vs $28.1 B) than it would have if the formula was corrected the same for resource extraction and hydroelectricity. In 2018, Quebec received $11.7 billion of the total $19-billion federal program funds, which is the largest of all transfers to the provinces and territories. Quebec will receive the most from equalization payments in the 2019-2020 year. On February 28, 2001, Bernard Landry, Parti Qu√©b√©cois leader who took office as Quebec premier on March 8, said that it was \\"degrading\\" that Quebec was receiving an extra $1.5 billion in equalization payments in 2001 and that the province had been receiving these payments for over 40 years. Quebec received the \\"lion's share\\" of the 2001 equalization payments. In 2000, Quebec economic growth was slower than that of the other six provinces that were also eligible for payments. Landry blamed the federal government for failing to redistribute \\"real wealth\\", saying Quebec had been \\"short-changed\\" for decades because the federal government did not \\"spend enough in Quebec on research and industry.\\" Paul Martin, federal finance minister, said Quebec's separatists \\"pursue political agendas as opposed to economic agendas\\" and this did not have the \\"beneficial results for their population.\\" In 2017, the Coalition Avenir Qu√©bec said that since 2003, federal equalization payments to Quebec had tripled to more than $11 billion. The party's leader, Fran√ßois Legault, found it \\"shameful\\". In 2019, CAQ Finance Minister Eric Girard wrote in a Financial Post op-ed, argued reiterate the party support to \\"raise Qu√©bec‚Äôs potential GDP growth to two per cent in order to close the wealth gap with the rest of Canada and assume greater economic leadership within the federation\\". He ended the article by stating \\"Someday, Qu√©bec will no longer receive equalization payments, and this will be a great day for Qu√©bec and Canada.\\" Federal MP and People's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier said that the equalization program leads provinces into what he calls a \\"poverty trap\\", where they become dependent on government funds. In a speech in 2010, advocating for more autonomy within Quebec, he argued that \\"It‚Äôs true that other provinces, such as Manitoba and the three Maritime Provinces, get even more equalization money per capita than Quebec, and so are even more dependent on Ottawa. But that‚Äôs not an excuse. As a Quebecer, I am not really proud of the fact that we are a poor province that gets equalization money.\\" In May 2019, the People's Party of Canada called for a new equalization formula, that would respect the Constitution, that would give lower income provinces, like Quebec, incentives to develop pro-growth economic policies thereby avoiding the \\"welfare trap\\". Maritimes Also in the same year, Shawn Graham, Premier of New Brunswick pledged to make the province self-sufficient, that is to no longer depend on federal equalization payments, by 2026. In 2007, because of amendments made to the equalization formula in terms of measuring property tax revenues, Prince Edward Island's proportion of the total amount increased considerably. In 2013‚Äì2014, Prince Edward Island had the highest per capita equalization payment at $2,326 per capita. Ontario Until the 2009‚Äì2010 fiscal year, Ontario was the only province to have never received equalization payments. In 2009-2010 Ontario began to receive equalization payments with its first payment amounting to $347-million.CBC News article The equalization formula is \\"based on a three- year average of economic growth\\". Since the 2008 recession, the Ontario economy got stronger which resulted in lower equalization payments. In 2012-2013 Ontario's equalization payments increased to a peak of $3.3-billion. It was projected to be $2-billion in 2014‚Äì2015. Late January 2012, based on access to the uncensored version of a 2006 censored federal report by Peter Gusen, then director of federal-provincial relations at the finance department, entitled 'An Operational Expenditure Need Equalization Formula for Canada', the Toronto Star alleged that Ontario and BC were shortchanged in the equalization system because wages and cost-of-living expenses were never taken into account by Ottawa. In 2014, Ontario would have qualified for the TTP payment for the first time, worth $640-million. In 2013 Stephen Harper ended the TTP program. According to a December 12, 2013 Globe and Mail article, cancelling the program was a political decision by the federal Conservatives. It would raise their \\"bottom line, while forcing Ontario's minority Liberal government to find the difference ahead of a budget that [had] the potential of triggering a provincial election.\\" In 2013‚Äì2014, Ontario's per capita payments were the lowest at $230.20. As of 2019-2020 Ontario stopped receiving equalization payments.

Synopsis Journey is the allegorical story of a young woman's struggle - outside the normal framework of space and time - to find herself. Found drifting down the Saguenay River, half-drowned and clinging to a log, a woman (Genevi√®ve Bujold) is rescued by Boulder (John Vernon), who carries her to Undersky, his commune in the Quebec wilderness. Named after the river from which she was saved, Saguenay is haunted by memories of her past and remains unresponsive for days, drifting in and out of consciousness. She gradually becomes aware of the life going on around her and begins to explore it. But she senses she has brought ill fortune to this community and fears something in her past has doomed her and all who know her. Finally, she journeys back up the river to confront the nightmare of her past. By doing so, she breaks through to the present and arrives at the mouth of the river. Reception This is Paul Almond's last film in his trilogy with Bujold that began with Isabel (1968) and The Act of the Heart (1970). Obscure and complex, the final film is considered the weakest of the trilogy, lacking the passion of the first two.

At the time, the case was the largest class-action suit ever filed. Affected veterans and families settled for $180 million in the form of a trust fund. Later life and death Throughout the late '80s and '90s, Shapiro began to focus more on mediation. In 1989, he was appointed by courts overseeing the bankruptcy of Eastern Airlines to mediate negotiations between the airline and its unions.Washington Post Article on Highbeam Research In 1996, Shapiro emigrated to London. He is credited in England as a leading mediator, and was said to have encouraged young lawyers to \\"press the Outrage Button.\\" When asked why he continued to practice law into his 80s, he would reportedly say: \\"Because I give a damn.\\" On October 1, 2009, Shapiro died of cardiac arrest in London. He had been making plans to return to his law firm in the US, Dickstein Shapiro.

In polyhedral combinatorics, a branch of mathematics, Balinski's theorem is a statement about the graph-theoretic structure of three-dimensional polyhedra and higher- dimensional polytopes. It states that, if one forms an undirected graph from the vertices and edges of a convex d-dimensional polyhedron or polytope (its skeleton), then the resulting graph is at least d-vertex-connected: the removal of any d ‚àí 1 vertices leaves a connected subgraph. For instance, for a three-dimensional polyhedron, even if two of its vertices (together with their incident edges) are removed, for any pair of vertices there will still exist a path of vertices and edges connecting the pair.. Balinski's theorem is named after mathematician Michel Balinski, who published its proof in 1961,. although the three-dimensional case dates back to the earlier part of the 20th century and the discovery of Steinitz's theorem that the graphs of three- dimensional polyhedra are exactly the three-connected planar graphs.. Balinski's proof Balinski proves the result based on the correctness of the simplex method for finding the minimum or maximum of a linear function on a convex polytope (the linear programming problem). The simplex method starts at an arbitrary vertex of the polytope and repeatedly moves towards an adjacent vertex that improves the function value; when no improvement can be made, the optimal function value has been reached. If S is a set of fewer than d vertices to be removed from the graph of the polytope, Balinski adds one more vertex v0 to S and finds a linear function ∆í that has the value zero on the augmented set but is not identically zero on the whole space. Then, any remaining vertex at which ∆í is non-negative (including v0) can be connected by simplex steps to the vertex with the maximum value of ∆í, while any remaining vertex at which ∆í is non-positive (again including v0) can be similarly connected to the vertex with the minimum value of ∆í. Therefore, the entire remaining graph is connected.

The refuge has a surface area of .USFWS Lands Report, 30 September 2007 Wildlife and habitat With its open coastal water and abundant prey, the refuge plays a significant role as migration and wintering habitat for the federally protected bald eagle. The bay area also provides prime migration habitat for the peregrine falcon. Many state- protected species use the refuge, including the common loon, pied-billed grebe, osprey, common tern, northern harrier and upland sandpiper. The bay area also serves as New Hampshire's major wintering area for black ducks. In spring, spring peepers announce the return of warmer weather as myriad shades of green begin to color the trees and shrubs. Flocks of migratory ducks, geese and songbirds drop into the protected waters, fields and forests of the refuge, making this an ideal time for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts to take to the trails. Summer features white-tailed deer, and their speckled fawns might be spied in the meadow along Ferry Way Trail. Turkey families strut boldly along the paths, and occasionally down the road. Birders can enjoy dazzling array of summer visitors such as the Baltimore oriole, goldfinch, ruby-throated hummingbird and yellow warbler. In the fall, various species of trees vie with one another to see which one can create the most stunning colors, a contest which the visitor always wins. The ponds and bay are alive with migratory waterfowl, delighting in a safe resting spot on the trip south for the winter. Beavers and porcupines prepare for the coming winter. River otters, red foxes, bobcats, and coyotes also inhabit this refuge. A stroll down either trail this time of year dazzles the senses. Bald eagles wintering on Great Bay can be seen soaring overhead and black ducks may be observed in patches of open water. Deer and turkey abound and are visible in the undergrowth.

The Droid had been publicized under the codenames Sholes and Tao and the model number A855. In Latin America and Europe, the model number is A853 (Milestone), and in Mexico, the model number is A854 (Motoroi). Due to the ambiguity with newer phones with similar names, it is also commonly known as the DROID 1. The brand name Droid is a trademark of Lucasfilm licensed to Verizon Wireless. Features of the phone include Wi-Fi networking, a 5-megapixel low light capable digital camera, a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack, interchangeable battery, 3.7-inch 854√ó480 touchscreen display. It also includes microSDHC support with bundled 16 GB card, free turn-by-turn navigation from Google Maps, sliding QWERTY keyboard, and Texas Instruments OMAP 3430 processor. The Motorola Droid runs Android version 2.2. The phone does not, however, run the re-branded Motoblur interface for Android, instead providing the Google Experience skin and application stack. With a major marketing push by Motorola and Verizon during and after its November 2009 release, the Droid became popular and had strong sales in the United States. It is credited for having popularized Android in the mass market. The Droid has a hearing aid compatibility (HAC) rating of M3/T3. The phone was the first to ship with free Google Maps Navigation (beta) installed.  Launch  United States Verizon explicitly promoted the Droid as an Apple iPhone alternative. Launched on October 17, 2009, TV spots and an associated website made \\"entertainingly combative\\" claims listing features then lacking on the iPhone, e.g. \\"iDon't multitask\\" and \\"'iDon't have a real keyboard\\", only mentioning the name of the Droid in the final frame, reading \\"Droid Does\\". At the official launch event on October 28, 2009, Verizon's Chief Marketing Officer John Stratton described the campaign as a spoof of Apple's iPhone ads, intended to \\"wake up the market.\\" The marketing for the American launch included \\"Droid Does Times Square.\\" This was a program (billed as an \\"interactive experience\\") in which Verizon connected the Nasdaq and Reuters electronic billboards in Times Square to its systems such that people were able to control the electronic displays by using voice commands (illustrating the voice search function that is a primary Android feature). Control of the billboards was available in Times Square or via the \\"Droid Does\\" website. The November 6, 2009, release date of the Droid came just under a month after Verizon and Google announced that they had entered into an agreement to jointly develop wireless devices based on the Android mobile platform. Verizon said at the time that it planned to have two Android-based handsets on the market by year-end with more to come in 2010. The other handset is the HTC Droid Eris, a modification to the HTC Hero, seen in shots of Google CEO Eric Schmidt holding one in a Verizon/Google press conference. American exclusive software for the Droid includes Google Maps Navigation, an Amazon MP3 Store applet, and Verizon Wireless Visual Voice Mail management. Analytics firm Flurry estimated that 250,000 Motorola Droid phones were sold in the United States during the phone's first week in stores. Flurry also estimated that 1.05 million Motorola Droids were sold in first 74 days of the launch. This number is greater than that of the original iPhone which sold one million units through day 74.  Software  This section applies to the Verizon- branded Motorola device in the US. Droid versions in foreign markets (Milestone) may be crippled or have some features disabled due to restrictions enforced by retailer agreements, carrier agreements, manufacturer agreements, or local laws and should be addressed in the appropriate section above. The Linux kernel used in the 2.0.1 OTA release is 2.6.29, Android build. Android 2.1 update On February 8, 2010, Motorola announced via Facebook that the Droid update would begin rolling out later that same week. Details were later released via Motorola's official forums. However, the details about the update were later retracted, and unclear information from Motorola and Verizon Wireless caused confusion among many, and technology news websites speculated the update would happen even later in 2010. As an attempt to clear confusion, Motorola released a chart of dates stating when each of their Android devices would be updated to Android 2.1, but this only added to the issues because they said the update would happen \\"soon\\", rather than offering a concrete time frame. However, on March 17, 2010, Verizon Wireless announced that they would issue the Android 2.1 \\"ESE53\\" update over-the-air, beginning March 18 to a small test group, and more users would see the update later, into the following week. But screenshots from Verizon Wireless documents showed that a last minute software bug was found, and the update was delayed once again, with no new roll out date determined. The new news from Verizon Wireless provided official information about the update and what it entailed, including \\"Pinch-to-zoom...available when using the browser, Gallery, and Google Maps\\", a weather and news app/widget including \\"information you want from the Web...weekly and hourly weather forecasts based on your location, and news headlines\\", voice-to-text wherever there are text boxes, \\"New Gallery application with 3D layout\\", and Live Wallpapers \\"offer[ing] richer animated, interactive backgrounds on the home screen\\", as well as other, more minor upgrades. However, the update did not include the addition of two more home screens currently available on the Nexus One, another Android 2.1 device. The 2.1 update rollout began on March 30, 2010. Android 2.2 update After some apparent discussion by Motorola over whether they would provide an Android 2.2 Froyo upgrade for the Droid and Milestone, it was confirmed that the Droid would get the upgrade, and a staggered rollout began. This rollout began on August 3, 2010, and updates the phone to Android 2.2 build number FRG01B. Another update for the Droid began on August 24, 2010, and it included some minor bug fixes. This update's build number is FRG22D. A third update was released on December 6, 2010, with a version number of 2.2.1 and a build of FRG83D. A fourth update was released on March 9, 2011, with a version number of 2.2.2 and a build of FRG83G. The Motorola support page reported the Milestone version would get an update to Android 2.2 in the first quarter of 2011, and on March 15 an update was made available. Root access and unsupported Android releases The Motorola Droid was successfully \\"rooted\\" (manipulated to provide superuser access) on December 8, 2009. This allowed removing sponsored or pay-to-use applets (Amazon, Verizon Visual Voice Mail, etc.), installing and launching custom software, and root access on the phone using a terminal emulator. On June 5, 2010, a leaked Android 2.2 ROM was given to the public for those with superuser access. It includes a new home launcher, Flash 10.1 support, new homescreen widgets, an updated Market, a JIT compiler for a faster system, as well as new aesthetic changes. As of July 13, 2011, the Droid is able to be updated to the Android 2.3.4 ROM, but with many small updates and edits to the base code in order to properly run. On July 26, 2011, an Android 2.3.5 ROM was made available for the DROID that, like the Android 2.3.4 ROM, has been modified to improve performance on the smart phone. Work is currently underway at xda-developers to bring Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich, to the Motorola Droid/Milestone, although CyanogenMod has stated it will drop support for the Droid/Milestone in ICS-based CyanogenMod 9.CM9 Progress Update As of July 17, 2012, the Droid is able to be updated to the Android 4.0.4 ROM. Similar to previous Gingerbread ROMs, this ROM has been tweaked to properly run. As of August 27, 2012, the Droid is able to be updated to the Android 4.1.1 Rom. This rom is currently being worked on and tweaked to properly run. Motorola Milestone The quad-band GSM/UMTS version of the Droid is the Motorola A853 (Milestone). While the phone's internal hardware (besides cellular) is the same, differences include out-of-the-box multi-touch support enabled, a trial version of Motorola's MOTONAV service (instead of Droid's US-only Google Maps Navigation) and an 8 GB microSDHC Card, instead of the Droid's 16 GB microSDHC card. Geographic launch information The launch countries for the Motorola Milestone included Germany, Italy and Argentina on November 9, 2009. Other European countries soon followed. Joining this trend, a new, North American, version of the Motorola Milestone was released in Canada in February 2010. This new version supports 3G bands II and V instead of bands I and VIII so it is compatible with Rogers, Bell, and Telus in Canada, and with AT&T; and T-Mobile (2G Only) in the US. At this time, Motorola Milestone is only available from Telus. The Milestone is also available in the U.S. from several regional GSM carriers, like Cincinnati Bell. United Kingdom The phone was launched in the United Kingdom on Thursday December 10, 2009, as the Motorola Milestone. The exclusive sales outlet for the phone, eXpansys, reported that all stocks of the phone had completely sold out within 3 hours of its debut. The sell-out was considered a major victory for Motorola, which has had little success with its prior Windows Mobile-based phones, and had been counting on Android-based phones for future growth. Middle East The phone was launched in the Middle East in 2010, however it included a serious limitation as Google prohibited access to its Android Market application for most of Middle Eastern countries. No reasonable alternative was provided by Google. Asia, India The Milestone was launched in Hong Kong on December 21, 2009, as the sixth Android device in the region for HKD 4,680 with an 8 GB microSDHC card included. This version is in English but supports Chinese hand writing that originated from the Motorola MING and pinyin input method. While MOTONAV is included, it does not work and is not officially supported. The phone can be updated to Android 2.1 since Q1 2010, the update features a Chinese user interface and more Chinese input methods such as Changjie. The Milestone launched in India on 30 March 2010, priced at 32,000 INR, approximately US$680. Locked bootloader Unlike the DROID, the Milestone has a bootloader that only allows signed firmware to load. This creates difficulties for users who wish to boot custom ROM images not signed by Motorola that have become popular in the Droid modding community. This has caused discontent in the Droid community in markets foreign to the US, with numerous petitions being created. Whether the disabling of custom boot loaders is due to retailer, carrier, manufacturer, or legal restrictions is unknown. Early in 2011 the community around Milestone ROM-Development and the Polish National BOINC Team initiated AndrOINC to decipher the RSA 1024-bit signature and make customizing possible. The project has been down since April 2011 because the German police confiscated the server on suspicion it was involved with an illegal P2P service. In June 2011, Motorola committed to delivering an unlockable and relockable bootloader solution for phones receiving updates later that year. This will likely not include the Milestone as Motorola has not indicated it will update the Milestone past Android 2.2/Froyo. Root access Despite the locked bootloader, the Motorola Milestone has been successfully rooted. Several step-by-step guides are available on the web. Software releases 2.0.1 update Two months after Motorola Droid received the update, the 2.0.1 update was released to fix a bug with the camera autofocus. 2.1 update The Motorola Milestone update rolled out in the beginning of May 2010, five months after the introduction of Android 2.1.http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.1.html After the update several problems were discovered, but since then firmware 2.1 update 1 has been released,https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=121867580498&topic;=18104 which fixes some of the issues. Although Motorola claimed, that they have fixed the random MP3 player start problems, they still occur. These problems affect only some users. 2.2 update The official Android 2.2 Froyo update was released on March 16, 2011, for UK users with a slow rollout to the rest of Europe. As of March 20, the update was still being rolled out was not available in all countries. Community created ROMs of Android 2.2 (Froyo), Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) have existed for some time, typically based on kernels from leaked updates. The continued postponing of Milestone updates has become known under the term \\"Motofail\\" in Central and South America. * See Android operating system for later software releases. Motorola Motoroi In July 2010, Motorola launched the phone for Mexico as the Motorola A854 (MOTOROI) and became exclusive to CDMA network carrier Iusacell.

As of 2006, the population is 99,196 in total with 52,644 male and 46,552 female residents. * Source: 2006 National Census1\\\\. http://www.population.gov.ng/ Natural Resources Natural resources found within Ini include limestone, clay, gravel, fine sand, crude oil, gold and iron ore. The forest region provides timber and firewood. Commerce Ini is known as the food basket of Akwa Ibom State. Due to Ini's land expansive area, the citizens are predominantly farmers. Ini produces food items such as rice, palm produce, cassava, cocoa, plantains, and bananas. There is potential for agricultural expansion and increased hunting. Traditional Administration of Ini Local Government Area The Ini Local Government is made up of Ikpe Clan, Ikono Clan, Iwerre Clan, Itu Mbon Uso Clan and Nkari Clan. Nkari, Itu Mbonu Uso and Iwerre Clan have ten gazetted and recognized villages each, while Ikpe Clan and Ikono Clan have 52 and 43 villages gazetted and officially recognized villages each. (Source: List of Recognized Villages and Clan, Akwa Ibom State Official Gazette, 2006). The local government area of Ini consists of ekpuks (lineages/macro-families) which make up autonomous, recognized and gazetted villages/communities. The communities/villages are grouped into one of the five clans of Ikono, Ikpe, Iwerri, Itu Mbon Uso and Nkari. The clans made up the local government. The Akwa Ibom State Traditional Rulers law, cap 134 laws of Akwa Ibom State and the gazettes published pursuant thereto clearly list all the recognized villages/communities and the grouped clans. The system of traditional administration in Ini Local Government Area is the same as other Local Government Areas in Akwa Ibom State that also follow the ancient Ibibio Political System, where the highest political system was the Community (Obio/Idung) which had an autonomous Obong Idung or Obong Obio or Obong Ikpaisong. Several communities with close blood affinity usually formed a confederation and cooperation for the purposes of cultural and mutual cooperation in defense, commerce, and cultural championship. These inter- communal union of communities with blood relation is today recognized as a clan. The clans today have official clan heads who are selected by the recognized traditional rulers of the communities/villages from among themselves. The traditional rulers' law restricts the authority of every traditional ruler to his gazetted village/community and forbids interference of any traditional ruler in the administration of any other autonomous or gazetted village/community. The paramount ruler is the president of the Council of Traditional Rulers in the local government. He is selected by the Clan Heads from amongst themselves. Thus, a Traditional Ruler is firstly the King or Ruler of his recognized village/community, before he can vie to be elected to the office of the clan head and further vie to be elected as paramount ruler. Thus if a paramount ruler loses his throne as a traditional ruler of his Community/villages, he automatically ceases to be a clan head and thus ceases to be a paramount ruler. Royalty in Ini Local Government Area resides in the ancient royal thrones which are in each of the autonomous and gazetted villages/communities. When a paramount ruler joins his ancestors, another clan head is elected to occupy the office of the Paramount Ruler from among the existing recognized clan heads after the burial of the deceased paramount ruler. The paramount ruler is, therefore, the first amongst equals in the royal thrones of Ini Local Government Area. The current Paramount Ruler of Ini Local Government Area is His Royal Majesty, Edidem Apostle Nteong Udo Effiong Akpan (Who is also the Clan Head of Itu Mbon Uso). The list of recognized Traditional Rulers of all the Communities/Villages and the Clans Heads are contained in the register kept at the State Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs.

The diversity of exceptional habitats provides excellent breeding and foraging areas for migratory birds, endangered species, resident wildlife, and rare plants. The refuge protects over of wetland and forested upland habitat along Umbagog Lake. About 70% of its area is in New Hampshire and 30% in Maine. Habitat and wildlife Umbagog Lake has extensive wetland complexes that are excellent for waterfowl production. One example is Harper's Meadow. In 1972, the Secretary of the Interior designated part of the wetlands at Harper's Meadow as a Floating Island National Natural Landmark. This designation recognized the floating bog and wetlands as a significant natural area, one of a very special group of places illustrating the diversity of the country‚Äôs natural history. Umbagog Lake is more than in length and covers more than , making it the largest lake along the New Hampshire/Maine border. It has an average depth of only . The Umbagog area, unique in its habitats, provides home to many different species. Situated at the southern range of the boreal forests and the northern range of the deciduous forests, the Umbagog area is a transition zone providing homes to species of both habitat types. A total of 229 bird species have been observed on the refuge, and 137 species are known to breed there. There are many species of songbirds, including 24 varieties of warblers. The abundance of fish in the lakes and rivers provide food for the local populations of osprey and bald eagles. Mink, river otter, muskrat, and beaver can be seen in the lakes and rivers, while raccoons, black bears, coyotes, fishers, red foxes, marten, bobcats, gray foxes, white-tailed deer and a dense population of moose inhabit the uplands. The extensive wetlands and marshes provide ideal habitat for waterfowl, such as common mergansers, American black ducks, common goldeneye and common loons. The area provides habitat for raptor species such as the bald eagle. In 1989, bald eagles successfully nested in New Hampshire on Umbagog Lake for the first time since 1949. Migratory non-game birds like the northern harrier, American bittern and great blue heron depend on habitat around Umbagog Lake. Abundant fish populations and wetland habitat support one of the highest concentrations of nesting osprey in New Hampshire. The areas forested wetlands support good numbers of black ducks, ring-necked ducks, and goldeneye. Wood ducks, mallards, hooded and common mergansers also nest in the area. The lake provides habitat for migrating scaup, three varieties of scoters and Canada geese.

He was educated at the Hotchkiss School and at Yale University, and spent some time on graduate work at the University of Chicago. Godley joined the United States Foreign Service in 1941. He was posted in France, Switzerland, Belgium, Cambodia and the Republic of the Congo (L√©opoldville). In 1946, he married Livia Paravicini, who had served as a sergeant major in the Swiss Army Ambulance Corps during World War II.Healey, Barth. \\"McMurtrie Godley, 82, Envoy To Laos During Vietnam War\\", The New York Times, November 10, 1999. Accessed October 18, 2009 The couple divorced in 1963. On February 20, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Godley United States Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ambassador Godley presented his credentials to the Congolese government on March 23, 1964. During his time as ambassador, Mobutu Sese Seko staged a second coup and seized control of the country. Godley left this post on October 15, 1966. Godley married his second wife, Elizabeth McCray Johnson, in 1969. Together, they had two sons, George and Nicholas. In 1969, President Nixon appointed Godley Ambassador to the Kingdom of Laos, with Ambassador Godley presenting his credentials on July 24. Ambassador Godley arrived in the midst of the Laotian Civil War and effectuated the American policy of supporting the Royal Lao Government against the Communist Pathet Lao. Although Laos was officially neutral in the ongoing Vietnam War, the Central Intelligence Agency was secretly active in Laos, organizing and financing Laotian and Thai guerillas who were fighting the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese. Godley left his position as Ambassador to Laos on April 23, 1973. Upon his return to the U.S., President Nixon nominated Godley as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. J. William Fulbright, the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, opposed this nomination, arguing that Godley was too closely identified with failed American policy in Southeast Asia to supervise U.S. diplomatic efforts in Asia. Following the failure of this nomination, on February 13, 1974, President Nixon nominated Godley as United States Ambassador to Lebanon. Ambassador Godley presented his credentials on March 15, 1974, and served as Ambassador to Lebanon until January 13, 1976. Upon his return from Lebanon, Godley retired from the Foreign Service and settled in Morris, New York. At this time, Godley learned that he had throat cancer and his larynx was removed as a result. In spite of his battle with throat cancer, Godley enjoyed an active retirement. He participated in founding the Glimmerglass Opera near Cooperstown, New York, serving as its first president, and later as chairman emeritus until the time of his death. He also served as chairman of Hartwick College and of Oneonta's Fox Hospital. In August 1992, Godley's activities as Ambassador to Laos were examined by the United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. Some reports suggested that during the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Indochina in the wake of the Fall of Saigon, as many as 135 American prisoners of war may have been left behind. Before the committee, Godley testified that he had done his best to account for all American P.O.W.s in Indochina, and that he believed that no P.O.W.s remained when he left Indochina in 1973. Godley died at age 82 of heart failure on November 7, 1999, at Fox Hospital in Oneonta, New York.

A component of the Delaware River estuary in Salem County, New Jersey, it is just north of the Salem River and south of Pennsville. The Delaware Bay and estuary are wetlands of international importance and an international shorebird reserve. The refuge currently owns approximately within the approved boundary. The brackish water tidal marshes and coastal forests that make up nearly 80 percent of the refuge provide waterfowl with a feeding and resting area, particularly during the fall and spring migrations. American black ducks, mallards and northern pintails are common winter visitors. Sandpipers and other shorebirds use the refuge marshes as a feeding area during the summer as well as during the spring and fall migrations. The rookery at nearby Pea Patch Island hosts over 6,000 pairs of nine species, making it the largest rookery of colonial wading birds on the east coast north of Florida. The refuge marshes provide valuable foraging habitat for these colonial wading birds during the nesting season. Warblers, sparrows and other migratory birds use the upland areas of the refuge as resting and feeding areas during migration and for nesting during the summer. Thousands of tree swallows forage on the refuge in the late summer. Ospreys, bald eagle, northern harrier, short-eared owl and barn owl nest on the refuge.

Personal life Jack Melloy was born in Brisbane, the youngest of six children of Charles Frederick Melloy and Ada Louise Crampton.Queensland Registrar-General: Index of Births, Deaths and Marriages Unlike his older siblings, Jack (formally John) had no middle name, which irritated him, so he sometimes called himself John Joseph Patrick Melloy. He married Elizabeth Maude Garner on 24 June 1933. They had seven children: John, Elaine, Lynette, Carol, Noela, Geoffrey, and Christine.\\"Obituary: Labor man devoted 80 years to party\\", Brisbane Courier-Mail, Monday 9 January 2006 Jack Melloy died at Redcliffe in 2006, aged 97. His wife Maude had died in 1995. The couple were survived by their 7 children, 50 grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren. Business life Jack Melloy was a dental technician. He was President and secretary of the Dental Technicians Association of Queensland. He served as the union representative on various dental committees. During World War II, he was a Staff Sergeant for the Australian Army Dental Corps from 1942 to 1946. From 1951 to 1952 he was organiser and industrial advocate for the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union. Politics Jack Melloy joined the Labor Party in 1922 at the age of 14. His interest in socialist politics was influenced by his trade unionist cousin Walter Russell Crampton. Jack Melloy first ran for public office in 1949 as a Labor candidate for Buranda in Brisbane City Council elections but was unsuccessful. He stood for the federal electorate of Lilley in 1955 and 1958 but was unsuccessful both times. In 1960 he was the Labor candidate in the Queensland electorate of Nudgee (defeating Frank Sleeman, who was later Brisbane's Lord Mayor) and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. He remained as Member for Nudgee until his retirement in 1977. He was Shadow Minister for Health from 1967 to 1972, where his background as a dental technician made him passionate about the state's lack of dental services and the poor health system generally. In 1974 Melloy was elected deputy leader of the State Labor Party, defeating Keith Wright and Jack Houston. He remained deputy leader until 1976.The Melloy family - a Labor tradition , Queensland Labor Times, accessed 18 Oct 2009. He championed the safari suit (a short-sleeved jacket worn without a shirt designed for wear in warm climates) by wearing one in Parliament but was told to leave and derided as a hippy. He retired in 1977, but continued his political activities through assisting his politically active family in their campaigns. In 1980 his daughter Elaine Darling won the seat of Lilley (the one he had unsuccessfully contested twice in the 1950s). His granddaughter Vicky Darling won the state seat of Sandgate in 2006. Other family members served in executive positions of branches of the Labor Party. In 1989 his daughter Noela Pemberton was the Labor candidate in the State electorate of Aspley being defeated by about 400 votes, after outpolling a sitting National Party State Government Minister and a Liberal Party Local Government Councillor on the primary vote. The Local Government councillor won the seat after the distribution of preferences. In 2000 his daughters Elaine Darling and Lyn Kally became local government Councillors in Queensland - Elaine in Caloundra, and Lyn in Esk Shire. Jack Melloy was awarded life membership of the Australian Labor Party in 1984. At age 95, he was still handing out how-to-vote cards on election day, loyal to his party.

Scatterheart guitarist Doug Fury regaled Michaels with stories of the group's festival experience in Busan, Korea: the initial ecstatic reaction of the crowd of 25,000 as the group came out on the stage led Doug to comment to Mike, Jesse, and Wes that ‚ÄúDudes, this is going to go off!‚Äù and, later, to note that a crowd of that size felt ‚Äújust about right!‚Äù During the interview, Rob also reminded his listening audience about the upcoming First Night 2010 show in the outdoor stadium at Whistler Olympic Park, at which Scatterheart was a featured group. Scatterheart 2.0 Following the departure of Enright from Scatterheart in November, 2010, the remaining three members of Scatterheart contemplated a future without feathers. Quitting was not an option, and the band continued to rehearse and write collaboratively. Over the next year, they wrote and album's worth of songs that featured Doug and Mike sharing lead vocal duty. In Coquitlam on Canada Day, July 1, 2012, Scatterheart 2.0 made their debut as a power trio. Doug and Mike are music producers with their own recording studios, and both are photographers and videographers as well. Mike has scripted and produced over 30 music videos for clients in a number of genres, while Wes is a computer programmer with extensive knowledge of the Web. This unique blend of strengths has allowed Scatterheart to produce a series of interactive music videos. Scatterheart 2.0 Music Videos Scatterheart 2.0's first video, titled Better Than Before takes the form of a bizarre obstacle race between band members, and is programmed to allow viewers to choose their own winner and produce that outcome as a video. The second video, Awesome Machine features a Rubric's-Cube-like split screen throughout, making it possible for the viewer to create an amalgam of Wes's, Doug's, and Mike's faces, as a series of nine avatars that the band collectively dubs 'Mr. Ugly'. The video for I Get The Feeling We've Hit The Ceiling is another first in the world of music video, filmed underwater on a submerged stage, a problematic shoot made even more difficult by the fact that drums and guitars float. Using compressed or surface air, Mike sings entire verses without taking a breath. MuchMusic's VideoFACT and MuchMore's PromoFACT provided funding for the development of two of these videos. Scatterheart 2.0 Personnel Doug Fury: guitar and vocals. Doug is a recording engineer and producer in Vancouver (Fortissimo Sound ), and has toured as Bif Naked's guitarist for over 10 years.

This album begs to be cranked up LOUD.‚ÄùB C. Musician Magazine, April 2009. The earlier album caught the attention of AntiMusic's Morley Seaver, who ranted: ‚ÄúThe record is a livewire, full of enthusiasm and power‚Äù and further, that Scatterheart is a band capable of ‚Äú. . . punching holes in the speakers with their energetic rock.‚Äù Seaver concludes: ‚ÄúIf this is just the beginning of Scatterheart, it's inevitable that you'll be hearing about them for a long time. They have the chops, the songs and the delivery to engage your ears. And I know their live show will be up to the task as well, having seen Mr. Fury many times. Scatter your heart to the winds over this record, people‚Ä¶.Doug Fury and company will piece it back together for you.‚ÄùAntimusic, Morley Seaver, 2007. Ferdy Belland called the album a \\". . .crazy-like-a-fox melding of Jane's Addiction alternative-psychedelia inside stunning three-minute pop nuggets.\\"Nerve Magazine, Vancouver 2008 The production on the album was almost too good for Georgia Straight reviewer John Lucas, who noted: ‚Äú Someone in the Scatterheart camp evidently has money burning a hole in his pocket. . . it‚Äôs obvious that someone spent a pretty penny on the recording too. The sound is slick and professional, with the songs falling somewhere between modern rock and ‚Äô80s pop. . .‚ÄùJohn Lucas, Georgia Straight, May 21, 2009. Possibly, Lucas did not realize that two members of Scatterheart are producers/sound engineers, and therefore have access to high quality sound recording technology. Further consideration of the album led Adrian Mack of Georgia Straight to state: ‚ÄúFirst single ‚ÄúBeautiful‚Äù is both glamtastic and generally wonderful enough to give Nick Gilder a good case of the vapours, ‚ÄúMore Than a Man‚Äù cheekily pushes Bowie‚Äôs ‚ÄúFame‚Äù (David Bowie) in new and harder directions, and ‚ÄúSons and Daughters of the Drum‚Äù takes 5,000-fingered Rick Wakeman keyboard ostentation and plunks it in the middle of a song you can actually hum along with (something Wakeman never quite figured out). .. Scatterheart loves you? The feeling appears to be mutual.‚ÄùAdrian Mack, Georgia Straight, December 3, 2009 As well, Spun Magazine rated Master Plan as one of the Top Ten albums of the year.Spun Magazine Top 10 albums of the year Dec. 20, 2009 Music Videos Scatterheart 1.0 The 2009 video for the song Beautiful featured an innovative script written and directed by the group members themselves. Billed as 'One Camera, One Shot, No Special Effects' this video was an antidote to the expensive and over-produced music videos that have become an expectation of the industry. Singer Enright performed in his characteristic wings, while feathers, balloons, hearts, bubbles, and other paraphernalia floated upwards as if by magic. Occasionally, the other band members appeared, apparently playing their instruments while upside down. The companion video Making Us Beautiful reveals the secret: Jesse was hanging upside down, suspended from a scaffold while wearing a climbing harness under his feathers. With the camera also positioned upside down, friends tossing various flying objects from the scaffold, and the rest of the band sneaking into the shot with instruments in hand, the effect was complete. The 2009 video for the song \\"More Than A Man\\", which featured typical Scatterheart antics with the stunning Vancouver skyline as a backdrop, was in rotation in 2009 at MuchMusic . A third video, based on the song \\"The Free\\" featured concert footage from the 10th Annual International Rock Festival in Busan, South Korea. \\\\---- Photo credits 1) Martin Prihoda 2) Busan International Rock Festival 3) Sara Sturrock References Category:Canadian alternative rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 2007 Category:Musical groups from Vancouver Category:Canadian pop rock music groups Category:2007 establishments in British Columbia ","title":"Scatterheart"},{"id":"24732502","title":"State Guard Association of the United States"},{"id":"24732505","text":"Behzad Khodadad Kanjobeh (, born April 25, 1981 in Tehran, Iran) is an Iranian Taekwondo athlete.

Biography Nikolay Vasilyevich Nikolsky was born in a village of Yurmekeykino, Yadrinsk uyezd (today Morgaushsky District of Chuvash Republic) in the family of surveyor. After finishing the local Shumatov zemstvo College he enrolled in the Theological College in Cheboksary. After that he studied also in the Theological Seminary in Kazan which Nikolsky finished in 1899 and then continuing to study at the Theological Academy of Kazan. Upon graduation of the academy he obtained the title of magistrate and his dissertation by the academy council was recognized as the best to reflect the history of Russian church. By the referral of the Kazan Academy the ober-procuror of Holy Synod appointed Nikolsky as the instructor at the Theological Seminary in Irkutsk. He rejected the appointment as he had intentions to study history of Chuvash culture. Therefore he stayed in Kazan where he found much less paid job as the observer over the students at the local seminary until November 1906. Simultaneously he worked as an instructor of the Chuvash language and the history and ethnography of Chuvash people in the Kazan Academy until 1917. In the 1900s he published numerous of his research of the Chuvash folklore, culture, as well as the Russian-Chuvash dictionary. In January 1906 he started to publish the Chuvash newspaper Hypar (News -engl.). In November 1906 he became a history instructor at the Kazan Teaching Seminary along with the duty of a local librarian. From all those positions he was relieved in 1910 when there were some revolutionary activities going in Kazan. In 1907 Nikolsky was accepted as the teacher of Chuvash language in the Kazan Theological Seminary where he worked until 1916. In 1915 he was accepted as private docent at the Kazan University and was allowed to read lectures as part of the \\"History course of Christian Enlightenment\\". In 1920 Nikolsky published a book on the \\"History of Mari\\". Later in 1929 he published series of other historical books on the Chuvash, Mordva, and Mari cultures. By the end of the 1950s he was specializing in the local folklore publishing series of ethnic fairy-tales and mythological stories based on the local culture. In 1947 by the order of the Ministry of the Higher Education of the Soviet Union he was awarded the science degree of doctor of history. Nikolsky died on November 2, 1961 in Kazan.

Plot The film starts with Adam telling the story of his two-planet home world, unique among planets or planetary systems as it is the only one that has \\"dual gravity\\". This phenomenon of dual gravity allows the two planets to orbit each other in what would otherwise be impossibly close proximity. There are three immutable laws of gravity for this two-planet system: # All matter is pulled by the gravity of the world that it comes from, and not the other. # An object's weight can be offset using matter from the opposite world (inverse matter). # After a few hours of contact, matter in contact with inverse matter burns. The societies of the two worlds are segregated by law. While the upper world (Up Top) is rich and prosperous, the lower (Down Below) is poor. Up Top buys cheap oil from Down Below and sells electricity back to Down Below at higher prices. A person from Down Below going Up Top (or having contact with anyone from Up Top) is strictly forbidden and can be punishable by incarceration or death. People from Up Top regularly visit Down Below to experience novelties like dancing on ceilings. The only physical connection linking the two worlds is the headquarters of the \\"TransWorld\\" company. Adam lives in an orphanage in Down, having lost his parents in an oil refinery explosion. The only living relative he has is his great-aunt, whom he visits every week. His great-aunt has a secret recipe for flying pancakes using pollen from pink bees which gather pollen from both worlds. The recipe has passed through generations and will be inherited by Adam. As a child, Adam secretly climbs a mountain that gets very close to Up. There he meets Eden, a girl from Up. Years later in their teens, they are in a relationship. They meet on the mountains and Adam uses a rope to pull Eden towards Down, and they head to the woods for a stroll. They are later discovered, and while Adam frantically releases Eden back to her world, he catches a bullet in his arm and drops her. Helpless, he watches Eden lying motionless on the ground as blood oozes from her head. When he returns home, his aunt Becky is arrested and her home is put to the torch. Ten years later, Adam is now working on creating an anti-gravity product using his great-aunt's recipe. The recipe allows matter to feel both gravitational fields at once. Adam is developing it as a cosmetic product for face-lifts. Then he sees Eden on TV and learns she is alive and works at TransWorld. He finally works out his formula and gets hired by TransWorld to develop the face-lift cream. Adam's plan is to find Eden in TransWorld. In his office he meets Bob, a TransWorld employee from Up who becomes his friend after he helps him obtain rare stamps from Down. Bob offers to help him contact Eden. With the help of Bob, Adam meets Eden by putting Up-material in his clothes to disguise himself as a worker from Up, using Bob's name as his own. But Eden doesn't recognize him because of amnesia from the accident as a teen. The Up-material in Adam's clothes starts to burn so he has to return to Down. Later on, Bob is fired but as he leaves, he secretly gives Adam his ID to help him exit the TransWorld building and into Up. Later, by calling Eden through Bob's phone, Adam manages to get a date. Meanwhile, his cosmetic cream becomes of great importance to the company. While Adam is doing a presentation of the cream, Eden enters the lecture hall and discovers his true identity. After she flees the auditorium Adam runs to find her but Bob's ID, having been terminated, lands him in trouble. He escapes to Bob's house. He shows him that mixing liquids from both gravity fields can make a hybrid solution that resists both gravitational fields and simply floats between the two. Adam then reveals that he didn't give TransWorld the main secret ingredient of his compound, leaving the company unable to manufacture the product without him. With Bob's help, he goes back to the restaurant where he met with Eden before and finds out she has begun to recover old memories of him. But the police arrive and he has to run. Upon returning to his planet he goes to the mountain top where he met Eden. Eden comes to find him and they meet again as they did long ago. But police are on their trail and, as they fail to escape, Eden is arrested while Adam falls the remaining distance between worlds. But he survives because of a vest containing inverse matter which he still had strapped to his torso. TransWorld agrees to drop the charges against Eden if Adam gives them his formula and never contacts Eden again. Now Adam has gone back to his old life, believing he will never see Eden again. But Eden, not so easily dissuaded, goes to Bob for help. Bob finds Adam and surprises him by showing he can stay Down without the help of the opposite-matter accoutrements; Bob has been able to use Adam's methods to create a way to negate the effect of gravity. Bob tells him he had purchased the patent of his beauty cream before TransWorld attempted to do so. He finishes by informing him that Adam also has a \\"date\\" with someone. The film ends with Eden revealing she has become pregnant with twins, and the camera zooms far out to reveal towering skyscrapers on both sides, showing that both sides have become prosperous, as well as children from both sides interacting by playing basketball. Cast * Jim Sturgess as Adam Kirk * Kirsten Dunst as Eden Moore * Timothy Spall as Bob Boruchowitz * Jayne Heitmeyer as Head Executive * Blu Mankuma as Albert Release The film was released on 23 August 2012 in Russia, then on 15 March 2013 in the US, in a limited capacity (11 theaters initially). It was released in France on 27 March 2013 (Mauvais Genre Film Festival) and, more generally, on 1 May 2013 through the local branch of Warner Bros., while the distribution rights were bought by Millennium Entertainment for North America and by Icon for the United Kingdom. The film became available on Blu-ray and DVD on 25 June 2013. Production The French production company Studio 37 initially searched for an American co-producer, and received positive response from Hollywood representatives who read the screenplay. However, because of cultural differences, they decided to look for European partners instead, as they thought it would be essential for the project to be driven primarily by its director. The film was eventually produced by Studio 37, Onyx Films and the Montreal-based company Transfilm, for a budget of $50 million. Variety reported from the Cannes Film Market in 2009 that Kirsten Dunst and Emile Hirsch were in talks to play the film's two leading roles. A few months later the same magazine reported that Jim Sturgess had been cast instead of Hirsch. Principal photography started in Hancock, Michigan in February 2010. Filming and post-production were located in the U.S. because of the country's low taxes for film productions. Producer Dimitri Rassam said: \\"We couldn't have made Upside Down without the French funding system but there was no way we could have shot [in France] because the tax rebate is not attractive enough.\\" Reception Upside Down received mostly negative reviews from mainstream critics. Most praised the visual style, world-building and originality, but criticized the generic love story, plot holes and convoluted plot, with a score of 27% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"In spite of its wonderfully unusual premise and talented cast, Upside Down fails to offer much in the way of compelling drama to anchor its admittedly dazzling visuals.\\" Mick LaSalle was one of several reviewers who admired the film's \\"brilliant\\" and \\"imaginative basis\\" while feeling ultimately disappointed, saying its \\"rich and bizarre premise is supported by fully realized visuals that make the fantastic real... it's all very enjoyable.\\" However, he wrote, \\"The only problem is that, after creating the most wonderful fantastic frame, Upside Down doesn't devise a picture worthy of it. The story is serviceable. It starts small, and it stays small, even though the circumstances surrounding the story seem to cry out for something bigger.\\" Wired called the film \\"an odd and ultimately flawed mix\\": \\"If only the story were as original, or as strong, as the film's topsy-turvy look. Unfortunately, Upside Down...invests almost all of its cinematic capital in gravity-defying eye candy.\\" The Star-Ledger also had a mixed reaction, with its reviewer praising the \\"wonderful visual shock\\" and its \\"marvelous sense of space and style\\" and writing, \\"Solanas' idea is a pretty audacious one, visually. A political one too, as it turns out that for generations the upper world (think Northern Hemisphere) has been getting fat exploiting the resources of the lower one (think Southern Hemisphere),\\" but concluding that the film \\"doesn't really develop its story, or its themes.\\" Frank Scheck found the film confusing, saying, \\"You practically need an advanced degree in physics to fully comprehend the convoluted physical machinations depicted in Upside Down, Juan Solanas' dizzyingly loopy sci-fi romance. Depicting the Romeo and Juliet-style romance between lovers from twin planets with opposite gravitational pulls, this head-scratcher boasts visual imagination to spare even as its logistical complexities and heavy-handed symbolism ultimately prove off-putting.\\" See also *Cosmicomics *Head over Heels (2012 film) *Patema Inverted References External links   * First look @ SlashFilm * Upside Down: could it turn cinema in 2012 on its head? @ The Guardian Category:2012 films Category:2010s romantic fantasy films Category:Dystopian films Category:French films Category:French romantic fantasy films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian romantic fantasy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Juan Diego Solanas Category:Films shot in Montreal ","title":"Upside Down (2012 film)"},{"id":"24732533","text":"With the Rocky Mountains to the west, the Great Plains to the east, and the Chihuahuan Desert to the south, Las Vegas National Wildlife Refuge encompasses a diversity of habitats.

Preparation Potatoes are grated, drained, squeezed, and mixed with the potato starch settled at the bottom of drained water in a bowl. The potato dough is balled into ongsimi, and boiled in anchovy-dasima broth with vegetables such as aehobak (Korean zucchini), shiitake mushrooms, shepherd's purse, and red chili peppers.

The typical First Premier Bank MasterCard user uses the card for about 18 months before moving to another card with better terms; Sanford described the company as offering a \\"lifeline\\" for those with poor credit. In 2007, the bank settled a case with the New York Attorney General who claimed the bank used deceptive practices to market its credit cards. The bank paid $4.5 million as part of the deal. As of December 2010, Premier Bank was reportedly offering a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate and a $300 limit. This was cited by Senator Bernie Sanders as an example of what he called \\"extortion and loan sharking\\".http://www.c-span.org/Watch/Media/2010/12/10/HP/A/41780/Sen+Sanders+Held+a+Tax+Cut+Filibuster.aspx Senator Bernie Sanders Speech 3:01:10 In 2014 it was announced that First Premier Bank sued cardhub.com for allowing customers to view rates and terms and also letting users review the card. First Premier Bank's CEO, Dana J. Dykhouse, was referenced in a 2014 piece in the Argus Leader as belonging to a group of would-be local benefactors who the author wrote, \\"should quit gouging poor people who can't make it from paycheck to paycheck, or don't qualify for regular credit cards. ... Loan sharks who charge an obscene profit just because they can don't make good community leaders.\\" Reception In April 2018, John Kiernan of WalletHub, a personal finance website, ranked the First Premier Bank MasterCard poorly (1 stars out of 5). He wrote that the card had excessive fees, low credit limit and a high annual percentage rate that made it a bad choice for most users.

The average precipitation on the refuge is annually, although it is highly variable ranging from about 7 to 25 inches per year. Multi-year droughts are frequent. Most precipitation comes in the summer. At least 10 springs and spring complexes on the refuge provide water for wildlife and create riparian zones with cottonwood, willow, and ash trees.

New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. October 2005. Desert bighorn sheep and oryx Ash Canyon and its springs create a lush corridor of vegetation amidst the desert of the San Andres mountains. The San Andres National Wildlife Refuge was created to preserve the desert bighorn sheep which was becoming rare in much of its range. At the time of the creation of the refuge, in 1941, the population of desert bighorn sheep was 33. With protection, this number increased to 140 in 1950 before declining to 70 after a severe drought. Grazing on the refuge was ended in 1952 and the numbers of the herd increased to about 200 in the 1970s. Disease then struck the herd and only one lone female remained alive in 1997. Beginning in 1999, desert bighorns were re-introduced into San Andres from other areas and their numbers slowly increased to about 100 in 2012. San Andres NWR is the largest area of protected land for desert bighorns in New Mexico.San Andres National Wildlife Refuge. Brochure. United States Fish and Wildlife Service. 2009. The oryx, a large desert antelope from Africa and the Arabian peninsula, was introduced into White Sands Missile Range in 1969. Their numbers quickly grew to about 4,000 and their range expanded into San Andres National Wildlife Refuge. By 1997, at least 50 oryx inhabited the refuge. Oryx successfully competed for scarce resources with bighorn sheep and mule deer because they need little or no water to survive, getting their moisture from the plants they eat. Except for calves, the oryx is too large to be preyed on by mountain lions and other carnivores. To reduce the number of oryx on the San Andres NWR and White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico state with the cooperation of the Fish and Wildlife Service issues permits to hunt oryx.

Plot Brutish prison escapee Moose Malloy (Ward Bond) forces \\"Goldie\\" Locke (Allen Jenkins) to drive him to Club 13, a posh nightclub, where Moose hopes to be reunited with his old girlfriend Velma. After bashing his way into the club and not finding Velma, he kills the club manager and forces Goldie to drive him away from the club. When Gay Lawrence (George Sanders), an amateur sleuth and Goldie's boss, arrives at the club, he learns that Moose is the suspect, because the manager died of a broken neck. Police Inspector Mike O'Hara (James Gleason) arrests Goldie as an accomplice, but after being questioned, Goldie is released. Lawrence and Goldie head out to the house in Brooklyn where Moose is hiding. Pretending to be drunk, Lawrence enters the house while Moose makes a getaway in Goldie's car. In the house, Jessie Florian (Anne Revere) is on the telephone, shouting hysterically and demanding protection from Moose. Jessie is told to send Moose to a certain address. Jessie tells Lawrence that Velma is dead. Seeing the address, he knows where Moose will be. When Lawrence returns to his apartment, a call from Quincy W. Marriot (Hans Conried) to deliver ransom money for a stolen jade necklace, sends Lawrence to a deserted graveyard. Marriot ambushes him, grabbing the detective's gun and shoots him, but, in turn, is shot by an unseen assailant who makes his escape. Seeing Lawrence is still alive, Reporter Ann Reardon (Lynn Bari), who has been trailing him, helps the detective to his feet, learning his gun was loaded with blanks. Lawrence searches Marriott's coat pockets and finds a business card from psychic Jules Amthor (Turhan Bey), at 415 Morton Avenue, the address where Moose is going. Lawrence asks Ann to track down the stolen necklace that belongs to socialite Diana Kenyon (Helen Gilbert). He makes a date to meet Diana at the Swan Club later that night, while Goldie heads to see Amthor. When he enters the house, Goldie sees Moose arrive, but the lights go out and gunfire erupts. When the lights are back on, O'Hara enters and discovers Amthor's dead body. Lawrence and Goldie return to Jessies's house, to find her dead, with a broken neck. Working on clues left at Jessie's house, Lawrence is convinced something is wrong with the theory that Moose is a murderer. Returning to his apartment, he meets Ann, who, after spending the day at police headquarters, learns the police think that Moose pleaded guilty to the manslaughter to protect Laird Burnett (Selmar Jackson), the owner of the Swan Club. Diana goes on a drive with Lawrence who has already guessed her true identity, as Velma. When she tries to kill Lawrence, Moose, who had been driving, turns on her, but is shot and killed. Ann arrives in a backfiring car that gives Lawrence a chance to disarm Velma. Ann gets her first big scoop, uncovering a sordid blackmail scheme that involved Velma, Burnett and Marriott. Just when Lawrence is about to leave the squad room to meet his fianc√©e, a glamorous woman asks for his help and he comes to her aid.

The noted sociologist Robert Bellah has referred to A Secular Age as \\"one of the most important books to be written in my lifetime.\\"The Immanent Frame ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Secularism of a new kind Background and overview In recent years, secularity has become an important topic in the humanities and social sciences. Although there continue to be important disagreements among scholars, many begin with the premise that secularism is not simply the absence of religion, but rather an intellectual and political category that itself needs to be understood as a historical construction. In this book, Taylor looks at the change in Western society from a condition in which it is almost impossible not to believe in God, to one in which believing in God is simply one option of many. He argues against the view that secularity in society is caused by the rise of science and reason. He argues that this view is far too simplistic and does not explain why people would abandon their faith. Taylor starts with a description of the Middle Ages and presents the changes to bring about the modern secular age. The Middle Ages were a time of enchantment. People believed in God, angels, demons, witches, the Church's sacraments, relics, and sacred places. Each of these types of things had mysterious, real effects on individuals and society. The early Middle Ages were content to have two speeds for people's spiritual development. The clergy and a few others were at the faster, more intense speed. Everyone else was only expected to plod along at a slower spiritual speed. The High Middle Ages had a strong focus on bringing everyone along to a higher realm of spirituality and life. Up until a few hundred years ago, the common viewpoint of the North Atlantic world was basically Christian. Most people could not even consider a viewpoint without God. The culture has changed so that multiple viewpoints are now conceivable to most people. This change is accomplished through three major facets of Deism: one, an anthropocentric shift in now conceiving of Nature as primarily for people; two, the idea that God relates to us primarily through an impersonal order that He established; and three, the idea that religion is to be understood from Nature by reason alone. Deism is considered the major intermediate step between the previous age of belief in God and the modern secular age.p 221 Three modes of secularity are distinguished: one, secularized public spaces; two, the decline of belief and practice; and three, cultural conditions where unbelief in religion is a viable option. This text focuses on secularity three.p 20 In his previous work, Sources of the Self: The Making of Modern Identity, Taylor focuses on the developments which led to the identity of modern individuals in the West. This work focuses on the developments which led to modern social structures. The content of Sources of the Self is complementary to A Secular Age. Taylor discussed the political implications of A Secular Age in an interview with The Utopian.Meaney, Thomas and Mounk, Yascha. Spititual Gains , the Utopian, December 7, 2010 Outline Preface/Introduction Taylor is \\"telling a story... of 'secularization' in the modern West\\" (p.ix), and what the process amounts to, i.e., religion: \\"as that which is retreating in public space (1), or as a type of belief and practice which is or is not in regression (2), and as a certain kind of belief or commitment whose conditions in this age are being examined (3).\\" (p. 15) Taylor does not believe that the decline in belief occurred because \\"'Darwin refuted the Bible,' as allegedly said by a Harrow schoolboy in the 1890s.\\" So he wants to discuss belief and unbelief \\"not as rival theories... but as different kinds of lived experience involved in understanding your life in one way or the other\\" (p. 5). Where is the place of richness or fullness, and its opposite, the place of absence or exile? There is also the \\"middle condition\\", the daily activities between the extremes, and their meaning. For believers, the place of fullness is God. For unbelievers, it is within the power of reason (Enlightenment) or Nature, or our inner depths (Romanticism). Also, postmodernism wants to stand outside reason and sentiment, on the idea that fullness is a projection that cannot be found. In the old world, people could have a naive belief, but today belief or unbelief is \\"reflective\\", and includes a knowledge that other people do or do not believe. We look over our shoulder at other beliefs, but we still each live a \\"background\\", with our beliefs \\"held within a context or framework of the taken-for-granted... tacit... because never formulated.\\" (p. 13) Part I: The Work of Reform \\"[W]hy was it virtually impossible not to believe in God in, say, 1500 in our Western society, while in 2000 many of us find this not only easy, but even inescapable?\\" (p. 25). God's presence retreated in three dimensions. (1) People no longer see natural events as acts of God. (2) Society \\"could only be conceived as grounded in something higher than human action in secular time.\\" (p. 25) (3) People lived then in an enchanted world, now in disenchantment. Rejecting the \\"subtraction\\" theory of secularization, Taylor believes that a movement of Reform in Christianity, aiming to raise everyone up to the highest levels of religious devotion and practice, caused the move to secularization. The disciplined Reformed self replaced the \\"porous\\" self, which was vulnerable to external forces like spirits and demons, with a new \\"buffered\\" self, a disciplined and free agent living in a progressively disenchanted world. The success of Reform and the propagation of successful disciplined selves leads to a disciplinary society that starts to take action against rowdiness and indiscipline: controlling the poor, taming the warrior aristocracy, suppressing \\"feasts of misrule\\" like Carnival. Calvinists and Puritans were \\"industrious, disciplined... mutually predictable... With such men a safe, well-ordered society can be built.\\" (p. 106) The success of the project encouraged an anthropocentrism that opened the gates for a godless humanism. (p. 130) \\"So disengaged discipline frames a new experience of the self as having a telos of autarky.\\" (p. 138) Early humans were embedded into the world in three ways: into their small-scale social group in which religious ritual was identical with social ritual; into the cosmos, the enchanted world of spirits and forces; and the cosmos into the divine, so that the gods are intimately involved with the project of human flourishing. Thus: \\"Human agents are embedded in society, society in the cosmos, and the cosmos incorporates the divine.\\" (p. 152) This embedding is broken, for an elite, by the \\"higher\\" religions of the Axial Age. Humans are individuals, no longer embedded in society, God is no longer embedded in the cosmos, but separate, and the notion of human flourishing becomes transformed, e.g., in \\"a salvation which takes us beyond what we usually understand as human flourishing.\\" (p. 152) In the Reformation and after, this disembedding extended more and more from the elite to the whole population. More and more, in recent times: \\"Humans are rational, sociable agents who are meant to collaborate in peace to their mutual benefit.\\" (p. 159) This modern social imaginary is the Modern Moral Order, and it is a radical break with the two pre-modern moral orders, the idea of \\"the Law of a people\\" (p. 163) or the organization of society \\"around a notion of hierarchy in society which expresses and corresponds to a hierarchy in the cosmos.\\" (p. 163) Taylor sees \\"three important forms of social self- understanding.\\" (p. 176) \\"They are, respectively (1) the \\"economy\\", (2) the public sphere, and (3) the practices and outlooks of democratic self-rule.\\" (p.176) Both the economy and the public sphere are conceived as existing independent of the political power. In the notion of economy is the \\"invisible hand\\" and the exchange of advantages in a relationship of interlocking causes. The state becomes \\"the orchestrating power that can make an economy flourish.\\" (p. 178) This new moral order is no longer a society of \\"mediated access\\" where the subjects are held together by an apex, a King. \\"We have moved from a hierarchical order of personalized links to an impersonal egalitarian one, from a vertical world of mediated access to horizontal, direct-access societies.\\" (p. 209) Taylor anticipates that his approach might be attacked as \\"idealism\\" against the Marxian requirement of \\"materialism.\\" But ideas and material conditions are inseparable. \\"'Ideas' always come in history wrapped up in certain practices\\" (p. 213). Part II: The Turning Point The program of Reform, by creating a disciplined, ordered society, in which the vulnerable \\"porous self\\" became the disengaged \\"buffered self\\", created a distance between humans and God. Thus, exclusive humanism became an option through the \\"notion of the world designed by God... God relates to us primarily by establishing a certain order of things... We obey God by following the demands of this order.\\" (p. 221) A true, original, natural religion, once obscured, is now to be laid clear again. Christianity always provided for ordinary human flourishing, but included inscrutable divine grace. With deism, grace became eclipsed, for people endowed with reason and benevolence need only these faculties to carry out God's plan. God's providence, once a mystery, is just God's plan. Eventually, we come to Feuerbach: \\"that the potentialities we have attributed to God are really human potentialities.\\" (p. 251) Taylor makes a threefold claim. First, that \\"exclusive humanism arose in connection with, indeed, as an alternative set of moral sources for, the ethic of freedom and mutual benefit.\\" Second, that \\"it couldn't have arisen in any other way at the time.\\" (p. 259) Third, that today's wide range of unbelief still originates \\"in the ethic of beneficent order.\\" The usual interpretation of the changing understanding of God in recent centuries is a move from a \\"supreme being with powers... [of] agency and personality\\" to God as creator of a \\"law-governed structure\\" to \\"an indifferent universe, with God either indifferent or non-existent.\\" (p. 270) This is the subtraction story, but Taylor believes that it is more complicated than that. The official Enlightenment story is that \\"people started using Reason and Science, instead of Religion and Superstition\\" (p. 273) to explain the world. The social order can be organized by rational codes, and human relationships which matter are prescribed in the codes. But the motive force behind this development was reformed Christianity and its move to a designer God in the early modern period. In the new epistemic predicament, humans \\"acquire knowledge by exploring impersonal orders with the aid of disengaged reason.\\" (p. 294) They form \\"societies under the normative provisions of the Modern Moral Order.\\" In the secularist understanding, \\"human beings discover that they just are humans united in societies which can have no other normative principles but those of the MMO.\\" (p. 294) \\"It is a massive shift in horizon.\\" Part III: The Nova Effect Taylor sees three stages of a nova effect, an explosion of secularity beginning with \\"an exclusive alternative to Christian faith\\" (p. 299) in the 18th century. It was followed by diversification in the 19th century, even to the Nietzschean break with the humanism of freedom and mutual benefit. Finally, in the last fifty years, the nova has exploded to reach beneath elites to whole societies and includes \\"a generalised culture of 'authenticity', or expressive individualism,\\" of doing your own thing. But there are cross pressures. Against the freedom from \\"unreasoning fears\\" there is a feeling of malaise, of something lost. Heroism is lost in the leveling down of aspiration; utilitarianism is thought too flat and shallow. There is no room for death. Unbelief in the middle-to-late 19th century began to take up the profound new sense of the universe, its vastness in space and time, and in the lack of a plan. Taylor calls this the modern \\"cosmic imaginary\\" (the natural version of the modern \\"social imaginary\\"). \\"Our present sense of things fails to touch bottom anywhere.\\" (p. 325) Through the idea of the sublime and recovery of the \\"well-springs of sympathy\\" (p. 344) in Herder and Rousseau lost to disengaged reason, we reach eventually the Will of Schopenhauer. We experience a universe maybe without a \\"rational, benign plan\\", bottomless, and the \\"locus of our dark genesis\\". This leads to the theories of Freud, that the \\"highest functions, thinking, willing, are... the product of neuro-physiological functions in us.\\" (p. 348) The new imaginary sustains a range of views, from \\"the hardest materialism through to Christian orthodoxy.\\" (p. 351) This has confounded the war between belief and unbelief. The opening up of different ways in experiencing the world includes a shift in the place of art. Instead of mimesis, the retelling of the Christian world-view through its standard symbols and reference points, we have a creative art that must develop its own reference points. Artists \\"make us aware of something in nature for which there are as yet no established words... In this 'subtler language'... something is defined and created as well as manifested.\\" (p. 353) This applies to poetry, painting, and music taking an \\"absolute\\" turn, decoupled from story and representation. Yet they still move. But why? The mystery provides a place of the spiritual and the deep for the unbeliever. Taylor invokes Schiller and his notion of \\"beauty as an aid to being moral,\\" a \\"stage of unity as a higher stage, beyond moralism\\" obtained through play, the way we \\"create and respond to beauty.\\" (p. 358) It creates an unspecified space \\"between religious commitment and materialism.\\" (p. 360) In the 19th century, two additional factors influenced people in renouncing their faith in God: advances in science and Biblical scholarship, and the new cosmic imaginary. People came to feel that the \\"impersonal order of regularities\\" was a more mature standpoint than the faith in a personal God. The new cosmic imaginary of a universe vast in time and space also argued against \\"a personal God or benign purpose.\\" A materialist view is adult; faith in a personal God is childish. Another view is associated with Nietzsche, the \\"post-Schopenhauerian\\" vision that notices the \\"irrational, amoral, even violent forces within us.\\" (p. 369) These \\"cannot simply be condemned and uprooted, because our existence, and/or vitality, creativity, strength, ability to create beauty depend on them.\\" This rebels against the Enlightenment in a way that echoes the old aristocratic and warrior ethos, a \\"revolt from within unbelief... against the primacy of life\\" (p. 372) i.e., that \\"our highest goal is to preserve and increase life, to prevent suffering... Life properly understood also affirms death and destruction.\\" (p. 373) Thus, it is possible for people to live in a world encountering \\"no echo outside.\\" This view experiences \\"its world entirely as immanent.\\" (p. 376) After a resurgence of belief driven by the evangelical movement, by the 1830s elites began to experience again the cross-pressure between \\"the inescapable idea of an impersonal order\\" (p. 378) and the need to avoid a flattened world shorn of the values of Christianity. Carlyle attempted his own faith in \\"the human potential for spiritual/moral ascent\\" (p. 380) in the face of \\"utilitarian-commercial-industrial society.\\" In Matthew Arnold, this becomes a faith in culture, \\"the best that has been thought and said in the world.\\" (p. 384) Darwin and evolution changed everything, but the \\"need to articulate something fuller, deeper\\" (p. 391) continues. The high cultural trajectory was accompanied by the slow replacement of the vertical understanding of society into the modern horizontal idea of rights-bearing individuals related in mutual benefit, a combination of constitutional monarchy, rights and freedoms, Protestant religions, and British \\"decency\\", i.e., character and self-control. This strenuous ethic of belief set up \\"an unbelieving philosophy of self- control\\" (p. 395) in Leslie Stephen and John Stuart Mill, a \\"humanism of altruism and duty.\\" (p. 398) But this moralism provoked a rebellion by the young at the end of the century. It was too materialistic and too stifling. The new rebels were opposed not only to the \\"ethic of self-control in its altruistic, public-spirited facet, but also in its individualistic, self- improving, 'self-help' aspect.\\" (p. 401) In one version, with G. M. Trevelyan, it teeters on the edge of the material/transcendent divide, in another, with Walter Pater, it replaces the transcendent with aestheticism. Bloomsbury was another approach, an ethic of \\"personal relations and beautiful states of mind.\\" (p. 405) It carried immanence another step, identifying the intrinsically valuable with the internal experience and sensibility. Then along came World War I. Here was a war fought for \\"civilization... the protection of life from violence through order and law.\\" (p. 407) Yet the war was a \\"greater negation of civilized life than any foe threatened.\\" Thus Ezra Pound's notion of \\"a botched civilization\\" and T. S. Eliot's \\"Waste Land.\\" For intellectuals, it was impossible to inhabit the mental world of Rupert Brooke. Educated people could not deploy images of dedication and patriotism without distance and irony. \\"The will was suspect\\" (p. 411), a \\"formula for destruction rather than virtue.\\" We get to the post-war consensus of an interventionist state. There is an option to believe that is wisely refused, and a confident, buffered identity. The trajectory took different forms in the Catholic cultures. In particular, in France the modern order of mutual benefit, in its Rousseau version, becomes republican and anti-Christian, if not always clearly atheist. The notion of humans as innocent and good requires a political order opposed to the Christian original sin. The social imaginary \\"is grounded in exclusive humanism\\" (p. 412) and becomes radicalized in Marxist socialism. Opposed to this imaginary was \\"Reaction\\", a vertical hierarchy \\"where differences of rank were respected\\" (p. 413) and each had his place under monarchy, albeit justified by its beneficial consequences rather than an ontic logos. An ideal order \\"stressing rights, liberties and democracy, squares off against a counter-ideal which stresses obedience, hierarchy, belonging to, even sacrifice.\\" (p. 414) But there can be crossovers, with Comte and a scientific \\"religion to provide social cohesion\\" and an unbelieving Nietzsche with heroes, suffering as an ineradicable dimension that \\"heroes learn to face and surmount.\\" (p. 415) By 1912, Henri Massis and Alfred de Tarde write of a generation of youth needing a new discipline to create order and hierarchy and commitment against the dilettante generation of 1885. This movement was shattered in World War I. Many went into the war celebrating the opportunity for \\"heroism and dedication\\" only to be \\"sent wholesale to death in a long, mechanized slaughter.\\" (p. 417) The crisis of civilization dealt a body blow to established Christianity, and provoked \\"new, unbelieving variants of the vertical ideal of order\\" (p. 418) in fascism and Nazism. Thus, the struggle between belief and unbelief \\"has been connected with ideals and counter-ideals of the moral order of society. But this conflict has disappeared, as religion has delinked from society into \\"a new kind of niche in society.\\" (p. 419) Part IV: Narratives of Secularization  The Age of Mobilization  To combat the standard narrative of secularization, e.g., Steve Bruce's proposal that the endpoint of secularization is a widespread indifference to religion, and \\"no socially significant shared religion\\" (p. 435), Taylor proposes an age of mobilization, from about 1800 to 1960 where religious forms of the ancien r√©gime-type suffered decay, but new forms that fit the age \\"recruited and mobilized people on an impressive scale.\\" (p. 471) Churches organized their members' lives and inspired intense loyalty, so that \\"people would be schooled, play football, take their recreation, etc., exclusively among co-religionists.\\" (p. 472) In France, this process played out as a direct combat between the ancien r√©gime church and the secular Republicans in which the Church began organizing lay people in new bodies for fundraising, pilgrimages, and \\"Catholic Action\\". In the Anglophone world this mobilization occurred through \\"denominations\\" (e.g. Methodists) that \\"are like affinity groups\\" (p. 449), an organizing force to help people struggling to find their feet in the market economy.  The Age of Authenticity  But with the cultural revolution of the 1960s, the age of mobilization came to an end, at least in the modern West. The last half- century has seen a cultural revolution in the North Atlantic civilization. \\"As well as moral/spiritual and instrumental individualisms, we now have a widespread \\"expressive\\" individualism.\\" (p.473) Taylor calls this a culture of \\"authenticity\\", from the Romantic expressivism that erupted in the late 18th century elite, \\"that each one of us has his/her own way of realizing our humanity, and that it is important to find and live out one's own.\\" (p. 475) This affects the social imaginary. To the \\"horizontal\\" notion of \\"the economy, the public sphere, and the sovereign people\\" (p. 481) is added a space of fashion, a culture of mutual display. The modern moral order of mutual benefit has been strengthened, mutual respect requires that \\"we shouldn't criticize each other's 'values'\\" (p. 484), in particular on sexual matters. Since \\"my\\" religious life or practice is my personal choice, my \\"link to the sacred\\" may not be embedded in \\"nation\\" or \\"church\\". This is a continuation of the Romantic move away from reason towards a \\"subtler language\\" (Shelley) to understand individual \\"spiritual insight/feeling.\\" \\"Only accept what rings true to your own inner Self.\\" (p. 489) This has \\"undermined the link between Christian faith and civilizational order.\\" (p. 492) The revolution in sexual behavior has broken the culture of \\"moralism\\" that dominated most of the last half millennium. Developing individualism was bound to come into conflict with moralism, but in the mid-20th century, the dam broke. Thinkers started to think of sexual gratification as good, or at least unstoppable, especially as \\"in cities, young people could pair off without supervision.\\" (p. 501) Now people are not bound by moralism: \\"they form, break, then reform relationships;\\" (p. 496) they experiment. It is a tragedy, however, that \\"the codes which churches want to urge on people\\" still suffer from \\"the denigration of sexuality, horror at the Dionysian, fixed gender roles, or a refusal to discuss identity issues.\\" (p. 503)  Religion Today  Today, the \\"neo-Durkheimian embedding of religion in a state\\" (p. 505) and a \\"close interweaving of religion, life-style and patriotism\\" (p. 506) has been called into question. People are asking, like Peggy Lee, \\"Is that all there is?\\" They are heirs of the expressive revolution, \\"seeking a kind of unity and wholeness of the self... of the body and its pleasures... The stress is on unity, integrity, holism, individuality.\\" (p. 507) This is often termed \\"spirituality\\" as opposed to \\"organized religion.\\" This has caused a breaking down of barriers between religious groups but also a decline in active practice and a loosening of commitment to orthodox dogmas. A move from an Age of Mobilization to an Age of Authenticity, it is a \\"retreat of Christendom\\". Fewer people will be \\"kept within a faith by some strong political or group identity,\\" (p. 514) although a core (vast in the United States) will remain in neo-Durkheimian identities, with its potential for manipulation by such as \\"Milosevic, and the BJP.\\" (p. 515) Assuming that \\"the human aspiration to religion will [not] flag\\" (p. 515), spiritual practice will extend beyond ordinary church practice to involve meditation, charitable work, study groups, pilgrimage, special prayer, etc. It will be \\"unhooked\\" from the paleo- Durkheimian sacralized society, the neo-Durkheimian national identity, or center of \\"civilizational order\\", but still collective. \\"One develops a religious life.\\" (p. 518) While religious life continues, many people retain a nominal tie with the church, particularly in Western Europe. This \\"penumbra\\" seems to have diminished since 1960. More people stand outside belief, and no longer participate in rites of passage like church baptism and marriage. Yet people respond to, e.g. in France the 1500th anniversary of the baptism of Clovis, or in Sweden the loss of a trans-Baltic ferry. Religion \\"remains powerful in memory; but also as a kind of reserve fund of spiritual force or consolation.\\" (p. 522) This distancing is not experienced in the United States. This may be (1) because immigrants used church membership as a way to establish themselves: \\"Go to the church of your choice, but go.\\" (p. 524) Or (2) it may be the difficulty that the secular elite has in imposing its \\"social imaginary\\" on the rest of society vis-a-vis hierarchical Europe. Also (3) the U.S. never had an ancien r√©gime, so there has never been a reaction against the state church. Next (4) the groups in the U.S. have reacted strongly against the post-1960s culture, unlike Europe. A majority of Americans remain happy in \\"one Nation under God\\". There are fewer skeletons in the family closet, and \\"it is easier to be unreservedly confident in your own rightness when you are the hegemonic power.\\" (p. 528) Finally (5) the U.S. has provided experimental models of post-Durkheimian religion at least for a century. After summarizing his argument, Taylor looks to the future, which might follow the slow reemergence of religion in Russia in people raised in the \\"wasteland\\" of militant atheism, but suddenly grabbed by God, or it might follow the \\"spiritual but not religious\\" phenomenon in the West. \\"In any case, we are just at the beginning of a new age of religious searching, whose outcome no one can foresee.\\" Part V: Conditions of Belief We live in an immanent frame. That is the consequence of the story Taylor has told, in disenchantment and the creation of the buffered self and the inner self, the invention of privacy and intimacy, the disciplined self, individualism. Then Reform, the breakup of the cosmic order and higher time in secular, making the best of clock time as a limited resource. The immanent frame can be open, allowing for the possibility of the transcendent, or closed. Taylor argues that both arguments are \\"spin\\" and \\"involve a step beyond available reasons into the realm of anticipatory confidence\\" (p. 551) or faith. There are several Closed World Structures that assume the immanent frame. One is the idea of the rational agent of modern epistemology. Another is the idea that religion is childish, so \\"An unbeliever has the courage to take up an adult stance and face reality.\\" (p. 562) Taylor argues that the Closed World Structures do not really argue their worldviews, they \\"function as unchallenged axioms\\" (p. 590) and it just becomes very hard to understand why anyone would believe in God. Living in the immanent frame, \\"The whole culture experiences cross pressures, between the draw of the narratives of closed immanence on one side, and the sense of their inadequacy on the other.\\" (p. 595) Materialists respond to the aesthetic experience of poetry. Theists agree with the Modern Moral Order and its agenda of universal human rights and welfare. Romantics \\"react against the disciplined, buffered self\\" (p. 609) that seems to sacrifice something essential with regard to feelings and bodily existence. To resolve the modern cross pressures and dilemmas, Taylor proposes a \\"maximal demand\\" that we define our moral aspirations in terms that do not \\"crush, mutilate or deny what is essential to our humanity\\". (p. 640) It aspires to wholeness and transcendence yet also tries to \\"fully respect ordinary human flourishing.\\" (p. 641) Taylor imagines a two-dimensional moral space. The horizontal gives you a \\"point of resolution, the fair award.\\" (p. 706) The vertical hopes to rise higher, to reestablish trust, \\"to overcome fear by offering oneself to it; responding with love and forgiveness, thereby tapping a source of goodness, and healing\\" (p. 708) and forgoing the satisfaction of moral victory over evil in sacred violence, religious or secular. Taylor examines the Unquiet Frontiers of Modernity, how we follow the Romantic search for fullness, yet seem to respond still to our religious heritage. We replace the old \\"higher time\\" with autobiography, history, and commemoration. Many moderns are uncomfortable with death, \\"the giving up of everything.\\" (p. 725) \\"Our age is very far from settling into a comfortable unbelief.\\" (p. 727) \\"The secular age is schizophrenic, or better, deeply cross-pressured.\\" (p. 727) Against unbelief, Taylor presents a selection of recent spiritual conversions or \\"epiphanic\\" experiences in Catholic artists and writers, including V√°clav Havel, Ivan Illich, Charles P√©guy, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. The path to the future is a rich variety of paths to God in a unity of the church and a new approach to the question of the sexual/sensual. The disciplined, disengaged secular world is challenged by a return to the body in Pentecostalism. There is a \\"profound interpenetration of eros and the spiritual life.\\" (p. 767) \\"[I]n our religious lives we are responding to a transcendent reality.\\" (p. 768) Our seeking for \\"fullness\\" is our response to it. Secular belief is a shutting out. \\"The door is barred against further discovery.\\" (p. 769) But in the secular \\"'waste land'... young people will begin again to explore beyond the boundaries.\\" (p. 770) It will, Taylor believes, involve a move away from \\"excarnation\\", the disembodying of spiritual life, and from homogenization in a single principle, to celebrate the \\"integrity of different ways of life.\\" (p. 772) Epilogue: The Many Stories In a brief afterword, Taylor links his narrative to similar efforts by e.g., John Milbank and the Radical Orthodoxy movement, while also elucidating the distinctiveness of his own approach. He calls the tale told by Radical Orthodoxy thinkers the \\"Intellectual Deviation\\" story, which focuses on \\"changes in theoretical understanding, mainly among learned and related √©lites,\\" (p. 774) whereas the story he relates, which he names the \\"Reform Master Narrative,\\" is more concerned with how secularity \\"emerges as a mass phenomenon.\\" (p. 775) Both these stories are complementary, \\"exploring different sides of the same mountain.\\" (p. 775) In his review of the book, Milbank agreed that Taylor's thesis \\"...is more fundamental...because the most determining processes are fusions of ideas and practices, not ideas in isolation. Criticism Charles Larmore was critical of A Secular Age in its approach, especially with it having too many references to Catholic theologians and a noticeable absence of Protestant figures (see section I paragraph 7 within the cited article). Larmore also sees A Secular Age offering nothing new and is simply an extension of Max Weber's work on secularization theory (Section II, paragraph 1) with Weber and Taylor having differences that may be attributable to Weber being \\"a lapsed Protestant\\" and Taylor being \\"an ardent Catholic\\" (section II, paragraph 2). Larmore feels Taylor, in his book, may have \\"an adequate basis for jumping to metaphysical or religious conclusions\\" concerning the understanding of a secular view of the world, but to do so is \\"precisely what we ought not to do\\" (Section II, paragraph 5). Larmore disagrees with Taylor's insistence that people, having adequate information, should take a stance on God's presence throughout the world (Section II, paragraph 7). In Larmore's opinion, Taylor is wrong in not recognizing that \\"We have never been, and we will never be, at one with ourselves\\" and, therefore, should not jump to conclusions that are based on faith - which Larmore believes Taylor did in his book (Section II, paragraph 12). Reviews A Secular Age has been reviewed in newspapers such as The New York TimesJohn Patrick Diggins (16 December 2007). \\"The Godless Delusion\\" and The Guardian,Stuart Jeffries (7 December 2007). \\"Is that all there is?\\" magazines such as The New Republic and The American Prospect, and professional journals such as Intellectual History Review, Political Theory, Implicit Religion, and European Journal of Sociology.

The refuge grasslands are a habitat model for maritime grasslands, a disappearing habitat type on Long Island due to development. Maritime grasslands are native grasslands composed of little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), poverty grass (Danthonia spicata), hairgrass (Deschampsia flexuosa), and prickly pear cactus (Opuntia humifusa). Wildlife on the refuge is as diverse as its habitats. Waterfowl are primarily American black ducks and bufflehead. The grasslands are being managed and enlarged specifically to attract grassland dependent birds such as grasshopper sparrow, eastern meadowlark, Savannah sparrow and bobolink. Due to its coastal location, the refuge is heavily used by migratory songbirds, shorebirds and raptors. The refuge also supports endangered and threatened species.

He was a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, where he taught and studied for 38 years, from 1960 until his death in 1998. Early life Paul Antony Tanner was born in Richmond, Surrey, and brought up in South London during the Second World War. His father was a civil servant and his mother had trained as a teacher. He attended Raynes Park County Grammar School and, after National Service, matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge where he read English. His teachers included two great Shakespearean scholars, A. P. Rossiter and Philip Brockbank, both of whom were to be lasting influences on Tanner. In 1958 he won a Harkness Fellowship to Berkeley, California where he first encountered post-war American literature and culture. Later life and career In 1960 Tanner took up a fellowship at King's College, Cambridge to begin a doctoral study of the Transcendentalists at a time when American literature was not taught widely at English universities, and its study was considered relatively novel. Tanner's thesis was published in 1965 as the book Reign of Wonder, and, on the strength of its merits, he was appointed to a post in the English faculty. From then on, Tanner took an active role in promoting the inclusion of American literature in the English syllabus, lecturing, examining and advising widely on his chosen field. He went on to make a comprehensive study of contemporary American fiction from the period 1950-1970 in City of Words, published in 1971. Tanner briefly took up a position at Johns Hopkins University, but, after a severe bout of depression, reapplied to his former position at Cambridge. His next work, Adultery and the Novel (1979), attempted to reconcile close readings of Goethe, Flaubert and Rousseau with a more contemporary theoretical approach. The depression that had first afflicted Tanner in Baltimore resurfaced, coupled with damaging drinking problems. However, Tanner was able to make a recovery after a period of psychoanalysis and the support of his wife, Nadia Fusini, and went on to return to the canonical writers Henry James and Jane Austen, on whom he published in 1985 and 1986 respectively. Tanner's last book, Venice Desired, was an exploration of portrayals of Venice through the eyes of literary figures such as Byron, Thomas Mann, John Ruskin and Marcel Proust. His final work was to write prefaces to each of Shakespeare's plays for the new Everyman library, which he completed before succumbing to the illness that eventually caused his death in 1998. A collection of twelve essays on writers including Herman Melville, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Don Delillo, and Thomas Pynchon entitled The American Mystery was published posthumously in 2000.

It lives in a demersal, non-migratory, marine habitat with its depth range between 8‚Äì50 m. It can survive in only temperate zones. These organisms are found in the South Pacific, mainly, Chile. It is harmless to humans. The mode of reproduction in this kind of organism is external. The copulatory organs are absent. The gonads of hagfishes are situated in the peritoneal cavity. The ovary is found in the anterior portion of the gonad, and the testis is found in the posterior part. The animal becomes female if the cranial part of the gonad develops or male if the caudal part undergoes differentiation. If none develops, then the animal becomes sterile. If both anterior and posterior parts develop, then the animal becomes a functional hermaphrodite. However, hermaphroditism being characterised as functional needs to be validated by more reproduction studies. The eggs develop in the demersal areas. The shape of the eggs are elongated. The egg contains a single micropylar opening located at the animal pole. It is situated at the bottom of a micropylar cup which lies between the anchor filaments. The single filaments are long and have an anchor-shaped apical end. The number of filaments varies around 50 but is always smaller on the vegetative end. On both ends of laid eggs, the filaments are enveloped by a gel-like matrix intertwined with large cytoskeletal biopolymers (keratin-like intermediate filaments) of possible holocrine origin.

It was incorporated in October 1983 by David and Karen Geary. As of March 2017, Geary Brewing Company is now owned and operated by Robin and Alan Lapoint of Freeport, Maine. At the time of its inception in 1983, there were only 13 so-called microbreweries in the United States, almost all of them in California and the Pacific Northwest. Geary's, as it is more commonly known, was one of the first new microbreweries during America‚Äôs late 20th-century brewing renaissance. In the winter of 1984, David traveled to England and Scotland for training and research of brewing. With the help of Peter Maxwell Stuart, a Scottish nobleman and brewer who arranged introductions and itineraries, he worked in half-dozen small commercial breweries from the highlands of Scotland to the south coast of England. There were fewer resources for craft brewing at the time, so upon returning to the States, David and Karen began the long and difficult process of creating a business plan finding appropriate real estate, specifying equipment and raw materials, and raising the capital necessary to begin brewing. Once enough money was collect and two years had passed, the size and design of the brewery began to take shape. Since 1986, brewing has taken place at the original brewhouse in Portland, Maine. Now a tasting room (covered in hops) offers samples and tours of the iconic brewery. Through hiring Alan Pugsley (would go on to be a co-founder of Shipyard Brewing Company), an English biochemist. At the time Pugsley was one of the top brewing consultants in North America, under the direction of David and Karen the recipe for Geary‚Äôs Pale Ale was created using classic elements from some of Britain‚Äôs best breweries. Brewing began in the fall of 1986 and once David sampled and approved of the Geary's Pale Ale, the brewery was ready. On December 10, 1986, the first pints of Geary's Pale Ale were sold; signaling the arrival of New England's first microbrewery. Their beer offerings eventually expanded to some 10 beers, with some being limited time seasonals. In 1987 D. L. Geary Brewing Company's first big distribution break occurred when supermarket chains, Hannaford and Shaw's started carrying their beers. It was not until 1990, that they distributed outside of the United States Northeast. In 2006 Geary‚Äôs London Porter won a New York Times blind taste test when put against 24 other Porters. During the later 2000's the beer market and the number of breweries has grown exponentially in Maine. The formerly known, D.L. Geary Brewing Co. had been overshadowed by newer and hipper breweries, leading to lower production. According to numbers from Maine's Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations, Geary's beer production dropped by 34.5 percent from 2011 to 2015, while craft beer production as an industry had increased from 2011 to 2015. Increased competition along with decreased production, a devastating loss of one of the founders, Karen Geary, and a general loss of passion eventually led to the sale of the brewery new owners in March of 2017. Under the new ownership of Robin and Alan Lapoint, Geary Brewing Company is gaining its second wind. The Lapoint's are long-time Maine residents who, like many other Mainers, share fond memories of this influential brand. They are dedicated to the preservation of Geary Brewing Company, and to stewarding it into the future. The new owners of the brewery are committed to the preservation of the heritage line of English ales perfected by David Geary and intend to direct the brewery into a dynamic new phase that includes the favorites from the past and new favorites for the future. Under the revitalization of the brand, Geary Brewing now has 5 closed fermenters that allow them to brew a new contemporary line of beers, that include a new England-style IPA, a family of lagers, and seasonal double hopped IPAs. Geary Brewing Company also has an intimate, friendly tasting room for guests to sample 8 on tap beers including special releases from their new pilot brewing system. Guests can sample single pours, flights, or buy packaged beer at the tasting room, as well as enjoy one-of-a- kind tours of this historic brewery. From April-November, Geary Brewing also opens an outdoor beer garden where guests can enjoy their beers in a quiet and slow-paced atmosphere. During select Saturdays throughout the summer, the brewery hosts events with charitable partners and local food trucks in their outdoor beer garden.

There is a Memorial Stone of C.S. Goldman in the yard on the Murray United Church. Biography Born in Cape Colony, Goldman was an uitlander who spent much of his life in the Transvaal. Charles Sydney Goldman was perhaps one of the Province's most enigmatic historic figures. A German of Jewish ancestry, he left Germany for England, where he married the granddaughter of Sir Robert Peel. His next move was to South Africa, where he made a fortune in ostrich farming and gold mining. As a young man he built up a fortune in mining, using some of the profits to purchase an extensive estate known as Schoongezicht in the Middelburg District. During the Second Boer War, Goldman was a war correspondent for The Standard and was a major in the British forces, who assisted Winston Churchill as a war correspondent. Initially attached to Sir Redvers Buller's relief force, he travelled with them as far as Ladysmith after which he transferred to the cavalry advancing north in order to report on their endeavours. These experiences served as the foundation for Goldman's subsequent book With General French and the Cavalry in South Africa. He then moved to British Columbia, where he founded Nicola Stock Farm (now Nicola Ranch) in Merritt. He wrote a lengthy account of the Boer War, edited and translated several other historic works, as well as being a collector of Pre-Raphaelite art. One of his legacies still enjoyed by the public is Monck Provincial Park on the shore of Nicola Lake. After this war, in an effort to gain political influence Goldman purchased the struggling weekly journal, The Outlook.Stephen Koss, The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain, vol. 1:The Nineteenth Century (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1981), p. 434 Seeking to develop it into a prominent platform for the cause of tariff reformers, he hired the journalist J. L. Garvin as its editor. Garvin quickly transformed the journal into a publication of note, yet in spite of an increase in both prominence and circulation the paper failed to turn a profit. After a series of disagreements between the two men over business matters, Goldman sold the paper to Lord Iveagh in October 1906.Alfred M. Gollin, The Observer and J. L. Garvin, 1908-1914: A Study in a Great Editorship (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1960), p. 14-15 Still desiring a political role, Goldman involved himself in politics directly by entering Parliament, winning the Penryn and Falmouth seat in the January 1910 general election as a Unionist and serving until the borough was abolished in 1918 (the name was transferred to a new county division). During the First World War, Goldman served as a major in the Cornwall Royal Garrison Artillery. In 1919 he purchased the Nicola Ranch and Town site in Nicola, British Columbia which grew to some . He owned all the way up to Monck Provincial Park. Which is now that name. He named this park after his son Commander Victor Robert Penryn Monck of the Royal Navy. In England Goldman lived at Trefusis House, Falmouth until about 1929, after which he moved to the Jacobean mansion at Yaverland Manor. Family Goldman married, in 1899, Honourable Agnes Mary Peel (1869-1959), daughter of liberal politician Arthur Peel, 1st Viscount Peel. She was decorated with the Royal Red Cross, and was in December 1901 appointed a Lady of Grace of the Venerable Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. They had 3 children.

The two districts (Odu and Eta) have several secondary schools including Comprehensive Secondary School, Okobo, Comprehensive Secondary School Okopedi Okobo, Community Comprehensive Secondary School Ekeya Okobo, Community Secondary School Odobo Okobo, National High School Odobo Okobo and Eastern Okobo High School Obufi. There is also a private post-primary educational institution called Odu College. It is located in Ebighi odu, Okobo. There are different schools of thought on the historical origin of the Okobo people- From Usakedit (the present day isangele) and Arochukwu. Clearly more research is required to validate any of these suggestions. What seems to be in agreement is that Okobo was a warrior who had sons- Ebighi, Odu and Eta. The first place where Okobo people settled is said to be Ebighi. Okobo is endowed with a tropical forest with mahogany for supply of wood for boat and canoe construction. There are significant deposits of clay and fine sand. Fishing and farming are common in this local government area.  Culture  The cultural heritage is demonstrated in several traditional dances and masquerades such as Ekpe. The traditional marriage ceremonies in Okobo are similar to those of the Efiks. The list include: * Knocking drinks (Mmin ukong usung) * Prayer drinks (Mmin akam) * Drinks for expressing intention (mmin ukop iko) * Introduction Drinks (Mmin mbup) * Appreciation drinks (Mmin ekom) This list is just for the Mbub (introductory) ceremony. The traditional marriage list (Nkpo Ndo) comes with its own set of rites and ‚Äúgifts.‚Äù However, the ‚Äúbride-price‚Äù used to be a standard ¬£12 (bon duopeba).  Traditional marriage ceremony (Ndo)  On the day of the proper ceremony which takes place at the bride's family house, the groom and his family will be seated with the bride's father and his kinsmen in a sitting room while other guests seat outside, the announcer or moderator known as Mma Ofiori Ndo [ female] Ette Ofiori Ndo [male] will announce each item to be presented to the hearing of the guests seated outside. One of the major items to be presented is a box ‚ÄòEkebe‚Äô which contains different kinds of clothing, accessories, shoes to show how the groom will take care of the wife he is to be given. The bride price Okuk Ndo is paid, Ufop Iso Eka Eyen is paid to the bride's mother, Ufop Iso Ete Eyen is paid to the bride's father, the groom also pays Okpono Ndidito loosen the ties on his bride's feet and arms to officially claim her. When the ofiori ndo calls for drinks to be presented to the bride's family, two well adorned maidens emerge with a brass tray containing the drinks [known as akpankpang] balanced on their heads for presentation. The akpangkpang an expensive commodity is very rare these days because not every family can afford it. Royal families who own it put it up for hire to those in need. After meeting all the formalities, the groom who is usually dressed in a white singlet, a wrapper {nsobo], beaded shoes and a cap is ready to make his entrance to the arena where guests are seated, his friends troop in with him holding a beautiful ceremonial umbrella over his head while dancing to beautiful traditional drums and songs. When he takes his seat, the bride, dressed in a ball like Elizabethan gown {onyoyo}, a beautiful staff and hair plaited up {ETINGHE} and designed with bronze combs{edisat] down to her neck or waist, makes her entrance with the ekombi dance and her friends follow closely behind dancing and cheering. She dances round curtseying in appreciation to the guests before she takes a seat beside her groom. The final rite is the presentation of mostly kitchen wares by the bride's mother and her family to the bride, these gifts are usually all an Okobo bride needs to keep her home running as nothing is seldom lacking. The ceremony ends as the couple take the dance floor while well wishers join them ad mist eating, drinking and much jubilation.

Prelude After Kara Mahmud Pasha was defeated at Martiniƒái (1796), he planned new operations to subdue Montenegro. With his main army in Scutari, Kara Mahmud Pasha advanced to Podgorica. In the meantime, near the Montenegrin borders, a rather large number of forces were stationed due to the concentration of attacks towards Montenegro and Brda. From Podgorica, the Pasha's forces moved onto Lje≈°kopolje because his goal was to use the Lje≈°kopolje-Krusi-Carev laz-Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa line to his advantage in order to carry out a raid toward Cetinje. Petar I was informed of the Pasha's plans, and had managed to organize a defence. He took the larger part of his army and camped beneath the Saƒëavce mountain on the right bank of the Matica river. Another large unit under the command of Jovan Radonjiƒá camped under the Busovnika mountain near the village of Krusi. One of the early accounts of the battle authored by Archimandrite Stefan Vukƒçeviƒá in 1811. Battle The battle occurred on 3 October 1796 when Bushati ordered his troops to cross the right hand bank of the Sitnica River and attack Montenegrin positions. Krusi was directly in the path of his army. Half of the Montenegrin army was led by Metropolitan Petar I, and the other half by Jovan Radonjiƒá. The earliest historical sources about this battle include records of Russian deacon Aleksije, at that time scribe of Petar I. Deakon Aleksije wrote that both Petar I and Radonjiƒá were armed and wore uniform and that 500 chosen soldiers also wore uniforms. According to deakon Aleksije, the battle started at 8:30 am and lasted until evening. After a whole day of fighting, the Montenegrins were able to defeat the Ottoman army. Bushati was killed by the Montenegrin army during the battle. Legend has it that it was a Bogdan Nikoliƒá from Zalazi who managed to kill Bushati. The remains of the defeated Ottoman army were forced to withdraw to Podgorica. According to voivode Mirko, the Ottomans had 7,000 killed men.: \\"–í–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥–∞ –ú–∏—Ä–∫–æ —É —Å–≤–æ–º –∏–∑–≤—ò–µ—à—Ç–∞—ò—É —Ç–≤—Ä–¥–∏ –¥–∞ —ò–µ –Ω–∞ –±–æ—ò–∏—à—Ç—É –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–æ 7.000 —Ç—É—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ª–µ—à–µ–≤–∞, ...\\" Vuƒçetiƒá presents figure of 32 dead and 64 wounded Montenegrin soldiers. Deakon Arsenije presents probably more realistic figures of 132 dead and 237 wounded Montenegrin soldiers. Aftermath The first report about the victory of Montenegrins was written by Metropolitan Petar I to Ivan Osterman, the Chancellor of the Russian Empire. In that report Petar I expressed his gratitude for support of Russia and its empress, proudly stating that his forces killed Scutari governor and captured 33 Ottoman flags, large number of light weapon and plenty of ammunition. With the victory, the tribes of Bjelopavliƒái and Piperi were joined into the Montenegrin tribal assembly. The independence of Montenegro, though not officially internationally recognized emerged from the victory in this battle, which allowed proclamation of the first constitional act of Montenegro - The General Code of Montenegro and the Highlands (.: \\"–î—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–∞ —Å–∞–º–æ–±–∏—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç, –∏–∞–∫–æ –∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω–æ –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞—Ç–∞, –∏—Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∞ —ò–µ –ø–æ—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º –¢—É—Ä–∞–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ –ö—Ä—É—Å–∏–º–∞ 1796, —à—Ç–æ —ò–µ –æ–º–æ–≥—É—õ–∏–ª–æ –¥–∞ —Å–µ 1798. –ø—Ä–æ–≥–ª–∞—Å–∏ –ø—Ä–≤–∏ ‚Äû–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω–∏–∫ —Ü—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –∏ –±—Ä–¥—Å–∫–∏\\". \\" The Ottoman defeat at Battle of Krusi weakened the Ottoman rule in Slavic populated territories in the region.: \\"... –∫—Ä–∞—ò–µ–≤–∏–º–∞, —Ç–æ —ò–µ —É –æ–≤–æ–º–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω—É—Ç–∫—É –æ—Ç—Å—É–¥–Ω–∞ –±–∏—Ç–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ –ö—Ä—É—Å–∏–º–∞ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏–ª–∞ —Å–Ω–∞–∂–∞–Ω —É–¥–∞—Ä–∞—Ü –ø–æ —Ç—É—Ä—Å–∫–æ—ò –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ —É –Ω–∞—à–∏–º –∫—Ä–∞—ò–µ–≤–∏–º–∞ —É–æ–ø—à—Ç–µ –∏ –∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–æ –¥–æ–≥–∞—í–∞—ò –∫–æ—ò–∏ —ò–µ –∏—Å—Ç–∏–º –¢—É—Ä—Ü–∏–º–∞ –ø–æ–º–æ–≥–∞–æ –¥–∞ —Å—É–∑–±–∏—ò—É –ø–ª–∞–Ω–æ–≤–µ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–∏—Ö –æ–¥–º–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞¬ª.

The localisation of both the Tulingi and the Latobrigi north of the Upper Rhine is mostly arbitrary. The Tulingi were a small tribe closely allied to the Celtic Helvetii in the time of Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul. Their location is unknown; their language and descent are uncertain. From their close cooperation with the Helvetii it can be deduced that they were probably neighbours of the latter. At the Battle of Bibracte in 58 BCE, they were, with the Boii and a few other smaller tribes, allies of the Helvetii against the Roman legions of Caesar. Ancient source material on the Tulingi is scarce. The only reference is Caesar, who relates that with the Helvetii and the others they burned their homes and became part of the column of migrants seeking a new country in southern France.. The column was defeated by Julius Caesar in the opening campaign of the Gallic Wars, 58 BC. They were then returned to their homes, which they were compelled to rebuild. According to captured records in the Helvetian camp, the number of Tulingi, including fighting men, old men, women and children, had been 36,000, a small fraction of the total of 368,000, of which only 110,000 remained to return home after their surrender.. The main possibility as to their identity is that they were Celtic. As the \\"-ing-\\" in Tulingi is also a frequently used suffix in forming Germanic tribal names,The name is mentioned critically by Wolfgang Meid as \\"the earliest but very uncertain\\" instance of an ethnonymic formation -inga-/-unga- in a second theory, that they were Germanic, developed. This was championed by Rudolf Much and other authors who proposed the now-discredited theory of \\"Alpine Germanic\\" tribes in the late Iron Age, to whom the Tulingi were counted. So far no Germanic etymology for the name has gained wider acceptance.Stefan Zimmer: , in: Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde, ed. Heinrich Beck. vol 31. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin-New York 2006, p. 325 f. The ancient Boii had been displaced from the Danube by the Germanics. Those in Gaul were a remnant, as the Tulingi may well have been. If they were, they might logically be found across the Rhine, in Germania. Why they did not ally with the Germanics, whom the Celts feared and disliked, remains unexplained. They appear briefly in Orosius' mention of the Helvetian campaign, manifestly based on Caesar. However, Orosius uses Latobrigi instead of Latovici. The \\"-brigi\\" would certainly identify a tribe with a Celtic name, and if they were Celtic, perhaps so were the Tulingi. It is possible that the tribe appears in an independent later source contradicting the Germanic theory. About 360 AD Rufus Festus Avienus in Ora Maritima mentions a number of peoples living on the upper Rh√¥ne in Valais. Among them were the Tylangii, who have been tentatively identified as the descendants of Caesar's Tulingi. They were not located across the Rhine, but to the south of Lake Geneva. Moreover, Avienus considers them Ligurians. Some of the other names mentioned are Daliterni, Clahilci, neither of which is noticeably Germanic.

Raised in July 1940 and consisting of three infantry battalions, the 25th Brigade initially served in the United Kingdom, where it formed part of the garrison tasked with defending against a possible German invasion. In 1941, the brigade was redeployed to the Middle East where it took part in the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign fighting several actions around Merdjayoun and Jezzine. Following Japan's entry into the war, the 25th Brigade was transferred back to Australia and subsequently took part in the fighting in New Guinea. Throughout 1942‚Äì1943, the brigade fought in the final stages of the Kokoda Track campaign and around Buna‚ÄìGona. Later, they took part in the fighting around Lae and Shaggy Ridge, before being withdrawn to Australia for a long period of rest and reorganisation. In 1945, the 25th Brigade was committed to the Borneo campaign, carrying out an amphibious landing at Balikpapan in July 1945 before being disbanded in 1946. History The 25th Brigade was raised in June 1940 from Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) personnel in the United Kingdom. Upon formation, the brigade's headquarters was opened at Tidworth, in Wiltshire.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2104. The brigade was created following the Fall of France, initially as a temporary formation that would defend southern England, in the event of an invasion by German forces. It had an foundational establishment of 1,759 personnel; a majority were drawn from service support corps of the 6th Division, although roughly a quarter of this number were diverted from infantry reinforcements bound initially for AIF units in the Middle East. Upon formation, the brigade consisted of only three infantry battalions instead of the four that had been the usual Australian establishment up to that time,Dickens 2005, p. 367. due to manpower shortages and its component units were the 70th, 71st and 72nd Battalions, although these were later re- designated as the 2/31st, 2/32nd and 2/33rd Battalions. When formed, each of these battalions consisted of only three companies, instead of the usual four, although these companies were later added when the brigade deployed to the Middle East after January 1941. Men from the 2/31st Battalion dig a section defence post in Syria, 1941 Originally, the 25th Brigade was part of the newly established 9th Division, however, after being dispatched to the Middle East in 1941 it was transferred to the 7th Division, with which it remained for the rest of the war. Upon arrival, the brigade was sent to Palestine, although it moved to Ikingi Maryut, in Egypt, in April 1941 as preparations were made to deploy to Greece, in support of the 6th Division. However, in response to German moves in North Africa, the brigade was deployed to Mersa Matruh in the Western Desert, remaining there until relieved in May. By this time, the brigade's establishment was completed, and it consisted of 3,500 menDickens 2005, p. xiii. and was composed of the 2/25th, 2/31st and 2/33rd Battalions, with the 2/32nd having been transferred to the 24th Brigade and the 2/25th being re-assigned to the 25th in its stead as part of a re-organisation of the 2nd AIF as the more combat ready units were shifted to the 7th Division in preparation for operations, while those still forming were transferred to the 9th Division.Johnston 2007, p. 43. After this the brigade took part in the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign in June‚ÄìJuly 1941, fighting against the Vichy French.James 2017 During this campaign, the brigade was allocated to the centre of the Allied advance, with the 21st Brigade advancing on its flank along the coast. The campaign was short, but hard fought and the brigade's major actions during this time included an attack on Merdjayoun and fighting around Jezzine.Johnston 2007, p. 44.Crooks 1971, pp. 120‚Äì125.Johnston 2005, p. 60. After the armistice was signed in July, the 25th Brigade moved to Beirut where they undertook garrison duties. A further move took place in September, when the brigade was transferred to Tripoli to construct defensive positions. They remained there until January 1942, when the 25th Brigade was withdrawn to Julius, in Palestine.McKenzie-Smith 2018, pp. 2104‚Äì2105. In early 1942, following Japan's entry into the war and concerns about the strategic situation in the Pacific, the 25th Brigade‚Äîalong with the rest of the 7th Division‚Äîwere brought back to Australia to help reinforce the Militia units that were trying to hold back the Japanese advance in New Guinea. Arriving in Adelaide, in South Australia, the 25th Brigade's personnel were granted a brief period of leave before the brigade reconstituted around Casino, New South Wales, where they took over the defences from the 15th Motor Regiment amidst concerns of a Japanese invasion. In May, the brigade moved to Caboolture, Queensland, and assumed a defensive role around the beaches of the Sunshine Coast. As the fighting between Japanese and Australian forces along the Kokoda Track intensified, the brigade received orders to deploy to New Guinea, and they subsequently arrived in Port Moresby in September 1942.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2105. As the situation was dire for the Australians, upon arrival at Port Moresby, the 25th Brigade was committed to the Kokoda Track campaign, and was sent up the track to Ioribaiwa, where they reinforced the heavily depleted 21st Brigade. After heavy fighting, a withdrawal was undertaken to Imita Ridge, and by the end of the month the Japanese advance towards Port Moresby had reached its limit. After this, the Japanese began to withdraw north, and the Australians began a tentative pursuit. This saw the 25th Brigade involved in heavy fighting around Eora Creek and Templeton's Crossing in October, which was followed by the recapture of Kokoda on 2 November. Following the occupation of Kokoda, the 25th Brigade began the advance towards Wairopi. The Japanese had established strong defences around Oivi and Gorari, and while the 21st Brigade carried out a frontal assault, the 25th Brigade advanced further to the south and then attacked the Japanese rear. The Japanese then withdrew across the Kumusi River, after which the 25th Brigade continued towards the coasts, joining the fighting around Gona. At Gona they came up against a well entrenched force, and suffered heavy casualties. As a result, the brigade was withdrawn to Donadabu in December 1942 and then flown back to Australia the following month. Troops from the 2/32nd Battalion on Borneo, July 1945 A six month period of home service in Australia followed, during which intensive training was carried out around Ravenshoe, Queensland, on the Atherton Tableands.Draydon 2000, pp. 109‚Äì199. In September 1943, the brigade was committed to the capture of Lae, as the 7th Division was flown into Nadzab to begin the advance from there, while the 9th Division carried out another advance on Lae from the coast. While emplaning in Port Moresby, the 2/33rd Battalion suffered heavy losses when a Liberator bomber crashed on take off amongst trucks carrying members of the battalion. Nevertheless, the brigade arrived in Nadzab and on 9 September began their advance through the Markham Valley and after clashes around Jensen's and Heath's Plantations, the brigade entered Lae on 16 September.Keogh 1965, pp. 308‚Äì310. Following the capture of Lae, the brigade was flown to Kaiapit and the took part in the advance through the Finisterre Range, culminating in the Battle of Shaggy Ridge.Bradley 2004.Johnston 2007, pp. 44‚Äì46. After being relieved in early 1944 by the 15th Brigade, the 25th was withdrawn to Port Moresby in January 1944 and returned to Australia the following month.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2016. After this, the 25th Brigade did not see action for over a year. During this period, the brigade was located initially at Strathpine, Queensland, before moving to Kairi as they undertook training in Queensland before taking part in the final western Allied amphibious operation of the war‚Äîthe landing at Balikpapan in July 1945.Johnston 2007, p. 32.Draydon 2000, p. 237. This operation was part of the wider Borneo campaign. The strategic value of this campaign has since been questioned, however, ultimately the 25th Brigade's involvement in it was successful and it proved their last involvement in the war. Staging out of Morotai, the brigade landed at Balikpapan in July, following the 18th and 21st Brigades ashore. Advancing up the Milford Highway, the brigade advanced towards Batuchampar, and by the end of the month the Australians began mopping up operations. The Japanese surrendered in August 1945, after which the brigade served as occupation troops in Dutch Borneo until civilian authorities could be re-established. The brigade was disbanded shortly thereafter in 1946.

Family background and education Menendez was the only son of The Honourable F. M. Menendez, of Nassau, the Bahamas and his wife Maud, the sister of G. W. Sibly, founder of Wycliffe College, Gloucestershire. Menendez attended his uncle's school from 1909 to 1912, before going up to St John's College, Cambridge, to study law. Military service In 1914 Menendez abandoned his studies to enlist in the Army. He was commissioned as temporary second lieutenant on 19 March 1915, serving in the York and Lancaster Regiment, until transferring to the Gloucestershire Regiment on 10 September 1915. He was sent to France on 1 January 1916, and was promoted to lieutenant on 20 April. He was appointed an acting-captain while serving as a company commander from 29 July to 17 December 1916, during the Battle of the Somme. He also distinguished himself by leading trench raids at Neuve-Chapelle. On 11 August 1917 he was appointed a flying officer (observer), and transferred to General List of the Royal Flying Corps, with seniority from 28 May. He was posted to No. 57 Squadron, flying the Airco D.H.4 two-seater day bomber. Paired with Australian pilot Second Lieutenant Arthur Thomas Drinkwater, Menendez gained his first aerial victory on 18 August by driving down an Albatros D.V out of control over Courtrai, repeating the feat two days later over Houthulst Forest. On 21 September he accounted for two more D.Vs, one destroyed and the other driven down, over Dadizeele. He gained another double victory on 12 November, driving down two D.Vs south-east of Houthulst. On 27 October 1917 Menendez was awarded the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 15 March 1918. His citation read: :Temporary Lieutenant Frank Tremar Silby Menendez, General List and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in carrying out photographic reconnaissances and bombing raids far behind the enemy lines. On one occasion, when attacked by five enemy scouts, he drove three of them down and the other two then withdrew. On two other occasions he has driven down enemy machines out of control.\\" Menendez returned to England for flight training, being regraded from observer to pilot on 30 May 1918. However, on 1 August, he was involved in a mid-air collision over Ipswich. He survived, but was seriously injured, losing one eye and requiring facial reconstruction. On 5 June 1919 he relinquished his RAF commission on account of his injuries, but was permitted to retain his rank. Post-war career After spending some time recuperating in the Bahamas, Menendez married, and had two children. In August 1927 he joined the Civil Service, serving in the Department of Overseas Trade. During World War II he served as a Lewis gunner in the Home Guard, and was also seconded to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Menendez died in a nursing home in Eastbourne, Sussex, on 27 February 1973. References Bibliography * Franks, Norman; Guest, Russell; Alegi, Gregory (2008).

VIAF ID:89586887 (Person) (1519‚Äì1586) was a Reformed pastor and Protestant reformer who succeeded Heinrich Bullinger as Antistes of the Zurich church.  Life  Gwalther was born the son of a carpenter, who died when he was young. Heinrich Bullinger assumed responsibility for Gwalther's upbringing. He attended schools in Kappel, Basel, Strasbourg, Lausanne and Marburg and studied mathematics and poetry in addition to theology. He learned French and Italian in Lausanne. Landgrave Philip of Hesse brought the gifted student along to the Regensburg Colloquy in 1541. When he returned to Zurich, he received the pastorate of St. Peter's Church to replace Leo Jud. He married Huldrych Zwingli‚Äôs daughter Regula (1524‚Äì1565). He was an inspiring and popular preacher. His sermons and biblical commentaries have been frequently printed and widely read. As Zwingli‚Äôs son-in-law, he sought to preserve the great reformer's heritage and remained true to his theological orientation. Gwalther's Latin translations of Zwingli's works helped disseminate his thought in the Romance language world. Gwalther's wife Regula and Daughter Anna, painting by Hans Asper For Bullinger, he was a valuable collaborator in the management of the Zurich church and in assisting with his widely dispersed correspondence network. Outside of historical narratives, he produced numerous translations, and composed Latin poems and spiritual songs. Following Bullinger‚Äôs wish, Gwalther was elected in 1575 as his successor as Antistes at the Grossm√ºnster. He held this difficult office until 1585, when his declining mental state forced him from the post. He was succeeded as head of the Zurich church by his longtime colleague Ludwig Lavater. Influence He had contacts with English Calvinists through John Parkhurst, in exile in Zurich in the 1550s.:s:Parkhurst, John (1512?-1576) His works were one of the influences on the English vestments controversy of the 1560s; and his sermons were translated by Robert Norton of Ipswich in the 1570s.Dictionary of National Biography, article on Norton. His son Rudolf Gwalther the younger (1552‚Äì77) likewise enhanced his influence in England when he studied in Oxford in the early 1570s. Gwalther was in regular communication with English bishops. With Zwingli, Bullinger, Wolfgang Musculus, and Thomas Erastus, Gwalther was a prime advocate of the Swiss German single-sphere model of church-state relations, and was a significant influence on the evolution of a statist model of church organization within the Church of England.

Biography Early life Laurence Min√¥t was born in Wandsworth, Surrey, the only son of John Edward and Ada Min√¥t of Upper Norwood. He was educated at Dulwich College from 1909, where he was made a school prefect and head of the house in May 1914, also representing his school in the rugby union First XV. Aerial service Min√¥t began learning to fly at the Hall Flying School at Hendon Aerodrome in January 1915, during the school holidays. He left Dulwich in April, and eventually gained his Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate on 8 July. Min√¥t was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) on 28 October 1915, and was confirmed in his rank on 15 February 1916. He was soon sent to France, posted to No. 16 Squadron RFC, flying a variety of aircraft on patrols and reconnaissance missions. He was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 28 July 1916. He was transferred to No. 57 Squadron RFC in 1917 to fly the Airco DH.4 two-seater day bomber. Paired with observer/gunner Lieutenant Arthur Britton, Min√¥t gained his first aerial victories on 3 July 1917, accounting for two Albatros D.Vs over Zonnebeke, one driven down out of control and the other shot down flames, killing Albert Dossenbach. On 7 July, with AM1 Goffe as his observer, he drove down another D.V north-east of Ypres. Britton had returned as his observer on 27 July when they drove down three D.Vs over Houthulst. As a result of this action, and that of 7 July, Min√¥t would be awarded the Military Cross, while Britton received the Croix de guerre. The next day, 28 July, five aircraft from No. 57 Squadron took off from Boisdinghem to attack the German airfields at Heule and Ingelmunster. As result of injuries sustained the previous day Britton was unable to fly, so Min√¥t was paired with Second Lieutenant Sidney John Leete. However, they were intercepted by the Albatros D.Vs of Jasta 6, a unit of von Richthofen's \\"Flying Circus\\", and in the ensuing dogfight Min√¥t's aircraft was last seen chasing an enemy aircraft towards the ground. Initially listed as missing, news eventually reached the British via the Red Cross that Min√¥t and Leete had been shot down and killed. They may have fallen victim to Leutnant Hans Ritter von Adam, who was himself subsequently killed in action on 15 November 1917. Min√¥t and Leete are buried alongside each other in the Harlebeke New British Cemetery in West Flanders, Belgium. Min√¥t's Military Cross was posthumously gazetted on 19 April 1918. His citation read: :Second Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) Laurence Min√¥t, RFC, Special Reserve. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. When leading a formation of five bombing machines, he attacked a hostile formation of twenty machines, and in the ensuing fight himself drove down two enemy machines completely out of control, whilst his observer destroyed another.

On a previous occasion he, in company with two other machines, attacked four of enemy who were reinforced later by thirteen scouts, and, after heavy fighting, drove down one enemy machine out of control, his formation returning safely.\\" The Laurence Min√¥t Memorial Trophy In May 1926 the Air Ministry announced the instigation of the Laurence Min√¥t Memorial Trophy, which would be awarded annually to the crew of the aircraft which obtained the highest degree of accuracy in bombing. The trophy, in the shape of a large silver eagle, was originally donated anonymously, but was in fact commissioned by Min√¥t's father in memory of his only son. The trophy was originally awarded in a competition held between bomber squadrons of the Air Defence of Great Britain, which came in the Wessex Bombing Area ‚Äî the precursor of Bomber Command. Wing Commander Charles Portal, commander of No. 7 Squadron, won the trophy in its initial year of 1927, and then again in 1928. The 1928 contest took place at the North Coates Fitties bombing range where Portal, in a Vickers Virginia flying at , dropped his bombs to within of the target. From 1930 until 1936, the competition was confined to night bombing squadrons in home commands, and was then in abeyance until revived in 1949, when it was awarded to the Bomber Command squadron showing the best all-round excellence in training throughout the year. The annual awards gradually petered out in the late 1950s. In 2011 the trophy was found to be at the official residence of the Chief of the Air Staff, and at their request was transferred to the Officer's Mess of No. 57 Squadron at RAF Wyton. In August 2013 No. 57 Squadron also acquired Captain Min√¥t's Military Cross, presented to them by one of his last remaining relatives.

It sources scholarships from private persons in developed countries (the donors are called \\"AiduMakers\\") and awards these scholarships on a merit basis to needy students in developing countries. Its focus is on Kenya and on the Philippines. Need While the Kenyan population has access to free-of- charge primary education, few families can afford secondary school education for their kids. Every year, this forces thousands of students to drop out of school. Consequently, talent, creativity, motivation and drive are lost ‚Äì potential needed for the economic, social and political development of Kenya. Information * AiduMakers can award the scholarship to the student they believe in most. The scholarship is named after the AiduMaker (f.e. \\"Frank- Smith-Scholarship\\") * Aiducation International has chapters on three continents. * Aiducation International spends more than 90% of all scholarship donations directly on education. * Aiducation International was founded in 2006. Today, Aiducation International is run by volunteers (called Aiducators) with chapters in Germany, Kenya, UK, USA, and Switzerland. 2006: AI started as an NGO startup with roots in Kenya. In February 2006, members of the Kenyan civil society founded the organization- Pwani Education Welfare Association (PEWA), which soon became Aiducation International Kenya. 2007: AI Schweiz was founded in September 2007. In the same month and thanks to the first AiduMakers, Aiducation was able to award the first two scholarships to poor but high performing students. 2008: The first \\"Mentorship Academy\\" took place in Kenya. During the event, scholars meet to network, learn from guest speakers as well as from each other, and participate in workshops on how to make their country a better place. 2009: Chapters were opened in Germany and Singapore. The indirect impact of the scholars of Aiducation International became visible for the first time as one of the scholars organized fundraising events against a famine in northern Kenya.See the article in the Kenyan national newspaper The East African Standard Since its inception, Aiducation has provided more than 300 Kenyan students with scholarships.Newly awarded scholarships are communicated on the Facebook Fanpage of Aiducation Awards *VentureKick award Zum ersten Mal 130000 CHF f√ºr eine NPO *Reboot grant *Procter & Gamble Alumni Grant to finance Mentorship Academies in 2010. Organization structure Aiducation International (the umbrella organization) has national chapters in developed as well as developing countries. The chapters in developed countries are for the purpose of raising scholarships as opposed to those in developing countries which exist to provide scholarships to bright and needy students. The scholarship-raising chapters (Switzerland, Germany, UK and Singapore) have contact with potential AiduMakers and the talent-raising chapters (Kenya) have contact with potential scholars. The latter are responsible for the recruitment and pre-selection of students as well as mentoring of scholars. AI is made up of \\"Aiducators\\" and most of them work on a voluntarily basis. Aiducators are typically students and young professionals who understand the importance of funding the education of a bright and needy student. Switzerland (AI Schweiz) Chief Executive Officer: Matthias Meier. AI Schweiz was established in September 2007 functions as a scholarship-raising arm for Aiducation. Kenya (AI Kenya) Chief Executive Officer: Jeremiah Kiponda Kambi. Applications are subjected to a shortlisting and interview process by AI Kenya, and made available to potential donors and sponsors. Germany (AI Deutschland) Chief Executive Officer: Matthias Meier. AI Deutschland began operations in early 2009, with a team of 15 Aiducators in Germany. It serves as a scholarship-raising chapter for Aiducation International. Merit-based scholarships Aiducation International sources scholarships for bright and poor children to fund their secondary school education. Typically, these students (called \\"AiduFellows\\") are above-average performers and would have dropped out of school due to financial constraints. Donors to Aiducation International, who award these merit-based scholarships are known as AiduMakers. AiduMakers can choose which student receives their scholarships from among Aiducation's pool of applications, and the scholarship is named after the AiduMaker (e.g. \\"Thomas- Smith-Scholarship\\"). Aiducation encourages its AiduMakers to build a one-to- one relationship with the AiduFellows they support and allows them to monitor the progress of the student through annual progress reports.

Circumnavigation and publicity Watson sailing Cape Horn, 13 January 2010. Approximate route taken by Watson on her voyage between October 2009 and May 2010 Watson had been planning to complete a solo non-stop and unassisted circumnavigation since at least early 2008. Officially announced in May 2009, the journey was expected to take eight months with an estimated distance of 23,000 nautical miles. To fulfill the plan of sailing non-stop and unassisted, during the journey no other person would be allowed to give her anything and she must not moor to any port or other boat, although advice over radio communication would be permitted. Watson's planned circumnavigation route was to start and end at Sydney and to pass near New Zealand, Fiji, Kiribati, Cape Horn, Cape of Good Hope, Cape Leeuwin and South East Cape. In accordance with the definitions for circumnavigations set out by the International Sailing Federation's WSSRC, the equator must be crossed \\\\- this crossing was carried out near Kiritimati. However, the WSSRC criteria also stipulate that a global circumnavigation must have an orthodromic distance of 21,600 nautical miles - Watson's journey did not meet this requirement. Watson arrived back in Sydney Harbour at 1:53 pm, Saturday 15 May 2010. The Los Angeles Times reported Watson's reason for her journey: \\"I wanted to challenge myself and achieve something to be proud of. And yes, I wanted to inspire people. I hated being judged by my appearance and other people's expectations of what a 'little girl' was capable of. It's no longer just my dream or voyage. Every milestone out here isn't just my achievement, but an achievement for everyone who has put so much time and effort into helping getting me here.\\" Watson wrote a book about her experience, True Spirit published by Hachette Australia. The book was released 29 July 2010. Watson filmed a documentary about her solo trip before, during and after completing her journey. It was narrated by Sir Richard Branson and premiered on ONEHD on 16 August 2010, before being released on DVD along with a CD album on 20 August 2010.Jessica's Documentary Completed -- World Premiere on ONEHD.

Preparation As training for her voyage, Watson crewed on a number of vessels, including OceansWatch's Magic Roundabout on which she acted as skipper during a crossing of the Tasman Sea. At the time she left on her voyage, Watson had the following qualifications: * RYA/ISAF Offshore Safety course (ISAF SR 6.01) Cat zero (one-day 8-hour course) * RYA Diesel Engine course (one-day 8-hour course) * RYA Radar course (one-day 8-hour course) * YAs Safety and Sea Survival certificate (two-day 16-hour course) * OMTC issued Certificates of Competence for Apply First Aid HTLF301B * IMO compliant Elementary First Aid Table A VI/1-3 STCW95 (one-day 8-hour course) * Yachtmaster Ocean theory certificates (40-hour course) * Radio operator's licence * About 6,000 coastal and 6,000 ocean miles experience. BoatThe boat is a Sparkman & Stephens model S&S; 34, the same design as used by Jon Sanders, David Dicks and Jesse Martin in their circumnavigations. It was obtained and refitted with new equipment under the supervision of Don McIntyre and Bruce Arms, both skilled and experienced sailors. The refitting included a new galley, reconditioned diesel and water tanks, and a complete rebuild of the electrical system. Watson was also deeply involved in the preparation of the boat, which she named Ella's Pink Lady. Most of the time the boat is steered by a self-steering windvane system. She has named the system Parker after the chauffeur of the pink Rolls-Royce in the Thunderbirds television series. Test run and collision During a test run sailing from Brisbane to Sydney, on her first night after leaving Brisbane, Ella's Pink Lady collided with the Silver Yang, a 63,000-tonne bulk carrier at about 02.00 am on 9 September 2009 near Point Lookout. Watson's boat was dismasted in the collision. She was able to retain control and return the boat to Southport under motor. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau's preliminary report on the collision found that Watson had been taking a five-minute nap during the event, (thus she was asleep at the time of the collision), and that while she had checked her radar prior to lying down, she had failed to spot the Silver Yang. This led to the accident four minutes later. The report also found that the Silver Yang had been aware of her presence and had attempted to change course, but that this had been insufficient to avoid Watson's boat. The final report was released in June 2010. The report stated that both Watson and the Silver Yang's watchkeepers had failed to maintain an adequate lookout and that both had failed to properly employ the navigational aids. In addition, the report found that the watchkeeper on the Silver Yang had failed to offer assistance to Watson after the two vessels had collided. Journey Watson sailed out of Sydney Harbour on 18 October 2009 in her pink-hulled Ella Bach√©- sponsored Ella's Pink Lady. 18 days later, on 5 November, she passed Tonga, sailing clear of both New Zealand and Fiji. alt=Jessica leaving Brisbane for Sydney As required for a full circumnavigation, she crossed the equator on 19 November 2009 (Australian date), near Jarvis Island at about 161¬∞40'W longitude, and rounded Kiritimati on 22 November 2009 (Australian date) after 36 days. Then she crossed the equator again at 156¬∞20'W longitude, and continued south-easterly towards Cape Horn. The sailed distance from Sydney to Kiritimati was about 3,900 nmi. At Christmas she was near Point Nemo, the place located furthest from land. On 13 January 2010 (9:40 UTC) she passed Cape Horn, having sailed around 9,800 nmi in 87 days. This was 11 days ahead of the planned per day schedule. Soon after her parents flew over her in a small plane in order to witness the passage. Just over a week later, on 23 January 2010, several days after passing the Falkland Islands, she suffered four knock-downs in a severe storm with 10-metre waves and winds. The storm caused minor damage to her boat and her emergency beacon was inadvertently activated as the mast hit the water. The halfway point on the voyage was passed on 25 January 2010, her 100th day at sea, based on the original calculation of sailing route. On 15 February 2010, she crossed the Prime Meridian, crossing from the Western Hemisphere to the Eastern Hemisphere. This placed her near the Cape of Good Hope, which she passed on 24 February, reaching Cape Agulhas, (the southernmost point of Africa), and crossing from the Atlantic Ocean into the Indian Ocean. From southern Africa, Watson sailed more than towards Western Australia. Watson arrived in the Australian economic zone on 10 April 2010, celebrating with crackers and Vegemite. There her parents and media flew over her in a small plane in order to welcome her. She passed Cape Leeuwin on south-western Australia two days later, with approximately remaining. When south of Australia, Watson suffered a lot of bad weather. In this part of the journey, she had at least three knockdowns (where the mast hit the water), one of them with the mast deep into the sea, but escaped serious damage and injury. The swells she experienced in the Great Australian Bight were up to 12 metres in height, higher than anytime before. On 3 May, Watson rounded the South East Cape of Tasmania and began heading north to Sydney, her final destination. She completed her journey on day 210 of her voyage at 1:53 pm on 15 May 2010 when she arrived in Sydney Harbour. Her 17th birthday was three days later. During the journey Watson had to repair the boat and the equipment. Several of the repairs were reported on the blog: the battery monitor (18 December), the stove, toilet and mainsail (24 January), the toilet again (11 March), replacement of wind generator blades (30 March), the kettle (10 April), the mainsail again (18 April), replacement of the wind generator with a spare (21 April), and finally the fuel pump of the engine (10 May). Ella's Pink Lady stays in Queensland In the months following the completion of Jessica's journey, there were questions about what would become of her boat, Ella's Pink Lady. In April 2011, after the state and federal governments jointly purchased the yacht for $300,000, it was announced that the Pink Lady would have a permanent exhibition at the Queensland Maritime Museum in Brisbane. Criticism Watson's journey has been criticised, particularly after the collision with the freighter. Barry Tyler of Pacific Motor Yacht magazine wrote, \\"like the majority of the seafaring world [I] consider it irresponsible, cavalier and indeed ignorant to attempt such a feat, at such a tender age and with so little trans-ocean experience.\\" Questions about her experience were also expressed by Phil Jones, the CEO of Yachting Australia, and by Grant Wharington, the skipper of Skandia, with Wharington stating that he had been impressed by Watson when they had met, but that he had advised her to gain experience by undertaking a number of shorter solo passages before attempting the circumnavigation, although she chose not to follow his advice. A more general concern was raised by the Australian Childhood Foundation, who questioned whether a 16-year-old girl would have the ability to fully understand the risks that such a venture would involve. Circumnavigation scrutiny Sailing website Sail-World.com published an analysis on 3 May 2010 which claimed that the expected rhumb line distance travelled by Watson was , which was less than the required distance according to the definition set by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC), and that the journey was therefore ineligible to claim world record status for round-the-world journeys. The equivalent orthodromic distance for Watson's route would be . The WSSRC definition states in part \\"The shortest orthodromic track of the vessel must be at least in length.\\" The analysis suggests that Watson's published distance logs are based on sailed distances, including tacks and strategic weather detours, rather than the shortest orthodromic track between islands and capes as defined.Girl, 16, shrugs off controversy as she ends global sail .

It was replaced by the rule that for world records the shortest orthodromic track must be at least as long as the circumference of the earth (hence 21,600 nautical miles). Watson's response, \\"If I haven't been sailing around the world, then it beats me what I've been doing out here all this time.\\" received widespread media coverage. And by following on with \\"...it's a shame that my voyage won't be recognized by a few organizations because I'm under 18 ...\\" Watson successfully created a public perception that it was her age, rather than the length of her voyage, that proscribed recognition as a global circumnavigator. Watson's manager, Andrew Fraser, defended Watson's circumnavigation claim, noting that the WSSRC does not recognise records by sailors under eighteen. He stated \\"Jessica has sailed a southern hemisphere solo circumnavigation, [in which] 'a vessel must start from and return to the same point, must cross all meridians of longitude and must cross the Equator'. Jessica has ticked all of these boxes. Jessica has sailed the most challenging and treacherous oceans of the world, passing the four capes (Cape Horn, Cape Agulhas, Cape Leeuwin and the Cape of SE Tasmania) and crossed the Equator twice. She has sailed around the world, non-stop, solo, unassisted and when she completes the voyage, she will be the youngest to have done that, sailing almost 23,000 nautical miles in the process. We have official TracPlus data to confirm Jessica's exact distance upon her return.\\" British sailing journalist and author Bob Fisher published an article on Sail-World.com refuting the round the world claim. He said \\"True, Jessica has sailed alone and unassisted, passed under the four required capes, but the orthodromic route she has taken does not total the necessary 21,600 miles that is equivalent of the girth of the Earth at the equator. And that, Andrew Fraser, is a requirement for the world record you were claiming for Jessica, and which would put her in line to beat Jesse Martin's record.\\" Watson commented on this matter in her book True Spirit. She states that she wrote a number of letters to the WSSRC asking what she had to do to claim the record. Their answer was that she could not claim the record since age records were no longer recognized. She got the impression it was (according to WSSRC) not necessary to follow the route Jesse Martin followed (which went far north of the equator in the Atlantic), a route Watson knew well from reading Martin's book more than once. Watson decided to follow a route commonly accepted as round the world. A number of sailors, like Kay Cottee, followed a similar route which has been accepted. In the book she also criticised those who criticised her management. Sail-World.com has written \\"We don‚Äôt believe she decided her route. People think we‚Äôre criticising Jessica. We‚Äôre not. We‚Äôre criticising her management\\". She felt hurt by that, since it hinted that \\"He was suggesting that I was just a puppet, that I had no voice and no will of my own.\\" Praise Despite criticism, Watson has had her supporters, not only after, but before the departure. In particular, adventurer Don McIntyre strongly supported her attempt, providing her with a boat and speaking in support of her attempt. Similarly, Tony Mowbray, who, like McIntyre, has previously circumnavigated the globe, provided his support, arguing that she was \\"doing it for the right reasons\\" and that he was confident of her success. The captain of the Magic Roundabout spoke highly of her skills, backing her circumnavigation attempt by describing her as a \\"damn- good crew member\\" and stating that he believed that she possessed the necessary abilities. Also adventurer and company owner Richard Branson gave his support before departure. During her journey others expressed their support for her attempt. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said in a public speech on 26 January that \\"Jessica Watson ... is an extraordinary young Australian.\\" According to ABC News, competing circumnavigator Abby Sunderland congratulated Watson on rounding Cape Horn, \\"She's done an amazing job and I hope the rest of her trip goes as well as it has so far.\\" At the arrival in Sydney, she was met by thousands of spectators including then Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. He said \\"Jess welcome back to dry land. Welcome back home to Australia. You know something, you may feel a little wobbly on your feet just now, but in the eyes of all Australians you now stand tall as our newest Australian hero.\\" The crowd then sang a special rendition of Australia's national Anthem Advance Australia Fair as a salute to Watson. Awards Watson in Laos as part of a program with the World Food Program (2011). Since her appointment in 2011, she acts as a WFP Youth Ambassador. Since completing her circumnavigation, Watson has been recognised with a number of awards. These include the \\"Spirit of Sport\\" award from the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, and \\"Young Performer of the Year\\" for 2010, an award voted by the Australian public and presented at the annual Sports Performer Awards in Melbourne. Watson was named the Australian Geographic Society's Young Adventurer of the Year in 2010. She was selected as one of the ten international \\"2010 Adventurers of the Year\\" by National Geographic Society, and was the only sailor in the group. Watson was named the Young Australian of the Year on 25 January 2011.Jessica Watson is Young Australian of the Year. Retrieved 25 January 2011. She was selected as one of the entrants to the Who's Who in Australia 2012 edition. Watson was the first female skipper to cross the line in the 2011 Sydney to Hobart and as a result earned the Jane Tate trophy. Watson received an Order of Australia Medal (OAM) in the Australia Day Honours List in January 2012 for service to sailing and to youth through the achievement of sailing solo and unassisted around the world, and as a role model for young Australians.cite web|url=http://www.dpmc.gov.au/government/its-honour/search-australian-honours Further projects Watson at the 2011 Imagine Cup finals. Watson took part in the Mini Fastnet sailing race, in Europe, in June 2011, sailing a two- person mini sailboat with Scott Cavanough as skipper. Following the Mini Fastnet, she sailed the Round the Island Race in United Kingdom in June 2011, as a crew member with Phil Baughen as skipper and Michael Perham as third crew member, although they had to retire after boat damage. In August 2011 she sailed in the Sydney Gold Coast Yacht Race with part of her intended Sydney‚ÄìHobart crew using the boat Another Challenge. They won their class. After that, she sailed in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in December 2011, skippering Another Challenge with the youngest crew to ever compete in the race, consisting of ten people aged under 22, with Watson aged 18. The boat got the second place in its class, Sydney 38 One Design, with equal standard boats. This was considered a success, since all the other boats in the class had considerably older skippers. She has studied marketing and communications at university.Jessica Watson says sailing is now just for fun as she puts her head down at university In 2015, she took a position as communications manager for deckee.com, an online forum and business directory for the boating community.Where are they now: Jessica Watson embarks on new career See also * List of youth solo sailing circumnavigations * List of female adventurers References External links *Official website *Broadcast of her arrival in Sydney (7:19 in length).

Nine entities contested the election, including several coalitions. Pre-election polls suggested a share of 41% of the vote going to the \\"Mega Combination\\" coalition that includes the National Democratic Party of former dictator D√©si Bouterse. The ruling Nieuw Front (NF) had around 22.5% support. There were 324,490 people registered to vote in the election which would determine the holders of 51 parliament seats, 116 regional positions and 752 municipal positions.Election 2010 turnout per district Results Preliminary results issued on 26 May 2010 showed the Mega Combination winning a plurality of 23 seats, up from 15 in the last election. The New Front for Democracy and Development alliance of incumbent President Ronald Venetiaan (who had stated before the election that he would not seek another term) was said to have won 14 seats. Venetiaan ruled out working together with the NDP as long as it was led by Bouterse. In the upcoming indirect presidential election in July 2010, a two-thirds majority will be required to elect the next president. Organisation of American States election observers reported a peaceful election with no irregularities. Bouterse had not stated if he will seek to return to the presidency. Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said that the Dutch government would respect the will of the voters of Suriname, despite Bouterse having been sentenced to 11 years in prison by a Dutch court for drug dealing. An Interpol arrest warrant has been issued for him, but Suriname does not extradite its citizens.  Aftermath  The NDP successfully concluded a coalition deal with Bouterse's former opponents in the civil war, the A Combinatie, giving him a majority in parliament, but not the two-thirds majority required to elect the president. Negotiations with the People's Alliance to attain the necessary supermajority reportedly failed after the People's Alliance raised excessive demands. The NDP fell out with the A Combinatie over the number of cabinet posts, however, and subsequently, the New Front (led by the National Party of Suriname) formed a coalition deal with the A Combinatie and the People's Alliance, giving them 27 seats in parliament, enough to form the government, but too few to elect the president. It was seen as a possibility that Bouterse might be elected in the final round of the presidential election (when it goes to the People's Assembly, where the NDP has a majority. In a surprise development, Jennifer Geerlings-Simons from the NDP was elected Chairwoman of the House on 30 June 2010 with 26 to 24 votes, even though the anti-NDP parties had a majority in parliament. The NPS's Ruth Wijdenbosch was elected Vice Chairwoman with 25 to 24 votes. In the run-up to the presidential election on 19 July 2010, Bouterse convinced the A Combinatie to join forces with him, giving him a 30-seat majority; immediately before the election, he succeeded in getting the People's Alliance to join him, giving him the votes required to become president.

Manapat (May 24, 1953 in Manila December 24, 2008 in Antipolo) was an activist, scholar, writer, researcher, and educator who was the Director of the Records Management and Archives Office of the Philippines (The National Archives) from 1996‚Äì1998 and 2002‚Äì2008. He is best known as the author of the book, \\"Some Are Smarter Than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism\\", a work on anti-cronyism exposing the wealth of the Marcos dynasty, and as Editor-in-Chief of the \\"Smart File\\", Smart File Magazine Animal Farm Series.Smart File Magazine, Published by Animal Farm Publications, 1993-2008Manapat's Book Early life and education Ricardo Manapat was born on May 24, 1953, in Manila, Philippines. His father, Apolinario B. Manapat (1925‚Äì2006), was a mechanical engineer, and his mother, Angelita de Leon (b. 1923), is a pharmacist and was a Professor of Chemistry at the University of Sto. Tomas for 30 years. Manapat was the eldest of five children, and his siblings are Maria Teresa, Maria Lourdes, Maria Cristina, and Jose Alfredo. As a young child, Manapat served as an acolyte at the Santo Domingo Church in Quezon City, when Mass was still given in Latin. He played piano and violin, and also studied the clarinet and trumpet. He was an avid and voracious reader, and he kept music and books as part of his daily life. He completed his elementary, high school, college, and post-graduate studies at the Ateneo de Manila University, where he cultivated and pursued his interests in mathematics, physics, linguistics, history, economics, and philosophy. He was fluent in English, Spanish and Filipino, and spoke German, French, and Italian. He also studied Latin, Portuguese, Arabic, Catalan, and Sanskrit in his later years. In his high school days, Manapat wanted to serve his country, and in response to the Marcos dictatorship, he joined Kasapi (Kapulungan ng mga Sandigan ng Pilipinas) and postponed his studies at the Ateneo for a year and became very active in the movement. He resumed his high school studies at the Ateneo de Manila, and obtained his college degree in Philosophy in 1976, graduating with Departmental Honors. Manapat was pursuing a doctorate in Economics at the New School for Social Research in New York, when he decided to return to the Philippines after the People Power movement led by President Corazon Aquino in 1986. He completed a master's degree in Spanish at the University of the Philippines, while pursuing master's degrees in Mathematics and History at the Ateneo de Manila University. In 2005, he began his studies in Historical Sociology towards a doctoral degree at La Trobe University in Australia. He was the recipient of a Commonwealth International Student Scholarship and was awarded the DM Myer Medal as the most outstanding undergraduate student graduating in that Faculty in 2006. Career After graduating with honors, Manapat became an instructor at the Department of Philosophy in the Ateneo de Manila University from 1977 to 1979. In December 1979, he met with Sen. Benigno Aquino, Jr. (\\"Ninoy\\") at the Aquino residence in Quezon City, where Manapat was congratulated by Aquino for his then 48-page pamphlet, ‚ÄúSome are Smarter than Others‚Äù. Aquino, while incarcerated in Fort Bonifacio in 1979, called the document as ‚Äúthe most explosive document to have rocked the city of Manila‚Äù. The meeting in Quezon City proved to be the beginning of a lifelong friendship between the two. A year later, Manapat received a letter from Aquino asking him to develop his pamphlet into a book. Manapat started working on the book in the United States in 1980.http://newsbreak.com.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=2264&Itemid;=88889332 Manapat worked at Bear Stearns, a global investment banking and securities firm in New York City, in 1988. While in the United States, Manapat also took computer programming courses at New York University and briefly taught at St. Peter's College in New Jersey. Manapat then completed his book, ‚ÄúSome are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos‚Äô Crony Capitalism‚Äù, in 1991. The book takes its title from a statement made by Imelda Marcos on criticisms regarding her relatives who became overnight millionaires under the Marcos regime. Imelda Marcos reportedly said, ‚ÄúSometimes you have smart relatives who can make it ‚Ä¶. My dear, there are always people who are just a little faster, more brilliant, more aggressive.‚Äù Manapat‚Äôs book became the best-selling book in contemporary Philippine history at that time. In 1996-1998 and 2002‚Äì2008, Manapat was Director of the Records Management and Archives Office of the Philippines (The National Archives). He was first appointed by President Fidel V. Ramos in 1996, and then by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in 2002. As Director of The National Archives, Manapat oversaw the reconstruction of the Intendencia, the historic building in Intramuros erected in 1824, as the future home of the National Archives. His work included the prior historical and architectural researches, the construction phase, and the soft- inauguration of the building in 1988. Manapat started the project to digitize all the important historical document holdings of the National Archives, storing them in computer media in order to preserve them and make them more accessible to the public. During his directorship, Manapat was able to finish around a third of the 12 million documents in the holdings by 1998. Manapat also initiated the cataloging of the historical documents, resulting in the discovery of rare Rizaliana in 1998.Jose Ricardo Manapat, Curriculum Vitae In 1998, Manapat also achieved the highest score (92.7%) in Civil Service Career Executive Service exams. In January 2004, three National Archives staff members accused Manapat of forging documents against the late Presidential candidate, Fernando Poe, Jr. Manapat, however, was cleared of the charges by the Sandiganbayan (a special court in the Philippines). Manapat then went on leave from the National Archives to pursue a doctoral degree in Historical Sociology at La Trobe University in Australia. He returned to the Philippines in 2008 to research and write his thesis, and to continue his various projects and studies. He completed his Master‚Äôs degree in Spanish on Rizal Studies at the University of the Philippines, and was working on his thesis for his Master‚Äôs in History and Mathematics at the Ateneo de Manila University.  Death  Manapat died unexpectedly in his home in Antipolo, Philippines, on December 24, 2008 at age 55. An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be myocardial infarction.

Early life  After growing up in a small town on the coast of Brittany, in 1955 Barri√®re enrolled in the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'arts et m√©tiers in Angers. As a student he bought a guitar and started to write songs. After graduating in engineering in 1960, he moved to Paris to take up employment, and started to perform in the evenings at small clubs around the capital. He won a song contest in 1961 with the self-penned song \\"Cathy\\"; his style was chanson-based with no concession to the burgeoning y√©-y√© scene, but nonetheless he was soon signed to a recording contract and started to release singles regularly, enabling him to give up his job and make at least a modest living from music.  Eurovision Song Contest  In 1963, Barri√®re's song \\"Elle √©tait si jolie\\" (\\"She Was So Pretty\\") was chosen as the French representative in the eighth Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 23 March in London. \\"Elle √©tait si jolie\\" finished fifth of 16 entries.  Success  \\"Elle √©tait si jolie\\" turned out to be by far the biggest seller of Barri√®re's career to that point. He released his first album, Ma vie, in 1964 and the title-track became a hit. In 1965 he was offered, and accepted, a leading role in a heist thriller, Pas de panique, alongside Pierre Brasseur. This would be his only venture into acting, but his singing career reached its peak in the latter part of the decade with a string of hits making him one of France's biggest stars and a sell-out live attraction. His most famous success is the song \\"Mon Vieux\\".  1970s  Barri√®re had gained a reputation for being uncompromising and at times difficult to work with. In the early 1970s he left his record company to set up his own label. He kept his fanbase, which ensured his records and concerts continued to provide a good living, despite his being overlooked by sections of the French broadcast media. \\"Tu t'en vas\\", a 1975 duet with fellow Eurovision veteran No√´lle Cordier, topped the French chart, and was the third biggest-selling single of the year in Switzerland. Barri√®re married in 1975, and he and his wife opened a nightclub-restaurant in a converted castle in Brittany. Although it proved a successful and popular venue, Barri√®re soon found himself facing severe tax problems as a result of dubious advice. In 1977 he took his family to the United States, where they remained for four years.  Later life  After returning to France, Barri√®re made several comeback attempts, to little avail. After another period spent overseas, this time in Quebec, the family were back in Brittany when Barri√®re's career was unexpectedly rejuvenated by the 1997 release of a CD containing remastered versions of his old hits, which proved to be a money-spinner. Shortly afterwards, Barri√®re released an album of new material, which also sold well. He published an autobiography in 2006 and continued to release both retrospective and newly recorded albums.[ AllMusic biography] Barri√®re died of cardiac arrest on 18 December 2019 at the age of 84.

Public Safety Canada defines human trafficking as \\"the recruitment, transportation, harbouring and/or exercising control, direction or influence over the movements of a person in order to exploit that person, typically through sexual exploitation or forced labour. It is often described as a modern form of slavery.\\"Public Safety Canada, National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking: \\"What is Human Trafficking?\\" British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons formed in 2007, making British Columbia the first province of Canada to address human trafficking in a formal manner. The biggest human trafficking case in Canadian history surrounded the dismantling of the Domotor-Kolompar criminal organization. On June 6, 2012, the Government of Canada established the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking in order to oppose human trafficking. The Human Trafficking Taskforce was established in June 2012 to replace the Interdepartmental Working Group on Trafficking in Persons as the body responsible for the development of public policy related to human trafficking in Canada. In 2019 The Canadian Centre to End Human Trafficking launched Canada's National Human Trafficking Hotline to provide crisis response to people being trafficked and tip reporting. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. RCMP In 2005, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) estimated that 600-800 people are trafficked into Canada annually and that additional 1,500-2,200 are trafficked through Canada into the United States. This was updated in 2010. In 2011, Corporal Jassy Bindra stated that there were more than thirty ongoing investigations into human trafficking across Canada. Cindy Kovalak is the Human Trafficking Awareness Coordinator for the Northwest Region Immigration and Passport Section of the RCMP. Law On June 29, 2010, the 40th Canadian Parliament enacted An Act to amend the Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons under the age of eighteen years). The act established a mandatory sentencing of five years' imprisonment for those charged with the trafficking of children within Canada. On June 28, 2012, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking in persons) amended the Criminal Code to enable the Government of Canada to prosecute Canadians for trafficking in persons while outside Canada. Government response Commenting on the report, the then Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Monte Solberg told Sun Media Corporation, \\"It's very damning, and if there are obvious legislative or regulatory fixes that need to be done, those have to become priorities, given especially that we're talking about very vulnerable people.\\"Canada an ‚ÄúInternational Embarrassment‚Äù on Sex Trafficking  US State Department Trafficking in Persons Reports  The US Trafficking in Persons Report is an annual report of the US State Department that takes stock of the international human trafficking situation, with Tier 1 being the best while Tier 3, may be subject to certain US government sanctions, such as the withholding of non-humanitarian, non-trade- related foreign assistance, funding for government employees educational and cultural exchange programs. Canada has been rated as Tier 1 consistently with the exception of 2003 when it was considered Tier 2. The 2009 report states \\"The Government of Canada fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. During the past year, the Canadian government maintained strong victim protection and prevention efforts, and demonstrated modest progress in prosecuting and punishing trafficking offenders, securing five trafficking-specific convictions during the past year. Law enforcement personnel, however, reported difficulties with securing adequate punishments against offenders.\\"US State Department Trafficking in Persons Report 2009: Country Narratives - Canada (p. 98) The 2010 report confirmed Canada's Tier 1 status.\\"2010 Trafficking in Persons Report\\", Page 49, Washington, D.C., Department of State The report states that \\"Prostitution by willing adults is not human trafficking regardless of whether it is legalized, decriminalized, or criminalized.\\" Therefore, should Canada fully legalize sex work, it will not affect its Tier ranking. This is a change from earlier reports such as 2005US State Department Trafficking in Persons Report 2009 which linked tolerance of prostitution to trafficking. Furthermore, the US now follows the International Labour Organization which considers human trafficking to be predominantly an issue of forced labour rather than of sexual exploitation. (p. 8) Aboriginal women and girls The sexual exploitation and Trafficking of Aboriginal girls and women is far more common than most are willing to believe. According to The Native Women's Association of Canada, the overrepresentation of Aboriginal women and girls in sexual exploitation and trafficking in Canada has been explored on repeated occasion through a span of years. However, the identified root causes never seem to change. These are the impact of colonialism on \\"Aboriginal societies, the legacies of the residential schools and their inter-generational effects, family violence, childhood abuse, poverty, homelessness, lack of basic survival necessities, race and gender-based discrimination, lack of education, migration, and substance addictions\\".Colonization in Canada has taken and maintains the form of systematic discrimination, embodied in harmful policies and legislation that have greatly damaged Aboriginal societies. Research into human trafficking in Canada shows that Aboriginal women and children are the majority of those trafficked domestically.  Recruiting  Traffickers mask their exploitation behind the appearance of claiming to care about the girl, and the relationship may start out with expensive gifts. Sometimes girls are made to recruit other girls, their motivation is frequently not their own economic profit but fear of violence from their own trafficker if they refuse or fail to bring in someone else. The dancers who end up trafficked are Aboriginal girls who are moved many times across provinces for their job until they have become disconnected from friends and family. Aboriginal girls, particularly in rural communities, are sometimes lured through communications with traffickers in the city who promise them employment (in respectable jobs, not trafficking). Hitchhiking is more of a direct approach, where girls are picked up attempting to relocate or travel, and are pushed into sexual exploitation. A heavy presence for recruitment is the use of gangs. One of the motivators for a gang presence in the sex trafficking of Aboriginal women and girls may be the perception that trafficking women and girls for sex acts is a low-risk crime for incarceration. Gangs use similar recruitment methods as other more straightforward traffickers. Many identified that drug addiction was a popular tool for gangs, seemingly over that of force, for achieving these women‚Äôs compliance. \\"For vulnerable Aboriginal youth, often faced with low self-esteem and a lack of sense of belonging, gangs can offer both of these through enrollment\\". Sometimes, their recruitment process requires sexual exploitation or that they recruit others. Gang presence is on the rise, and represents a growing, if not completely quantifiable, source for active recruitment of Aboriginal women and girls into sex trafficking. Systemic discrimination in terms of overrepresentation in the criminal justice system and the overrepresentation in the child welfare system factor largely in the vulnerability of these women and girls, which can lead to being trafficked.  Prevention  * Awareness-raising through education and discussion * A safe, non-judgemental place to go * Cultural connection * Raising self-esteem * Service providers who have experience in the trade * Viable economic alternatives Kingsley, C., & Mark, M. (2001). Sacred lives: Canadian Aboriginal children and youth speakout about sexual exploitation. Vancouver: Human Resources Development Canada. Education refers to being educated on the difference between healthy relationships and unhealthy ones (specifically, sexually exploitive relationships). Education is crucial, both for potential \\"victims\\" and those around them, including the community. Part of education is not taking things for granted. It is not always obvious what is and is not appropriate. One of the ways that exploitation is allowed to continue is due to the lack of education of the realities of the trauma and prevalence of exploitation. Educating is not just for the potentially exploited, exploitation happens in the dark, in unhealthy environments, and for many, before they have a chance to learn and set healthy parameters. The practice of sexually trafficking women and girls is a practice that discriminates against their gender, under a justification on the part of the trafficker that this behaviour is somehow permissible.http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/LegislativeSummaries/38/1/c49-e.pdf Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the promotion of women‚Äôs equality come into focus.Barrett, N. A. (2010). An exploration of promising practices in response to human trafficking in Canada. International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy, Vancouver; British Columbia. \\"These should be pursued in laws and policies that focus on reducing harm against women\\". More than five hundred First Nations girls and women have gone missing in Canada over the last thirty years. No one knows at this point in time, how many of these disappearances are linked to the flesh market and, perhaps, domestic sex trafficking, but many believe that the two are likely related. It is evident that \\"Canada has systematically failed to comply with its international and domestic obligations under the Trafficking Protocol for the protection of \\"victims\\" of human trafficking.\\"  UN Protocol to Prevent  Until the year 2000, there was no internationally recognized definition of sex trafficking. The United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons (UN Protocol) defines human trafficking in the following way: \\"Trafficking in Persons shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of persons, by means of use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction or fraud, of deceptions, of the abuse of power of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payment or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over other persons, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at the minimum, the exploitations of the prostitutions of other or other forms of sexual exploitation, forces labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs\\". According to the UN protocol, sex trafficking does not require cross border movements of humans. However, many people continue to confuse or use the terms human trafficking and human smuggling inter-changeably. Domestic sex trafficking has recently been gaining attention in Canada. The reality for many Aboriginal women and girls in Canada are that they are \\"victims\\" and survivors of domestic sex trafficking. Aboriginal women and girls are being targeted for sexual exploitation and relocated from their communities, homes, foster homes, to and within urban centres in Canada. In general, the high rates of migration from a reserve (rural area) to an urban centre also poses an increased risk and entry point through which vulnerable Aboriginal women and girls may be exploited. \\"The promises by sex traffickers to provide shelter and employment in off reserve communities can lead young Aboriginal girls to feel that they can escape poverty or a potential problem situation at home\\". They willingly leave their home and community only to discover that the promise was too good to be true and they are forced into sex slavery. They are manipulated and lured by sex traffickers. Many Aboriginal girls go missing from communities or in urban centres and they are viewed as runaways, or simply fall off the radar. The misinterpretations of misconceptions on the definition regarding cross-border movement and coercion leaves many trafficked Aboriginal women and girls unprotected and neglected. The UN Protocol itself did not give legal effect to the definition, and countries were required to adopt legislative and other measures to establish criminal offences. Following the ratification in Canada of the UN Protocol, Parliament passed legislation to amend the Criminal Code with Bill C-49. Bill C-49, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking in persons) came into force on November 25, 2005. Bill C-49 creates three new additional indictable offences specifically to address human trafficking and which can be used by law enforcement to address this crime. Bill C-49 amends the Criminal Code to specifically prohibit trafficking in persons in Canada.Previously, the Criminal Code contained no provisions to specifically prohibit trafficking in persons, although a number of offences ‚Äì including kidnapping, uttering threats, and extortion‚Äì played a role in targeting this crime. In 2002, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act brought Canada‚Äôs first anti-trafficking legislation into force. prohibits bringing anyone into Canada by means of abduction, fraud, deception, or use or threat of force or coercion. Bill C-49 adds to this legislation by going beyond the focus on immigration and making trafficking in persons a criminal offence. The bill contains three prohibitions. The first contains the global prohibition on trafficking in persons, defined as the recruitment, transport, transfer, receipt, concealment or harbouring of a person, or the exercise of control, direction or influence over the movements of a person, for the purpose of exploitation. The second prohibits a person from benefiting economically from trafficking. The third prohibits the withholding or destroying of identity, immigration, or travel documents to facilitate trafficking in persons. Bill C-49 also ensures that trafficking may form the basis of a warrant to intercept private communications and to take bodily samples for DNA analysis, and permits inclusion of the offender in the sex offender registry. Finally, Bill C-49 expands the ability to seek restitution to \\"victims\\" who are subjected to bodily or psychological harm.  UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  As a result of historical injustices (colonization, genocide, loss of lands and resources) and discriminatory government legislation and policies, Indigenous Peoples have been prevented from fully realizing or exercising all of their human rights. Recognized by Canada in November 2000 as an \\"aspirational document\\", the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) is a framework that re-affirms the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and to strengthen the relationship between States and Indigenous Peoples. This Declaration affirms that \\"Indigenous individuals have the rights to life, physical and mental integrity and liberty and security\\" (Article 7). Many Aboriginal women in prostitution do not participate in the sex trade by choice and have been a \\"victim\\" of childhood abuse and sex trafficking. Aboriginal women have the right to protection and safety of the law regardless of the views of others that they are choosing prostitution. Article 8c of the (UNDRIP) asserts that \\"States shall provide effective mechanisms for prevention of, and redress for any form of forced population transfer which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of the rights of Indigenous Peoples.\\" Indigenous women and girls are overrepresented in the sex trade and are at a higher risk of being trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This is a complete violation of their human rights and States have an obligation to invest effective mechanisms, interventions, programs and services to address this issue. Indigenous women are often recruited into the sex trade when they are still children. Article 17 reaffirms that States shall \\"in cooperation with Indigenous Peoples take specific measure to protect Indigenous children from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child‚Äôs education, or to be harmful to the child‚Äôs health or physical, mental, spiritual, oral or social development.\\" Trafficking, prostitution and commercial sexual exploitation of Aboriginal women and girls are all forms of extreme violence against women. They are repeatedly exposed to acts of violence, sexual violence, trauma, and torture. Article 22 of the UNDRIP recognizes the responsibility of States to take measure to \\"ensure that Indigenous women and children enjoy the full protection and guarantees against all forms of violence and discrimination.\\"  Other  A 2009 US State Department Human Rights ReportUS State Department. Human Rights Reports - 2009 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Canada. March 11 2010 stated > \\"NGOs estimated that 2,000 persons were trafficked into the country > annually, while the RCMP estimated 600 to 800 persons, with an additional > 1,500 to 2,200 persons trafficked through the country into the United > States.

The report also states that some of the victims are sexually exploited, although no percentage is provided in the report. Canadian NGOs and claims of links between sex work and trafficking As noted by the US report, Some Canadian NGOs such as Vancouver Rape Relief believe that making prostitution legal is the best way to prevent human trafficking, forced prostitution, child prostitution and similar abusive activities. They argue that a system which allows legalized and regulated prostitution makes it more socially acceptable to buy sex, creating demand for prostitutes and, as a result, human trafficking increases in order to satisfy this demand. However these claims are disputed by other organizations.FIRST. Feminists Advocating for Rights and Equality for Sex Workers Justice Susan Himel in a 2010 Ontario Superior Court decision, referring to the New Zealand Report of the Prostitution Law Review Committee on the Operation of the Prostitution Reform Act 2003, noted that \\"Under-aged prostitution does not appear to have increased post-decriminalization, and, as of 2007, no situations involving trafficking in the sex industry have been identified.Bedford v.

Plot summary The story follows a young Assamese woman who teaches at the University of Delhi and is an author. She is busy writing a book on Delhi and regularly jots down anything that crosses her mind. The Operation Blue Star at the Golden Temple in Amritsar brings sudden twist to the novel and the protagonist plunges headlong into the crisis for most of the people she is close to are Sikhs.

In several interviewsInterview in Pratilipi she stresses that there is no difference between fact and fiction in that book. Sexuality For the conservative Assamese society, it created a stir due to the frank confession of sexual attraction the first-person narrator feels to Santokh Singh, the rickshaw puller, with whom she visits the riot- affected areas such as Jahangirpuri, Shakti Nagar. Delhi The City of Delhi is the most important character in the novel. Though the backdrop is of immense political and social crisis, the author attempts to complete her book by visiting various places such as Mirza Ghalib's house, the prostitutes of GB Road ‚Äì the famous red light area of Delhi. Her preoccupation is often the remnants of Mughal Delhi and the Delhi of the dispossessed. Blood Blood is the most importance metaphor and presence in the novel.

He came to Queensland in 1898. He married Amy Maria Beadle on 2 January 1903 in Townsville, Queensland.Queensland Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages They had five children: Raymond, Morrie, Madge, Jack and Jill. He was commonly known as Jack Crampton.Obituary, \\"The Passing of a Great Labor Stalwart: Death of Alderman W.R. Crampton\\", The Worker (Brisbane), Tues 25 October 1938. Walter died on 20 October 1938 at Brisbane, Queensland after a short illness.Obituary, \\"Death of a Labor Stalwart\\", Brisbane Courier-Mail, Fri 21 October 1938. He was cremated at the Mt Thompson Crematorium. Public life In April 1892 Crampton joined the Slaughtermen's Union in April 1892, beginning a lifelong association with the union movement. He moved to Queensland in 1898 and was working as a meatworker in northern Queensland where he became concerned about the conditions of working men. In particular, he was concerned that many abattoirs would only employ workers on contracts that gave them no job security. In 1904, he had moved to Brisbane and became the full-time organizer for the Australasian Federated Butchers' Employees' Union in 1908. In this role, he worked tirelessly to unionise the abattoirs of North Queensland. When managers would turn him away from their premises, he would slog through mud flats and bush to find a back entrance to the workplaces to talk with the workers. Crampton sought to achieve greater unionisation in all workplaces. From 1910 to 1913, he was a member of the central political executive of the Australian Labor Federation. In 1911 he established the southern district branch of the Amalgamated Workers' Association and was involved in organising the sugar workers' strike at Mackay, Queensland. In 1912, he became President of the Brisbane branch of the Australian Labor Federation. In 1912, Crampton stood for election as a member of the Labor for the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for the seat of Windsor, but was not successful. Instead he became secretary of the Queensland branch of Australasian Federated Butchers' Employees' Union. He was a director of the newspapers The Daily Standard and The Worker, both of which were affiliated with the Australian Labour Party. In 1914, he resigned his roles with his union to work as a journalist on The Daily Standard, writing under the name Jack Aster. In 1915‚Äì17 he was appointed to the public service as the director of labour, where he worked to reorganise the department. In 1917 he returned to the Daily Standard as its general manager, a role he held until 1927. In 1916-19 Crampton was a government representative on the Senate of the University of Queensland. Jack Crampton was a member of LaborRegister of Members of the Legislative Assembly 1860‚Äì2009 and of the Legislative Council 1860-1922, accessed 18 October 2009 and was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council on 10 October 1917. Although it was a lifetime appointment, the Council was abolished on 23 March 1922. Jack Crampton was one of those who voted for its abolition, as it had been Labor Party policy to abolish the Council for many years. Crampton was an alderman of Brisbane City Council from 1921 to 1925 and then again from 1934 to 1937 in the Paddington Ward and from 1937 to his death in 1938 in the Baroona Ward.

He is best known for his iconic 1949 nude photographs of Marilyn Monroe, which were distributed widely as calendar art‚Äîone of which was featured in the inaugural issue of Playboy magazine in 1953. He paid Marilyn Monroe only $50 dollars for the shoot. Biography Kelley was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He learned photography as an apprentice in a New York photo studio, and then worked for the Associated Press and Town & Country magazine. After moving to California in 1935, Kelley established a photography studio in Hollywood and produced promotional photographs of motion picture stars. David O. Selznick and Samuel Goldwyn retained Kelley to take promotional photos of their stars and starlets for magazine covers and advertising. Later, Kelley's business shifted to commercial and advertising photography. Some of Kelley's most famous photo subjects have included Gary Cooper, Greta Garbo, James Cagney, Clark Gable, Winston Churchill, Bob Hope, Marlene Dietrich, Joan Crawford, Jack Benny, David Bowie, John F. Kennedy, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Yma Sumac and, of course, Marilyn Monroe, with and without clothes. Tom Kelley had a way of making his subjects feel comfortable behind the camera. He would bring his wife with him to his shoots to create a more soothing and relaxed atmosphere. Kelley served on the panel of judges at the Miss Universe 1952 and Miss Universe 1956 pageants. Kelley was one of the judges for the famed annual Cavalcades of Jazz beauty contests from 1955 to 1958 which was held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles and the last one at The Shrine Auditorium. These concerts and beauty pageants were produced by an African-American Leon Hefflin, Sr. Kelley appeared in the 1966 documentary film The Legend of Marilyn Monroe. The Red Velvet photos When Kelley originally approached Marilyn about the nude shoot, she turned him down. Monroe was concerned initially about the potential negative effects that such publicity could bring her young career. She was aware that at that time it was not considered traditionally \\"appropriate\\" to be nude. Nonetheless a few days later she gave in and decided to pose for the photos, signing them ' Mona Monroe'. Kelley believed that it was in part because she owed him a favor, having lent her a few bucks for a cab ride home. But Monroe herself said several times that she really just needed the money when she was hungry and needed to make a payment on her vehicle. She joked, however, that she was glad she wasn‚Äôt eating much at the time because it gave her \\"a real washboard stomach\\" in the photos. Upon doing the shoot, Kelley stated \\"all of her constraints seemed to vanish with her clothes\\", and that she seemed to be more \\"herself\\" in the nude. He even went as far as to say that she was \\"graceful as an otter\\". Kelley gave Marilyn fifty dollars for the shoot and, despite its aggressive popularity, she never received any additional remuneration. Playboy Past The photos of Monroe also succeeded in building a relationship between Tom Kelley and Hugh Hefner. In 1953 Hefner was getting serious about introducing his new sexually charged magazine, Playboy. Featuring Kelley's now-classic photo of Marilyn Monroe on the cover of its very first issue significantly factored in Playboy's launch into popularity, selling over 50,000 copies. Continuing to partner with Hefner for future editions, Kelley always seemed to make his models more relaxed in order to obtain uniquely appealing and popular photos. One model, Neva Gilbert, Miss July 1954, remembered the experience in a 2016 Associated Press interview, again recalling how he would always bring his wife with him to the shoots. Kelley had her lay on a tiger rug with red painted nails for $20 an hour. Neva said of the photos, \\"I didn't think it was dirty. I felt they were in good taste. I thought nudes were lovely.\\" Legacy Tom Kelley Jr. attempted to auction off, not only his father's photographs of Marilyn Monroe, but also their intellectual property rights such that the buyer could remarket them in any way they so chose. Kelley Jr. set the price high, but when the bid only reached $840,000 he decided not to sell.

Early career According to some accounts, Vasily Yershov came from a family of serfs of Prince Mikhail Cherkassky. He began to progress up the career ladder owing to his notable work as a pribylshchik (lit. profit man), a person developing projects for increasing government revenues. In 1704-1709, Vasily Yershov headed the Office of Court Affairs (–ö–∞–Ω—Ü–µ–ª—è—Ä–∏—è –¥–≤–æ—Ä—Ü–æ–≤—ã—Ö –¥–µ–ª) and then Horse-and-Carriage Service. Some contemporary evidence suggests that, as head of these two government offices, Yershov managed to increase their total revenue by 90,000 rubles. Yershov as governor and vice governor On February 22, 1711, Vasily Yershov replaced Tikhon Streshnev as the governor of Moscow guberniya. In January 1712, however, he was transferred to the position of vice governor due to his \\"ignoble\\" ancestry (Mikhail Romodanovsky was appointed the governor of Moscow). Upon the death of his superior in January 1713, Vasily Yershov headed the gubernatorial office for half a year until the appointment of . Yershov was known for his cussedness, for which the senators would often threaten him with administrative punishment or prison. Also, he was in constant disagreement with Alexei Saltykov, who had been the Senate‚Äôs appointee. In 1714, the Senate even issued a special decree forbidding the vice governor to make certain decisions without the approval of his immediate superior. In 1715, Vasily Yershov publicly accused Alexei Saltykov of embezzlement, causing the latter‚Äôs removal from the office. Yershov kept his post upon the appointment of the new governor Kirill Naryshkin. Vasily Yershov is known to have elaborated numerous projects on increasing government revenues, cracking down on the escaping of army recruits, collecting arrears, eliminating extortion in state-run offices etc. Later life In 1721-1723, Vasily Yershov was in charge of the Monastery Prikaz. In 1727, he fell into disgrace as an associate of Alexander Menshikov, who had been arrested and then expelled from Moscow in the early fall of the same year. In 1729, Vasily Yershov took monastic vows in Pereyaslavl-Zalessky with the consent of Peter II.

It is located on the River Ribble, at Settle Weir near Bridge End Mill. It uses part of the former mill race. A screw turbine, which uses the principle of the Archimedean screw, generates 50 kW of electricity.  History  Settle weir was built across the Ribble to provide a head for the Bridge End Mill which occupies the same site. Bridge End Mill was built to mill corn, but was converted to spin cotton. Later it was fitted out to become a woodworking shop providing furniture for the local chapels out of imported cedar. Though the wheel still turns, it is not connected to any shafts, and the mill building has been converted to housing. Planning permission and the Abstraction Licence were granted in February 2009 and the share issue started in September 2008 raised the necessary capital at a cost of ¬£410,000. Lakeland Marine Construction began work in June 2009 and completed it in October with Settle Hydro Ltd generating electricity by November of the same year. Over the forty-year lifetime of the scheme that generates 165,000 kWh per annum, it is envisaged that 3,200 tonnes of carbon will be saved. Construction of the screw took place in Germany. Despite the installation of a fish ladder adjacent to the screw, there is a worry that the hydro plant has had an adverse effect on the salmon in the river. The fish numbers upstream of the screw have dropped since it was installed and it is believed that the noise from the screw is scaring the salmon. However, during periods of low flow water, the turbine automatically shuts down to maintain a constant flow of water through the fish pass.

Trafficking is officially defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons by means of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, or abuse of power of a position of vulnerability for the purpose of exploitation. Human trafficking is not synonymous with forced migration or smuggling. They span a wide age range from 1 to 18 years old. Sex trafficking victims up to roughly 25 years old most often started as young as 14. In the United States, human trafficking tends to occur around international travel-hubs with large immigrant populations, notably California, Texas and Georgia. The U.S. Justice Department estimates that 35,500‚Äì170,500 people enter illegally into the country every year. The 2016 Global Slavery Index estimates that including U.S. citizens and immigrants 57,700 people across the world are victims of human trafficking. Those being trafficked include young children, teenagers, men and women and can be domestic citizens or foreign nationals. Under federal law (18 USC ¬ß 1589), it is a crime to make people work by use of force, coercion or fear. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2017. On April 11, 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act into law, which is aimed at closing websites that enable the crime to occur, and prosecuting their owners and users.Trump signs ‚ÄòFOSTA‚Äô bill targeting online sex trafficking, enables states and victims to pursue websites The Washington Post, April 11, 2018  Reports  According to the Department of State 2011 Trafficking in Persons Report, the United States is a Tier 1 country for trafficking. Tier 1 means that the government is in compliance with the U.S. government's minimum standards of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 to eliminate trafficking. The minimum standards as listed in section 108 of the legislation are: > (1) The government of the country should prohibit severe forms of > trafficking in persons and punish acts of such trafficking. (2) For the > knowing commission of any act of sex trafficking involving force, fraud, > coercion, or in which the victim of sex trafficking is a child incapable of > giving meaningful consent, or of trafficking which includes rape or > kidnapping or which causes a death, the government of the country should > prescribe punishment commensurate with that for grave crimes, such as > forcible sexual assault. (3) For the knowing commission of any act of a > severe form of trafficking in persons, the government of the country should > prescribe punishment that is sufficiently stringent to deter and that > adequately reflects the heinous nature of the offense. (4) The government of > the country should make serious and sustained efforts to eliminate severe > forms of trafficking in persons. The U.S. is working to eliminate human trafficking in the U.S. and worldwide. Each year, the Department of State releases data compiled on the state of human trafficking in many different countries including the U.S. in accordance with the Trafficking Victim Protection Act of 2000's standards [see below]. It also releases data on trafficking cases under federal prosecution and estimates of those trafficked; however, the report also cautions that the data may not be representative of the number of individuals actually trafficked due to both the lack of cohesion between many states and agencies battling human trafficking and the inability to account for undiscovered victims. Below is a compilation of data from a variety of U.S. agencies and the United Nations. Attorney General According to the Attorney General's 2005 report, an estimated 14,500‚Äì17,500 victims are trafficked into the United States each year, although that figure may be overstated.  2011 Department of Justice report  The findings of the U.S. Department of Justice's 2011 report, \\"Characteristics of Suspected Human Trafficking Incidents, 2008-2010\\", include: # From 2008 to 2010, Federal anti-trafficking task forces opened 2,515 suspected cases of human trafficking. # 82% of suspected incidents were classified as sex trafficking and nearly half of these involved victims under the age of 18. # Approximately 10% of the incidents were classified as labor trafficking. # 83% of victims in confirmed sex-trafficking incidents were identified as U.S. citizens, while most confirmed labor-trafficking victims were identified as undocumented immigrants (67%) or legal immigrants (28%). # 25% of the confirmed victims received a \\"T visa,\\" part of a federal program designed to aid victims of trafficking. While the findings represent the government's best estimate, the authors caution that \\"the data described in this report reflect the information that was available to, and entered by, these state and local law enforcement agencies\\", and such data systems are still being established and are likely not recording all incidents.  2011 Department of State report  According to the Department of State, the U.S. was identified as a Tier 1 country with unspecified federal agencies charging 181 individuals with trafficking other humans and obtaining 141 convictions in 103 human trafficking prosecutions. Of the prosecutions reported by the Department of State, 32 were labor trafficking cases and 71 were sex trafficking cases.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  During 2009, ICE initiated 566 cases. These investigations led to 388 criminal arrests, more than double the number of arrests from the previous fiscal year, resulting in 148 indictments and 165 convictions.  Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center  The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center is an inter- agency intelligence center that gathers information on illicit travel‚Äîincluding that of trafficking. The center also coordinates with foreign agencies and diplomats to monitor and fight trafficking on an international basis. With the enactment of TVPRA 2008, the HSTC was also charged with the responsibility of compiling a comprehensive inter-agency database on persons identified as victims of human trafficking.  Prevalence   Geographic distribution of forced laborers  According to the 2011 Department of State report, victims are largely from Thailand, India, Mexico, Philippines, Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic, though U.S. citizens have also been victims of human trafficking. Relevant to people being trafficked from other countries, are increasingly found in visa programs for legally documented students and temporary workers who typically fill labor needs in the hospitality, landscaping, construction, food service, and agricultural industries.\\" Human trafficking occurred consistently in high-population areas that serve as hubs for international travel and that have large immigrant populations. In the study, higher numbers of reported cases were found in California, New York, Texas, and Florida. This is consistent with the U.S. Department of Justice report that the largest concentrations of survivors of human trafficking were located in California, Oklahoma, New York, and Texas.  Criticism  In a 2007 Washington Post expose entitled \\"Human Trafficking Evokes Outrage, Little Evidence\\", human trafficking into the United States is described as essentially nonexistent. However, there are more victims than those who have applied for and been granted certification. First, certification requires that the victim be willing to cooperate with a police investigation. Following a police raid, some victims just want to go home, some victims don't want to cooperate with police and are deported, and some victims are afraid to testify against vicious traffickers. The application for certification requires support from law enforcement. If the victim is not seen as useful for a case, or if the police don't want to pursue a case, they have no support to stay in the U.S. and will not be counted as victims of trafficking. Nevertheless, the number of identified victims (or convicted traffickers) is far less than the official estimate (by the U.S. State Department) that as many 14,500‚Äì17,500 individuals are trafficked into the United States every year. A recent analysis by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics showed a gap between the claimed number of victims and the number of confirmed cases of victimization.Duren Banks and Tracey Kyckelhahn. Characteristics of Suspected Human Trafficking Incidents, 2008‚Äì2010. Washington, DC: BJS, 2011 A gap between the alleged number of victims and the number of confirmed cases also characterizes the situation worldwide. The U.S. Department of State recently reported that 0.4 percent of the estimated victims of trafficking internationally had been officially identified.U.S. Department of State, Trafficking in Persons Report, 2010 The State Department report provided no source for the number of either estimated or identified victims. Some critics, like Markon in the Washington Post, note that all such estimates are deeply flawed.Ronald Weitzer, \\"Sex Trafficking and the Sex Industry: The Need for Evidence-Based Theory and Legislation\\", Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 101, 4 (Fall 2011): pages 1337-1370  Types  Research conducted by University of California at Berkeley on behalf of the anti-trafficking organization Free the Slaves found that about 46% of people in slavery in the United States are forced into prostitution. The U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted 360 defendants for human trafficking from 2001 to 2007 and gained 238 convictions. From January 2007 through September 2008, there were 1,229 alleged cases of human trafficking nationally; 1,018 of them, nearly 83 percent, were sex trafficking cases. Sex trafficking has a close relationship with migrant smuggling operations headed by Mexican, Eastern European, and Asian crime organizations. Domestic servitude claims 27% of people in slavery in the U.S., agriculture 10%, and other occupations 17%.  Sex trafficking  Louise Slaughter testifies at a Ways & Means Human Resources Subcommittee hearing on October 23, 2013. Louise testified in strong support of a bill she has co-sponsored with Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-MN) that address the high rate of children in foster care being recruited into sex trafficking within the United States. (10445204615) The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services estimated that between 240,000 and 325,000 children are at risk for sexual exploitation each year. Children who are considered runaways are at particular risk of prostitution or of being trafficked into the sex industry. Of the 1,682,900 children who were considered runaways for a period of time in 1999, 71% were considered at risk for prostitution. 1,700 of those reported actually engaging in sexual activity in exchange for money. David Finkelhor, a University of New Hampshire professor who is director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center, said \\"I wouldn't put any stock in these figures as indicators of what is going on today\\". According to the United States Department of State an estimated 20,000 women and children are trafficked into the United States each year by crossing the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border.  Commercial sexual exploitation of children  In 2003, 1,400 minors were arrested for prostitution, 14% of whom were younger than 14 years old. A study conducted by the International Labor Union indicated that boys are at a higher risk of being trafficked into agricultural work, the drug trade, and petty crime. Girls were at a higher risk of being forced into the sex industry and domestic work. In 2004, the Department of Labor found 1,087 minors employed in situations that violated hazardous occupation standards. The same year, 5,480 children were employed violating child labor laws. Due to the secretive nature of trafficking, it is difficult to piece together an accurate picture of how widespread the problem is. In 2001, the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Work released a study on CSEC conducted in 17 cities across the United States. While they did not interview any of the adolescent subjects of the inquiry, they estimated through secondary response that as many as 300,000 American youth may be at risk of commercial sexual exploitation at any time. The Center for Court Innovation in New York City had used Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS), Social Network Analysis, capture/recapture, and Markov based probability estimates in 2008 to generate a prevalence estimate for New York City alone and found that there were approximately 3800 children that were identified as commercial sexual exploitation victims. Researchers said this was an underestimate of the actual number as isolated sub-groups outside their sampling methodology exist and could not be estimated.Curtis,R., Terry, K., Dank, M., Dombrowski, K., Khan, B., Muslim, A., Labriola, M. and Rempel, M. The Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in New York City: Volume One: The CSEC Population in New York City: Size, Characteristics, and Needs . National Institute of Justice, United States Department of Justice. September 2008. An article by the Village Voice that reviewed arrest records in 37 large US cities over 10 years found only 827 cases a year had been reported to police departments. Especially vulnerable are homeless and runaways. The National Runaway Switchboard said in 2009 that one-third of runaway youths in America will be lured into prostitution within 48 hours on the streets.Washington DC: A Sexual Playground for Pimps and Johns: Exposing child prostitution rings in DC, by Aisha Ali, Examiner.com Mar. 17, 2009; retrieved 12/27/2014 This view of adolescent prostitution in the United States as primarily driven by pimp-exploiters and other \\"sex traffickers\\" was challenged by SNRG-NYC in their 2008 New York City study which interviewed over 300 under-age prostitutes and found that only 10% reported having pimps. A 2012 study done in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by the same group incorporated an extended qualitative ethnographic component that looked specifically at the relationship between pimps and adolescents engaged with street based sex markets.Marcus, A. Riggs, R. et al, \\"Is Child to Adult as Victim is to Criminal? Social Policy and Street Based Sex Work in the USA\\" in Sexuality Research and Social Policy This study found the percentage of adolescents who had pimps to be only 14% and that those relationships were typically misidentified by youth as mutual, and non-exploitative.Marcus, Anthony, et al. \\"Conflict and Agency among Sex Workers and Pimps: A Closer Look at Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking\\". The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science May 2014 vol. 653 no. 1 225-246. . Various trauma responds, including trauma bonds, normalization and lack of information on the issue leaves only 1/3 of victims identifying their experience as commercial sexual exploitation. The New York State Office of Children and Family Services estimated in 2007 that New York City is home to more than 2,000 sexually exploited children under 18. At least 85 percent of these youths statewide have had some contact with the child welfare system, mostly through abuse or neglect proceedings. In New York City, 75 percent have been in foster care. Mishi Faruqee, who is in charge of juvenile justice issues for the Correctional Association of New York, questioned the reliability of the estimate. \\"We believe that number is really an undercount.\\" This is confirmed by SNRG-NYC's New York City population estimate of 2008 which was 3,946.  Super Bowls  Exterior of MetLife Stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII Law authorities have led sting operations in connection with Super Bowl games. During the Super Bowl XLVIII, authorities arrested 45 pimps and rescued 25 child victims of human trafficking. During Super Bowl XLIX, authorities led a sting operation called National Day of Johns and arrested almost 600 people and rescued 68 victims.  Labor trafficking  According to the National Human Rights Center in Berkeley, California, there are currently about 10,000 forced laborers in the U.S., around one-third of whom are domestic servants and some portion of whom are children. In reality, this number could be far higher due to the difficulty in getting exact numbers of victims, due to the secretive nature of human trafficking. The U.S. government only keeps a count of survivors, defined as victims of severe instances of human trafficking, who have been assisted by the government in acquiring immigration benefits. Research at San Diego State University estimates that there are 2.4 million victims of human trafficking among illegal Mexican immigrants.Looking for a Hidden Population: Trafficking of Migrant Laborers in San Diego County Research by the Urban Institute says that law enforcement agencies do not prioritize labor trafficking cases, were reluctant to help victims obtain authorization to legally remain in the United States, and felt there was not enough evidence to corroborate victim statements. In 2014, the National Human Trafficking Resource Center reported 990 cases of forced labor trafficking in the US, including 172 which also involved sex trafficking. The most common types of labor trafficking included domestic work, traveling sales crews, agriculture/farms, restaurant/food service, health & beauty services, begging, retail, landscaping, hospitality, construction, carnivals, elder care, forestry, manufacturing, and housekeeping.  Domestic labor  Domestic servitude is the forced employment of someone as a maid or nanny, and victims are often migrant women who come from low-wage communities in their home countries.Srikantiah, Jayashri. \\"Perfect Victims and Real Survivors: The Iconic Victim in Domestic Human Trafficking Law.\\" Boston University Law Review 87, no. 157 (2007): 157-211. Domestic workers perform duties such as cleaning, cooking and childcare in their employers home. Domestic workers are commonly US citizens, undocumented workers or foreign nationals most commonly holding one of the following visa types: A-3, G-5,NATO-7 or B-1 The most common victims of this type of trafficking are women. Similar means of control to Agricultural Work are common. Additionally, a lack of legislation regarding the duties and protection of these workers facilitates their exploitation. Employers commonly use the workers lack of knowledge of the language or legal system as a means of control and intimidation. This is also commonly paired with various forms of abuse and/or passport revocation. Many domestic workers are brought to the United States on a promise of a better life or an education.Women's Rights. (n.d.).

Perpetrators of domestic servitude are often well-respected members of their communities and lead otherwise normal lives. Areas with large middle-class and upper-middle-class populations are commonly the destinations of this type of trafficking. The Associated Press reports, based on interviews in California and Egypt, that trafficking of children for domestic labor in the U.S. includes an extension of an illegal but common practice in Africa. Families in remote villages send their daughters to work in cities for extra money and the opportunity to escape a dead-end life. Some girls work for free on the understanding that they at least will be better fed in the home of their employer. This custom has led to the spread of trafficking, as well-to- do Africans accustomed to employing children immigrate into the U.S.Callimachi, Rukmini. Child maid trafficking spreads from Africa to US, Associated Press, December 28, 2008. Legally employed domestic workers are distinct from illegally employed domestic servants. While legally employed domestic house workers are fairly compensated for their work in accordance with national wage laws, domestic servants are typically forced to work extremely long hours for little to no monetary compensation, and psychological and physical means are employed to limit their mobility and freedom. In addition, deportation threats are often used to discourage internationally trafficked persons from seeking help.  Traveling sales crew  Traveling sales crews have the highest rate of calls to human trafficking hotlines after domestic labor (counting from January 2008 to February 2015). The mobile nature makes it easier for traffickers to control their victims' sleeping arrangements and food and to alienate them from outside contact. Traffickers may withhold food or threaten to abandon their victims in unfamiliar locations without money if they do not comply. Unlike other professions, members of traveling sales crews are considered independent contractors even if they do not have any autonomy in their life outside of work. As independent contractors, they are not overseen by several laws meant to prevent abuse, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Victims often incur debt from their traffickers, and enter into a form of debt slavery. Wisconsin state senator Jon Erpenbach, author of Malinda's Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act Malinda's Traveling Sales Crew Protection ActMalinda's Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act Pounded By Out-Of-State Company is a Wisconsin law that gives traveling sales crew members similar employment rights as part-time workers in Wisconsin are currently guaranteed by state law. It also requires all crews to register with the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection before going door to door in state communities. By registering members of the crew, alerts for members with outstanding warrants in other states can be identified and criminals detained. It is the only law in the United States that regulates traveling sales crews. Wisconsin governor James E. Doyle says the intent of the law is to \\"stop companies from putting workers in dangerous and unfair conditions\\". The bill was passed in a form that applies only to sales workers who travel in groups of two or more. It was authored by Jon Erpenbach.official WI Senate website Southwestern Advantage lobbied against the bill, arguing that their independent contractor business model nurtured the entrepreneurial spirit. During the hearings, former Southwestern student dealers testified on both sides of the issue.Bill To Regulate Traveling Sales Crews Considered At Capitol Agriculture In the agriculture sector, the most common victims of trafficking are U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, undocumented immigrants, and foreign nationals with temporary H-2A visas. H-2A visa is a certification program, which is the employers contracting people from other countries, but first the employers must try to recruit U.S. workers, before looking abroad. In attempts towards seeking employees, once they are hired they may encounter some difficulties such as: # May not be able to join a union or face legal challenges # Requirements that farmers may not meet because of the program H-2A visas are temporary visas that allow people from other countries to work in the United States, with some benefits contractors need to provide to them. Examples include, \\"farmers are required to these workers with housing and pay for transportation to the job, pay them at least three-quarters of the season at a higher rate, than the average paid rate of that work\\". Yet, the circumstances of the law states for free housing, \\"prevailing practice in the area and occupation of intended employment\\". Farmers who are working and have families are not guaranteed housing situations. Farm workers being controlled greatly, their lives are vulnerable in fears that they may be deported back to their homeland. Due to the nature of agricultural work as being seasonal and transient, the ability of employers to exploit these workers is high. Such exploitation may take the form of threats of violence and playing on vulnerabilities (i.e. immigration status). In some cases, workers are held in a state of perpetual debt to the crew leaders who impose mandatory transportation, housing and communication fees upon the workers which are high in relation to pay received, therefore further indebting the worker. Crew leaders may also provide workers with H-2A visas and transportation to the place of work from a home country. Part of the H-2A visa, is that it does not provide an adequate choosing of their employment, how much would they be paid for their work, or even the hours, are not negotiable. Undocumented people who come without any visas, have a greater chance of choosing of where they wish to work and decide to leave the employment if they wish and have a better chance of not being exploited. In 2010, the company Global Horizons was indicted on charges of trafficking over 200 Thai workers. With the program, bonded labor, it was guaranteed that the workers were going to receive a visa that would allow them to live and work in the United States. Upon arrival, the company made a false statement to lure the workers and having a higher recruitment. The fees that were imposed to the farm workers were so high that the debt was impossible to pay with the employment they were given. Many were living in poor housing conditions (up to a dozen living per home), threats, and physical assaults.  Human trafficking among Latin Americans  According to Polaris hotline statistics, people from Latin America makes up almost one third of the population of victims of human traffic in the United States.https://polarisproject.org/sites/default/files/Polaris-Typology-of- Modern-Slavery.pdf Most victims are from Mexico, Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic. Nearly 29 percent of victims enter the US through the Mexico-United States border by human smuggling while majority come with work visas.  Vulnerabilities and recruitment  There are some circumstances or vulnerabilities that have led some Latin Americans to a higher susceptibility to victimization and human trafficking. The relationship between \\"push\\" factors that result in poverty (i.e. unemployment, natural disasters, drug abuse, etc.) and \\"pull\\" factors (i.e. risky job opportunities, deceitful romantic relationships, the American dream that is fueled by mass media, etc.) encourages Latin Americans to accept risky job proposition in the US. Once the victims fall for deceitful labor recruiters, traffickers exploit vulnerabilities to keep victims under their control such as language barrier and illiteracy, fear of deportation due to lack of documentation, isolation from family, friends, and the public, unfamiliarity with surroundings and with the laws, indebtedness, drug dependence, and physical and psychological abuse. Deportation can often leave trafficked victims at the mercy of their traffickers once again or it may cause harm to their families through either punishment by the traffickers or a loss of remittances that the traffickers had been sending to the family. Furthermore, when natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes strike Latin American countries, traffickers often capitalize on impoverished families who can't afford to support their kids. In 2013, three years after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake devastated Haiti, the United States government estimated that between 150,000 and 500,000 children in Haiti were involved in domestic servitude.  Coyotaje  With the increase in U.S. border security, undocumented Latino immigrants have increasingly turned to smugglers to lead them through Mexico and across the U.S.-Mexican border. The colloquial term coyotaje refers to human smuggling along the Mexico-United States border. The term used to imply that the relationship between the smuggler and the migrant ended once they arrived in the US.Chacon, Jennifer. \\"Misery and Mypoia: Understanding the Failures of U.S. Efforts to Stop Human Trafficking.\\" Fordham Law Review 74, no. 6 (2006): 2977-3040. However, it has become increasingly commonplace for coyotes to coerce migrants into exploitative labor arrangements upon reaching their destination in the U.S. (frequently a different one from that which they paid to be smuggled to). These smuggling routes have become more dangerous and therefore costlier, making some smugglers sell undocumented migrants into situations of forced labor or prostitution to recover their costs. Illegal immigrants transiting Mexico often fail to report abuses committed against them by criminals or officials in their home countries or along their journey because of fears of deportation. Unaccompanied minors are sometimes sold into prostitution by the trafficker, and their families are falsely led to believe that they died during transit.  Labor trafficking   Agriculture  According to cases reported to Polaris-operated hotlines, survivors of this type of labor trafficking are disproportionately Latino male migrant workers, mostly from Mexico and Central America, on seasonal H-2A visas. Despite the H-2A program requirement that employers supply workers with suitable housing, traffickers have also been known to subject victims to squalid living conditions, often denying them even necessities such as beds and indoor toilets. This type of labor trafficking occurs in places from orange orchards to corn fields, but some crops such as tobacco require much more intensive labor to harvest, making them more susceptible to forced labor or exploitation. By far the most common method of control in agriculture, as in many other types, is economic abuse, including wage theft, improper deductions, and payment at piece rates rather than hourly rates.  Restaurants  Data from Polaris has indicated that foreign national men and women from Mexico and Central America tend to be equally victimized. Victims can be confined at the restaurant around the clock or be isolated in a nearby home provided by the traffickers.  Domestic workers  Having a legal work visa is not necessarily a protection against abuse; the Urban Institute estimated 82% of cases of domestic worker trafficking it reviewed had come to the US on legal visas. Labor trafficking victims in domestic work commonly work 12‚Äì18 hours a day (some as much as 24/7) for little to no pay. They may experience extreme isolation and confinement from the outside world, sexual harassment, high levels of monitoring, debt bondage, extreme wage theft, confiscation of critical documents such as passports, and restricted access to food and medical care.  Construction  Most of labor trafficking survivors in construction are men from Mexico and the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala), most of whom have H-2B visas or are undocumented. Workers can enter their exploitative situations through formal job offers and misrepresented visa contracts. In some cases, workers may be charged illegal and exorbitant recruitment fees, which may be a method of control to keep workers in abusive situations. Recruitment may also begin through an abusive migration journey or through word-of-mouth referrals.  Sex trafficking  Most of the victims that suffer from sex trafficking come from Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean and only 11% come from the United States. Severe brutality and abuse are the tactics used to control the victims, over half whom are minors. 96% of the potential victims are female from either Mexico or Central America and 63% of the victims are minors because the traffickers in the cantinas are eager to target young girls.  Bars and cantinas  Woman and girls of ages 14‚Äì29 from the area demographics of Mexico and Central America are often victimized by bars and cantinas. The Latina woman and girls who are targeted by traffickers lack economic means, English fluency and legal status which makes the process easier for traffickers to manipulate them.  Escort services  Latin American women and girls that are smuggled into the United States are also often exposed to the world of commercial sex trade better known as \\"escort services\\". There are two ways in which the operation can proceed: one is described as \\"outcall\\", where the traffickers deliver victims to the buyer's hotel room or their homes. The second option is \\"incall\\" which is when the customers cycle in and out of a hotel room while the trafficker extends the victims' stay. Many of these interactions between the buyers, the traffickers and victims took place on the website backpage.com where Latinas had their own category. The website has been closed since January 2017.  Latino brothels  Brothels catering exclusively to Latino males, referred to as \\"Latino Residential Brothels\\", are a major vehicle for sex trafficking, with the victims being almost exclusively women and children from Latin America. Trafficking of U.S. citizens within the U.S. occurs as well. They typically own informal underground businesses in urban, suburban, and rural areas.  Structural factors   Poverty  Poverty can lead to increased trafficking in many different ways. Poverty affects the notion of individual choice and often drives families to make decisions out of desperation and lack of education. Poverty, in some countries, may influence parents to send their children to work in another urban country with a more stable economy, such as the U.S., without the knowledge that the child is then forced into slave labor or prostitution. Furthermore, once this kidnapping and trafficking of the child occurs, the victim often accepts their situation and limits efforts to escape their imprisonment. Oftentimes, they wind up alone in a country where they do not speak the language, making it difficult to seek aid. In addition, victims often accept their positions because they feel that this is the only way that they may send some remittances to their family and their enslaved situations may in some cases still be better than their original impoverished and desperate state.  Globalization  The rate of human trafficking has directly increased in correlation with globalization. Globalization has increased cross-border trade and the demand for cheap labor; however, migration policies of the U.S. and other countries have not changed with the level of demand for cheap labor, thus forcing people illegally to immigrate. Illegal immigration then creates ideal conditions for organized criminal operations to form trafficking circles. With increased trade of foreign goods to rural areas, import competition in the rural markets has also forced people in poor areas to migrate to industrialized economies for better livelihoods. Their desperate positions often make them subject to exploitation and trafficking into different forms of forced labor to support that economy. Lastly, the technological advances that go hand in hand with globalization have facilitated the ease with which organized crime circles may conduct trafficking operations.  Prostitution  Some feminists, such as Carole Pateman, believe that exploitation is in both prostitution and sex trafficking. They believe that even if the women agreed to be a sex worker in a foreign country that the worker was still trafficked because of the preceding conditions that lead her to believe that sex work was the only viable work option. Other feminists such as Kamala Kempadoo, on the other hand, believe that prostitution is a form of labor just like any other migrant labor; however, due to the criminalization of prostitution, prostitutes are then subject to coercion and exploitation and subsequent trafficking. In the US, each year 80,000 women are arrested for prostitution. Current debates about modifications to Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 policy are based about these two arguments. In providing aid for victims of sex trafficking the government must take a stand on whether or not they believe the sex industry and sex trafficking are inherently linked. These people involved in prostitution have an 80% higher chance of sexually transmitted infections and many are never able to afford to seek treatment. This results in serious infections, lifelong diseases, and sometimes even death.  Fear of government corruption  Even though the U.S. offers protection for trafficking victims, few victims seek the government's aid due to fear of corruption, fear of deportation, or fear of reprisals with their family. Victims of trafficking may be citizens of countries with corrupt governments that actually aid trafficking. Where victims' home countries lack reliable police systems, trafficking victims are hesitant to reach out to the law for aid. Jessa Dillow Crisp was one of many victims of human trafficking, who had encountered the police in her town to be corruptive and involved in the trafficking.  Anti-trafficking laws and policies  Laws against trafficking exist at the federal and community levels. Over half of the states now criminalize human trafficking, though the penalties are not as tough as under the federal laws. Related federal and state efforts focus on regulating the tourism industry to prevent the facilitation of sex tourism and regulate international marriage brokers to ensure criminal background checks and information on how to get help are given to the potential brides.  Policy of the federal government  The federal government has taken a firm stance against human trafficking both within its borders and beyond. Domestically, human trafficking is a federal crime under Title 18 of the United States Code. Section 1584 makes it a crime to force a person to work against her or his will, or to sell a person into a condition of involuntary servitude. Section 1581 similarly makes it illegal to force a person to work through \\"debt servitude\\". Human trafficking as it relates to involuntary servitude and slavery is prohibited by the 13th Amendment. Federal laws on human trafficking are enforced by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Marshal Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and Criminal Section, and other federal agencies.  Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act  The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 allowed for greater statutory maximum sentences for traffickers, provided resources for protection of and assistance for victims of trafficking, and created avenues for interagency cooperation. It also allows many trafficking victims to remain in the U.S. and apply for permanent residency under a T-1 Visa.DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ISSUES T VISA TO PROTECT WOMEN, CHILDREN AND ALL VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING, U.S. Department of Justice, January 24, 2002 Previously, trafficked individuals who were often in the country illegally were treated as criminals. According to the section on Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons, the definition extends to include any \\"commercial sex act ... in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age\\".U.S. Department of State. This means that any minor engaged in prostitution is a victim of human trafficking, regardless of citizenship or whether or not movement has taken place.National Report on Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking, Shared Hope International, 2009, pg 5 (PDF) The law defines trafficking as \\"the prohibition against any individual who provides or obtains labor or services for peonage, slavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor.\\" The law distinguishes trafficking, where victims are coerced into entering the U.S., from smuggling, where migrants enter the country without authorization. The act also attempted to encourage efforts to prevent human trafficking internationally, by creating annual country reports on trafficking and tying financial non-humanitarian assistance to foreign countries to real efforts in addressing human trafficking. The benefits of the law, however, are dependent on the survivor's cooperation with prosecuting the perpetrators. This can be complicated if the victim fears retribution from their trafficker or has a fear of authority that remains from their country of origin. The original TVPA of 2000 has been reauthorized three times, the most recent being the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. These reauthorizations have clarified definitions of trafficking and forced labor in order both to aid in prosecution of traffickers and to aid the victims of trafficking. The reauthorization versions have also required the federal government to terminate all contracts with overseas contractors involved in human trafficking or forced labor. Extraterritoriality jurisdiction was also extended to cover all U.S. nationals and permanent residents who are living overseas. In \\"October 2000, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) (Public Law 106-386) was enacted. Prior to that, no comprehensive Federal law existed to protect victims of trafficking or to prosecute their traffickers\\". In 2003, the Bush Administration authorized more than $200 million to combat human trafficking through the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 (TVPRA). TVPRA renews the U.S. government's commitment to identify and assist victims exploited through labor and sex trafficking in the U.S. The U.S. has also set up programs to help those who have been victims. The government can help victims, once identified, by stabilizing their immigrant status. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) enables victims who are non-U.S. citizens to receive federally funded benefits and services to the same extent as a refugee; as well, U.S. citizens who are victims are eligible for many benefits.  Human trafficking hotline  The federal government has set up a National Human Trafficking Resource Center Hotline (1-888-373-7888). The hotline answers questions and responds to crises in up to 170 languages. and provides materials in over 20 languages. Since 2007, the hotline has received over 60,000 calls. Callers include victims of human trafficking seeking services, as well as individuals and organizations seeking information about human trafficking. Twenty-five states have mandated certain types of businesses to post a hotline. Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Tennessee have their own hotline while the others use the national hotline.  Safe Harbor laws  Safe Harbor laws protect victims of human trafficking from legal prosecution of crimes committed while under the influence of the trafficker and provide services such as counseling and housing and protect them from their exploiters. Victims of trafficking are protected under federal law, but may still be charged under state law. The federal Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2013 is a law that encourages states to pass safe harbor laws. It elevated the status of the National Human Trafficking Hotline and opened up the Job Corps program to sex trafficking victims.  Pressure from human rights groups  International NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have called on the U.S. to improve its measures aimed at reducing trafficking. They recommend that the U.S. more fully implement the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children and for immigration officers to improve their awareness of trafficking and support the victims of trafficking. Health professionals Doctors and health professionals are asked to look out for possible victims of human trafficking as most get to health care services at some time. Health care services have the chance to rescue them.  National opposition organizations  * Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women (GAATW): influences shaping of U.S. policy against trafficking. Distinguishes between prostitution and sex trafficking. * Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW): influences shaping of U.S. policy against trafficking. Does not acknowledge a difference between prostitution and sex trafficking. * The Trafficking Education Network focuses on educating and training people so they are better equipped to respond to human trafficking. * Worthwhile Wear is an international organization that provides an escape for those forced into prostitution or human trafficking. Overseas, survivors are provided vocational training and employment where they can learn to make items such as clothing, bags, and jewelry, and earn up to 5 times more than their counterparts. This provides the women with a way to stay out of forced prostitution. In the US, Worthwhile Wear operates a program called, The Well, offering long-term housing (up to 2 years), restorative services and employment to women, 18 years and older, who have been affected by human trafficking.  As a moral panic  A number of authorities and critics of contemporary anti-prostitution activism have pointed out that the hysteria over human trafficking as conflated with voluntary adult prostitution has all the hallmarks of a moral panic, and indeed closely resembles the white slavery hysteria at the beginning of the 20th century. As is typical in such panics, broad claims are made with insufficient factual support, \\"horror stories\\" of victims take the place of research, and legislators rush to enact dangerously broad and vague legislation which infringes on civil rights. Anthropologist Laura Agust√≠n has written at great length about the way voluntary migration is purposefully conflated with involuntary trafficking, and how anti-trafficking laws tend to assume any foreign or underage prostitute is a \\"trafficking victim\\" even if she denies it. In a similar vein, ethnographers studying U.S.-born adolescents involved in street-based sex markets have argued that the relationships that these adolescents have with the adults in their lives who help facilitate their market activity typically have a far greater mutuality and equality than is understood by policy-makers, social service providers, and not-for-profit advocates who embrace the human trafficking model. Such critiques of this narrative have generally been dismissed by activists as evidence of Stockholm syndrome, thus denying the prostitute agency and treating her as mentally ill.   Ethnographers concerned with the validity of activists' impressions studied a federal anti-trafficking task force in a city that had been identified as a hub for domestic minor sex trafficking. In comparing local sex markets with the understandings of local social service providers, law enforcement officials, and anti-trafficking activists participating in the task force they found that many of the claims of widespread trafficking activity were either exaggerations or misinterpretations of anecdotal evidence; thus calling into question activists' ability to understand the context of what they were seeing.

The practice was since made illegal and is considered a form of labor trafficking.  Documentaries  * The Men of Atalissa is a documentary film by POV.org and The New York Times about 32 intellectually challenged people who were employed by Texas-based Henry's Turkey Service without proper compensation, and were abused physically and mentally, living in harsh conditions, at Atalissa, Iowa, for more than 30 years beginning in the 1970s. The men, paid a wage of $65 a month and sheltered in an old uphill schoolhouse, were used for meat processing. Their conditions were made public in 2009, leading to a $240 million jury verdict, subsequently reduced to $50,000 per person. The documentary is based on court records and internal documents of the company and features first-time interviews with seven of the victims. * I am Jane Doe is a documentary chronicling the legal battle that several American mothers are waging on behalf of their middle-school daughters, who were trafficked for commercial sex on Backpage.com, the classified advertising website formerly owned by the Village Voice. The film is narrated by Jessica Chastain, directed by filmmaker Mary Mazzio, and produced by Mazzio along with Alec Sokolow. *California's Forgotten Children is a feature documentary that follows a diverse group of resilient survivors of child sex trafficking who are now courageous leaders fighting for the rights of victims worldwide. The film supports the stories of survivors with current statistics and perspectives of sexual exploitation from professionals in social services, law enforcement, advocates, and child welfare. It focuses on those who were wrongfully criminalized in the judicial system; manipulated and coerced by family, friends, and caretakers; and exploited by multiple slavery industries.  Policy of state governments  Several state governments have taken action to address human trafficking within their borders, through either legislation or prevention activities. For example, Florida state law prohibits forced labor, sex trafficking, and domestic servitude and provides for mandatory law enforcement training and victim services. A 2006 Connecticut law prohibits coerced work and makes trafficking a violation of the Connecticut RICO Act. Washington State was the first to pass a law criminalizing human trafficking in 2003.  Arizona  According to the U.S. State Department, Arizona is a main destination and transit point for labor and sex trafficking, both nationally and internationally. Some contributing factors include its proximity to Mexico, San Diego and Las Vegas, its warm weather, its network of freeways, and that it is a major conference destination, and home to many professional sporting events.Gallagher, J., Roe- Sepowitz, D.

Organizations  * The Underage Sex-Trafficking Coalition was formed in 2011 by the Arizona Attorney General. It seeks to raise public awareness, educate the community and advocate to strengthen laws about human trafficking. It began the Arizona's Not Buying It Campaign, in partnership with Shared Hope International, to fight child sex trafficking.Arizona's not buying it *Arizona League to End Regional Trafficking (ALERT) is a coalition representing partnerships with law enforcement, faith-based communities, non- profit organizations, social service agencies, attorneys and concerned citizens.

California  California is particularly vulnerable because of \\"proximity to international borders, number of ports and airports, significant immigrant population, and large economy that includes industries that attract forced labor.\\" It serves both as an entry point for slaves imported from outside the US as well as a destination for slaves. Slavery is found throughout California, but major hubs are centered around Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco. In 2011, California enacted a new law called the \\"Transparency in Supply Chains Act\\". The law requires certain retailers to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains. The law went into effect January 1, 2012, and it applies to any company that is in the \\"retail trade\\" that has annual worldwide gross receipts in excess of $100 million and annual California sales exceeding $500,000. Organizations * The Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking: works to assist persons trafficked for the purpose of forced labor and slavery-like practices and to work toward ending all instances of such human rights violations. * The Thai Community Development Center's Slavery Eradication and Rights Initiative works to raise awareness of human trafficking and provide survivor support  Florida  Florida Coalition Against Human Trafficking: based in Clearwater, Florida. FCAHT's founder, Anna Rodriguez, had her first experience with a human trafficking case in 1999; U.S. vs. Tecum. Rodriguez served as a victim advocate with the Collier County Sheriff's Office and an outreach coordinator for the Immokalee Shelter for Abused Women in Collier County, Florida, for 10 years. Her first human trafficking case developed from a \\"home visitation\\", in which she was following up on a domestic violence incident. She noticed the presence of a young female who turned out to be a victim of human trafficking. Rodriguez identified \\"red flags\\" that made her suspicious and eventually she helped get the victim out. Today the Tecum case has become a major case study by agencies including USDOJ, FSU, Croft Institute for International and New York Times. The Tecum case was one of the cases used to urge US Congress in passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. The mission of FCAHT is to improve and provide outreach and services to victims of human trafficking throughout Florida by developing support programs, networking, coalition building, training, service delivery, and referrals to victims in need. FCAHT works closely with community service providers to provide victims with emergency food and shelter, medical and psychological treatment and other services as needed to help these individuals restore their lives and their freedoms. FCAHT provides training to law enforcement agencies, medical facilities, faith based, civil and community organizations to bring awareness and recognition to the signs and symptoms of human trafficking. FCAHT also works very closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and state and local law enforcement agencies in Florida as well providing guidance to law enforcement nationwide and Internationally. FCAHT also works hand in hand with government officials, victim service providers, faith-based groups and civic groups throughout Florida, the nation and overseas. FCAHT has assisted in the coordination of funded/unfunded human trafficking task forces throughout Florida and across the nation as well. FCAHT has also assisted in the creation of new human trafficking laws within Florida as well as overseas. # Florida Abolitionist: based in Orlando  Georgia  State policy: Georgia law OCGA 16-5-46 prohibits the trafficking of persons for labor or sexual servitude with a more severe penalty for trafficking minors. Other related laws: On April 2, 2015, a new law passed called the SB8 and SR7. Under this law convicted traffickers will register as sex offenders and pay into a state fund called New Safe Harbor to help victims of sex trafficking with physical, mental health, education, job training and legal help. HB 200 law went into effect on July 1, 2011. The law is harsher when it involves minors and can be up to a twenty-year prison sentence and a $100,000 fine. Another major step is that the age of consent, which is sixteen, or lack of knowledge of the victim's age is no longer a valid defense. Major issues: Atlanta is now a major transportation hub when it comes to trafficking young girls from Mexico and is one of the fourteen U.S. cities with the highest levels of sex trafficking of children. In 2007 the sex trade generated $290 million in Atlanta. Craigslist is a major medium for the advertisement for sex and the site is known to get three hits per day. Since Atlanta has \\"the same ready access to commercial air and ground routes that draws businesses and travelers to Atlanta also entices criminals engaged in human trafficking\\". There are numerous events and conventions in Atlanta that bring many people to the city which also exemplifies the issue. Organizations: Out Of Darkness is an organization that is against sex trafficking which is located in Atlanta Georgia; Out of Darkness falls under the section 501(c) (3). Their \\"mission is to reach, rescue and restore all victims of commercial sexual exploitation, that the glory of God may be known.\\" _BeLoved Atlanta_ Atlanta is an organization that focuses on the \\"community of women who have survived trafficking, prostitution and addiction\\". BeLoved Atlanta will provide a residential home to adult women who were personally affected by sexual exploitation, they are able to provide their services to residents for up to two years. _End It_ \\"is a coalition of leading organization in the world to fight for freedom\\". There mission is to shine a light on all forms of slavery. End it \\"Partners are doing the work, on the ground, every day, to bring AWARENESS, PREVENTION, RESCUE, and RESTORATION.\\" _Not for sale_ is about protecting individuals from modern day slavery and human trafficking. Not for sale started out in San Francisco however is located in 15 other states. They provide safety, job-training, and life skills, along with many other outlets.  Michigan  In 2006, Governor Jennifer Granholm signed House Bill 5747 (introduced by Rep. Phil Pavlov (R)) which specifically outlawed human trafficking in Michigan. The relevant state statutes are sections 750.462a to 750.462i. Effective April 1, 2011, an additional statute, 750.462j was enacted, which set grounds for further prosecution in human trafficking cases.  Nevada  In 2013, Nevada passed Assembly Bill 67, which uses the federal definition of sex trafficking and increases penalties by one level. It makes victims eligible for state assistance and allows them to sue their traffickers. Sex traffickers will have to register as a sex offender, and their assets will be seized to pay for victim services.  Legal brothels  Prostitution of adults is legal in 11 rural counties in Nevada.

Another former prostitute who worked in four Nevada brothels attacked the system, saying, \\"Under this system, prostitutes give up too much autonomy, control and choice over their work and lives\\" and \\"While the brothel owners love this profitable solution, it can be exploitative and is unnecessary\\". She described how the women were subject to various exaggerated restrictions, including making it very difficult for them to refuse clients and having to deal with doctors who had a \\"patronizing or sexist attitude\\" (the brothels discouraged and in many cases forbade prostitutes to see doctors of their own choosing).Working In Nevada.

The bill was signed into law in September 2008. The work of GEMS is the subject of the 2007 documentary Very Young Girls.  Ohio  The Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force was created by executive order on March 29, 2012. It coordinates efforts between 11 departments to identify and rescue victims, to coordinate investigation of human trafficking cases, and to provide the services and treatment for victims.Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force: Recommendations to Governor John R. Kasich Since then, Ohio has spent $2 million on programs for trafficking victims. Franklin County Municipal Court Judge Paul Herbert established a program called Changing Actions to Change Habits (CATCH court), which is a two-year probation program for adult victims of human trafficking that allows them to have their prior convictions dismissed. Ohio is particularly vulnerable to human trafficking because it has both large urban centers and rural counties and a large transient and immigrant population, as well as five major highways with easy access to other states and Canada. 24 out of 88 counties have no human-trafficking training or access to victim services. 1,078 Ohio children are victims of human sex trafficking every year.\\"Ohio Trafficking In Persons Study Commission\\", Ohio Attorney General's Office, 2010 Toledo is the fourth largest recruitment site for human trafficking in the US.  Laws  H.B. 262 (The Ohio Human Trafficking Act of 2012) raised the penalty for committing the crime of human trafficking to a first-degree felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of 10‚Äì15 years, created a diversion program for juvenile victims to receive protection and treatment, and allows for adult victims of human trafficking with prior convictions of prostitution or solicitation to have their records expunged.

They provide a sanctuary that helps women heal, opportunities for move survivors from vulnerability to employment and economic freedom, and create paths to rise against systems that commoditize, criminalize and abuse women.  Texas   Major U.S. hubs  The main factors that contribute to high levels of trafficking through Atlanta and Houston are proximity, demographics, and a large migrant labor force. The presence of two large airports provides ways in and out of the city in Houston and Atlanta hosts the world's busiest and largest airport by several measures. The likelihood of a high level of trafficking in Atlanta and Houston is supported by the fact that the majority of calls to National Trafficking Hotline come from The Atlanta Center and Houston.  Houston  Houston's proximity to the Mexican border, I-10, a highway running across country through Houston, and the port of Houston make it a popular point of entry for international trafficking. Houston's huge geographic size and large Hispanic population create optimal conditions for trafficking because of the ability to blend in with the community. There are large Asian and Middle Eastern populations that allow traffickers and their victims to blend easily into local communities. Also, Texas businesses employ migrant labors in many different sectors throughout the state; such as textiles, agriculture, restaurants, construction, and domestic work. This vast diversity makes it difficult for law enforcement to concentrate on any one labor sector and be effective in ending human trafficking. = Types of trafficking found in Houston = The United States, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 defines sex trafficking as the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act, in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person forced to perform such an act is under the age of 18 years. Sex trafficking that occurs in Houston is not limited to taking place in strip clubs, spas, massage parlors, modeling studios, cantinas, and residential brothels in hotels, motels, apartments and houses. Labor trafficking found in Houston may be but not limited to agricultural work, restaurants, nail salons, domestic servitude, peddling, begging, or traveling sales crew. = Quantity of trafficking in Texas = Based on a study released by Dallas Women's Foundation, sex trafficking of young girls is not an isolated phenomenon, but a widespread criminal activity in Texas. The research found that 740 girls under age 18 were documented being marketed for sex during a 30-day period in Texas, of whom 712 of these girls were being marketed through Internet classified web sites and 28 were being marketed through escort services. More information concluded from the research is that there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are women killed in domestic violence with former or current husbands, intimate partners or boyfriends in Texas over an entire year. There are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are females of all ages who died from complication due to AIDS in one year in Texas. And finally, there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are teen girls who died by suicide, homicide, and accidents in the state in one year.  Laws and policies  There are several pieces of legislation in place in Texas working to combat human trafficking. Recent legislation passed in Texas mandates that all incoming local law enforcement receive training on human trafficking. In Houston specifically, one of the primary elements of the Juvenile Justice System in Harris County is the Juvenile Probation Department (HCJPD). HCJPD is \\"committed to the protection of the public, utilizing intervention strategies that are community-based, family-oriented and least restrictive while emphasizing responsibility and accountability of both parent and child\\". Feeding into HCJPD is the juvenile court system that includes five juvenile courts (each with a different judge presiding), a juvenile mental health court, and a juvenile drug court.  Organizations  # The Coalition Against Human Trafficking: works to increase community awareness of human trafficking and coordinate the identification, assistance, and protection of victims through community education, advocacy, provision of culturally and linguistically sensitive victim services, and efforts to ensure the investigation and prosecution of human traffickers. # Mosaic Family Services operates the Services for Victims of Trafficking Program that provides culturally and linguistically competent services to victims experiencing abuse, so that they may quickly recover from a criminal act. # The Texas Association Against Sexual Assault: educates rape centers and domestic violence shelters throughout Texas about human trafficking. # Free the Captives: is a Christian-based NGO that has objectives including educating the community, preventing, and intervening in the trafficking of at-risk teens, reducing the demand, and pursuing legal remedies to combat trafficking. # Houston Rescue and Restore: exists to prevent and confront modern-day slavery by educating the public, training professionals, and empowering the community to take action for the purpose of identifying, rescuing, and restoring trafficking victims to freedom. # CHILDREN AT RISK: works to end child trafficking and ensure that child victims are recognized as victims and not criminals. # Innocence Lost  Virginia  According to officials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement agencies, there is a growing problem with human trafficking in Virginia, particularly in connection with Latino gangs, including MS-13. Anti-human trafficking advocates argue that weak laws in Virginia are attracting traffickers from Washington D.C. and Maryland which have passed stricter laws.  Laws  Before April 1, 2015, Virginia was the only state in the nation that did not have any standalone human trafficking laws. SB 1188 and HB 1964 were passed on April 1, 2015. They were the first bills in Virginia to define sex trafficking, establish penalties, criminalized child sex trafficking as a Class 3 felony without the need to prove force, intimidation or deception, and criminalized recruitment for commercial sex. It also provides provisions for protecting and identifying sex trafficking victims. Robert Dillard was the first man charged under this law.

Wisconsin  The State of Wisconsin has worked to address human trafficking by establishing a comprehensive task force co-chaired by Attorney General Brad Schimel and Secretary of Children and Families Eloise Anderson. An implementation committee was chaired by Jodi Emerson of the Fierce Freedom Organization. In 2017, the Wisconsin Department of Justice launched a Human Trafficking Bureau .There are five organizations in Wisconsin that are affiliated with human trafficking cosortium efforts. These organizations include \\"Comprehensive Approaches to Youth who have been Sexually Exploited\\" (Milwaukee, Wisconsin), \\"Dana County Coordinated Community Response to the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children,\\" \\"Fierce Freedom\\" (Eau Claire), \\"La Crosse Task Force to Eradicate Modern Slavery,\\" and the Outagamie Human Trafficking Steering Committee.  Oregon  The state of Oregon has began to crack down on laws regarding Human Trafficking. In May 2013, the Multnomah County District Attorney's formed a Human Trafficking Team also known as (HTT). The HTT consists of \\"three highly skilled Deputy District Attorneys and a Victim Advocate.These team members are strategically placed in order to maximize their impacts on human trafficking with specifically the Multnomah County.\\" The role of the HTT is to protect victims utilizing a three-prong approach, (1) aggressively prosecuting those who engage in human trafficking; (2) reducing demand for exploitation in all its forms; and (3) ensuring adequate protection and support for victims of human trafficking.\\" Since 2013 the Human Trafficking Offenders Convicted has doubled since 2007. According to Shared Hope International, in 2015, Oregon legislators considered a new bill which would apply to a commonly held courtroom protection for rape victims to victims of human trafficking. This bill is known as the House bill of 3040 which was an innovated approach to \\"hearsay exception for human trafficking victims.\\" Yet, this bill did not pass, \\"despite significant local support.\\" Committee Chair Senator Pronzanski committed at a public hearing to establish a work group that will further consider hearsay exceptions for sex trafficking cases. ‚ÄúWhile Oregon has made commendable strides forward, forcing victims to face their traffickers from the witness stand only continues that terror. A victim should never have to choose between justice and restoration.‚Äù Linda Smith, President and Founder of Shared Hope International said.\\"  Organizations  * Safety Compass is an organization based in Salem Oregon, their mission is to offer support for survivors of commercial sexual exploitation and sex trafficking navigating the criminal and social justice systems in the mid-Willamette Valley, Oregon.

In 1719 he was one of the original backers of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company which commissioned numerous works from Handel and others.Thomas McGeary. The Politics of Opera in Handel's Britain. Cambridge University Press, 2013. p.254 Political career In 1715, Negus was appointed joint commissioner for executing the office of master of the horse, becoming on 27 June 1717 sole commissioner, an office he held until 1727. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Ipswich at a by-election on 13 November 1717 in succession to his father in law. He voted regularly with the Government and was returned unopposed at the 1722 British general election and in a contest at the 1727 British general election. He was appointed avener and clerk marshal to George II on 20 June 1727, and master of his majesty's buckhounds on 19 July in the same year. Negus was also ranger of Swinley Chase, lieutenant and deputy warden of Windsor Forest, and one of the commissioners of the lieutenancy of Middlesex and liberty of Westminster. In 1728 he became an assistant of the Royal African Company for the rest of his life. He was also a governor of Chelsea Waterworks. Death and legacy Negus died at Dallinghoo, on 9 September 1732 leaving a son and daughter. The Ipswich Gazette published a poem in his memory which began 'Is Negus gone? ah! Ipswich weep and mourn'. The invention of negus Edmond Malone in his Life of Dryden (1800) states that \\"the mixture now called Negus ... was invented in Queen Anne's time by Colonel Negus,\\" but does not go into further detail.

Its 11th-century origins are now mostly hidden behind the results of extensive restoration work undertaken since the 18th century; but some Saxon-era fragments remain, and reused Roman building materials can still be seen in the walls. The extensive collection of 18th-century gravestones in the churchyard includes some especially macabre examples. The church is protected as a Grade I Listed building. History The ancient parish of Walberton, which incorporated Fontwell and Avisford, covered more than of mostly flat, gravelly land about west-southwest of Arundel and east of the county town of Chichester. The village of Walberton, the largest settlement, developed to the southwest of the main routes through the parish‚Äîthe east‚Äìwest Roman road between Brighton and Chichester (now the A27 road) and the north‚Äìsouth route between Madehurst and Yapton. A church was recorded at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086; it had a permanent priest at that time, indicating its importance. It was a simple two-cell building with a nave and chancel. The west wall of the nave was built almost entirely of rubble and stones salvaged from Roman-era sites nearby, and had brick quoins. The lord of the manor granted the advowson of the church to the abbey at Lessay, France, in 1105. The abbey was associated with the priory at Boxgrove, a few miles from Walberton; the priory controlled it from about 1174 until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536. The first structural change came in the 12th century, when the east end of the nave was given arcades, each with two bays, on the north and south sides. These aisles are not homogeneous in style‚Äîalmost every column and arch is a different width or height‚Äîsuggesting that they were built over a long period of time, possibly even extending into the 13th century. The chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century; this work made it wider than the nave. Lancet windows were added at the same time. A porch was added on the north side at the same time; it also has lancets, and is considered a rare example. The chancel arch was replaced in the 14th century, and a new roof was added to the nave a century later. It formed an unbroken roofline across the nave and aisles, which was possible because the church lacked a clerestory. A new west window was added at the same time, along with some other windows. The fortunes of the church declined in the 17th and 18th centuries, and repair work had to be carried out several times, including to the roof and the south aisle (which was completely rebuilt). In the 19th century, the porch, chancel, belfry and the relatively new gallery were all altered, and the Saxon-era west entrance door was blocked. Despite all this work, yet more repairs were needed by the start of the 20th century: the nave was in danger of collapse‚Äîpossibly because of the earlier work on the belfry, which had some of its supporting timberwork removed. A wholesale restoration was paid for by public donations; the architect Richard Creed was commissioned. His work, which was very extensive and eliminated almost all pre-Norman elements, has been criticised as \\"clumsy\\" and even \\"mulish\\". The nave and aisles were transformed, buttresses were added to support the west wall of the nave, the belfry was given a new supporting structure, and the chancel and nave roofs were relaid again. Charles Cook's macabre gravestone The churchyard is large and has a wide variety of gravestones and rarer wooden graveboards from the 18th century onwards. The carvings on gravestones of that era are often gruesome, in Sussex and elsewhere, and at Walberton there are three examples detailing their victims' causes of death. The earliest, commemorating the death in 1767 of Charles Cook, is also the most prominent because of its remarkably good condition. The white slab shows Cook crushed under a fallen tree, watched by a laughing skeleton to the left, a hat-wearing man (who is holding an axe) and Father Time (carrying his traditional scythe and hourglass) to the right, and a company of trumpet-playing angels above. Such imagery was often used on ancient gravestones because not everybody could read. Elsewhere in the churchyard, the 1st Earl of Woolton, Minister of Food during the Second World War, is buried; he lived at Walberton House, the former manor house. A large stone coffin was found in the ground in front of the north porch in 1834; it may be of Saxon origin. It is now displayed inside the church. A lychgate was added at the churchyard entrance in the 20th century to the design of architect Philip Mainwaring Johnston. St Mary's Church opened a mission hall in Fontwell village in 1930. This closed about 30 years later. Architecture The church is a mostly flint structure with some ashlar and brickwork. It has a chancel, nave with north and south aisles, porch, tiled roof, and a shingled spire which sits on top of the weatherboarded belfry. Part of the nave has been converted into a vestry and other rooms. The entrance door at the west end is now the only part of the church where any pre-Norman masonry can be seen. The 13th-century chancel retains its original lancet windows, but other windows elsewhere in the church were renewed in the 15th century. Many have since been replaced. The windows in the north porch have trefoil openings at the top. The nave roof had a Saxon cross-gable until the restorations of 1903. The belfry and its framework are typical of the Chichester area. It holds six bells, three of which were added in 1903; the others were cast between the 16th and 18th centuries but were remade as part of Creed's restoration. Other interior features include the Saxon stone coffin, which is displayed beneath the west window; an ancient stone font which was discovered in a field; a marble and iron burial vault for a local family; and a memorial stone to a previous vicar, which was carved by Sussex sculptor Eric Gill.

History The Engineer's Office is the only remaining building of the former Pumping Station (ËàäÊ∞¥ÂãôÁΩ≤ÊäΩÊ∞¥Á´ô), which was built in 1895. It is the oldest pumping station in Hong Kong, even older than Tai Tam Tuk Pumping Station (Â§ßÊΩ≠ÁØ§Ê≥µÊàø), which was constructed in 1917. In 1890, Osbert Chadwick, consulting engineer of the Crown Agents, proposed the building plan for a water supply system in Kowloon. He suggested collecting subterranean water by building underground mud barriers. Although his proposal was not adopted immediately, it contributed to the construction of this pumping station subsequently. Originally, the pumping station was a complex which comprised three two-storey buildings and a tall chimney for the boiler. The first building consisted an engine house and a boiler house. The second building had a workshop on the ground floor and fitters' quarters on the first floor. Between the first building and the second building was a chimney. For the third building, an office, a store, a boy and coolie room, a cook House and a latrine are the components of the ground floor, while there was overseers' quarters on the first floor. thumb|centre|600px|Elevation of the Yau Ma Tei Pumping Station on Station Street (today's Shanghai Street) from the set of original architectural drawings recovered from Water Supplies Department. (Starting from the left: 1\\\\. First building: Engine House and Boiler House; 2. The Chimney; 3. Second building: Fitters' Quarters and Workshop; 4. Third building: Overseers' Quarters, Office and Store) The engine house and boiler house of the pumping station as it appeared in the early 1960s, which, at the time of this photo, was used as a post office. The pumping station was equipped with steam-driven pumps, which were imported from England, and able to abstract an estimated 400,000 gallons of water from three wells nearby for the early inhabitants in the Kowloon Peninsula. With the supply of fresh water, commercial activities could take place and normal daily living was assured. As a result, the population of Kowloon was increased by 33% from about 23,000 in 1891 to 34,782 by 1897. This pumping station became unimportant in the 20th century because of the construction of Kowloon Reservoir in 1906 and other reservoirs subsequently. In 1911 the pumping station ceased operationhttp://www.discoverhongkong.com/uk/see-do/arts-performance/arts- venues/yau-ma-tei-theatre.jsp and the chimney was demolished one year later. The remaining buildings then underwent different adaptive reuse. The first building, which had consisted of the engine house and the boiler house, was converted into a post office in the 1910s‚Äì1920s. The second building, which had consisted the workshop and the fitters' quarters, became a hazardous goods store. The third building, which had consisted the overseers' quarters and the office, became a hawkers control office. In the pre-war and early post-war days Yunnan Lane, which was located by the side of the post office, became a place where professional letter writers set up their stalls. There were as many as 37 stalls. This traditional trade gradually disappeared with raising literacy. The post office ceased operation in 1967 with the opening of the nearby Kowloon Central Post Office. The vacated post office was then used as a \\"Street Sleepers' Shelter\\" operated by the Salvation Army, until the end of the 1990s, when the shelter for the homeless moved across the street to the building on 345A Shanghai Street. At present, only one of the three buildings remains. Except for the engineer's office, the other parts of the pumping station have been demolished. Architecture Front view of today's Red Brick House Side view of today's Red Brick House The building with two-storey is built in a colonial Neo-Classical style with Arts and Crafts influence. The most significant feature of the building is the red brick fa√ßade. This refers to the construction of the walls of the building by red bricks, which account for the name \\"Red Brick House\\". Being a former pumping station, the architecture of the building is of utilitarian design, which is also a typical example of the British industrial building. The building does not consist of much decoration, there are only some decorative brickwork features and ironwork balustrading. There are not much structural alteration to the building. The pitched roof is finished with double layer Chinese clay tiles, with a single chimney stack and flue openings projects above the ridge. The windows of the building consist of wooden casements incorporated in window openings with granite cills and lintels. Above the lintels, there are rough brick relieving arches. Ornamental ironwork balustrades with granite copings is retained from an arched verandah, which is now enclosed with windows. Doors of the building which are cross braced and battened, are also made of wood. Cast-iron rainwater pipes, hopper heads and gutters along the wall of the building also have executional level of significance to the building. Inside the building, there are arched verandah and internal arcades on the ground floor. The walls are plastered and painted and the floor is screeded. For the first floor, the original wooden doors and windows, cornices, skirtings and floor boarding are still presented. Neighbouring Historic buildings Yau Ma Tei is the oldest developed urban area in Kowloon. Some other low-rise historic structures are found nearby, such as Yaumati Theatre and Yau Ma Tei Wholesale Fruit Market. Architecturally they complement each other. The block next to the Engineer's Office features post-war tong-laus along Shanghai Street, which house the Hong Kong International Hobby and Toy Museum at No. 330.maps.google.com Preservation Model of the former pumping station In early 2000, the sole surviving building of former pumping station was slated for demolition in preparation for the 36-storey, twin-tower residential project, No. 8 Waterloo Road, which was jointly developed by the Land Development Corporation (the predecessor of the Urban Renewal Authority) and Sun Hung Kai Properties. At that time, the original identity of the building had been forgotten and it was simply referred to as \\"Red Brick House\\". During the process of the study, two heritage specialists from The University of Hong Kong, Dr. Lee Ho Yin and Dr. Lynne DiStefano, raised questions about the original function of the anonymous Red Brick House. The original identity and usage of the building was revealed when the original architectural drawings were found by an old British engineer at Water Supplies Department. In view of the building's historical significance and rarity, it was awarded a Grade I Historical Building status in 2000 and recommended for conservation. As a result, the building cannot be demolished. Therefore, Land Development Corporation and Sun Hung Kai Properties had to adjust the development plans to accommodate the 36-storey building on the site, without any influence on the engineer's office of the former pumping station. Revitalisation The building is now vacant awaiting a suitable adaptive re-use. It is proposed that the Red Brick Building will revitalise in conjunction with the Yau Ma Tei Theatre as a Xiqu (Êà≤Êõ≤) Activity Centre, providing a performing and practising venue for small-scale Cantonese Opera performance. It would also serve as training venue for budding artists.

Early days Whittell was born at Stratford in Essex, England, now part of Greater London. His father, an engineer and naval architect was the Bombay representative of Lloyd's of London, and Whittell grew up in both India and England, as well as attending school for a year in Germany in 1894. In 1899 he began studying medicine at Edinburgh University. In 1899, Whittell donated to Edinburgh Museum a specimen of an Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) taken in County Mayo, Ireland. His address was then given as 53, Merchiston Crescent, Edinburgh. In August 1901, he made an ornithological expedition to Orkney and collected a specimen of a red-necked phalarope (Phalaropus hyperboreus) from Stromness. However, in 1903 he gave up his medical studies to pursue a career in the British Army.Serventy (1954).Kloot (1990). Military career In September 1904, after service with the 2nd Battalion the Royal Guernsey Light Infantry (Channel Islands Militia), Whittell passed a competitive examination and in December was gazetted a Second Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion the Royal Sussex Regiment, with which he was posted to India in 1905. In November 1907 he was promoted lieutenant, and transferred to the Indian Army, joining the 56th Punjabi Rifles, being promoted to captain in 1913. He studied Urdu, Pushtu and Persian, collected old Indian coins, went big game hunting and published papers on local history. He married Sydney Margaret O'Hara Hodgkins in 1911 in Bombay. Following the outbreak of World War I he served in France, Belgium and Egypt for the duration of the war, after which he returned to India to serve in the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919. He was twice Mentioned in Despatches and was promoted to major. In June 1921, while serving with the Supplies and Transport Corps of the Indian Army, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division). In 1926 he retired from the Indian Army and emigrated to Australia. Ornithology Whittell settled with his family at Bridgetown, Western Australia, 270 km south of Perth, where he bought an orchard and a dairy farm which he managed successfully, becoming a prosperous member of the local farming community. By 1929 he had revived a lifelong interest in birds and was ornithologically active, joining the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) that year. He started building up a bird egg and skin collection, as well as establishing an ornithological library. He also made several collecting trips in the south-west and south- east of Western Australia. In 1939 Whittell became Convener of the RAOU's Checklist Committee, serving also as President of the Union 1941‚Äì1943. A keen conservationist, from 1946 he served on the State Fauna Protection Advisory Committee. In 1943 he began a collaboration with Dominic Serventy on a regional handbook, the Birds of Western Australia, the first edition of which was published in 1948. From the mid-1930s he had been working on a comprehensive history and bibliography of Australian ornithology, The Literature of Australian Birds, a monumental 900-page volume published in 1954 not long after his death. Whittell was described by his friend and collaborator Dom Serventy as follows: > ‚ÄùPhysically he was a slight man, of restless disposition, and his > physiognomy, with the keen face and the alert prominent blue-grey eyes, > reminded one strikingly of some of the profile portraits of Frederick the > Great. Personally he was of the highest integrity and he despised any > adventitious aid to advancement, such as joining the 'right' social > organisations or currying favour with persons supposed to have influence. He > found it difficult to suffer fools gladly and this, combined with a somewhat > choleric temperament at times, alienated some of his acquaintances. Others > were never quite at their ease in his presence, never knowing whether to > take his quips, uttered in a clipped English accent, as real reproaches or > humorous chaffing. However, when acquaintance passed to friendship his ripe > observations from an intelligent and well-stocked mind, on people, places > and things, combined with his essential good nature and fair dealing, made > him an agreeable and congenial companion.‚Äù Whittell was awarded Life Memberships of the St John Ambulance Association, the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia, and the Western Australian Naturalists' Club. He died in 1954 following long and painful complications from surgery carried out more than a year previously in December 1952. He was survived by his wife, a daughter, two sons and three grandchildren.

His work consists of large documentary projects on social, environmental, and economic issues, exposing the lives of \\"people on the margins of Chinese society: coal miners, drug addicts, HIV patients.\\" His stories on pollution and environmental destruction cover topics traditionally under-reported due to the risk of punishment by the Chinese government. He has received three World Press Photo awards, the Henri Nannen Prize for photojournalism, the W. Eugene Smith Grant, a photography grant from the National Geographic and the Prince Claus Award. Lu is based in New York City, the first Chinese photographer to be invited by the U.S. State Department as a visiting scholar, and Beijing. In early November 2018, whilst travelling in Xinjiang, he was taken away by state security agents. He was released in 2019. Life and work Lu was born in 1961 in the city of Yongkang in the Zhejiang province of China. He grew up under Mao Zedong's policies in the People's Republic of China. At the age of fifteen, following Mao's death, China underwent economic change with the introduction of Western industrialization. In 1980, Lu encountered photography while working in a silk factory in Yongkang. From 1987 until 1993, he ran his own photo studio. Later, he studied photography at the Fine Arts Academy of Tsinghua University (Beijing) from 1993 to 1995. He worked for several years on advertising assignments before going freelance as a reportage photographer. During his years of study at Tsinghua University, Lu encountered Xie Hairong, another Chinese photographer, from whom he gained inspiration to become a photojournalist. Lu's work covers a wide range of consequences of China's rapid industrialization. A reoccurring theme is that of \\"cancer villages\\" in certain affected provinces, the negative environmental conditions (such as water pollution) causing these cancer villages and other related health issues, and the effect of industrialization on Chinese countrysides and its people. Lu has stated that his choice of subject in his photography is done to raise awareness in both China and on a global scale. The Shanxi province is the setting for a photograph within the series capturing severe birth defects present in the children living there, the province is also one of the most polluted areas in China. Beyond the Yellow River, Lu also documented pollution in the Yangtze River, the Qiantang River, leaking sewage from the industrial districts. Heavy sewage and air pollution in Anyang City of Henan province is shown negatively affecting the lives of villagers.

They were broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2009 as part of the station's \\"Point of View\\" strand, in the weekly timeslot formerly occupied by Alistair Cooke's Letter from America. In each of the 20 programmes, Attenborough discusses a particular subject of personal resonance, drawing on his experience of six decades filming the natural world. The series was produced by Julian Hector, head of radio at the BBC Natural History Unit. A second 20-part series of Life Stories called New Life Stories began on 18 February 2011. Background The commissioning of Life Stories was announced in January 2009. Speaking of his move from television to radio, Attenborough remarked that \\"It's a chance to talk about fossils, archaeopteryx\\" and other subjects close to his heart, including his first pet, a salamander, and his favourite animal - the bird-of- paradise. The programmes were broadcast on Friday evenings and repeated on the Sunday morning of the same week. They were also broadcast on the BBC World Service station as part of the \\"Letter from\\" strand. During the series run, each episode was made available as a podcast on the Radio 4 website, and are still available on the BBC Sounds app. Episodes Series 1 (2009) Series 2 (2011) Reception The series drew widespread praise from the British press. Gillian Reynolds, radio critic for The Daily Telegraph, wrote \\"his opening talk, about his affinity with the gently ruminant three-toed sloth, was pure delight\\". She went on to describe Attenborough as a \\"gent, scholar, a brilliant communicator with a sense of humour\\", and added that \\"unlike many a radio broadcaster these days, he doesn't drop his voice on the key word in any sentence.\\" The Observer's Kate Kellaway, comparing the \\"Sloth\\" episode to Attenborough's television work, wrote \\"if the marvellous first programme is anything to go by, it will prove that we do not need to be on televisual safari to be completely intrigued.\\" Writing in The Times on Attenborough's delivery, Simon Barnes remarked that \\"all the time the lilting, dancing voice is alight with wonder and ‚Äî let's call a spade a spade ‚Äî love.\\" In May 2010, Attenborough won Speech Broadcaster of the Year at the Sony Radio Academy Awards for his work on Life Stories. Book and audio book The complete series was released in audio book form and the scripts compiled in a hardback volume. Attenborough went on a national book signing tour to promote the titles, and also appeared on the BBC One chatshow Friday Night with Jonathan Ross to talk about the book. This book contains the same text that was used in Attenborough's speeches, along with pictures at the end of each chapter, accompanied by captions written by Attenborough. * Life Stories by David Attenborough, published in hardcover edition by BBC Books on 1 October 2009 () * David Attenborough's Life Stories, 3CD audiobook set released by BBC Audio on 21 October 2009 () References External links  David Attenborough's official website * Attenborough's biography at BBC Online Category:BBC Radio 4 programmes Category:2009 radio programme debuts Category:David Attenborough ","title":"David Attenborough's Life Stories"},{"id":"24734501","text":"Iliyan Yordanov (Bulgarian: –ò–ª–∏—è–Ω –ô–æ—Ä–¥–∞–Ω–æ–≤; born 3 April 1989) is a Bulgarian professional footballer who currently plays as a midfielder for Neftochimic Burgas.

The Medem library in Paris, the largest European Yiddish institution, bears his name.  Life  Son of a Russian medical officer who had converted from Judaism to Lutheranism, Vladimir Medem was educated in a Minsk gymnasium. He studied later at the Kiev University and developed an interest in the Yiddish-speaking proletariat and their harsh living conditions. He was preoccupied by the fact that the Russian Jews had no nation and no right to strike. In spite of his interest in Jewish affairs, Medem did not re-convert to Judaism. Medem only learned Yiddish at the age of 22; the language was taboo in his family environment. Because of a student strike in 1899, he had to leave the university and joined the Minsk socialists, inspired by Marxist friends. His great interest in the world of Yiddish-speaking workers and the political antisemitism made him the leading ideologue of the Jewish Labour Bund, whose supporters were especially well represented among the immigrants in Paris, and were also called Bundists. Medem emigrated to New York in 1921 and died less than two years later. He is buried at the Mount Carmel Cemetery in Queens, NY. The Jewish Labour Bund, founded in 1897 in the Lithuanian Vilnius, was committed to the cultural and national rights of Jews in Eastern Europe. In this regard, Medem dared to oppose the view of Russian Marxists, and even of Lenin. These objectives received support in Central and Western Europe, e.g. from Austromarxists, and especially in several Jewish immigrant workers' clubs in Paris, whose members described themselves as Bundists. One such club, which also saw the education of the workers as its main task was given the name Arbeter-klub afn nomen Vladimir Medem (Workers' Club on behalf of Vladimir Medem). His educational policy ambitions culminated in 1929 in the founding of the , which at 30,000 volumes is now the largest Yiddish cultural institution in Europe.

She was affectionately known to peers and fans as Fei-fei (ËÇ• ËÇ•, lit. \\"Fat Fat\\" or \\"Fatty\\"). Shum died at 8:38 a.m. (local time) on 19 February 2008 where her condition worsened due to pleural effusion, aged 62. Early years Shum was born on 21 July 1945 in Shanghai to Sung Shen Gee (Ê≤à Ë≥¢ Á•∫; 1913‚Äì1978, with ancestral home in Shanpei, Ningbo) and Sung Tan Sun (Ê≤à ÈÇ± Ê∑° Á¥†; 1913‚Äì2008).Sudden Weekly, Issue no. 656, 22 February 2008, cover page She entered the Hong Kong entertainment industry at the age of 13 in 1958. She made her film debut in 1960, joining Shaw Brothers as a teenage actress at the age of 15. She took some time to adjust to Hong Kong as she found the Cantonese cuisine very different from that of her native Shanghai. TVB Shum's last public appearance reuniting with the cast of Enjoy Yourself Tonight While she worked at Shaw Brothers, her popularity grew and she became one of the first stakeholders in the up-and-coming TV broadcast station TVB. In 1967, Shum's stardom took off with the popular television variety show Enjoy Yourself Tonight. She first sang in the Cantopop group the Four Golden Flowers. Later, she played a Shanghai woman in the 1970s. She also sang as the partner of Roman Tam from 1971 to 1973. By August 1972 she was sufficiently regarded to be one of the first Chinese to ceremonially ride through the Cross-Harbour Tunnel on its opening day. TVB general manager Stephen Chan has said that there was no substitute for Lydia Shum, and that every person who worked with her professionally eventually became well known in Hong Kong. Her openness to appearing in sport bikinis and ballet costumes despite her weight earned her respect in image-conscious Hong Kong. Film work Shum has been established mainly as a comic and dramatic actress but is not limited to films in those genres. Kung fu fans will recognize her from her role as Yuen Cheung-Yan's dominating wife in the film Drunken Tai Chi. She also appeared as Richard Ng's wife in the all-star comedy Millionaire's Express, as well as a major role in It's a Mad Mad World. Her 1997 film Fitness Tour is utilized her weight for its plot. She took a leave from her movie career in 1997, and hosted a talk show in Hong Kong, along with numerous telethons and variety shows on TVB. She returned to films in 2004 with the comedy In-Laws Outlaws. Asia region Shum starred in Singapore's Channel 5 sitcom Living with Lydia and Cantonese series like Slim Chances (ÊàëË¶ÅFit‰∏ÄFit). Her performance in Living with Lydia won her the \\"Best Comedy Performance by an Actress\\" award at the 2003 Asian Television Awards. It was also the first time she had acted in an English sitcom with a multi-camera format though a laugh track was used. Personal life Marriage Shum married actor and singer Adam Cheng Siu-chow in January 1985 after 11 years of cohabitation. Prior to the marriage, in December 1984, Shum was asked by her good friend Lee Heung Kam to fly to San Francisco for the opening ceremony of Lee's shop. Shum, who was in Taiwan with Cheng at the time, was reluctant to do so initially, but three days later, Shum left for San Francisco. When she returned to Taiwan, she heard rumors that Cheng was having an affair. Upon being asked about this, Cheng denied having a relationship with another woman and suggested marriage. Shum believed that a marriage would deter any woman from becoming close to Cheng. On 5 January 1985, Cheng and Shum flew to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to get married. Due to the hurried circumstances of their marriage and Shum's size, there was insufficient time to prepare for a wedding gown, so Shum wore a Chinese cheongsam instead. Shum later said in a 2006 interview in Hong Kong that one of her greatest regrets was to not have put on a wedding gown for her wedding. Family On 30 May 1987, Joyce Cheng Yan-Yee was born to Shum and Adam Cheng. Eight months after their daughter was born, Cheng and Shum divorced. Lydia Shum was the sister of fashion designer Alfred Sung. Health problems and subsequent death Shum suffered from several serious chronic ailments: cholangitis, diabetes, and hypertension. In 2002, she was admitted to the Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) in Hong Kong and had 36 gallstones extracted. In September 2006, Shum was diagnosed with a liver tumor and cancer around the gallbladder. Doctors immediately removed one third of her liver.Nickkita Lau, Media scrum as Fei Fei rushed to intensive care , 12 October 2007 Prior to a cholecystectomy done in 2002, she suffered bile duct inflammation in 1978 and again in 1989. On 22 September 2006, the inflammation recurred. Four days later, it had complicated her liver and she went into a coma until 1 October. Once again, on 29 January 2007, she entered the operating room to remove a liver tumor which weighed 2.7 kg. On 8 March 2007, the tumor was found to be growing so she had another cholecystectomy. On 1 November 2006, a 24-year-old Indonesian domestic helper, Triyuliarti Yuyun, was convicted of violating the Hospital Authority Ordinance and sentenced to four weeks in jail. Yuyun entered a ward at the Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) on 1 October 2006 where Shum had been receiving treatment, and attempted to take photographs of Shum. Later, it was confirmed that Yuyun was a domestic helper to one of the employees of the local magazine, East Week, but she had not been authorized to take photographs of Shum. East Week's senior management did not approve of the action and offered an apology to Shum. Magistrate Colin Mackintosh determined that Yuyun's actions were premeditated and done for financial gain and that the serious infringement of the patient's privacy warranted a custodial sentence. On that occasion, Shum was discharged from the hospital in July 2007. On 11 October 2007, Shum collapsed at home with pleural effusion, and was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QE) for emergency treatment. Later that day, Shum was transferred to QMH. She was discharged from that hospital on 16 October 2007. Shum was admitted to the intensive care ward at QMH on 22 January 2008 and checked out four days later. Shum's mother died in Canada, while Shum was in the hospital. She was once again admitted to the intensive care ward at QMH on 2 February 2008, where her condition worsened. On 19 February, at 3 am, her family decided that Shum's life support should be withdrawn. It was decided that her breathing apparatus would be removed and that her family spend time with her by her bedside. Shum died at 8:38 a.m. (local time) on that day. Prior to her death, she was known to be suffering from liver cancer which she had fought for two years. As part of the treatment for her illness, she underwent chemotherapy and several rounds of kidney dialysis treatment. On 24 February 2008, escorted by her daughter Joyce, Shum's body was flown on a Cathay Pacific passenger flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. On 27 February, Shum was buried at Burnaby's Forest Lawn Memorial Park in a private ceremony. Video footage of the funeral was played at a memorial event at the Hong Kong Coliseum on 2 March. Fei Fei Day Fei Fei Day was proclaimed for 1 June 2008 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (which is Shum's lunar calendar birthday). Mayor Sam Sullivan proclaimed this memorial day in Vancouver on 26 February 2008, a week after Shum's death.

Slavery in New France was practiced by some of the indigenous populations, which enslaved outsiders as captives in warfare, but it was European colonization that made commercial chattel slavery become common in New France. By 1750, two thirds of the enslaved peoples in New France were indigenous, and by 1843, most enslaved people were black. The institution, which endured for almost two centuries, affected thousands of men, women, and children descended from indigenous and African peoples. It also impacted many indigenous people, who were used as domestic servants and traded as goods.  Indigenous origins of slavery in Canada  The existence of slavery in this region predates arrival of Europeans and had major impacts on the way the system of slavery progressed during French colonization. Entrenched in a culture of war, indigenous groups of the Pays d'en Haut relied extensively on warfare that focused on captive- taking, rather than killing. These captives would then be processed, often through a brutal series of events designed to strip the individual of any identifications from prior groups and also supplying lasting demarcations and scarring to signify the individual's captive status to others in the community. New France, 1750 The process of integration was often cruel and life-threatening and included acts such as the cutting off of fingers or other extremities, nails being torn out, nose cropping, and beatings. The ritual of captive integration was a public affair, which involved all sections of native society, including women and children, whose participation was particularly poignant in solidifying the status of the slave, often a captured male warrior, in his new community. Those surviving from being beaten and marked would then undergo humiliating acts, such as undressing and forced singing, to erase former identities further before they were reintegrated into their new community or were ritually tortured and executed. Once part of the community, captives served distinct social functions within it. Generally, slaves were not typically seen as freely-transferable property and trade goods as traditionally seen in modes of chattel slavery. Instead, slaves were intended to serve the social role of a lost community member: when one member would be murdered or taken from the community, a captive would be provided to take that member's place and assume her or his roles. That often meant that the position of the slave was gendered in a way that pushed men to take on traditionally- female tasks, such as serving meals, providing farm labour, preparing skins, and carrying packs when hunting. Female captives were often used as secondary \\"chore\\" wives, who were used for routine household acts as well as providing reproductive labour. Politically, there was also considerable value in these captive-taking rituals. Captives' unique positions as social intermediaries allowed them to provide diplomatic services, such as translation. Able to act as symbolic gifts between peoples, slave-trading added social and political weight behind indigenous relations, linking separate regions' peoples to one another through ethnic and linguistic boundaries. Often being seized from one group, integrated into another, and then exchanged to still others, they had capacities to act as cultural coordinators, which highlighted the utility of the indigenous slave trade and the degree to which indigenous captives may have been able to exercise autonomy within their servitude.  French- indigenous patterns of enslavement  American Indian Slave Halter. Eighteenth Century, Great Lakes Region. Colonial Williamsburg Collection, 1996-816. Courtesy The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. Taken from Rushforth, 2012. Clearly established prior to the French arrival, a system of slavery was well underway. The French practice of slavery therefore existed more as an adaptation to an existing system rather than the imposition of a new system upon indigenous peoples and spaces. Slavery was adopted by French settlers in earnest beginning in 1632, continuing into Anglo-Canadian occupation in the 18th century. Initially, slavery in the colony was complicated by France's ethical stance on the matter: slave ownership in New France was not legally recognized (as per their free-soil doctrine), but it could still be justified with the understanding that only the act of enslaving people was deemed unethical and simply buying or receiving slaves was accepted. Hoping to mimic the economic success of other colonies, France's royal administration gave in to Canadian pressures from slave-purchasing colonial officials, and issued the Raudot Ordinance of 1709, putting into law a legitimacy of enslavement within the St. Lawrence Valley colonial setting. French settlers primarily acquired slaves through the process of ritualized gift giving commonly used to facilitate diplomatic negotiations. However French hunger for more slaves altered indigenous practices of captive taking and enslavement. Warfare focusing on captive taking increased, as captives became not just a way to symbolically replace lost relatives, but also became economically valuable goods to exchange with the French. Networks of alliances between indigenous groups helped funnel captives towards the French. The exchange of slaves, and different understandings about the nature of slavery also had real impacts on French relationships with their native neighbors. Protracted conflicts, such as the Fox Wars, were largely encouraged because war captives provided an ample source of new slaves. Indigenous nations allied to the French and antagonistic to the Fox used this incentive to leverage French military support. At other times, different conceptions of slavery stood in the way of relationships. Denonville's decision to send 40 captured Iroquois to France as galley slaves proved to be a major roadblock to future peace negotiations between the French and the Iroquois. Similarly, diplomatic talks with Sioux chiefs in 1742 were marred by the presence of Sioux slaves who had ended up in French possession.  African slave trade in New France  African slaves in New France were a minority in relationship to both African slaves within New France and throughout all \\"New World\\" slave holdings. Out of the roughly 3.8 million slaves who had been transported from Western Africa to the America's by the 1750s, only about 1,400 ended up in New France. Similarly, African slaves were continuously outnumbered by the enslaved indigenous population that formed the majority of the forced labour force in New France. While exact figures are hard to reconstruct, an estimate of slave populations in 1759, on the eve of British conquest suggests a total of around 4000 slaves, of which around 1200 were African. It was in 1632 that the first recorded black slave, Olivier Le Jeune, arrived in New France. It would take more than 50 years later for the next black slave to appear in records, despite strong efforts to augment the numbers of black slaves. Several attempts were made throughout the history of New France to increase the number of African slaves brought to the colony to increase the available workforce. Attempts to increase the economic output of mines, fisheries, and farms were frustrated by the lack of workers. There was much concern that the introduction of African enslavement in Canada would be a costly economic option, citing the major differences in climate as the main reason for its possible failure. Nevertheless, the Governor, Marquis de Denonville, petitioned Louis XIV in 1688 for permission to import African slaves into New France to help establish a colonial economy more closely based on that of France's Caribbean colonies. In May 1689, permission was granted by the King to begin the import of black slaves. However, the number of African slaves remained quite low; colonial records show that there were only eleven African slaves in New France between 1689 and 1709. Later calls to increase the importation of African Slaves to New France also echoed the example of other European colonies that relied on Slave labour. For example Michel Begon argued in 1716 that New France should try to emulate the British colonies in their use of slaves. However attempts at modeling New France on other colonies were frustrated both by historical accident and changing colonial policy. While Louis XIV authorization of slave imports to New France in response to Denonville's request was granted, the start of the Nine Years' War prevented the establishment of continual trade. A similar authorization in 1701 was curtailed by the outbreak of the Seven Years' War. Beyond the difficulties of establishing slave trading networks to New France, economic factors further hindered their development; New France had less potential for high-profit plantation agriculture compared to other colonies, and the availability of indigenous slaves generally meant that there were fewer profitable opportunities for selling slaves in New France. Royal Edict of 1685 The Code Noir (Black Code) was essentially designed for (black) African slaves whom the French had used extensively in the French Caribbean colonies since 1685. It was composed of 60 articles and was meant to offer some protection to slaves. The Code, moreover, extended toward \\"Panis\\" slaves in New France, but its legal application and enforcement remained limited due to the close relationship between the French and the native tribes. The Code outlined the rights and obligations of both slaves and their owners. Slaves could not make contracts, own land, testify, or be sentenced publicly. Because they did not have the status of a civil individual, slaves could not be charged criminally as citizens. If slaves were found to have physically harmed or damaged something or someone, the owner or owners were financially and personally responsible for the damages caused. If the owner failed to pay for the damages, his slave could be forcefully removed from his possession. The owner, additionally, had the right to whip or chain his slave. However, it was illegal to mutilate, kill or torture slaves. Although the Code classified slaves as objects much like a piece of furniture, the owners, nevertheless, had obligations toward their slaves. They were required to feed, clothe, care for in case of injury or sickness, and provide for aging and crippled slaves. With regards to births and marriages, under the Black Code, there was no legal recognition of the father's situation; a marriage between a free man and a slave woman was not legally recognized. A child born from a free man and a slave woman was considered a slave child; a child born from a free man and free slave woman, in contrast, was a free child. In 1724, modifications were made to the Black Code. After its revision, the Code \\"insisted on the basic humanity of the slave: each was to be instructed, baptized, and ministered unto as a Christian, families were to be recognized, and freed slaves were to receive the rights of common citizens ‚Äî in theory the African could aspire to become a Frenchman\\". In practice, nevertheless, there was a huge gap between the laws written in the Black Code and reality since the large majority of French colonists ignored the existence of the document. It was an exception, moreover, for a slave to become free. And while it has been argued that the French were more lenient and tolerant towards their slaves, in comparison to the British or the Dutch, the living conditions and treatment of slaves, however, was still determined by the attitude of their owners.  Regional characteristics of slavery   Slavery in the Illinois Country  The Illinois Country was a French colonial settlement situated in the Mississippi Valley. Although newcomers to the region, the Illinois were an influential Algonquian group who were heavily engaged in slave trade practices with the French and other indigenous allies. Given that their economy primarily revolved around bison hunting, the Illinois required a lot of manpower which they mostly received from slaves. Bison was not only a staple diet for the Illinois but was also integrated in their material culture. In fact, the integrative use of bison led to gendered work in the Illinois Country which further entrenched the practice of slavery in the region. Emphasis was placed on female work which, in turn, led to a social structure wherein the majority of slaves were female. Furthermore, polygamous relationships became widely popular among the Illinois in which secondary wives were merely considered and treated as slaves. Female slaves had little to no control over their bodies and did not get to choose their prospective husbands. This was done in order to maximize productivity and to ensure that the demands of the bison economy were met. As far as the Illinois were concerned, the female body was only good for reproduction and labor. Thus, wives and other female slaves were delegated tedious tasks such as processing and drying the meat as well as using bison skins for decorative purposes, clothing and diplomatic gifts. Completing these tasks was not an easy feat, however, as it required wives and female slaves to cooperate and divide the work amongst each other. Though there is no denying that slavery practices benefitted the bison enterprise, wives and female slaves were the ones who suffered the brunt of this thriving economy. Yet slavery did not only serve economic needs in the Illinois country as it also served cultural purposes. For one, the slave trade allowed the Illinois to strengthened their relationship with the French and other indigenous allies. They would raid and take captives from their enemies, namely the Foxes, and offer them as gifts to the French. The trading of slaves was a ritualized performance that reinforced kinship alliance between the French and the Illinois. The French, in turn, accepted the slaves and baptized them‚Äîstripping them of their ethnic and cultural identity in an effort to Christianize them. Not surprisingly, the taking of captives often led to violent retaliations, namely from the Foxes. Longstanding animosity between the Illinois and the Foxes placed the French in a compromising position. While the French were eager to move westward and trade with the Foxes, they needed to consider their kinship alliance with the Illinois and other indigenous groups in the Great Lakes region. To demand the Illinois to relinquish their captives to the Foxes was to offend them, but to ask the Foxes to seek new captives in distant regions was to doubly offend the Illinois since it threaten their position as trusted middlemen to the French. Moreover, the French were reluctant to stop the Illinois from taking captives seeing as they benefited from the Fox slave trade. Thus, inasmuch as the slave trade strengthened alliances between the Illinois and the French, it also soured relationships which led to intermittent retaliatory campaigns. The French introduced legalized African slavery under the Code Noir into New France. After the port of New Orleans was founded in 1718 with access to the slave colonies of the Caribbean, French colonists imported increased numbers of African slaves to the Illinois Country for use as mining or agricultural laborers. By the mid-eighteenth century, slaves accounted for as many as a third of the limited population in that rural area. Slavery on √éle-Royale The Louisbourg in the colony of √éle- Royale (Cape Breton & Prince Edward Island) is one city of New France with official records of a black slave community. Louisbourg was an important trading port for the colony because of its key geographical location. It was the midpoint between Europe and France's Caribbean colonies, and was not so subject to sea ice as the settlements to the west. Its economy depended on fishing, the military and trade. It is believed that hundreds of black slaves traveled through the port aboard merchant vessels; only 216 black individuals, nevertheless, were actually enslaved on Ile Royale. The majority of these slaves were the property of the wealthiest individuals of Ile Royale: merchants, government and military officials. Owning slaves increased one's living conditions and social status within the colony. The slaves of Ile Royale had very different backgrounds as some came from the Dutch West Indies while others directly came from Guinea. However, despite not having the same heritage or ethnicity, they had the common experience of being slaves. What is interesting about Ile Royale is that slaves on the island had a variety of occupations that included being servants, gardeners, bakers, tavern keepers, stonemasons, soldiers, sailors, fisherman and hospital workers. What is most important about this specific part of the French colony of New France is that the enslaved blacks became citizens of the community; not only were they mothers and fathers who became part of a growing African-French colonial culture but they also helped shape colonial life, too. Slavery in Louisiana Although Louisiana was established much later than other colonies within New France in 1699, it still acquired blacks far more quickly than Canada as it had the advantage of being closer to the Caribbean market. It also had the opportunity to exploit the native market of the vast Mississippi valley. In Louisiana, plantation owners preferred African slaves; some still kept natives as maids, nevertheless. Some Panis were enslaved by the beginning of the 18th century, even though it was prohibited officially. These slaves were captured by other native tribes during conflicts and then sold to the French. In 1717, John Law advised the Mississippi Company to import black slaves into Louisiana in order to develop the economy with plantations. Around 6,000 black slaves were brought in between 1719 and 1743. Some slaves were sent to the Illinois Country, in Upper Louisiana, New France, a part of French North America, to work in the plantation fields and lead mines. The Black Code regulated the condition of the slaves just like in the other French colonies, aside from Canada. The Black Code, nevertheless, was not highly respected and slaves enjoyed relative autonomy. During their days off, for example, slaves could cultivate a piece of land and then sell their produce. Others would hunt, log wood, or take care of cattle; all of these actives could occur far from the plantation. Even though interracial marriages and gatherings of slaves was prohibited, both of these practices were nonetheless recorded. Despite this small window of freedom, the lives and work of slaves remained extremely difficult. Harvest period was the most disagreeable season for them. Their belongings, in addition, were sparse and usually only consisted of a few personal items. Still, slave rebellions were rare during the French colonial period. The slaves also contributed to the creolization of this part of the colony. Even if the Black Code mandated that slaves receive a Christian education, most continued their native practices. Slavery in Quebec Thousands of people were legally held as slaves in Quebec during the colonial period, used as status symbols and servants for wealthy individuals, the local government, and religious organizations including the Grey Nuns. Black slaves exploited by the French were brought from other colonies like Martinique or captured from African regions like Madagascar.  Personal experiences of slaves in Canada  Man Holding a Calumet. Louis Hennepin, Nouvelle d√©couverte d'un tr√®s grande pays situ√© dans l'Am√©riques. Utrecht, 1697. Courtesy Special Collections Research Center, Swem Library, College of William and Mary. Taken from Rushforth, 2012. Treatment of slaves in Canada varied depending on whether the captive was enslaved by an indigenous group or enslaved by a colonial settler. For example, when faced with a declining population, the Iroquois were known to organize a war party and take captives in order to replace the deceased. Customarily, the captive would undergo a ritualized form of torture, a process that was meant to break down the captive's previous social identity before he/she were fully integrated in their adoptive clan. Although the captive was considered an adoptive kin, disfigurements such as a mutilated nose or missing fingers marked them as captives. Yet an account from the Jesuit missionary, Father Isaac Jogues, seems to suggest that revenge and humiliation were also reasons for taking and torturing captives. He details the ways in which his Iroquois abductors repeatedly beat him with war clubs, tore his fingernails and burned his arms and thighs. Women and youth also had their fill of torturing Father Jogues by beating him with iron rods and yanking out his thumbs. Captive taking was also practiced among other indigenous groups and that some rituals of humiliation and torture were not always as ghastly as the ones endured by Father Jogues. Louis Hennepin, for example, was another French missionary who recorded his experience as a captive among the Sioux. Even though he was ceremoniously adopted by the war chief Aquipaguetin to replace his deceased son, he suffered physical abuse and ridicule from his captors until he was released. Although he did not experience the same horrors as Father Jogues, his meals were rationed in order to keep him weak and dependent. By contrast, French slave-owners did not subject their slaves to undue forms of torture as European understanding of kinship and adoption were radically different from that of indigenous peoples. Instead, many slave-owners opted to baptize their slaves and christen them with a new name. Those who wished to keep the origins of their slave a secret requested that their slave be identified as \\"panis\\" on their baptismal records. However, some slave-owners delayed the baptism of their slaves while others never bothered to baptize them at all. For example, slave-owner Desmoulins baptized Thomas, his black slave, at the age of sixty while Phillippe Vinet-Pr√©ville baptized his slave on the day of her death at the age of fifty-five. Due to their lowly status, many official documents have neglected to specify the kinds of jobs held by slaves. In the Census of 1666, for example, slaves are merely identified as \\"domestic engag√©\\" while the profession of other family members are specified to the reader. Luckily, some legal documents did provide information on the status of a slave, the nature of their tasks and sometimes, their hobbies and interests. For example, a smuggling trial in 1712 involving a free native slave named Joseph was recorded, providing a fascinating window into the world of free slave populations in Montreal. The legal document mentions that Joseph spent most of his days trading and negotiating with other free slaves from his neighborhood and that he had access to his slave-owner's canoe and sometimes travelled to the Pays d'en Haut with his native friends. Although it may not be a substantial amount of information, knowing that Joseph had friends and was able to have close relationships outside of his household humanizes him. Occasionally, testimonies and wills provide a glimpse into the intimate relationships between indigenous (or black) slaves and their owners. In 1721, a widow named Marie Claire Catoire wrote a will in which she confirmed her conditional manumission of her native slave Suzanne in exchange for the slave's servitude to her and her son Leonard for the remainder of their lives. Although Suzanne fulfilled this condition, Catoire added another condition to her slave's liberation: that Suzanne and her husband were \\"to practice the Roman Catholic religion and comport themselves as free persons of the French nation.\\" Efforts to \\"frenchify\\" indigenous or black slaves through clothing or conversion was not uncommon during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. For example, in 1731 a widow by the name of Marie LeRoy wrote a will expressing that her sauvagesse be given her \\"'habit de crepon', several 'aulnes' of white cloth with which might make 'coeffes', and a 'jupon' so that she might remember her for the remainder of her life, and live in Christian fashion\\". Personal history of slaves Pierre was one of the first recorded slaves in New France. In 1690, he appeared on the official hospital records at the age of 15. Between 1690 and 1692, his Jesuit master who identified Pierre as his \\"domestic\\" placed him twice in the care of the hospital. He was of Panis origin; initially captured in the Illinois territories, he belonged to the Jesuit missionaries of Quebec. Marie-Joachim was an enslaved Mesquaki (Fox) Indian who belonged to Julien Trottier dit Desrivieres, a wealthy merchant of Montreal. She was brought to Montreal as a slave around 1712 but only appeared in official records in 1725 at the age of 22 due to her involvement in a criminal trial. She was accused of stealing trade goods from her master's warehouse with the intention of giving them to her French lover. While she was sentenced to have her hands cut off, she was sold, instead to a master in Quebec City where she worked as a domestic slave. She eventually died a few years later in her late 20s. Marie-Marguerite was an enslaved Plains Indian who belonged to Marc-Antoine Huard de Dormicourt, a naval officer from Quebec City. Marie-Marguerite appeared in the record in 1740 in her late twenties when she sued Marc-Antoine Huard de Dormicourt for her freedom. Her trial ignited a debate within the population of New France because she was challenging the legality of her enslavement and forcing inhabitants to question the legal boundaries of slavery. Unfortunately for Marie-Marguerite, however, she lost her appeal and was sent to work on a Caribbean sugar plantation. Charlotte-Barbe was an enslaved Plains Indian who belonged to Governor Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois. Charlotte- Barbe appeared in the record in 1729 when she died at the age of 9. This governor held more than twenty enslaved natives at various times during his tenure. Marie-Joseph Ang√©lique was one of New France's most well known slaves. While pregnant, she set her mistress' house on fire for revenge or to divert the attention away from her escape. She ran away with the father of her child, who was also a black slave and belonged to another owner. The fire that she started ended up burning part of Montreal and a large portion of the H√¥tel- Dieu. Later on she was caught and sentenced to death. Marie Louise is a famous figure for black slaves in New France but more specifically on Ile Royale. She was the third enslaved woman to be freed on the island. On January 21, 1754, she married 25-year-old Louis Coustard who had arrived to Louisbourg three years earlier from the port of LaRochelle in France. He was the only white man to marry a black slave on Ile Royale. Prior to her marriage, Marie Louise had given birth to 7 illegitimate children, all of whom had to become slaves because she had not yet been free. With Louis she gave birth to two children, both of whom inherited free status from their father. Road to abolition A side effect of the Treaty of Paris was that Panis enslavement in North America greatly diminished and eventually disappeared at the turn of the century, most likely due to harsh economic conditions. In 1793, importing black slaves became prohibited in Upper Canada, but it was not until the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 that the institution finally was abolished in the entire British Empire, though on a gradual basis.

It is actually the initial cloudy juice of the olive drupes soon after crushing, separation and decanting and before final filtration. The oil is either filtered or stored in tanks to settle for weeks or months to allow sediments to be separated from the oil; this is known as racking. Once opened, unfiltered olive oil has a shorter life because the olive particles continue to ferment in the bottle.  Application  Although most commercially available olive oil in the world market is filtered, unfiltered olive oil is gaining increasing popularity amongst olive oil small scale producers, some chefs, and people who prefer a more \\"natural\\" aesthetic. They believe that this oil has superior sensory characteristics compared to filtered olive oil, because it is a less processed product.  Nature of cloudiness  Unfiltered olive has aspects of both a suspension and an emulsion. Plant material from olive drupes is suspended in oil due to lack of the filtering step, along with microdroplets of vegetative and non-vegetative water in small amounts (0.1‚Äì0.3%) forming in a water-oil emulsion. Unfiltered olive oil initially has higher levels of phenolics that form a complex polyphenol-protein complex. This complex interacts within the suspension/emulsion system and contributes to the formation and maintenance of the physicochemical properties of this oil. However, the presence of water in unfiltered oil leads to a more rapid hydrolysis of these water-associated phenolics, and also to hydrolysis of the triglycerides in the oil, and enzymes present in particles of olive fruit and pit and pathogens such as yeasts can accelerate the rate of degradation of the quality of the oil and increase the oil free acidity. The overall effect of filtration on olive oil durability is controversial, with different studies coming to different conclusions, and likely also depends on the specific systems used to filter the oil. The main phenolics found in olive oil are secoiridoids, hydroxytyrosol, and tyrosol, along with caffeic, vanillic, p-coumaric, syringic and p-hydroxy benzoic acids, 3-hydroxyphenylethanol and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol.‚ÄúPolyphenols in olive oils‚Äù. T. Gutfinger, Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society, Volume 58, Number 11, 966‚Äì968,  Natural cloudiness versus low-temperature cloudiness  Olive oil cloudiness resulting from sediments discussed in this article is different from the characteristic cloudiness of olive oil due to storage at low temperatures [REF]. This type of cloudiness is the result of congealing of triglycerides. When these oils are returned to room temperature, they become again transparent. Unfiltered olive oil has a cloudy appearance that can persist months after the oil has been returned to room temperature.

The settlement of the land began sometime 5000 years ago, during the Neolithic, as evidenced from various funeral monuments and dolmens sporadically situated in Lavra, Perafita, Le√ßa do Balio, Santa Cruz do Bispo, Guif√µes and S√£o Gens. At the end of the Bronze Age, much like most of the northwest peninsula, settlements expanded into proto-urban agglomerations at high altitudes (castros), associated with a culture with specific characteristics that predominated until the 1st century. Until today there still exist vestiges of castros dotting the landscapes, such as the assets collected from the Castro of Monte Castelo in Guif√µes. The natural conditions and navigability of the Le√ßa River estuary assisted maritime transport, that depended on the transport of a diverse flow of merchandise from throughout Imperial Roman. Here, the products were offloaded and redistributed to other sites within the region. Its position within the Roman Empire provoked profound changes to the territory's structure and settlement. The opening of new links (like the road between Cale and Bracara Augusta) and the construction of bridges (such as the Ponte da Pedra) resulted from a general policy of development, communication and commerce, associated with Pax Romana. The estuary of Le√ßa and the area of Lavra, therefore, became the most Romanized localities, as seen by the establishment of a villa and the constitution of production structures associated with sal production. When Portugal was established in the 12th century, a settlement in the territory had already existed for a time, Vila de Matesinum. One of the first official records referring to Matusiny dates from 1258, the result of Inquiries of Afonso III. At that time Matosinhos was a humble location, part of the parish of Sandim. During the late Middle Ages, the territory was marked by the foundation of monasteries and convents, such as the Monastery of Bou√ßas. This monastery, which had its origin in the 10th century, supported the growth of the settlement, and eventually became the administrative centre of the Julgado de Bou√ßas in the 13th century: the basis of the municipality of Matosinhos. Meanwhile, another medieval monument, the Monastery of Le√ßa do Balio, whose origin extended back to the 10th century, later (12th century) became the primitive seat of the Ordem Militar dos Cavaleiros Hospital√°rios (the Portuguese version of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta). The Order of Malt also maintained several other properties, that included monasteries of Lavra, Moreira and Aldoar. By the end of the 14th century, the small community of Franciscan friars installed themselves along the beach of Boa Nova, founding the Oratory of S√£o Clement das Penhas. This small convent would give rise to the Convent of Concei√ß√£o de Le√ßa, which was founded in the 15th century, where today the municipal park of Quinta da Concei√ß√£o exists. In the 16th century, Matosinhos received a foral (charter) attributed to King D. Manuel I in 1514, which made it assume an important position as an agro- producer and seat of many property-owners. Matosinhos, therefore, became a principal poles and suppliers of Porto, at a time when the parishes of Ramalde, Foz and Aldoar were part of the territory. During this time the actual Church of Matosinhos was built, where the image of the Bom Jesus (Good Jesus) was deposited at the Monastery of Bou√ßas. The growing importance of the cult resulted in a profound remodelling of the temple, under the direction of Italian architect Nicolau Nasoni, who had worked in estates of Chantre (Le√ßa do Balio) and Bispo (Santa Cruz do Bispo), as well as the Chapel of S√£o Francisco (in the Quinta do Concei√ß√£o). The growth of the cult, the devotion to the Senhor de Bou√ßas in Brazil, and expropriation of gold from the New World, was a determinant of the ambitious project to remodel the Monastery. As a port city, the settlement ideally placed to take advantage of the traffic during the Age of Discoveries, when many emigrants were looking to purchase land in the territory of Brazil. Many emigrants from Matosinhos, during the 17th century, founded the Confraria do S√£o Salvador de Bou√ßas and organized the cult of Bom Jesus, whose devotion grew with its invocation by emigrants travelling the ocean. In 1832, the army under the command of D. Pedro disembarked in Arnosa-Pampelido, and definitively implanted the flag of Liberalism in Portugal. At the same time, a fishing community had already begun to turn the coast of Matosinhos into an important centre for conserve industry, establishing a principal motor for development in the municipality, that would drive the economy until the late 20th century. In 1833, during the administrative reforms, the municipality of Bou√ßas was created, with its seat (after 1836) in the locality of Senhora da Hora, which was elevated to the category of Vila de Bou√ßas. It remained the seat until 1853, when the town of Matosinhos was established, which included the civil parishes of Matosinhos and Le√ßa da Palmeira, which became the municipal seat. The reorganization resulted in the reorganization of Bou√ßas, which began to incorporate parishes of Lavra and Perafita, which had been part of Maia, as well as the parishes of Le√ßa do Balio, Cust√≥ias and S√£o Mamede de Infesta (which were, until 1834, part of the old Couto de Le√ßa). In 1895, when they constructed the circulation roadway, the parishes of Aldoar, Ramalde and Nevogilde were de-annexed and integrated into the municipality of Porto. In 1909, the municipality solicited authorization to change its name to the municipality of Matosinhos, as locality of Bou√ßas had lost its significance: it was ratified on 6 May 1909. The need to establish a sheltered port, resulted in the construction of the Port of Leix√µes at the end of the 19th century. This marked the beginning of the process of the city's transformation, based on the sardine fishery and conserve industry, and the elevation of the town to the status of city on 28 May 1984. In 2005, the municipality funded a public sculpture to be built in the Waterfront Plaza of Matosinhos. The resulting sculpture is entitled She Changes Sculpture Magazine July‚ÄìAugust 2005 by American artist, Janet Echelman,She Changes Janet Echelman's website and spans the height of 50x150x150 meters.

Valbuena Abbey () is a former Cistercian monastery in Valbuena de Duero in Valladolid Province, Castile-Leon, Spain. It stands on the right bank of the Duero, within sight of the royal castle of Pe√±afiel.  History  Western facade of the sections of the monastery. The monastery was founded in 1143 by Estefan√≠a, daughter of Count Ermengol V of Urgell, and settled from Berdoues Abbey in France, of the filiation of Morimond. The first two abbots were Martin and Ebrardo. Valbuena received a number of privileges shortly after its foundation, and flourished to the point where it was able to settle three daughter houses of its own: Rioseco Abbey, founded in 1148; Bonaval Abbey, founded in 1164; and Palazuelos Abbey, founded in 1169. In the 14th century a decline set in. Valbuena remained a daughter house of Berdoues until 1430, when the Castilian Cistercian Congregation was established; thereafter it was a daughter house of Poblet Abbey. The abbey was dissolved under the anti-ecclesiastical Mendiz√°bal government in 1835. The church became a parish church. The site was used as Francoist concentration camp, operating at least from April to May 1939. The conventual buildings passed into private ownership and were eventually acquired by a Baron Kessel, who sold them to Juan Pardo, who looked after them until 1950, when the Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci√≥n acquired the site and buildings for settlement purposes. In 1967 the Archdiocese of Valladolid took possession of the monastery buildings, and in 1990 leased them to the foundation Las Edades del Hombre.  Buildings and site  Fa√ßade of the guest wing. The building complex, which was more or less complete by 1230, and most of which still stands, comprises the church, built from 1149 onwards, the conventual buildings, the guest wing, dormitories and the lay brothers' area. The groin- vaulted church of three aisles in four bays, with a barrel-vaulted transept and a crossing which was heightened in the Renaissance and covered with a cupola, is largely in accordance with the usual Cistercian building practice. The church also has an unusually large semi-circular apse, between two smaller semi-circular side apses, and also a rectangular side-chapel, built in 1165. The nave is in the early Gothic style. The west front has a portal with a pointed arch and several archivolts, over which is a large oculus in a blind arch. The chapter house and the day room are also groin-vaulted, while the refectory on the south side of the complex has a pointed barrel-vaulted roof of four bays. The cloister has two storeys. The Capilla San Pedro (\\"St. Peter's Chapel\\") contains an arcosolium with a mural of a king from the period of around 1270. The lay brothers' wing was removed in the Renaissance to make room for a second courtyard. By the river stand the ruins of the abbot's house, dating from the 16th century. The abbey was declared a national monument in 1931. Notes  References  * Herbosa, Vicente, 2003: El Rom√°nico en Valladolid.

After a concert career, she appeared at the Savoy Theatre in the first repertory seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan operas mounted by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1906‚Äì09, under the direction of the author. She is remembered as one of the last principal sopranos personally trained by W. S. Gilbert at the Savoy. In between engagements with D'Oyly Carte, Dow performed in concerts and operetta. After her retirement from the professional stage, she directed amateur productions of the Savoy Operas until she was in her seventies. Early life and career Dow was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk.Stone, David, Clara Dow, Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 31 May 2002, accessed 18 October 2009 She made her stage debut at the age of 16 in Hunstanton,The Times, 29 March 1969, p. 10 and went on to study at the Royal College of Music, where she made her London stage debut in 1900 as the Dewman in a student production of the opera Hansel and Gretel, conducted by Charles Villiers Stanford and directed by Richard Temple.The Times, 5 December 1903, p. 14 Dow became a professional oratorio and concert singer, appearing, for example, in a promenade concert at the Crystal Palace in 1905.The Times, 29 November 1905, p. 1 She joined the chorus of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company for its first London repertory season in December 1906.Rollins and Witts, pp 21‚Äì22, 124‚Äì26, 128, 130‚Äì31 Dow was soon promoted to small roles, playing Giulia in The Gondoliers and Kate in The Yeomen of the Guard in January 1907, also understudying and occasionally appearing in some of the leading roles. Dow (left) with C. H. Workman and Louie Ren√© in Patience, 1907 In April 1907, she was promoted to the title role in Patience, and by June 1907 she was also playing the leading soprano parts of Phyllis in Iolanthe and Elsie in Yeomen. Dow also played Gianetta in The Gondoliers in the latter part of the 1907 season. Dow later remembered that, while still a chorister, she had an opportunity to sing part of the role of Elsie for W. S. Gilbert at a rehearsal of The Yeomen of the Guard. The singer chosen by Helen Carte came from a grand opera background. \\"She had a beautiful voice, but poor diction, and Gilbert mumbled, 'I did not sit up all night for my words to be distorted by this d....d Italian method', with the result, the lady, at last reduced to tears, ran off the stage. I was immediately called out to continue her solo, and Gilbert said 'It's like coming out of a fog'.\\"Carte, Bridget D'Oyly. Foreword to Mander and Mitchenson From November 1907 to April 1908, she joined the D'Oyly Carte touring company, playing the soprano leads of Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore, Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance, Patience, Phyllis, the title role in Princess Ida, Yum-Yum in The Mikado, Elsie, and Gianetta. She returned to the Savoy for the second London repertory season, beginning in April 1908, appearing as Yum-Yum and later as Phyllis. The Times said that as Yum-Yum she \\"sang somewhat weakly, but she realized the part well\\".The Times, 29 April 1908, g. 12 The Observer found her \\"A Yum-Yum of undoubted charm\\".The Observer, 3 May 1908, p. 5 Her Phyllis again divided opinion. The Times said, \\"If only all Miss Clara Dow's notes were as true and sweet as a few of them are, she might have sung Phyllis as well as she acted it\\",The Times, 20 October 1908, p. 10 but The Observer wrote, \\"Miss Clara Dow as Phyllis was peculiarly satisfactory. The slight whiteness of her voice and what one may call the tartness of manner she is able to command made a real Phyllis of her, dainty, a little petulant, yet winning.\\" She rejoined the repertory touring company in November 1908, remaining with them for a year as principal soprano. The Times thought her \\"quite captivating\\" as Patience.The Times, 2 November 1909, p. 13 As the repertory seasons were the last seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan operas directed by Gilbert, Dow and Elsie Spain, who played soprano roles in the 1908‚Äì09 seasons, were the last D'Oyly Carte principal sopranos personally trained by W. S. Gilbert.Stedman, p. 326 et seq. At the end of that tour, Dow left the company and married an aviator, Wilfred Foulis.The Manchester Guardian, 28 November 1909, p. 11 At the time, the press reported that she would in future appear on the concert platform, rather than in opera, but she rejoined D'Oyly Carte in her old roles in July‚ÄìSeptember 1911. In 1912, Dow played Mimi in Oscar Straus's operetta, The Dancing Viennese at the London Coliseum.The Times, 3 July 1912, p. 10 From July 1913 to December 1914, she played her final series of engagements with D'Oyly Carte. The Manchester Guardian wrote that she sang Yum-Yum with \\"a sweet fluty tone and free vocal style\\".The Manchester Guardian, 24 March 1914, p. 11 Later years After her retirement, she remained fondly remembered by Gilbert and Sullivan fans. Reviewing a 1936 recording of The Mikado, the critic of The Gramophone commented, \\"Whenever Yum-Yum is mentioned I think of Clara Dow and find it hard to remember those who succeeded her.\\"The Gramophone , November 1936, p. 19 In retirement, she remained connected with Gilbert and Sullivan, directing amateur productions.

He made his MLB debut on April 1, 2013, with the Minnesota Twins. Career Minor leagues A switch hitter, Aaron was drafted by Minnesota Twins in the first round of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft out of Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, California. In his first professional season, Hicks was tabbed a 2008 Baseball America Rookie All-Star and named the top prospect in the Twins' organization. He batted .318 with four home runs, 27 runs batted in, twelve stolen bases and 28 walks for the Gulf Coast League Twins to earn a Gulf Coast League postseason All-Star nod. In 2009, Hicks batted .251 with four home runs, 29 RBIs, ten steals and 40 walks for the Beloit Snappers. He returned to Beloit in 2010 and hit .279 with eight home runs. Playing for the Fort Myers Miracle in 2011, he hit .242 with five home runs. In 2012, he hit .286 with 13 home runs for the New Britain Rock Cats. After being sent down from the major leagues in August, for the 2013 season in AAA he batted .222 with the Rochester Red Wings. Aaron was a top 100 prospect by Baseball America four times. Minnesota Twins 2013 Minnesota Twins in 2013 On March 24, 2013, it was announced that Hicks would be the starting center fielder for the Minnesota Twins. He chose his new number to honor Dave Winfield, who wore 32 for the Twins. He was sent down to AAA on August 1, and was not called back up in 2013. In 2013, Hicks batted .192 in 281 at bats, with a .259 on-base percentage. Jim Souhan of the Star Tribune wrote that he became: \\"the latest unpaid spokesman for the Public Service Announcement that reminds baseball fans not to believe anything they see in spring training.\\" 2014 Despite his underwhelming 2013 performance, Hicks was named the starting center fielder for the 2014 season amid protest and controversy. Hicks' 2014 season did not show improvement at the plate. Through 47 games, Hicks hit .201 and was demoted to Double A on June 9. Hicks gave up switch hitting during the 2014 season due to a lack of confidence in his ability to bat left-handed.http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on- baseball/24572913/aaron-hicks-will-stop-switch-hitting-due-to-lack-of- confidence-from-left-side However, he went back to switch hitting less than a month later. 2015 For the 2015 season, Hicks hit .256 with 11 home runs and 33 RBIs in 97 games. New York Yankees On November 11, 2015, the Twins traded Hicks to the New York Yankees for John Ryan Murphy. The Yankees targeted Hicks due to his athleticism, strong throwing arm, and ability to hit left-handed pitching. 2016 During a game against the Oakland Athletics on April 20, 2016, Hicks made a throw that nabbed Danny Valencia at home plate for an out. The throw was recorded at , the fastest throwing speed recorded by Statcast. In 123 games of 2016, Hicks batted .217 with eight home runs and 31 RBI. 2017 Hicks's torrid start to the 2017 season has given many reason to believe he may be in the midst of a breakout year. In early June, with just 154 at bats, Hicks had already hit more home runs (10) and RBIs (34) than in all of last season. As of June 9 he ranked seventh in the majors in both OBP and OPS. On April 13, 2017, Hicks hit two home runs; one batting left handed and one batting right handed. He drove in all three runs as the Yankees won 3-2 over the Tampa Bay Rays. Hicks suffered an oblique injury in late June, causing him to go on the 10-day disabled list. On September 3, Hicks was again placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a left oblique injury. He returned from the DL on September 26. Hicks ended the season with 15 home runs, 52 RBIs, and a .266 average, all career highs. 2018 On March 30, 2018, the Yankees placed Hicks on the 10-day disabled list due to a strained right intercostal muscle. He was reinstated from the DL on April 12 and hit an inside-the-park home run against the Detroit Tigers on the next day. Hicks would hit another inside-the-park-home run against the Kansas City Royals on May 19, becoming the first Yankee since Mickey Mantle in 1958 to hit two inside-the-park-home runs in a single season. On July 1, Hicks hit three home runs in one game against the Boston Red Sox. Hicks ended the season with 27 home runs, 79 RBIs, and 119 hits, all career highs. 2019 On January 11, 2019, Hicks signed a one-year, $6 million contract to remain with the Yankees. On February 25, Hicks signed a seven-year, $70 million contract extension, replacing the one-year deal. The deal includes a $12.5 million club option for 2026, a $1 million buyout and a $2 million signing bonus. He began the 2019 year on the 10-day injured list due to a lower back strain. On May 6, he was optioned to the Tampa Tarpons for a rehab assignment. On June 24, against the Blue Jays, Hicks hit a home run that helped the Yankees tie a league record with 27 straight games hitting a home run. On June 29, 2019, Hicks became the first MLB player to hit a home run in Europe during the first inning of the Red Sox-Yankees 2019 London Series. On September 10, Hicks left the game with an elbow injury. It was revealed that Hicks was diagnosed with a right flexor strain in his right elbow since August 3, and that Tommy John surgery would be necessary to correct the problem. The Yankees ruled Hicks out for the rest of 2019 due to his elbow injury. On October 11, 2019, Aaron Hicks told a New York Post reporter that he would be on the ALCS roster against the Houston Astros. The following day, the Yankees announced that they had reinstated Hicks from the 60-day injured list and added him to the roster, replacing Luke Voit. He revealed that after his Tommy John surgery recommendation, he had decided not to have surgery immediately and engaged in light physical activity on his own. After a week, he visited the Yankees‚Äô spring training complex to work out his elbow. Following a few weeks of regular exercise, it was determined that he would not in fact require surgery and he joined his team on the road in Houston. He later underwent the surgery, and was expected to miss 8-10 months.  2020  With COVID-19 pandemic delaying the start of the season by over 4 months, Hicks was able to return to play in the intra-squad scrimmage match just 8 months post surgery. In 54 games, Hicks batted .225 with six home runs and 21 RBIs.

Musbury Brook flows through its length, and its south side is flanked and dominated by Musbury Tor. In the 14th century it was part of the Earl of Lincoln's hunting park. Most of the Musbury valley is now sheep grazing pasture. To the south is Musbury Tor and Alden Valley; to the north- west is Musbury Heights and, beyond, the Grane Valley. Beginning as Long Grain Water on Musden Head Moor, the stream becomes Musbury Brook after its confluence with Short Grain Water. It flows in a north-westerly direction to join the River Ogden, a tributary of the River Irwell. Musbury Park In 1305 a huge ditch and earth bank were dug to enclose a large area that included most of the west side of Musbury township (later becoming Helmshore). A palisade of oak stakes created a fence on the outside of the ditch which extended from Grane Valley in the north to Alden Valley in the south. This created an enclosure to keep in fallow deer for the estate of Hugh de Lacy, and supplying venison for his table. Musbury Valley was at the heart of the deer park, which covered 1,713 acres, and the area was known as Musbury Park. Although deer parks were very fashionable at the beginning of the 14th century, by the middle of the century many parks were in decline, hastened by the introduction of the Black Death. From 1480 no park-keepers were employed, and in 1507 a survey reported that the park was closed down. The old park area was then divided into eight different holdings, four of which included sections of Musbury valley. The process of enclosing parts of the old park and Musdenhead, at the head of the valley and which had been outside the boundaries of the park, continued through the 16th and 17th centuries. By the first detailed map in the 1840s there were well over 20 farms in the valley. Farming During the period after the decline of the hunting park most people in the valley made a living combining farming and textile making. Raising cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry, and growing a few cereal crops on their land. Inventories in the 17th/early 18th centuries show corn, oats and barley being grown. There is a tradition of illegal Musbury whisky distilling too. In 1881 James Barlow, known as 'Musbury Jim' was caught at Hare Clough with a whisky still. He was fined ¬£10. Several farms near Hare Clough were raided by excise men in the 1880s and there are stories of distilling in Musbury throughout the 19th century. The moorland also gave the farming community turbary rights, this being the ability to take peat from the upper moorland peat beds for fuel. Sods of peat could also be used for repairing banks, although stone quarrying meant that walls could be built from the stone taken from the moorland. These dry stone walls are still characteristic of the area. Textiles From the 16th to the 18th century, textile production was small-scale and complemented the farming work. Tannery work also developed, tanning leather, and Tan Pits is a name still given to the Helmshore end of the valley. But in the 18th century, the textile industry developed rapidly, with the brook providing a source of water-power. In 1790 the first mill was built at Tan Pits, and others soon joined them. The first mills were used for carding wool, or fulling and finishing woollen cloth, but a change from wool to cotton started soon after 1800. This developed first in Alden Valley, but soon the Turner family began building much larger mills in the Musbury area and by the early 19th century they were one of the largest textile firms, and had several mills in the township of Musbury. William Turner died in 1852, while the Porritt family were developing Sunnybank and for a while, during the cotton famine, things were less secure in the Musbury mills. However, the new owners, the Ashworths, expanded Turner's Middle Mill and were soon employing 200 workers in their mills. The older mills in Musbury began to disappear after 1850, as production switched from the outlying districts to the new village that was growing up in Helmshore, and this pattern continued to be the case. In 1883 the unit of local government known as Musbury was abolished and it became known as Helmshore. During the 20th century the textile industry declined severely, and most of the mills were closed. After WWII the remaining companies pooled resources and opened a research centre which, in 1956 moved across Holcombe Road into a new building, but this finally closed in 1981. Water Board The farms at the head of the valley fell in to disuse relatively early, and the Porritt family, who had rights to shoot in the surrounding moorland, built kennels in the garden of Longfield House, which had been built about 1800 by the Worsick family. But in 1929 the Porritts left Helmshore and in 1934 they sold their land ‚Äì 806 acres ‚Äì in Musbury valley to the Irwell Valley Water Board. A plan to flood the valley and create a reservoir was developed throughout the 1950s. During this period much of the valley was abandoned and fell into disrepair, but access remained available and so it became a popular picnic and walking area. The reservoir was never built. Heavy rain in July 1964 caused a flood which destroyed much of the brook-side footpath at the bottom of the valley. Musbury Heights On the north-west side of the valley is Musbury Heights. Between 1850 and 1931, this area was an extensive quarry working the Lower Haslingden Flag. It is now disused but has been tidied by the Rossendale Groundwork Valley of Stone project. The ruins of several buildings and a (rebuilt) Scrubbing Mill chimney remain, along with a number of spoil heaps and old workings, including an extensive tramway system, including an incline. The quarry produced mainly road setts (cobbles), kerbstones and flagstones.  Gallery  File:Musb valley.jpg|Looking into the valley from the path following the brook.

The S-PRISM represents GEH's Generation IV reactor solution to closing the nuclear fuel cycle and is also part of its Advanced Recycling Center (ARC) propositionTestimony to the U.S. Congress: Full Committee Hearing - Advancing Technology for Nuclear Fuel Recycling: What Should Our Research, Development and Demonstration Strategy Be? to U.S. Congress to deal with nuclear waste.GE Energy press release. June 18, 2009 S-PRISM is a commercial implementation of the Integral Fast Reactor developed by Argonne National Laboratory between 1984 and 1994. It is a sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor, based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) design, scaled up by a factor of ten. The design utilizes reactor modules, each having a power output of 311 MWe, to enable factory fabrication at low cost. In an identical fashion to the EBR-II that it is based on, the reactor would transition to a much lower power level whenever temperatures rise significantly, moreover the reactor vessel modules are pool type, as opposed to loop type, with the pool conferring substantial thermal inertia and the final key safety feature includes a \\"RVACS\\", which is a passive reactor vessel air cooling system to remove decay heat. These safety systems are passive and therefore always operate and are to prevent core damage when no other means of heat removal are available. Integral fast reactor The integral fast reactor was developed at the West Campus of the Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho and was the intended successor to the Experimental Breeder Reactor II, which achieved first criticality in 1965 and ran for 30 years. The Integral Fast Reactor project was shut down by the U.S. Congress in 1994. Possible US demonstration reactor In October 2010, GEH signed a memorandum of understanding with the operators of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Savannah River site, which should allow the construction of a demonstration reactor prior to the design receiving full NRC licensing approval. UK interest in PRISM In October 2011, The Independent reported that the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and senior advisers within the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) had asked for technical and financial details of the PRISM, partly as a means of reducing the country's plutonium stockpile. In July 2012, GEH submitted a feasibility report to the NDA showing that the PRISM could provide a cost-effective way of quickly dealing with the UK's plutonium stockpile. The feasibility report includes an assessment from the consultancy firm DBD Limited suggesting there are \\"no fundamental impediment(s)\\" to the licensing of the PRISM in the UK. A 2012 Guardian article pointed out that a new generation of fast reactors such as the PRISM \\"could dispose of the waste problem, reducing the threat of radiation and nuclear proliferation, and at the same time generate vast amounts of low-carbon energy\\". David J. C. MacKay, chief scientist at the DECC, was quoted as saying that British plutonium contains enough energy to run the country's electricity grid for 500 years. In the years that were to follow, analysis refocused on metal chloride e.g. Plutonium(III) chloride, to aid in greater \\"nuclear waste\\" closed-fuel cycle capabilities, the Stable Salt Reactor (SSR) concept promoted by MOLTEX, was found to be the most competitive for Small modular reactor development by a British-based consultancy firm Energy Process Development in 2015.Europe: Moltex‚Äô Stable Salt ReactorMoltex Energy sees UK, Canada SMR licensing as springboard to Asia Jun 28, 2016 Possible role in the Versatile Test Reactor program In 2018 PRISM was selected by Batelle to support the DOE decision making on the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) program. In February 2019, DOE expected to complete the initial stage of deciding whether to proceed with the VTR within a few weeks.

Stobo Kirk History Early history The Cedar of Lebanon entrance door Jesus Christ blessing children, one of the stained glass windows in Stobo Kirk It is believed there has been a church on the site of present-day Stobo Kirk since as early as the 6th century. St Kentigern, otherwise known as St Mungo, founded many churches during his time as Archbishop of the ancient kingdom of Strathclyde, and Stobo is believed to be one of his foundations. Stobo was originally the 'plebania' or mother church with subordinate chapelries or churches at Dawyck, Drumelzier, Kingledoors, Tweedsmuir, Broughton, Glenholm, and Lyne.Groome; p. 1526 Medieval times A new church, the ancestor of the present building, was built in the 12th century, but during the 15th and 16th centuries, the Scottish people were becoming weary of the rule of Rome. The church was becoming wealthy but the people were still poor and many voices spoke of reforming the church in Scotland.http://www.reformation-scotland.org.uk/articles/john-knox-scottish- reformation.php John Knox and the Scottish Reformation by Scott Melhuish The people of Stobo were no different and when their canon, Adam Colquhoun,http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0931&type;=P University of Glasgow Story was succeeded by one of his two sons, it helped fuel the desire for a reformed church. Post Reformation Stobo, part of the Parish of Stobo in the Diocese of Glasgow until the Protestant Reformation, appears to have retained much of the original 12th-century building, including windows, the nave and chancel, unlike many other Roman Catholic churches which were destroyed after the coming of the reformed religion. The tower was raised above first-floor level in the 16th century, and further major restoration was carried out in 1863http://www.ramshornstudio.com/stobo_kirk.htm Stobo Kirk by John Lessels, an eminent 19th-century architect.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200066 John Lessels, Edinburgh Architect Further major restoration work was carried out in 1929.

Merlin had fled to the forest after Gwenddoleu had been defeated and killed at the battle of Arderydd near Arthuret in 573. There is a great rock at the spot known as the 'Altar Stone' and a stained glass window in Stobo Kirk commemorates the event. Description of the kirk building Both the church and the graveyard are B listed. Porch The Jougs on the porch wall The porch was added in the late 15th‚Äì16th century and is notable for the grooves in the left-hand doorjamb, created by pupils sharpening their slate pencils before class and possibly by the sharpening of arrow heads prior to the weekly after-church archery practice which became compulsory after the disaster of the Battle of Flodden. The 12th-century Norman entrance into the nave has a door made from a single board of cedar wood from the nearby Dawyck estate.Seymour, Page 1 On the outer entrance hangs the old Jougs used to punish recalcitrant members of the parish until some time in the 18th century. Nave A much damaged Celtic cross was found in the stonework during restoration and a reconstruction has been placed in the nave. The red paint on the stonework is a reminder of the original brightly painted character of pre-Reformation churches.Seymour, p. 3 North aisle chapel The kirk tower thumb Reconstructed in a style reminiscent of the Arts and Crafts Movement, in the erroneous belief that this was the site of Saint Kentigern's Chapel, the structure incorporates a standing stone in the wall. It was probably a chantry or mortuary aisle of the 15th century.Seymour, p. 4 The 14th burial slab of Robert Vesey, and others of a local miller and a knight in armour are preserved in the aisle. The altar stone may be linked to the conversion of Merlin Sylvestris by Saint Kentigern (Mungo). Tower The tower may be 12th-century in origin; however, it has been rebuilt several times. It gave access to the 'Laird's Loft' and now contains a meeting room as well as the vestry. Blocked-up windows of a likely 16th-century date are present. Brass hanging lamps The Balfour family of Stobo Castle presented a number of brass hanging lamps to the kirk and one of these has been identified as being manufactured in Nuremberg by Hans Muller between 1693 and 1701. The others are copies or by other Nuremberg craftsmen.Seymour; p. 5 'Stobo Kirk' by James McIntosh Patrick The kirk is the subject of paintings by the 20th-century Scottish landscape painter James McIntosh Patrick (1907-98), including the well-known 'Stobo Kirk' (1936) in the City Art Centre, Edinburgh.

It had remarkable impact on the society, politics, culture, art and architecture of Germany and roughly coincided with the Belle √âpoque era of Western Europe. Characteristics By Wilhelminism is not meant a conception of society associated with the name Wilhelm, and traceable to an intellectual initiative of the German Emperor. Rather, it relates to the image presented by Wilhelm II, and his demeanour, manifested by the public presentation of grandiose military parades, and self- aggrandisement on his part, this latter tendency having already been noticed by his grandfather Emperor Wilhelm I during the period that Wilhelm‚Äôs father Frederick was Crown Prince. The term Wilhelminism also characterizes the social and cultural climate of the reign of Wilhelm II, which found expression in rigidly conservative attitudes relying on the Prussian Junker landowners and associated in the German Agrarian League. Thereby resembling the Victorian era in the United Kingdom, at the same time, the period was distinguished by an extraordinary belief in progress, which, while contributing to the enormous prosperity of the highly industrialised German Empire, was at odds with its social conservatism. Though Bismarcks's Anti-Socialist Laws were not renewed, Wilhelm's government continued to implement measures against Socialist ideas. Nevertheless, the Social Democratic Party continued to grow in strength and became the largest faction in the Reichstag parliament upon the 1912 elections. With stronger influence, the internal developments were characterised by an increasing loyalty of the party establishment towards Emperor and Reich; an attitude that was condemned as \\"revisionism\\" by its opponents and culminated in the Burgfrieden policy of granting loans to fund the German effort in World War I. Foreign policies were founded on Wilhelm's imperialist ambitions and directed towards the establishment of Germany as a world power (Weltmacht); the desire for a \\"place in the sun\\" as coined by Secretary of State Bernhard von B√ºlow was shared by a large number of German citizens and intellectuals. German nationalism achieved a short-lived high point, following the acquisition of some colonial possessions on the African continent and in the South Seas, while external relations deteriorated: in 1890, Germany had refused to prolong the secret Reinsurance Treaty with Russia, concluded by Bismarck in 1887, and had to witness the forming of the Franco-Russian Alliance presenting a new two-front war scenario. The relations with the British were not only strained by the \\"Scramble for Africa\\" but also by the Anglo-German naval arms race. Wilhelm‚Äôs fascination for the German Navy, and his ambition to see it established as an instrument for the projection of world power, were reflected in everyday German life. Still until the middle of the twentieth century, boys were dressed in sailor suits, and in this way were impressed at an early age with the Navy‚Äôs aura and prestige. Prussian Pickelhauben The distinctive spiked helmet, the so-called Pickelhaube, although it had existed previously, and not only in the German Empire, was symbolic for the Wilhelmine period, for the Imperial Army, and German militarism in general (in various sign languages, the extended forefinger placed in front of the forehead, indicating the spiked helmet, is still the sign for ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù). The term is equally applied to the distinctive styles prevailing in the visual arts and architecture of the period, for example the ornate Germania postage stamps,Germania Issue - 1900 numerous government buildings as well as the Wilhelmine Ring housing areas of Berlin and many other German cities. It is also used to describe, among other things, an essentially Neo-Baroque, extraordinarily prestige-oriented style calculated to give expression to the German state‚Äôs claim to imperial power. This style was particularly exemplified by the grandiose Siegesallee, a boulevard of sculptures lampooned by Berliners as Puppenallee (‚Äúmall of dolls‚Äù), and was given official status by Wilhelm‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúRinnsteinrede‚Äú (‚Äúgutter speech‚Äù) on what he considered modernist degenerate art at the inauguration of the extravagant boulevard on December 18, 1901.

The population of the CDP was 46 at the 2010 census. The CDP is located along Farm Road 3073 in northwestern Jim Hogg County, southwest of Hebbronville, the county seat. The CDP takes its name from an unincorporated community near the western border of Jim Hogg County, at the junction of Farm Roads 649 and 3073, west of the Thompsonville CDP and southwest of Hebbronville. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community was probably named after Jim Hogg County's first sheriff, Oscar Thompson. Thompsonville's history dates back to the 1910s. The first commercial oil well in the county began producing oil on April 17, 1921. The well was located in the Mirando Valley field near Thompsonville and brought new residents to the area. A post office in 1925, but was discontinued around 1936. A school and several businesses were located at the site in the late 1940s.

In the early part of the twentieth century, the shafts at Quincy Mine were increasing in depth at a prodigious rate as the company pushed farther underground in search of copper. Between 1905 and 1920, the depth of the principal shafts increased from 5000 feet to over 7000.Survey number HAER MI-2, p. 456 The requirements to lift rock to the surface from ever-increasing depths severely strained the capabilities of the company's mine hoist equipment.Survey number HAER MI-2, p. 457 By 1916, the hoist servicing the number 2 shaft had reached its depth limit.Survey number HAER MI-2, p. 461 Rather than abandon the shaft or eke out a little more depth by retrofitting the existing hoist, Quincy hired the Nordberg Manufacturing Company and Bruno V. Nordberg to design a new hoist engine at a cost of $160,000. It would be the largest mine hoist in the world. Quincy contracted for delivery of the Nordberg engine in early 1917, but World War I intervened, delaying receipt until late 1919. In the meantime, a hoist house was designed by J. H.

Widely known as Bandarpoonch, literally \\"tail of the monkey\\", its name is inspired by the mythological tale in which Hanuman, the monkey god, extinguishes his tale, after it catches fire during the battle between King Rama and Ravana in Lanka, by going to the summit of the mountain. Bandarpunch is located at the western edge of the high Himalayan range where it turns the corner to the northwest. It is part of the Sankari Range and lies within the Govind Pashu Vihar National Park and Sanctuary. It is a major watershed for the headwaters of the Yamuna River, whose source lies above Yamunotri, on the west end of the massif below White Peak. Yamunotri is the westernmost of the four most sacred pilgrimage places (Chota Char Dham) and destination for thousands of pilgrims annually. On the north side of the Bandapoonch massif, the 12 km long glacier from its flanks feeds the Ruinsar Gad which flows into the Yamuna at Seema. On the south side, the glacier at the base of Bandarpoonch peak feeds the Hanuman Ganga River which joins the Yamuna at Hanuman Chatti. Bandarpunch massif has 3 peaks. To the west above Yamunotri is White Peak (6102 m). Almost 5 km east is Bandarpoonch Peak (6316 m) and about 4 km to the north-east of that is Kalanag (6387 m) lit. black serpent, commonly known as Black Peak. Major General Harold Williams led the first successful climbing expedition in 1950. The first team to summit Bandarpoonch Peak comprised legendary mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, Sergeant Roy Greenwood and Sherpa Kin Chok Tshering.

Despite many years in France, he remained unattracted to Impressionism, preferring instead the Naturalism of painters such as Jules Bastien-Lepage. He also rejected the idea of creating landscapes en plein aire. Biography Both of his parents, Johan Edvard Bergh and Amanda Helander (1825‚Äì1888), were artists and, presumably, his first teachers. He began his formal studies with Edvard Pers√©us, at his private school then, from 1878 to 1881, at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. His first works were scenes from Swedish history, painted in the Academic style. In 1881, he went to Paris, where he took lessons from Jean-Paul Laurens at the Acad√©mie Colarossi. His first exhibition at the Salon came in 1883 and he completed his studies in 1884. The following year, he and his friend, Ernst Josephson, became members of the Nordic art colony at Grez-sur-Loing. That same year, he joined with the Swedish artists who became known as the opponents (Opponenterna); a group that was protesting what they felt were the outmoded teaching methods at the Academy. Shortly after, they created the Artists' Association (Konstn√§rsf√∂rbundet) and Bergh became its Secretary. In 1886, he married Helena Maria Klemming (1863‚Äì1889), the daughter of a bookseller. Their daughter, Amie, was born the same year. He had painted her portrait in 1885, and she would serve as his model on many occasions over the course of their short marriage. Never in good health, Helena declined after Amie's birth and he became interested in attending s√©ances. When she felt death approaching, they returned to Stockholm, at her request, and she died there from what is simply described as an \\"incurable disease\\". Not long after, he caught pneumonia and came close to death himself. During a long convalescence, one of those who cared for him was Gerda Winkrans (1864‚Äì1919), whose father was a local Rector. He married her in 1890. In 1893, Bergh and his family moved to Varberg, where he had plans to establish an artists' colony. Together with Nils Kreuger and Karl Nordstr√∂m, old friends of his from the Academy, a new style of landscape painting was created which became known as the Varberg School (Varbergsskolan). He also found himself more attracted to Romantic Nationalism; a predilection that was strengthened by a stay in Italy from 1897 to 1898, where the art he observed impressed him as representing exactly the opposite. The painter Hedvig Hamilton studied with him in Stockholm. In 1904, he decided to settle in Stor√§ngen, Nacka Municipality (now part of Stockholm). He engaged the architect Albin Brag to design his home, now known as the Villa Bergh at V√§rmd√∂v√§gen. He and Gerda would live there until their deaths. Despite this apparent retirement, in 1915 he accepted an appointment as curator ('√ñverintendent) and Director of the Nationalmuseum; spending his last years on a modernization project that featured new purchasing guidelines. During those years, he also wrote numerous essays on art and an account of his participation with the Opponenterna. His works may be seen at the G√∂teborgs konstmuseumG√∂teborgs konstmuseum, NationalmuseumNationalmuseum, Nordiska museetNordiska museet, Uppsala University LibraryUppsala universitetsbibliotek, Thiel Gallery, Malm√∂ konstmuseum, LivrustkammarenLivrustkammarent and Prins Eugens WaldemarsuddePrins Eugens Waldemarsudde.

Suddenly the thinker no longer believes in anything, everything seeming like a fabrication. Thought becomes meaningless and a feeling akin to vertigo is experienced. Many writers have described this feeling as \\"the void\\" or as a \\"crisis of postmodernism\\". Another term which has a similar meaning is anomie. Whereas a crisis of postmodernism describes the thought or meaning of viewing existence as a false construct and the void creates a metaphoric representation and Anomie refers to the philosophical dead end, Post-modern vertigo more specifically has been used to refer to this feeling when it takes on a physiological manifestation, causing an increase in heart rate and sweating.

Detail of the frieze and the tondoes. Ospedale del Ceppo is a medieval hospital in Pistoia, Tuscany, central Italy. History According to tradition, the Ospedale was founded in 1277 by the company of Santa Maria or \\"del Ceppo dei poveri\\" (\\"The offering trunk of the poor\\").\\"Con il termine 'Ceppo' si indicava nell'antichit√† il tronco di legno cavo in cui venivano raccolte le offerte destinate agli indigenti\\" (\\"The term ceppo (cfLatin cippus) indicated in times past the hollowed tree trunk in which were collected offerings intended for the poverty-stricken\\") (Il Ceppo dei Poveri di Prato). In 1345 documents mention ongoing works for a new cloister, oratory and domus (residence for women). It became the main city's hospital after the donations received in the wake of the Black Death of 1348. Initially given to the cathedral chapter, from 1350 the commune of Pistoia tried to absorb direction of the company. After the conquest of Pistoia by the Republic of Florence (1401), the Florentines officially confirmed the lay status of the hospital. In 1456 the hospital administrators commissioned the Florentine architect Michelozzo di Bartolomeo a restoration of the building. The election of the spedalingo (rector) was often contended between the noble Pistoiese families, sometimes causing popular turmoil such as in 1498. In 1494 the Compagnia del Ceppo was expelled in 1494, the hospital administrated by the communal priori. In 1501 the hospital was submitted to the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence; the Florentine spedalingo, Leonardo Buonafede, ordered in this period the realization of the frieze which is now the main feature of the monumental fa√ßade. In 1784 Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany aggregated the hospital to a new entity including the other Pistoiese hospital of San Gregorio, the Spedali Riuniti di Pistoia, the spedalingo returning to be a Pistoiese.  Description  The current complex is the result of a series of additions and restorations of the original 13th-century edifice, which corresponds to today's corsia di Sant'Atto, a large ward with big windows now existing in a 16th-century renovation. In the 15th century the wing and the current fa√ßade were added, with the Renaissance arcaded loggia built in 1502, inspired by the Ospedale degli Innocenti at Florence. The loggia is decorated by a ceramic glaze frieze executed from 1525 by Santi Buglioni: it portrays the seven works of mercy, mixed with scenes of the Virtues. A panel was replaced in 1586 by a new one, not in ceramic glaze. Also from 1525 are the tondoes by Giovanni della Robbia, depicting the Annunciation, the Glory of the Virgin, the Visitation and the Medici coat of arms. The corsia di San Leopoldo (\\"Ward of St. Leopold\\"), now the seat of the Pistoia Medical Academy, was originally intended for the contagious patients.

However, he also wrote Urdu prose and was a staunch believer in the importance of the Persian language to enhance one's knowledge about the world. Early life and career Khursheed Kamal Aziz was born on 11 December 1927 to Abdul Aziz, a barrister and a historian in his own right. He was born in a town called Ballamabad, Chiniot, Punjab, British India.Ballamabad city of Pakistan Ballamabad town, Chiniot, Punjab, Pakistan on newstrackindia.com website, Retrieved 5 July 2020 He received his early education from M.B. High School in Batala, Punjab and then went to first Forman Christian College and finally to Government College Lahore for further studies where one of his professors was the famed Patras Bokhari. Later he completed his studies at Victoria University in Manchester, UK. Aziz taught at various reputed institutions such as the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford, UK, and at universities in Heidelberg, Germany as well as in Khartoum, Sudan and the Punjab University in Lahore, Pakistan. He also delivered occasional lectures at universities in Pakistan: Karachi, Peshawar, Islamabad; Bangladesh: Dacca; United Kingdom: Hull, New Castle upon Tyne and Oxford; Switzerland: Geneva and Bergen. He worked briefly, in the early 1970s, as an advisor to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and was the chairman of the 'National Commission on Historical and Cultural Research' but he later fell out with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and his regime and left that position. Some years later, he returned his \\"Sitara-i- Imtiaz\\" Award awarded by the President of Pakistan in protest of his treatment by the Martial Law authorities after General Zia-ul-Haq took over power in 1977 and was forced to leave the country. He lived many years abroad as an exile and taught at many universities abroad. He began to collect his research material for his many famous books while he was teaching in Germany. His research material was enriched by the experiences he had while living in many different countries abroad. Death and legacy He died in Lahore, Pakistan at the age of 81, on 15 July 2009. K. K. Aziz had returned from abroad to Lahore, Pakistan only in 2008, a year before his death. His wife, Zarina Aziz, said in an interview to a Pakistani newspaper, after his death, that he had been somewhat sick for about last 5 years but had continued to work for 10 hours daily to write and finish his books. He had written over 50 history books in his lifetime and used to say to her that his books were his children and would keep his name alive. In 2014, per a major Pakistani newspaper columnist, some young Pakistanis are starting to give K. K. Aziz credit for helping them have a balanced view of Pakistan's history. Now, at least, they got a chance to look at the history of Pakistan from a point of view other than the 'only slanted view laced with extreme ideological narratives' in the text books they studied at school and college. Pakistani people themselves and also the world at large, have the ability to sort out the truth, on individual basis, after reading many and different points of view on the history of Pakistan. Since the mid 1990s, some historians and intellectuals in Pakistan have slowly and surely tried to develop a more rational and balanced view of Pakistani history. . Literary works Aziz had a profound love for words and writing. He authored 44 valuable books on the modern history of the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. He had a unique style of writing that stimulated readers' thought process. He wrote on many significant issues related to Pakistan and also came up with volumes of significant details on important dignitaries who helped in shaping the history of the Indian subcontinent.
