MAN Diesel & Turbo view from Lueginslandbastion  Products   Marine Engines  MAN marine engine Two-Stroke engines are developed at the company's base in Copenhagen, Denmark, and have a range of outputs from 2 MW to 90 MW. In view of their size, the engines are manufactured by international licensees in the immediate vicinity of dockyards, and propel large container vessels, freighters and oil tankers. Low-speed diesel engines do not require a transmission system because they are directly connected to the propellers by drive shafts. MAN Diesel & Turbo also offers medium-speed four-stroke engines that cover a performance range from 450 kW to 21,600 kW and can be operated using liquid or gaseous fuel. Medium-speed engines are deployed to propel all types of merchant vessels, but are also used in passenger ships thanks to their compact nature and their amenability to flexible mounting. As well as cruise liners, other areas of use for medium-speed engines include specialist vessels such as tugs, dredgers or cable-laying ships. Smaller medium-speed four-stroke engines are also used in high-speed ferries and naval vessels.  Turbocharger  MAN Diesel & Turbo builds exhaust-gas turbochargers for high charging pressures with single-stage radial and axial turbines. The performance spectrum of these chargers, which are used both in two-stroke and four-stroke marine engines and in stationary systems, ranges from around 300 kW to 30,000 kW of engine power.  Power Plants  In the stationary sector, MAN diesel engines are primarily used for power plants and emergency power supplies. MAN Diesel & Turbo products range from small emergency power generators to turnkey power plants with outputs of up to 400 MW. The range of stationary systems comprises four-stroke engines with a unit output of 450 kW to 21,600 kW and two-stroke engines for unit outputs of up to 80,000 kW. MAN diesel engines are operated using heavy fuel oil, diesel, gas or renewable fuels such as Jatropha oil, animal fat or recycled vegetable oils. Under the brand MAN Power Management, the firm supplies integrated solutions for the management, operation and maintenance of diesel-fueled power plants.

Early life A son of Wolf Krotoshinsky, he was born in Plotsk, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire, and came to New York City in 1912 in order to escape service in the Russian Army. He initially worked as a barber \\"I ran away from Russia and came to America to escape military service. I hated Russia, its people, its government, in particular its cruel and inhuman treatment of Jews. Such a Government I refused to serve. \\" War service Krotoshinsky undertook initial training at Camp Upton, where he enjoyed his time in the Army. Shortly after his arrival in France, the 77th division was sent to relieve the 42nd Infantry Division in the Lorraine, where the German Army sent up a welcome balloon which said \\"Goodbye, Forty-Second! Hello, Seventy-Seventh!. Shortly thereafter, the 77th was moved to near Chateau Thierry, where it would part of the drive against Germany. Krotoshinsky passed a message, which led him to help rescue the trapped company. During this trip, he played dead and his hand was stepped on by a German officer. After the action he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by General Pershing. After the war Krotoshinsky portrayed himself in the 1919 film, The Lost Battalion (1919). Krotoshinsky, with the help of Nathan Strauss, emigrated to Palestine, but found that he did not have the capital to farm successfully. He described himself as a Zionist. After his return to the United States, he was in some difficulty, but eventually, in 1927, was given by an executive order from President Calvin Coolidge a job with the United States Postal Service, where he served at the 221 East Thirty- Fourth Street Post-office until his death on 4 November 1953, at the age of 60. He was survived by three daughters, Mrs. Abigail Krotoshinsky (n√©e Arkin) - a foster daughter, a brother Joseph, and, currently, has many descendants.

The sculpture is bronze; the base is red sandstone. Shading his eyes to scan the distance, Leif Ericson stands on a large red sandstone pedestal. Unlike other depictions of Ericson, here he is youthful and clean-shaven. He wears a scale armor shirt, ornamented with breast plates and a studded belt. Underneath, he wears a tunic and leggings with leather sandals. He carries a powder horn over his shoulder and a knife in a decorative sheath at his side. On the sandstone base, the inscription reads, Leif, the discoverer/ son of Erik/ who sailed from Iceland/ and landed on this continent/ A.D. 1000. In runic letters, it also reads, Leif, son of Erik the Red. Short video of Leif, the Discoverer sculpture. History The original statue resides in Boston, Massachusetts on Commonwealth Avenue. In November 1887, the Milwaukee replica was erected; however, at the request of its donor, Mrs. Joseph Gilbert, there was no dedication ceremony. On 26 April 2003, the Sons of Norway Fosselyngen Lodge held a ceremony to celebrate the recent addition of the statue's lighting, which cost $3,800. The funds were bequested by the late lodge member, Duane Olson. The addition was a joint effort between the Sons of Norway Fosselyngen Lodge, Milwaukee County and the city of Milwaukee. Prior to this, there had been evidence of structural instability, through cracks, erosion, and the deterioration of caulking in a pedestal.

In addition to news, television, radio, online, print, and magazine outlets that qualify as ethnic media, academic John D.H. Downing adds musical culture and forms of religious expression to the ethnic media mix. Downing finds, ‚Äúthese may, along with language and dialect, act as a media force somewhere between shock absorption and psychic validation in the often fraught atmosphere between the ethnic majority and ethnic minorities.‚ÄùDowning, John. (2001, p. 82). Radical Media: Rebellious communication and social movements. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.

(2001, p. 81). Radical Media: Rebellious communication and social movements. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.  Ethnic media as alternative media  Analogous to the debate as to what qualifying factors constitute alternative media, the domain of what qualifying factors that classify a respective ethnic media outlet as an alternative media outlet is also, at play. Thus, ethnic media is not by definitional default alternative media. Again, the work of academics and grassroots practitioners, such as John D.H. Downing, Yu Shi, Clemencia Rodriguez, and Inga Buchbinder of New America Media provide definitional assistance for this complex and overdetermined zone. Discernment of whether or not a respective ethnic media outlet qualifies as an alternative media outlet is dependent upon the outstanding contextual information, and should be assessed on a case by case evaluation. Yu Shi‚Äôs work puts forth a seven- pronged test for evaluating the ‚Äúalternative media role‚Äù of ethnic media in the United States: ‚Äúreference has to be made to their (1) individual place of origin, (2) historical evolution, (3) production process, (4) distribution pattern, (5) ownership, (6) self-identity (non-profit or for-profit; alternative or commercial; or in between), and (7) connection to power groups in local and transnational settings.‚ÄùShi, Yu.

He is best known for his role in the Vietnam draft resistance movement, which drew the high-profile 1968 federal prosecution of the \\"Boston Five.\\" Mitford, J. (1969) The trial of Dr. Spock: the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, Jr., Michael Ferber, Mitchell Goodman, and Marcus Raskin. Knopf. Life and career Mitchell Goodman was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1923. His parents, Irving and Adele, were first and second generation Jewish immigrants and were well off until Irving lost his clothing store in the Great Depression. Goodman was given a scholarship to Harvard and was at college when the U.S. entered World War II.Greene, D. (2012) Denise Levertov: A Poet's Life University of Illinois Press. He was trained as a Second Lieutenant forward observer in an artillery battalion, but was not deployed overseas. He traveled to Europe following the war, where he met the poet Denise Levertov. The two were married in 1947 and continued lived briefly in France and Italy before moving to the U.S. to Greenwich Village in 1948. A son was born in 1949. These experiences informed his vivid 1961 anti-war novel The End of It, which focuses on an American soldier's experience in the Italian campaign. The book received a positive reception from critics and prominent literary figures such as William Carlos Williams, and Norman Mailer. In the mid 1960s Goodman and Levertov both became prominent in the anti-war movement.The two began by running paid advertisements in national publications with statements of protest signed by writers, artists and others. In March 1966, he was involved in organizing the Fifth Avenue Peace parade in New York City, in which an estimated 30,000 people took part.Finn, J. (1967) \\"Mitchell Goodman and Denise Levertov\\" in Protest: pacifism and politics: some passionate views on war and nonviolence Random House In March 1967 Goodman led a walkout during Vice President Hubert Humphrey's address at the National Book Awards, in which he shouted, \\"Vice President, we are burning women and children in Vietnam, and you and we are responsible!\\" The quote was carried in newspapers nationwide.The New York Times, March 9th, 1967, Henry Raymont, \\"Writers Leave Humphrey Talk\\" Later that year, as described in the opening of Norman Mailer's book The Armies of the Night, Goodman helped organize the anti-Vietnam war demonstration at the Pentagon in October 1967, the first national protest against the war. As part of the planning for this event, he circulated a pamphlet stating: > We are planning an act of direct creative resistance to the war and the > draft in Washington on Friday, October 20... . We will appear at the Justice > Department together with 30 or 40 young men brought by us to Washington to > represent the 24 Resistance groups from all over the country. There we will > present to the Attorney General the draft cards turned in locally by these > groups on October 16... . We will, in a clear, simple ceremony, make > concrete our affirmation of support for these young men who are the > spearhead of direct resistance to the war and all of its machinery... . > [Signed] Mitchell Goodman, Henry Braun, Denise Levertov, Noam Chomsky, > William Sloane Coffin, Dwight Macdonald.Barsky, R. Noam Chomsky: A Life of > Dissent MIT Press, Cambridge, MA Prior to the protest, Goodman was one among the writers of \\"A Call To Resist Illegitimate Authority\\"; he became a member of the steering committee of the anti-war group Resist, which emerged from that Call. The \\"Call to Resist\\" expressed moral and religious outrage against the war in Vietnam, its unconstitutionality, war crimes, and the forced military service of conscientious objectors. It concluded by committing its signers to continue to provide material and moral support to draft resisters. The \\"Call\\" was published in the New Republic and the New York Review of Books with over three hundred signatures of prominent writers, activists and clergy on October 12, 1967. These documents and his protest actions led to his indictment for conspiring to council, aid and abet violations of the Selective Service law and to hinder administration of the draft. He was indicted for conspiracy alongside Benjamin Spock, a famous doctor and author, Marcus Raskin, leader of a Washington think tank, Rev. William Sloane Coffin, chaplain at Yale, and Michael Ferber, a graduate student at Harvard, in what became known as the \\"Boston Five\\" conspiracy trial. The defendants stood by their support of draft resisters, but denied the conspiracy charges. The defendants and others in the resistance movement had hoped to put the morality and legitimacy of the war on trial, but were largely precluded by Judge Ford, who was widely seen to favor the prosecution. Nevertheless, the defendants' principled stand and stature as professionals was seen by many as lending mainstream legitimacy to the actions of youthful draft resisters. The trial and its appeals were covered extensively in the media, and in a book by Jessica Mitford, published in 1969. All the defendants were convicted and sentenced to two years in prison, except for Raskin, who did not advocate civil disobedience, but merely an inquest into the legality of the war. The conviction was appealed, and the appellate court ruled that Judge Ford had overstepped in his instructions to the jury by giving a list of ten yes or no questions to be answered as part of their deliberation, a list which had possibly been drawn up in collaboration with the prosecution. Spock and Ferber were acquitted by the appeals court, which ruled that their actions were covered by the right to free speech in the First Amendment. However, Goodman and Rev. Coffin were ruled to have been more closely involved with the illegal acts in the draft card protests, and so were to be retried in the Federal District Court. The Justice Department declined to pursue the case, stating that a conviction for conspiracy would be too hard to win given that three of the original conspirators had been acquitted. Others believed that the Justice Department did not want to give further publicity to the case. Jessica Mitford and Alan Dershowitz have argured that the prosecution for conspiracy rather than for specific crimes was an attempt to repress organized public opposition to the war. Evidence for this view includes the indictment, which cited \\"diverse other persons, some known and others unknown\\" belonging to the conspiracy, implying they could also be prosecuted. Also, the prosecutor John Wall went as far as pursuing the \\"applause theory,\\" that those who expressed public support for the defendants statements could be considered part of the conspiracy. In a letter published in the New York Review of Books April 10, 1969, the day after the dismissal of his case, Goodman stated that student-run draft resistance groups, such as The Resistance, were the cutting edge of the anti-war movement, and by risking and serving jail time, were the \\"bravest guys in America.\\" He did not accept the charge of \\"inciting\\" draft resistance because he felt that did not account for the strength of the individual moral decisions taken by the draft resistors in the face of severe personal consequences. He also gave credit to tens of thousands of people who stood up to what he considered government intimidation by taking part in similar public protests, or by signing letters of solidarity requesting to be indicted on the same conspiracy charges as the \\"Boston Five.\\" From 1968 to 1970 Goodman, along with collaborators Robbie Kahn Pfeufer and Kathy Mulherin, assembled a compendium of source material from the political movements of the preceding decade and a half entitled The Movement Toward a New America: The Beginnings of a Long Revolution. Described in a New York Times review as a \\"telephone-book thick proceedings\\" of 750 pages, it includes essays, manifestos, journalism, and reflections from mainstream publications, radical magazines and student newspapers. Self-declared as, \\"1. A Comprehension, 2. A Compendium, 3. A Handbook, 4. A Guide, 5. A History, 6. A Revolution Kit, 7. A Work-in-Progress,\\" the book captured the ferment at the height of The Movement through sheer force of inclusiveness. Although out of print today, it remains a monumental assemblage of first hand cultural references from the radical movements of the 1960s. In his later years, Goodman resided in Temple, Maine where he wrote poetry and took part in local politics, including standing in solidarity with the workers in the International Paper strike in Jay, Maine. He and Denise Levertov divorced in 1975. He died in 1997, months before Levertov. Partial bibliography *1961 ‚Äì The End of It: A Novel. New York, Horizon Press.

Thompson and associates is an architectural group that has worked in Arkansas since the late 1800s and continues to this day, now as Cromwell Architects Engineers, Inc.. This article is about Thompson and associates' work as part of one architectural group, and its predecessor and descendant firms, including under names Charles L. Thompson, Thompson & Harding, Sanders & Ginocchio, and Thompson, Sanders and Ginocchio. The firm was the \\"most prolific architectural firm\\" practicing in Arkansas in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and produced more than 2,000 buildings. The architectural group used standard and custom designs that both led and evolved with changing architectural taste in Arkansas. The group built a wide range of types of works, including large public buildings, commercial buildings, mansions, and small houses. Many works by Thompson and the associated firms survive and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Charles L. Thompson Charles Louis Thompson (16 November 1868 ‚Äì December 30, 1959)Charles Witsell Jr., Charles Louis Thompson (1868-1959), Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture was the original head of the firm. Thompson was born in 1868 in Danville, Illinois. Orphaned at age fourteen, he and siblings moved to Indiana, where Charles began work at a mill, and in off hours began to learn drafting. Thompson's son-in-law, Edwin Boykin Cromwell (1909‚Äì2001) later headed the firm. Thematic Resources study A total of 143 properties in thirty Arkansas counties were nominated for NRHP listing in the 1982 study, \\"Charles L. Thompson Design Collection Thematic Resources\\", written by multiple authors. F. Hampton Roy, a Little Rock ophthalmologist, began cataloging the architectural drawings, expecting to complete a book. His collection eventually inspired this study, as Thompson and associates had such influence on Arkansas architecture. The properties listed under this study were selected from review of a large collection of original drawings by Charles L. Thompson, Fred J. H. Rickon, Thomas Harding Jr., Theo Sanders, and Frank Ginocchio. The collection of drawings covered 2500 properties representing a wide range of types and styles geographically distributed over the entire state of Arkansas. The authors wrote: \\"The 143 structures selected for nomination exemplify the firm's remarkable versatility and productivity from 1896 through 1931,\\" and \\"Charles L. Thompson was the constant motivating force behind the firm's immense productivity and influence upon the state's built environment. Today the firm he established continues this legacy.\\" Ginocchio and Sanders Frank Ginocchio and Theodore M. Sanders, partners since 1919, joined Thompson in partnership in 1927. Both had studied at the University of Illinois and Sanders had studied further at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. They brought design ideas of Prairie Style, influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright, and Art Deco architecture to the firm. Theo Sanders designed several houses in Little Rock's Hillcrest neighborhood. Others Architect John Parks Almand worked for the firm during 1912 to 1914 before forming his own practice.

The event was opened by Sagoo and followed by a keynote speech from the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. The awards were expanded to include winners from all Asian countries (China, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and others) as well as the traditional South Asian countries from which winners had been honoured previously.

The media particularly commented on the presence of Zayn Malik's attendance as it was the first time since his split from the band One Direction. Post the awards, Sagoo commented (through social media) on the lack of TV coverage from the British television networks. The Awards also broke two specific Twitter records by having the most tweeted tweet by an Indian (that a picture of Shah Rukh Khan and Zayn Malik)and also the very same tweet was the most popular \\"Selfie\\" of 2015. ;2016 The 6th Asian Awards was hosted by Alistair McGowan on 8 April 2016.

The Rising Star award also made its debut this year with the star of the Oscar nominated film Lion (2016 film) Sunny Pawar receiving it.

It continues the first book's exploration of the dark subterranean world populated by the brutal hominid offshoot Homo hadalis. Plot In a prologue, veteran underground guide Ike Crockett abandons his wife Alexandra von Schade and unborn child to return to the subterranean world, driven by feelings and whispers he cannot understand. He does not plan on returning to the surface. At the same time, an unscrupulous video documentary producer named Clemens is leading a film crew and its support team into the abandoned Hadal metropolis discovered by the ill-fated Helios expedition three years earlier. The film crew is wiped out by an unseen force, with Clemens the sole survivor. The main narrative resumes a few years later. While tensions between the United States and China increase on the surface, sub-planetary exploration and colonization is booming, ratcheting up potentials for international conflicts. The subterranean world is thought to be safe, having been \\"sanitized\\" by the viral bioweapon deployed during the first novel's Helios expedition. On Halloween night, scores of children are suddenly abducted by the long-thought-extinct Hadals, who brutally kill any adults attempting to intervene. The Hadals take the children back underground with them, leaving the United States in a panic. Due to the tensions with the Chinese, the U.S. government decides against mobilizing the military to perform a sweep of the sub-planetary Pacific region in search of the kidnapped children and the apparently-not-extinct Hadals. Ali von Schade is approached by Rebecca, a tall and statuesque young woman whose husband was killed and whose daughter, Samantha, was kidnapped by Hadals. Due to Ali's previous experience with Hadals and the sub-planet, Rebecca wishes to enlist her help in searching for her daughter. When Ali declines and warns against searching, Rebecca eventually creates an army of volunteers and mercenaries to rescue the kidnapped children. Some of these volunteers are the same people who angrily attack Ali's research institution, believing her to be more sympathetic to the Hadals than to her own people. Clemens, who escaped Hadal captivity and is wracked with brutally inflicted scars and deformities, is present at the attack on Ali, and becomes a supporter of Rebecca and her goal of entering the sub-planet. Rebecca's army enters the sub-planet, aided surreptitiously by the U.S. government and overtly by a mercenary leader named Hunter, and begins traveling toward the Hadal metropolis discovered by the Helios expedition a decade earlier. She encounters an AWOL Navy SEAL sniper named Beckwith, who had deserted the military after he and his colleagues had mistakenly murdered a group of Chinese settlers after believing them to be the children-snatching Hadals. Rebecca, Hunter, Clemens, and Beckwith descend through the interior of the planetary crust toward the metropolis. They discover the remains of all the male children, who were apparently killed by the Hadals after being unsuitable captives. Ali and a colleague, Gregorio, enter the sub-planet themselves on a similar quest. Meanwhile, as both Rebecca's army and Ali and Gregorio separately descend in search of the kidnapped children, Ike Crockett has been conversing with an ominous \\"Angel,\\" who appears to be a superhuman being as old as Earth itself. Ike appears to be a captive of this being, who explains that he himself is the prisoner and wishes Ike to \\"free\\" him. The Angel reveals that he has directed both human and Hadal evolution. Gregorio dies in a climbing incident, leaving Ali by herself. Rebecca's army, having shrunk considerably due to desertions, eventually discovers a second Hadal metropolis, this one decorated with statues and emblems of oxen and Minotaurs. Ali is discovered by the Angel, who takes her to his lair. There, she watches in shock as he removes his \\"disciple,\\" who is revealed to be Ike, her husband, from a walled-in room and forcibly gives him an amphetamine-like drink. Ike rushes off, having been given instructions by the Angel to bring him the kidnapped children. Rebecca's army discovers a complex of pyramids across a river from the city and, led by Clemens, enters it across a large bridge while Hunter's mercenaries and Rebecca herself remain behind. The volunteer army, now down to less than ninety men, discover troves of treasure and begin looting. Suddenly, they are ambushed by Hadals and effectively massacred - only three make it back to the city. Rebecca, Hunter, the mercenaries, and the three volunteer survivors use a building on the city's side of the bridge to fortify themselves and a siege begins, pitting the remaining humans against an unknown number of Hadals. The siege ends in a bloody battle after over a week of Hadal biowarfare, which includes using darts poisoned with the rabies virus and a Hadal who infects himself with Ebola before allowing himself to be killed by a mercenary sniper; soon to be cooked and eaten by the starving humans. Clemens, thought dead in the massacre of the volunteer army, returns and tells them that he has been dealing with the Hadals, who will release the children if the mercenaries surrender to certain torture and death. Hunter refuses and believes Clemens to be in league with the Hadals. Before he can be killed, the zip-tied Clemens is freed by Rebecca, and he promises to return with Samantha. Samantha is brought forth by three Hadals, who use her as a human shield. A battle ensues, and Samantha is killed. As Ali replaces Ike as the Angel's captive \\"disciple,\\" Ike enters the pyramid complex. It has been revealed that the kidnapped children are the design of the Angel, but the Angel's plans have been co-opted by Clemens, who was once a \\"trainee\\" of the Angel. Ike kills many surviving Hadals and has been told to bring the children and the disobedient Clemens to the Angel. Clemens, however, proves to be a formidable adversary and bests Ike in hand-to-hand combat, inadvertently aided by the sniper Beckwith, who remained undetected by the Hadals and mistook Ike for a bad guy and assumed Clemens was a good guy, shooting Ike's hand. Clemens has the remaining girls and a traumatized and mentally unstable Rebecca (unable to cope with the loss of her daughter Samantha) with him, and tells the girls that he, Clemens, is their rescuer and that Ike is the one who mutilated him. As he tortures and prepares to kill Ike, Clemens is paralyzed by Rebecca, who uses a poison-tipped barb given to Ike by the Angel. Beckwith arrives and, realizing his mistake, helps rescue Ike, the delusional Rebecca, and the girls. They head toward the surface, suffering from illness and fatigue. Ali remains with the Angel, knowing that as long as she is his willing captive and \\"disciple\\" he will not find a way to \\"free\\" himself. Clemens is kept alive as a meat source. The girls are brought to the surface and their parents celebrate in massive function thrown by the United States government. In the final pages, it is ambiguous as to whether or not a nuclear war between the United States and China has erupted.

Most of its buildings are in the northwest corner of Dapa, but some are spread across the north side of the town.Wikimapia website, http://wikimapia.org/ . History It was in the summer of 1995 when the idea of putting up a school for the welfare of poor but deserving students in Siargao and Bucas Grande Islands, Surigao del Norte came about. It was a brainchild of then Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) ‚Äì Caraga Regional Director Dr. Sol Matugas. The school, which came to be known as the Siargao Island Institute of Technology (SIIT) was born with the help of the director's son Francisco Jose Matugas, plus the financial support of the Siargao Foundation set up by her husband, former Surigao del Norte Governor Francisco Matugas. Harnessing her expertise in documentation, in compliance with permit application requirements, and in the installation of all necessary equipment and facilities prescribed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Dr. Matugas easily obtained permits to offer Bachelor in Elementary Education (BEEd), Bachelor in Secondary Education (BSEd) and Associate in Computer Science courses by June 1996. Classes during its first year of operation were held in three classrooms at Gerona Building along Sto. Nino Street in Dapa, Surigao del Norte. The late Dr. Genevieve Guda was designated as the School Director. With her were three full-time teachers Raul de Castro, Jr., Jonathan Etcuban and Rey Baquirquir from Cebu City. Part-time teachers from the island were also hired to complement the teaching staff. In just a matter of eight years since it opened with only 148 students, SIIT‚Äôs enrolment quadrupled to over 500 students by 2003. The phenomenal growth in enrolment was brought about by the expansion of course offerings. This then required the opening of additional classrooms in two more buildings along Sto. Nino Street. On March 20, 1998, the first Commencement Exercises were held for the 15 graduates of its two-year Associate in Computer Science course. Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) Regional Director Enrique Einar was the commencement speaker. The year 2000 marked a new milestone in the history of SIIT, when the government granted recognition to its two-year Computer Secretarial course. With an initial enrollment of only 15 students, it did not take long for the new program to attract about 50 students. It was also during this year when the first batch of candidates for graduation from the baccalaureate degrees received their diplomas. Twelve students graduated with the degree of BSEd and 43 graduated with the degree of BSEEd. The candidates took pride in having Regional Director Joanna Cuenca of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Caraga Region, as their commencement speaker. By 2003, permits were issued allowing SIIT to offer two new four-year courses, Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA) and Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim). Two thousand five was yet another turning point in the history of the institute when the construction of the new Don Mariano Matugas building was completed. The availability of more classrooms, new equipment, laboratory and other facilities, including an Internet facility, encouraged more students to study at SIIT, which resulted in an increase of enrolment from 500 to almost 700 during the first semester of academic year 2005-2006. Despite the continuing economic downturn that heavily affected enrolment of other tertiary schools with higher tuition fees, SIIT‚Äôs enrolment continually grew due to the opening of more academic programs, such as the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), majors in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics for BSEd, plus the two-year Licensed Practical Nursing Course (LPN), which is duly accredited by TESDA. Other schools‚Äô loss became SIIT‚Äôs gain because students who could no longer afford their tuition fees had to turn to SIIT as a fallback for their continued studies. Present Programs In order to keep pace with the rapid advancement in communications and information technology, SIIT pioneered the establishment of an Internet facility in the entire Siargao and Bucas Grande Islands. The islands, which compose the First District of the province of Surigao del Norte, is home to nine municipalities ‚Äì General Luna (where the world-famous Cloud 9 is located), Del Carmen, San Benito, Pilar, Burgos, San Isidro, Sta. Monica, Socorro, and Dapa, the latter being the center of commerce, trade and industry. Although the fully air-conditioned Internet cafe is primarily for the use of SIIT students, it is also available to the public during off-peak hours on school days and on Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. Despite the availability of four college annex buildings where the administrative offices, laboratories and classrooms are located, enrolment growth which is projected to increase by at least 30 percent this coming AY 2007-2008 will need more classrooms. Having anticipated such an increase, a new 10-classroom building is targeted to commence construction by early next year. It will be erected side by side with the present main Don Mariano Matugas Building. Meanwhile, blueprints for the renovation and redesign of at least two of the four existing college campuses have been made. Carpentry and masonry jobs are almost complete to conform with the recommendations of the Regional Quality Assessment Team (RQAT), such that academic programs with more students like the B.S. Criminology will have its offices, laboratory and classrooms in just one building or campus. The expected increase in enrolment this June will be due to the opening of a number of one-year and two-year ladderized programs under TESDA. The program designs are leading to four-year degree academic programs under CHED. Such programs include, among others, the one-year and two-year Security Services leading to B.S. Criminology; two-year Computer Hardware Servicing leading to BSIT, one-year and two-year Housekeeping and Bar Tendering leading to B.S. in Tourism and B.S. in Hotel and Restaurant Management, one-year Caregiver Course and other short-term technical-vocational and skills training programs under TESDA, which are in great demand by foreign countries these days. TESDA has committed its full support to SIIT since the latter has now become the center for technical and vocational skills training in the entire island. Besides, it is the only tertiary institution that provides quality education with the lowest tuition fees. As a clear manifestation of its support, TESDA is offering scholarship grants to students of SIIT beginning the second semester of AY 2006-2007. It is TESDA‚Äôs goal to help schools churn out skilled manpower and accelerate employment under President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo‚Äôs \\"A Million Jobs\\" generation program.

The brewery produces year round beers as well as seasonal beers, some of which have received praise from brewing competitions and festivals such as White Rascal Belgian-Style White Ale at the 2015 Great American Beer Festival. In 2017, Spain-based Mahou-San Miguel Group acquired a 30% stake in Avery. In 2019, Avery sold another 40% stake to Mahou-San Miguel Group and Founders Brewing Company.  History  Avery Brewing Company's new brewery opened in February 2015 in Boulder, Colorado. Adam Avery, president and head brewmaster of the brewery, incorporated the company in 1993 when craft breweries were just starting to increase in popularity among mainstream beer drinkers. In its first years, the brewery utilized only a seven barrel tank to ferment its beers, causing production to be relatively small. In the years since, the brewery has expanded and produced 50,000 barrels of beer in 2015. This volume of beer has allowed Avery beers to become increasingly available throughout Colorado, and the rest of the United States as well. As a result of capacity constraints, Avery Brewing left 18 markets in the United States in 2010 and 2011. Once the new Nautilus Court facility in Boulder went online, Avery began to re-enter those markets as of 2015 and 2016. In 2015, the brewery closed the doors of its original brewery and opened their new $30 million, 67,000 sq. ft. brewery, nearly doubling their brewing capacity and providing space for a potential expansion to 500,000 barrels per year. In November 2017, Avery announced that Mahou-San Miguel had purchased a 30% minority stake in the business. This makes Avery no longer a craft brewery, since the Brewers Association requires that craft breweries not be more than 25% owned by a macro-brewery.  Beer  Since the brewery's founding in 1993, Avery has vastly increased the number and varieties of its beers for the growing market of craft beer drinkers. Avery's beers vary greatly in style from Avery IPA to White Rascal Belgian-Style White Ale to Raspberry Sour to Rumpkin, a 15-18% ABV spiced pumpkin beer aged in rum barrels.

The concept of fadenya has been stretched and is often used to describe the political and social dynamism of the Mande world. Fadenya is often discussed in contrast to badenya, or mother-childness.  Definition  Fadenya originally described the conflicts between half-siblings with the same father, but different mothers. In the traditionally polygamous Mande world, half-brothers would often compete for control of their father's lineage and claim to his wealth and land. In order to do so, these brothers would have to set out on their own, leaving the safety of their community, in order to achieve recognition independently and claim the lineage of their father or to ‚Äú[overcome] paternal and ancestral reputations‚Äù.Bulman, Stephen (1995). \\"The Image of the Young Hero in the Printed Corpus of the Sunjata Epic. Younger Brother in Mande: Kinship and Politics in West Africa (76-93) This setting out to make a name for oneself was particularly common among younger brothers, who were less likely to receive anything from their father and therefore more motivated to overhaul the system through their own actions. These younger brothers have more to gain and much less to lose if they leave the family to seek their own fortunes. Although the term originally refers specifically to the conflict between brothers, the concept of fadenya is much larger than intra-familial conflict. In addition to its meaning of ‚Äúfather-childness\\", fadenya is also used as a word for conflict in general.Jansen, Jan (1995). \\"Kinship as Political Discourse: The Representation of Harmony and Change in Mande\\". Younger Brother in Mande: Kinship and Politics in West Africa (1-7) Fadenya can also extend beyond immediate family and affect an entire clan.Bagayogo, Shaka (1989). Places and Power Theory in the Mande World: Today and in the Past (445-459) Fadenya is seen as the source of political and social change in the Mande world, for upheaval of the existing social order occurs due to the tension of fadenya. Fadenya is associated with ‚Äúcentrifugal forces of social disequilibrium: envy, jealousy, competition, self-promotion‚Äù. Reprinted as Fadenya is the catalyst and root of all sociopolitical changes in the Mande world, ‚Äúthe conceptual vehicle of dymanism in Mande society‚Äù, and thus carries with it all of those connotations.Skinner, Ryan (2010). \\"Civil Taxis and Wild Trucks: the Dialectics of Social Space and Subjectivity in Dimanche a Bamako\\" Popular Music (17-39) Fadenya itself requires a departure from society, whether literal or not. In many traditional tales, one leaves one's family and the safety it provides in order to make one's own name and fortune.Bamba Suso (1999). Sunjata Fadenya does not always imply a physical journey, however. One may also figuratively leave one's family and village by deviating in opinion or values. Because fadenya describes paternal ties, and almost always describes tensions between men, fadenya is often considered a decidedly masculine force. This creates an interesting cultural phenomenon, in which men are seen as the forces of change and advancement or decline. The masculinization of change creates interesting gender roles within the Mande world.  Positive and Negative Fadenya   Positive Fadenya Leading to Innovation  Because it is defined as rivalry and tension between half- siblings, fadenya may seem like an intrinsically destructive force. However, in reality, it is often tremendously positive. Fadenya is the means through which ‚Äúthe innovative actions of the young hero can lead to a modification of norms within the tradition of a community.‚Äù Through a positive form of fadenya, one can improve society through the evolution and growth of customs. It is only through innovation that a society can survive and thrive, and positive fadenya provides the impetus for such change. This positive fadenya is ‚Äúpredicated on commitment to society‚Äôs traditions and social mores and describes how such traditions and mores are reproduced or ‚Äò‚Äôreinvented‚Äô‚Äô to meet the demands of, and even develop and improve, modern social life‚Äù. The emphasis in positive fadenya is a respect for the existing elements of society and a recognition that traditions should be ‚Äúreinvented‚Äù as opposed to essentially changed. For fadenya to be positive, it must place value in the current society and badenya, and change elements only to innovate, not to destroy or severely alter. As seen in the figure, positive fadenya necessitates reintegration. One must return from one's experience of the outside world or of other views, and bring this new knowledge to the community, using it to innovate and adapt existing customs.  Negative Fadenya Leading to Destruction and Shame  In contrast to positive fadenya, negative fadenya harms society. In instances of negative fadenya, one does not return with positive methods of integrating and innovating. A ‚Äúdissociate breakdown into wildness‚Äù occurs, leaving family members shamed and society worse off. One may use cruel force to impose different and self-serving values, rejecting years of societal progress and disrespecting the innovations and work of those who came before. That is, of course, if one returns at all. Negative fadenya can also signal an individual's complete break from society, in which one leaves and never returns with anything to benefit one's own family and people. This also brings about great shame.  Relationship with Badenya   Badenya  Badenya refers to ‚Äúmother-childness‚Äù or the relationship between siblings of the same mother within the polygamous structure. Because these siblings often share a closer bond, and do not compete among themselves as half siblings with the same father, badenya is a source of safety and security. Badenya is often what saves one from the tensions and competitiveness of fadenya. One can always rely on a full sibling because of badenya. When expanded, badenya is a uniting, community-oriented force; it promotes stasis and security. Just as badenya is used to mean mother-childness or sibling-hood, it is also used to mean harmony. It ‚Äúconnotes devotion to home, family and tradition‚Äù and ‚Äúconveys a sense of community, social solidarity, and shared intimacy‚Äù. Within the community, badenya represents the ‚Äúcentripetal forces of society: submission to authority, stability, cooperation‚Äù. The ‚Äústrong forces in Mande society [which] emphasize group norms, decisions and success over those of the individual‚Ä¶are reflected in the term badenya.  Interactions between Fadenya and Badenya  Badenya is the reason which communities stay together despite fadenya; it is the strong link that acts against the weaker ones of fadenya. Badenya acts as the status quo to the change represented by fadenya and ‚Äúcarries with it a strong moral valence; there is a sense of an essential ‚Äògoodness‚Äô and ‚Äòrightness‚Äô to the familial collectivity badenya implies\\". Fadenya is the ‚Äú ‚Äòpaternal‚Äô corollary to the ‚Äòmaternal‚Äô mores of badenya‚Äù. Just as fadenya is masculinized, badenya is feminized, as it represents maternal connection. It is also worth noting that it is through badenya that women often display their influence in society, for they have the power to protect their children from the forces of fadenya. By placing security and stability into the realm of women, badenya emphasizes their important role in society. It is important to note that in the Mande world, both badenya and fadenya are integral to the survival of a community. While ‚ÄúMande peoples focus much socialization activity on the fostering of fadenya behavior, recognizing that it is only through this force of change that their community will be able to survive trials and a changing world; they also recognize that without the stability badenya provides, their societies would be plunged into constant chaos.\\" The tension between badenya and fadenya represents the tensions between the group and the individual. This tension is not dichotomous, but rather an ‚Äúintersection of two axes‚Äù. Cultural Examples of Fadenya   Sunjata  The story of Sunjata, the founder of the Mali Empire, is a tremendously important aspect of Mande culture and provides not only historical information, but cultural information as well. Traditionally told through Griots, Sunjata contains many examples of fadenya, badenya, and their interactions.  Summary  The story, as told by Balle Fasseke, begins with the birth of Sunjata to the King, Maghan Kon Fatta, and his mother, Sogolon Kedjou. Sunjata is the second son born to his father but a wise hunter predicts Sunjata to be the founder of the Mali empire and ultimately the successor of his father. When his father eventually dies, his father's first wife seeks to destroy him to eliminate any threat of competition between sunjata and her son (the king's first born son). At this point, Sunjata decides to leave his people, and sojourns to find his destiny. Through a series of events in which his mother, sister, and younger half- brother provide tremendous help, eventually Sunjata is able to become King and rule.  Examples of Fadenya and Badenya  Examples of fadenya are numerous in the story of Sunjata: from the way he is exiled and later comes to rule the Mande kingdom to his relationship with his mother. From the beginning of the tale, strong fadenya is established between Sunjata and his half- brothers, one of whom has stolen his place as the first born. This fadenya returns later, after the death of his father, when ‚Äúhis brothers got together,/ and then they went to a sorcerer/ and told him, ‚ÄòAttack [Sunjata] with a korte till he dies‚Äù. *** In response to this fadenya, Sunjata leaves his home to set out to make a destiny of his own, a classic element of fadenya. Through Sunjata's journey, we see many examples of badenya. Even as a child, when he could not walk, it is his mother who comes to his aid when Sunjata proclaims ‚ÄúCall my mother:/ when a child has fallen down, it is his mother who picks him up‚Äù reflecting the deeply maternal and supportive essence of badenya ***. Later, when Sunjata is plotting to overthrow the rival who has stolen his homelands, it is Sunjata's sister who stands by his side and charms the tyrant into revealing his secrets. The fact that it is Sunjata's sister who plays such a significant role in his rise to power is reflective of the strong relationship between full siblings as described by badenya.  The Kouta Trilogy  Twentieth-century Malian author Massa Makan Diabat√©'s \\"Kouta trilogy\\" is often interpreted as demonstrating the conflict between fadenya and badenya. In Le lieutenant de Kouta, for example, the titular lieutenant struggles against the tyranny of his traditional animist elder brother, while seeking to preserve other traditions in the face of a youth-driven independence movement.Ke√Øta, Cheick M. Ch√©rif. Un Griot mandingue √† la rencontre de l‚Äô√©criture. Paris: Editions L'Harmattan, 1995. p. 108. In Le coiffeur de Kouta (\\"The Barber of Kouta\\"), the trilogy's second novel, the elders of the village similarly cite tradition in plotting against the village's young people, only to later realize that they must step aside so that the village can evolve and grow.Ke√Øta, p. 112.

It is a Top Level Project under the Apache Software Foundation. It was created by Edward J. Yoon,Apache Hama Proposal who named it (short for \\"Hadoop Matrix\\") and was inspired by Google's Pregel large-scale graph computing framework described in 2010. Hama also means hippopotamus in Korean language (ÌïòÎßà), following the trend of naming Apache projects after animals and zoology (such as Apache Pig).  Architecture  Hama consists of three major components: BSPMaster, GroomServers and Zookeeper.Apache Hama Architecture  BSPMaster  BSPMaster is responsible for: * Maintaining groom server status * Controlling super steps in a cluster * Maintaining job progress information * Scheduling jobs and assigning tasks to groom servers * Disseminating execution class across groom servers * Controlling fault * Providing users with the cluster control interface. A BSP Master and multiple grooms are started by the script. Then, the bsp master starts up with a RPC server for groom servers. Groom servers starts up with a BSPPeer instance and a RPC proxy to contact the bsp master. After started, each groom periodically sends a heartbeat message that encloses its groom server status, including maximum task capacity, unused memory, and so on. Each time the BSP master receives a heartbeat message, it brings up-to-date groom server status - the bsp master makes use of groom servers' status in order to effectively assign tasks to idle groom servers - and returns a heartbeat response that contains assigned tasks and others actions that a groom server has to do. For now, we have a FIFO job scheduler and very simple task assignment algorithms.  GroomServer  A groom server (shortly referred to as groom) is a process that performs BSP tasks assigned by BSPMaster. Each groom contacts the BSPMaster, and it takes assigned tasks and reports its status by means of periodical piggybacks with BSPMaster. Each groom is designed to run with HDFS or other distributed storages. Basically, a groom server and a data node should be run on one physical node.  Zookeeper  A Zookeeper is used to manage the efficient barrier synchronisation of the BSPPeers.

Early life  Alan Turner Peacock was born in County Durham in 1922. He was the son of the noted scientist Alexander David Peacock, who in 1926 became Professor of Natural History at University College, Dundee (then a part of the University of St Andrews). On his father's appointment, the family moved to Broughty Ferry. He was educated at Grove Academy and the High School of Dundee.  Career  He taught at the University of St Andrews, the London School of Economics (where he also conducted the LSE Orchestra), the University of Edinburgh's School of Economics, the University of York (where he founded the Department of Economics), the University of Buckingham of which he was the Vice-Chancellor from 1980 to 1984, and finally at Heriot- Watt University where he was honorary professor of public finance at the Edinburgh Business School until his death. He was from 1973 to 1976 the Chief Economic Adviser to the Department of Trade and Industry of the United Kingdom. He was also a co-founder and the first Executive Director of the David Hume Institute. During the 1970s and 1980s, he played a leading role in the field of cultural economics. From 1984 to 1986 Peacock served as Chairman of the Committee on the Financing of the BBC (Peacock Committee), the tenth major British inquiry into broadcasting. The Committee rejected Margaret Thatcher's wish to fund the BBC by advertising and proposed a sophisticated long-term strategy in which given a full broadcasting market with unlimited channels and freedom of entry, subscription would replace the licence fee. The model developed by Peacock later on served as a blueprint for Ofcom's Public Service Publisher.  Awards and fellowships  He was a Fellow of the British Academy, the Accademia dei Lincei, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and was in addition an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Economic Affairs. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross for his intelligence work in the Arctic Ocean during World War II and was knighted in 1987.  Books  His many academic books include \\"The Political Economy of Economic Freedom\\" (1997), \\"Public Choice Analysis in Historical Perspective\\" (1992), \\"The Economic Theory of Fiscal Policy\\" (1971, co-author G. K. Shaw) and \\"The Economics of National Insurance\\" (1952). He has also authored four autobiographical volumes. In \\"The Enigmatic Sailor\\" (2003) Peacock treats his experiences and achievements as a sailor in naval intelligence during World War II for which he was awarded the DSC. \\"Paying the Piper\\" (1993) lays out his application of economics to understand the arts. In \\"Anxious to do Good\\" (2010) Peacock gives an account of his involvement in public policy, including the financing of the BBC. \\"Defying Decrepitude\\" (2013), a light-hearted account of the costs and benefits of retirement, is his last book.  Other interests  He was also a composer of music, and studied composition with the Austrian composer Hans G√°l.

Family He was the youngest son of Simeon and Deborah Thayer Wheelock of Uxbridge, MA, and was born September 19, 1784 at Uxbridge. He was a sixth generation descendant of the first Wheelock settler, Rev. Ralph Wheelock. The Rev. Ralph Wheelock of Dedham, MA who had been a contemporary of John Milton at Oxford University and who was a Puritan minister in the 1630s, had been the first to establish public education in America. Jerry was the youngest of eight in the Wheelock family at Uxbridge and was born just after the end of the Revolutionary War. His father Simeon, had been a blacksmith, the town clerk, and a Lieutenant at Lexington and Concord in the Massachusetts Militia which preceded the more organized Continental Army. His father Simeon was killed in war action around two years after Jerry's birth. Simeon died in September 1786 at the age of 45 when his horse slipped on the ice while engaged in the suppression of Shays' Rebellion in Springfield. His mother, who raised him primarily by herself, became his principal teacher, although Uxbridge had a basic school since 1732. At an early age Jerry was \\"put out to learn a trade\\" as a maker of tubs, and pails.  Ancestry  Jerry Wheelock is a 3rd great grandson of Ralph Wheelock (1600‚Äì1683). An industrial incubator and early work experiences There was plentiful \\"bog\\" iron ore in Uxbridge, and at least three local forges for metal working and a working triphammer established by Caleb Handy at Ironstone, Massachusetts. In 1810/1811 Daniel Day completed the first woolen mill at Uxbridge in 1809, a town that one day would be headquarters and next in line to become America's largest woolen company.\\"Business: Time Clock,\\" Time, March 29, 1954 Jerry married Sukey Day (1789‚Äì1875), the daughter of Daniel and Sylvia Wheelock (maiden; 1764‚Äì1842) January 24, 1811, in Uxbridge. Jerry soon became a full partner with Daniel Day &vCo.; in the Carding machine company first established near the junction of the West and Blackstone Rivers. After a few years, Jerry worked for Artemus Dryden of Holden, MA, which manufactured Carding machines near Worcester, MA the county seat. Carding machine manufacture in Worcester County began with Pliny Earle I at Leicester, MA, (near Holden), as early as the 1780s. Jerry then was employed with the newly formed Rivulet Manufacturing company, founded by Chandler Taft in North Uxbridge in 1814, and worked his way up to Superintendent. He later struck out on his own and manufactured his own machinery at Uxbridge until 1833 (age 49). He and one of his sons, Charles Augustus Wheelock (1812‚Äì1895), then entered into a manufacturing business known as Jerry Wheelock and Son. His grandson Silas Wheelock joined the business in the 1840s. Historic Significance The Blackstone Valley would later be known as a historic corridor of national significance to America's earliest industrialization. The woolen mill started by Daniel Day and Jerry Wheelock continues today, two centuries later, under the name of Berroco Inc. a yarn distribution company, with headquarters for many years in the Elmdale section of Uxbridge, where Daniel and Jerry started the first woolen mill. More recently it has since moved to nearby North Smithfield, Rhode Island. Death Jerry died at Uxbridge on October 10, 1861 at the age of 77.

[archived page from July 15, 2011] Nepenthes leonardoi was formally described in the March 2011 issue of Carniflora Australis by McPherson, Bourke, Cervancia, Jaunzems, and Alastair Robinson. The specific epithet leonardoi honours Filipino botanist Leonardo Co, who was killed on the island of Leyte on November 15, 2010, reportedly as a result of \\"crossfire between government security forces and an insurgent group\\".Anda, R. 2010. New pitcher plant species to be named after slain botanist. Inquirer Southern Luzon, December 17, 2010. [archived page]Anda, R. 2010. New plant species named after Co . Inquirer Southern Luzon, December 24, 2010. The date of Co's death coincided with the first day of the Nepenthes expedition that led to the discovery of N. leonardoi. As explained in the species's describing paper: > The first four authors of this species discovered this plant on November > 18th, and felt it fitting to name this plant, which is unique among > Philippine Nepenthes in producing black pitchers, after Leonardo, in honour > of his lifework and many accomplishments. The herbarium specimen S. McPherson SRM 5 is the designated holotype, and is deposited at the herbarium of Palawan State University (PPC), Puerto Princesa City. It was collected on November 20, 2010, near the summit of Schom-carp Peak at 1490 m. In preparing the species description, the describing authors also examined herbarium material of a number of closely allied species, including N. attenboroughii (specimens A.Robinson AR001 and AR002), N. mantalingajanensis (G.C.G.Argent & E.M.Romero 92114), N. mira (G.C.G.Argent et al. 25438), and N. rajah (Low s.n.). Description Nepenthes leonardoi is a climbing or scrambling plant. The stem, which is unbranched, reaches a maximum length of around 4 m. It is cylindrical and varies in diameter from 1.5‚Äì2.8 cm. Internodes are typically 1.5‚Äì18 cm long, becoming elongated in climbing specimens. Plants found under the shade of dense vegetation typically have longer internodes compared to those growing in more open areas, although the latter on average bear larger pitchers and inflorescences. Leaves Leaves are petiolate to subpetiolate and coriaceous in texture. In mature plants, the lamina (leaf blade) is narrowly oblong and measures 15‚Äì50 cm in length by 6‚Äì10 cm in width. The laminar apex is typically acute or rounded, but may occasionally be abruptly truncated. The base may be shortly attenuate or obtuse, and encircles the stem for two-thirds to the entirety of its circumference. In younger plants, the lamina is usually narrower towards the base, becoming more oblong as the plant matures. The apex may sometimes be slightly peltate, with the tendril joining the lamina on the underside, up to 4 mm before the apex. Occasionally the two halves of the lamina may meet the midrib unequally at different points along its length, up to 3 mm apart in some specimens. Tendrils may be extremely long, sometimes exceeding 130 cm, particularly on leaves bearing lower pitchers. Those supporting upper pitchers are coiled. Pitchers Rosette and lower pitchers are variable in shape: they are usually wholly ovate or urceolate, but may also be globose. They grow up to 15 cm high by 6 cm wide, but are often considerably smaller. A pair of wings up to 12 mm wide runs down the ventral surface of the pitcher cup. These wings bear filiform fringe elements up to 10 mm long. The pitcher mouth is oval to circular and up to 6 cm across. It rises at the rear to form a conspicuous neck. The peristome is cylindrical to slightly flattened and up to 2 cm wide for most of its length, becoming broader towards the neck (‚â§2.5 cm wide). It bears ribs up to 2 mm high and spaced up to 2 mm apart, which terminate in teeth (‚â§4 mm long) on the peristome's inner margin. The digestive zone of the inner surface usually extends for around two-thirds of the pitcher's height, although some specimens may be wholly glandular. The pitcher lid or operculum is elliptic and measures up to 5.5 cm in length by 3.5 cm in width. It lacks appendages or a keel. A spur is inserted near the base of the lid. It measures up to 9 mm in length, with a basal diameter of up to 3 mm, although it may be much smaller. Upper pitchers are variably funnel-shaped, ranging from wholly infundibular to infundibular only in the basal quarter and cylindrical, or more rarely tubular, above. They may be considerably larger than their terrestrial counterparts, reaching 24 cm in height by 6 cm in width, though they rarely approach these maximum dimensions. The wings are commonly reduced to a pair of ribs in aerial traps. Upper pitchers resemble lower ones in other respects. Inflorescence Nepenthes leonardoi is known to flower both in the rosette stage and as a vining plant. The species has a racemose inflorescence. Male inflorescences can reach a height of 50 cm, of which the rachis constitutes up to 30 cm. Female inflorescences are similar in size, typically growing to 45 cm in length. Generally both male and female inflorescences are much shorter, however, especially in the case of plants growing in exposed sites. This being the case, exceptional specimens (also found in exposed areas) may produce a rigid inflorescence up to 110 cm length, of which only the distal 15% bears flowers. Inflorescences of both sexes have a basal diameter of approximately 1 cm and hold up to around 120 closely packed flowers, which are usually restricted to the distal quarter to half of its length. Flowers are usually borne on one-flowered pedicels, although two- flowered partial peduncles may also be present. The inflorescence often bears a vestigial leaf below the rachis. Male flowers are fragrant; their scent has been described as \\"distinctive, musty, sweet\\" and is noticeable from a distance of up to 60 cm. The smell of female flowers has not been recorded. Fruits are up to 8 mm long. As in most Nepenthes species, the seeds are filiform. They are pale brown and around 7 mm long. Indumentum A sparse indumentum of simple, reddish-brown hairs is present on certain vegetative parts, including the outside of the pitchers, the laminar margins, the lower surface of the midrib, and the tendrils (where they are somewhat more densely distributed). These hairs may be 2 mm long, but are typically shorter. They are caducous, being lost with age. Consequently, the laminar margins and midrib are particularly hirsute in developing leaves. Colour Colouration is highly variable. The laminae and petioles are often green throughout when produced in shaded conditions and red to purple in plants exposed to direct sunlight. In certain specimens the underside of the lamina and/or the stem may be red to purple, but this is uncommon. A red tinge to the stem is already apparent in many juvenile plants. The range of colours displayed by the pitchers of N. leonardoi is exceptional among Philippine Nepenthes. Lower pitchers are most commonly orange to red on their outer surfaces, often flecked with slightly darker purple markings. The wings may match the external pigmentation of the pitcher cup or be yellowish-green. The peristome is often red and may turn purple with age. The lid is yellow to orange, frequently with red highlights. In aerial traps, the pitcher cup is predominantly yellowish- green with a darker, orange to red peristome. In certain specimens the upper pitchers may be faintly red speckled. Beyond this common pigmentation, both lower and upper pitchers exhibit a continuum of colours across the species, from wholly yellowish-green at one extreme to entirely burgundy at the other. The latter colour form is particularly striking and is far more frequently encountered in N. leonardoi than in any other closely allied Philippine Nepenthes. In extreme cases, the upper pitchers may look almost completely black. Flash photography shows the actual colour of the pitcher cup to be a uniform deep purple; their very dark appearance seems to result from a combination of this purple pigmentation and their brown indumentum. This effect is particularly pronounced in wet pitchers. Ecology Nepenthes leonardoi is endemic to the Philippine island of Palawan. It has only been recorded from the upper slopes of a single mountain system centred on Schom- carp Peak (also known as Shumkat Peak or Shumkak Peak); it grows on the peak itself as well as on its eastern ridge, which extends in the direction of Narra municipality. The presence of this species on the easterly ridge connecting Schom-carp Peak with the Brow Shoulder massif could not be confirmed by the describing authors, but they suggested it is likely to grow there and possibly on the massif itself. The altitudinal distribution of N. leonardoi ranges from at least 1300 m above sea level to the summit of Schom- carp at 1490 m. The only known population numbers several thousand individuals. Nepenthes leonardoi is exclusively terrestrial. Its typical habitat is upper montane forest (on the eastern ridge) and upper montane scrub (in the summit area of Schom-carp Peak). It is not sympatric with other Nepenthes species and no natural hybrids have been recorded. Like its close relatives, N. leonardoi is apparently outcompeted by bamboo and is consequently largely or completely absent from the highest parts of the eastern ridge. The infaunal community of N. leonardoi pitchers includes small spidersThe Discovery of Nepenthes leonardoi. [video] Redfern Natural History Productions. and unidentified mosquito larvae, the latter being found in abundance in both lower and upper pitchers. The conservation status of N. leonardoi has not been formally assessed for the IUCN Red List, but the describing authors suggested it be considered Critically Endangered based on the IUCN criteria, due to its localised distribution and small population size. Although the habitat of N. leonardoi remains untouched by human activity, the describing authors cited mining operations to the south, on the Mount Victoria massif (to which N. attenboroughii is endemic), as a possible future threat if appropriate conservation measures are not taken. Notes :a.Similar outcomes of interspecific competition with bamboo have been observed in N. attenboroughii, N. deaniana, N. gantungensis, N. mantalingajanensis, N. mira, and N. palawanensis.

He contributed much to the modeling of aerodynamic effects on helicopter airfoils and on the flight dynamics of missile systems. Conducting research at the Israel Institute of Technology, or the Technion, Aharon Isser published many of his papers in the Journal of the American Helicopter Society. Biography Isser was born on July 13, 1958, in Rehovoth, Israel to Matityahu and Judith Isser, who immigrated to Israel from Europe after World War II. Born with an identical twin, Aharon and family moved to Bnei Brak in 1960. In 1976, Aharon graduated from a local high school and joined the Academic Reserve Unit of the Israeli Air Force, which allows its members to finish their academic degree prior to active duty. Deeply interested in engineering, Aharon applied to the Technion's Department of Aeronautical Engineering to begin his studies. After four years of study, Isser completed his bachelor's degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1980 and shortly thereafter received the rank of second lieutenant in the Israeli Air Force. During his six years of service in the Israeli Air Force, Isser simultaneously earned his master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering at the Technion. In 1984, during his military service, Isser also married, and moved to a suburb of Tel Aviv. Soon after, he and his wife had two children, one, a girl, in 1985 and the other, a boy, in 1989. In 1986 Isser was honorably discharged from the Israeli Air Force, having achieved the rank of captain. He then accepted a position as a senior engineer at Elbit Systems, a military defense contractor located near Haifa, Israel, where he modeled trajectories and flight profiles of missiles launched from a fixed-wing aircraft. While at Elbit, Isser continued his studies at the Technion on a part-time basis under the guidance of Professor Aviv Rosen. In 1995, Isser completed his Ph-D in Aeronautical Engineering and successfully defended his thesis, entitled \\"The Influence of Variations in the Locations of the Blades of a Hovering Helicopter on the Aerodynamic Loads Developed during Perturbations about Axial Flight\\".Aharon Isser's Ph-D Thesis Title That same year, Isser died on April 9, 1995, in a tragic accident, but his pioneering work in air foil modeling has paved the way for more aerodynamically efficient designs for helicopter rotors and other rotorcraft platforms. SH-60B Seahawk. Scientific contributions Isser's research focused on modeling the non-linear airflow dynamics around rotor blades of helicopters in slow axial flight or during hovering. Isser added additional accuracy to well established models of unsteady rotor aerodynamics that had previously been developed by scientists at the Technion and at other research institutions. These basic models assumed linear distribution of air circulation along the blades and a linear wake geometry.See Amer, K.B. (1950), \\"Theory of Helicopter Damping in Pitch or Roll and a Comparison with Flight Measurements\\", NACA TN 2136. Abstract of Amer's article .See also Ballin, M.G. and Dalang-Secre'tan, M.A., \\"Validation of the Dynamic Response of a Blade Element UH-60 Simulation Model in Hovering Flight\\", Journal of the American Helicopter Society Vol. 36(4), 1991, pp. 77-78.See also Hammond, C.E. and Pierce, A.G. (1973), \\"A Compressible Unsteady Aerodynamic Theory for Helicopter Rotors\\", AGARD-CP 111, pp. 213-227 In reality, however, small airflow velocity perturbations are caused by small vertical motions of the blades, resulting in variations in the induced wake field and airflow velocities. These airflow perturbations were not included in previous unsteady airflow models. In contrast, Isser's model added harmonic factors into the airflow model, taking into account the small periodic vertical motions of the blades during hovering or slow axial flight and treating the airflow differently in the near and far fields of the wake. To reduce the complexity of the model, Isser assumed mathematical simplifications. Then he conducted simulations of simple wake field profiles in order to test the accuracy of the model. Not only was the model validated with a high degree of accuracy for the case of constant circulation along the blades and radial trailing edges, but, thanks to Isser's updates, the model's accuracy and ability to predict rotor behavior during pitch and roll maneuvers was also significantly improved. The enhanced model predicted correctly the helicopter off‚Äêaxis response, a phenomenon that was beyond the capability of previous models. The improved model could also predict more accurate designs of rotor blade profiles to better match the wake-field non-linear geometry around rotary wing platforms, improving both the flight dynamics and hovering efficiency of rotary wing platforms.

Oldham, a pioneer of landscape architecture in Australia, and his journalist wife Ray were founding members of the National Trust (WA) and were prominent in the fight to save some of WA‚Äôs heritage buildings during the 1960s and 1970s. Biography John Oldham was born in Perth (19 December 1907). His father, Charles Lancelot Oldham, was a well known local architect who had designed a number of buildings in Fremantle during the 1890s, including the Fremantle Markets. His mother, Susan, was a painter. Both of Oldham's maternal grandparents were also painters, and his paternal grandfather, James Oldham, the headmaster of the Central Training School in Ballarat, established the Ballarat Art Gallery. Oldham was educated at Christ Church Grammar School and as a boarder at Guildford Grammar School. In 1924 he served an architectural apprenticeship to the firm Oldham, Boas and Ednie-Brown, which had bought his father‚Äôs business after the death of Oldham Senior in 1919. In 1928 he joined the staff of Rodney Allsop Oldham, where he worked on designs for the University of Western Australia, he then went for a year of study at the Architecture Atelier at the University of Melbourne. Oldham returned to Perth in late 1930, and capitalised on his graphic skills to set up the ‚ÄòPoster Studio‚Äô with Harold Krantz, where, even during the Great Depression, he was able to make a living out of producing lino-cut poster prints. In 1932, as a result of a family legacy, he moved to Sydney, where he established the Oldham Publishing Company which produced lino-cut posters and calendars. In 1934 he returned to Perth joining an architectural firm established by Krantz, as a junior partner. During 1934‚Äì37, Oldham established himself as an architectural designer, specialising in the rendering and presentation of architectural drawings. He drew heavily on his knowledge of the ideas of the Bauhaus and the International School. In 1936 he met Ray McClintock, a journalist with The West Australian, whom he subsequently married. In the late 1930s Oldham and Ray joined the Communist Party and embraced its programmes ‚Äì especially the Workers‚Äô Art Guild. He contributed substantially to the design and production of posters and programmes. They moved to Sydney, joining the architectural firm of Stephenson and Turner and, in 1939, Oldham was given the task of designing the Australian Pavilion for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Oldham was appointed WA‚Äôs first Government landscape architect in the 1950s. Among his many achievements were the landscaping of the Narrows Interchange, Parliament House, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Serpentine and Wellington Dams, Western Australian Institute of Technology and developing a master plan for Kings Park and the Swan River foreshores. Internationally renowned as a landscape architect, Oldham was admitted as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM)in 1990. He died in 1999.

Tunisia‚ÄìUnited States relations date back more than 200 years.  History  Prior to the arrival of Peace Corps and Amideast volunteers in the early-1960s and 1970s, there was little interest on the part of Tunisians to emigrate to the US. In 1981, the U.S. launched its Technology Transfer Program in Tunisia with the goal of increasing Tunisia's long-term capacity to apply new technologies in support of the development of a market economy. The Technology Transfer Program aimed to accomplish this by developing a substantial cadre of individuals with the skills and attitudes needed to develop and sustain a competitive, open market system. USAID/Tunis to date has obligated $45 million under the Project, has dispersed all but about $3 million of that total.http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABE093A.pdf Through the TTP, young and intelligent Tunisians were granted the opportunity to pursue studies in the United States. By the late-1990s, the number of Tunisians in United States started to grow, reaching around 8,000 through the launch of the Diversity Immigrant Visa program.  Building a Tunisian-American community  In 1998, the idea of building a Tunisian-American community was born; an impossible task, considering the dispersion of the community (basically diluted between the West Coast, Northeast and Southeast areas) and the size of the country. At that time, the Internet and high-tech telecommunications started to grow and evolve. So, the strategy was to build a virtual community that would, in time, be merged with the offline community. By late 1998, way before Facebook, MySpace and Twitter, http://www.tunisiancommunity.org/ became \\"the Cultural Home\\" for Tunisians in America and the Tunisian Community Center, their institution. The modest website, with the help of several tech-savvy Tunisian volunteers over the years, became what is now a powerful, interactive Web presence. Over the years, in spite of always being seen thru a \\"political lens\\", thanks to steadfast leadership and many dedicated volunteers, the organization was able to inspire the formation of local chapters that operate autonomously, but carry out the mission of the organization by conducting community-based activities that raise the profile of Tunisia in the United States and promote cross-cultural literacy.

It is difficult to distinguish from other related species firstly because it is variable, secondly because the taxonomic criteria are often based on characteristics which have later been found to be variable, and thirdly because there is much disagreement between authorities as to exactly how the species should be defined. Description *Cap: 3.5 ‚Äì 8 cm, low convex, often with a low umbo, smooth, dark brown fading to greyish brown. *Gills: Whitish, crowded, emarginately attached to stipe. *Stipe: Up to 10 cm long and typically 1 cm thick, similarly coloured to the cap but lighter, with longitudinal fibres. *Spores: 6.5 - 8.5 x 5 - 6 ¬µm, elliptical with amyloid warts (staining blue in Melzer's reagent), spore print white. *Odor: Faint. *Microscopic features: May have fusiform cheilocystidia or they may be missing (see below in taxonomy section). *Habitat: Grassy places in woods, roadsides, heathland etc. This description is taken from several references, which generally agree except on microscopic features. Due partly to the confused taxonomic definitions, this mushroom is very difficult to identify with certainty. Various authorities imply that around M. melaleuca there is a complex of closely related species without clear dividing lines, and that the current analysis (which varies from one author to another) requires more clarification. Much of the taxonomic work on Melanoleuca has been done in Europe and the status of North American specimens is less certain. However a 2012 paper by Vizzini et al. proposes updated definitions based on DNA analysis and suggests that some progress on these issues is being made. Taxonomy and Related Species Both the species name melaleuca and the genus name Melanoleuca come from the same Ancient Greek words for black (ŒºŒ≠ŒªŒ±œÇ - melas) and white (ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫œåŒΩ - leukon). The species name was originated by the Swedish mycologist Persoon in his 1801 publication Synopsis Methodica Fungorum, as Agaricus melaleucus. This formed the basis for the genus name Melanoleuca which was invented by Narcisse Th√©ophile Patouillard in 1897 as a variant of Melaleuca. The underside of the cap is whitish, and the top of the cap and the stem are often quite a dark brown, but \\"black and white\\" is not a very accurate description in practice. The species names of common animals are often identical to their genus names (as with Rattus rattus or Bufo bufo), but this form of designation (known as a tautonym) is forbidden for plants and fungi by the International Code of Nomenclature. Melanoleuca melaleuca narrowly circumvents this rule. Patouillard had originally named the genus Melaleuca in 1887 and called the type species Melaleuca vulgaris, presumably to avoid a tautonym. In 1897 Patouillard changed the name of the genus to Melanoleuca. According to modern nomenclatural rules, the older genus name should normally take precedence, but an exception has been made by the International Botanical Congress and Melanoleuca has been declared a nomen conservandum, that is, a name which is to be considered valid irrespective of the rules of precedence. The American mycologist William Murrill devised the name Melanoleuca melaleuca in a 1911 article in the journal Mycologia. If that is a valid name, again following modern rules, it should take precedence over Melanoleuca vulgaris as it refers to the original species name melaleucus. But in any case, Species Fungorum gives M. vulgaris as a synonym of M. polioleuca, rather than of M. melaleuca (see below), and Bon implies that M. vulgaris is equivalent to only part of M. melaleuca. In certain treatments of the genus, including Funga Nordica and Flora Agaricina Neerlandica, M. melaleuca is defined as having no cheilocystidia, but molecular analysis by Vizzini et al. makes it clear that these cystidia may sometimes appear and sometimes be missing in the same species of Melanoleuca, implying that this feature should not be used to characterize the mushroom. Other treatments specify M. melaleuca as having fusiform cheilocystidia, but recognize a separate closely related species, Melanoleuca graminicola as having no cheilocystidia. According to Index Fungorum the latter is a valid current name, but the former two references consider M. graminicola to be a synonym of M. melaleuca. According to its definition (which is admitted to be in need of revision), Funga Nordica also lists Melanoleuca brachyspora, Melanoleuca brevispora, Melanoleuca robertiana and Melanoleuca stridula as synonyms of M. melaleuca. The older treatments use various characteristics to delimit the species, for instance Moser distinguishes M. melaleuca as not having a pruinose cap, with a long stem in relation to the cap diameter, having a dark brownish cap colour, with stem not coarsely striate, and having white stem flesh. Another species which has been confused with M. melaleuca is Melanoleuca polioleuca. In Species Fungorum (the part of Index Fungorum which evaluates current names), apart from the valid entry of M. melaleuca, there is an invalid one designated \\"Melanoleuca melaleuca sensu NCL\\" which is said to be equivalent to the current M. polioleuca. According to Courtecuisse, M. polioleuca is distinguished by having a dense white \\"pruina\\" (a powdery covering) on the stem and by the flesh inside the stem being dark cinnamon rather than pale. General This species is reported to be edible. The confusion described in the previous section does not imply any particular culinary danger because (as far as is known) the closely related species are also edible. It is a widely distributed species, known from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and Oceania. Like all Melanoleuca it is saprophytic, feeding on organic litter and not being associated with particular types of tree.

In the 1910s and 1920s he served in Westchester County, New York, as commissioner of the Department of Charities and Corrections, the Commissioner of Public Welfare, and as Commissioner of Parks.  Biography   Early years and education  Macy was born in 1871 to Josiah Macy Jr. and Louisa Everett. His father was an officer in Standard Oil. He was named for his maternal grandfather, a Brooklyn leather merchant. His great-grandfather Josiah Macy had been a prominent shipping magnate on Nantucket. The Macy family had founded an oil company which built the State of New York's first oil refinery near Long Island City. Everit's father, Josiah Macy Jr., sold out to the Standard Oil trust and served on that company's board. His mother, Caroline Macy, was a benefactor of Columbia University, donating the funds to build Macy Hall. His sister was Kate Macy Ladd, a prominent philanthropist. At the death of his father in 1876, the five-year-old V. Everit Macy inherited over $20 million (approximately $ today). He was interested in design and architecture from an early age, and studied architecture at Columbia University, though he never practiced. He received his undergraduate degree from the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation with the class of 1893.  Public service and philanthropy  Macy served as the commissioner of the Westchester County, New York, Department of Charities and Corrections from 1913‚Äì1919, as Commissioner of Public Welfare in 1925, and as Commissioner of Parks from 1926-1930. He also served as president of the National Civic Federation. He would later serve on the board at Teachers College, Columbia and would also serve as its president. He was a major benefactor of Teachers College, donating funds to build the Morningside Heights building that houses the Horace Mann School.  Death  Macy died in a Phoenix, Arizona, hotel on March 21, 1930.  Personal life  Macy's wife, Edith Wiseman Carpenter, was a prominent member of the Girl Scout National Board of Directors and a founding member of New York's Cosmopolitan Club.

Xtranormal Desktop (aka State) is free to download on Xtranormal website but is no longer available after Xtranormal's shutdown. On June 28, 2013, the company announced that they would be shutting down its online services on July 31, 2013. They encouraged users to complete their unfinished movies and download their completed movies before July 31, 2013. After the shutdown, the website had been replaced by a holding page in a gray background showing Xtranormal's logo above a set of media player control buttons and the word \\"pause\\", hinting at a future relaunch. However, in October 2013, the placeholder was gone and the website was shut down entirely. In April 2014, Nawmal Ltd. acquired the rights to Xtranormal's IP and began releasing a rebranded version of a similar software.  History  Xtranormal was launched after four years of software development.. It was established as a storyboarding tool for writers and film directors. The original intent was to allow users to create videos by choosing from a menu of pre-designed characters and sets, and scripting their own dialogue. Xtranormal's State platform allowed casual users to create their own animated videos, and could be downloaded for free and run offline. At some point, Slate was replaced with a newer version of the animation software called Xtranormal Desktop (or, XD). Like Slate, XD was free to download from the Xtranormal website, but is no longer available after Xtranormal's shutdown.. Xtranormal also released a web- based animation software tool called Movie Maker (alternately known as \\"Text- To-Movie\\"). Movie Maker offers users a more limited subset of functionality in exchange for the convenience of a web browser. Xtranormal videos could at one time be created through an interface directly on the YouTube website.. In 2011, Xtranormal launched a subscription service called Xtranormal for Education. This program aimed to empower teachers and students by giving them a new way to express themselves in the classroom. Teachers could create and grade animation-based assignments directly from their web browsers. Xtranormal for Education was implemented in K‚Äì12, university and special needs classes all over the world. In January 2013, Xtranormal's CEO at the time told Forbes magazine that Xtranormal had a viable web subscription model, including Tellagami app, but they believed that the real opportunity for growth was now in mobile.. On June 28, 2013, the company announced that they would be shutting down its online services including all current subscriptions, points plans and existing services as of July 31, 2013. They encouraged users to use up existing points and to publish and download created movies before that date. Xtranormal's online services were taken down shortly after, with the content of their web site replaced by a holding page showing the company's logo, a set of media player control buttons, and the word \\"pause\\", but in early October, the placeholder was gone, thus their site was shut down altogether. Its official YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter pages had also deleted. The site was briefly home to a store called \\"The College Shop\\" in November 2013. In July 2014, it was announced that the assets of Xtranormal had been acquired by Nawmal Ltd. As of 2016, Xtranormal's new parent company, Nawmal Ltd. has split Xtranormal into 2 different animators named after the company itself, both just like Xtranormal, except one being for professional use and one being for education.http://www.nawmal.com/ As of 2018, Xtranormal had a new feature of Nawmal Ltd. but is introducing new VR, AR, advanced customization and more. Legacy Some user-created videos reached more than a million views on YouTube... In 2010, the short film Sleeping with Charlie Kaufman by director J Roland Kelly, animated entirely with Xtranormal, premiered at the Little Rock Film Festival and was shown at The Rome International Film Festival in Rome, Georgia. Xtranormal videos once formed a recurring feature on the late night FNC talk show Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld, and were featured as part of a GEICO advertising campaign.. The Micros series of shorts about the world of online has been the most popular Xtranormal web- series on YouTube..

Of the nine one-year terms that he served as county supervisor between 1856 and 1877, Jensen was the Chairman of the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors four times. His Agua Mansa home, the Jensen Alvarado Ranch, is a registered California Historical Landmark (No. 943) and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early years Jensen was born on the North Frisian island of Sylt off the coast of Southern Schleswig (then part of Denmark, now in Germany) in either 1812 or 1814. He took his mate's exam in Denmark and thereafter made several trips around Cape Horn, arriving in California by 1844. Biography Jensen was captain of his own vessel for 20 years. He arrived in San Francisco in 1848. With news of the California Gold Rush, his crew jumped ship and, thereafter, he went to Sacramento and opened a store, selling items to the gold miners. It was there that he met the Californio Ignacio Alvarado. At Alvarado's urging Jensen moved to Southern California, settling in Agua Mansa around 1854. At the age of 40, he married Alvarado's 16-year-old sister, Though the reference states that Mercedes was Ignacio's daughter, genealogical records show Ignacio (or Ygnacio) to be her brother.

In addition to being a rancher and vintner on his Southern California properties, he owned a sawmill and a store, and served as a politician. Personal life After the Great Flood of 1862 destroyed much of the town of Agua Mansa, Jensen and his wife built a home on hundreds of acres on what was to become the Cornelius and Mercedes Jensen Ranch, a California Historical Landmark, located at the Jensen-Alvarado Ranch Historic Park and Museum. Their brick home, the oldest non-adobe structure in the Inland Empire, was Riverside County's first kiln-fired brick building. Of their twelve children, ten survived into adulthood.

He is the 71st generation of kora players in his family and a son to Sidiki Diabat√©. Biography Mamadou Sidiki Diabat√©, widely known as \\"Madou,\\" was born on September 23, 1982 in Bamako, Mali. He is a Muslim and he's the youngest son of the late Sidiki Diabat√© and Mariam Kouyat√©. He is part of the seventy-first generation of kora players in his family. His family has a long heritage in the oral tradition of jalis (sometimes spelled djeli), or griots. \\"Jali\\" is the Mandingo word for the repository musician and storyteller of Mande's ancient oral tradition, transmitting history and culture from generation to generation, from father to son. \\"Mand√©,\\" often used to describe Madou and his family, is a broad cultural designation of several ethnic groups in West Africa, including (though not exclusively) the Mandinka, Maninka (or \\"Malinke\\"), Sarakole, Bambara, and Dyula, residing primarily in Gambia, Senegal, Guinea, Mali, the northern regions of Ivory Coast, and the western regions of Burkina Faso. The kora, arguably the most complex chordophone in African music, is a 21-stringed bridge-harp from West Africa. Madou, tutored by his father, began playing an eight-stringed kora at the age of three. From ages three to six, Madou accompanied his parents at weddings and baptisms, among other ceremonies. He played his first concert at the age of six at the Centre Culturel Fran√ßais of Bobodioulasso, Burkina Faso with his father. In 1992, at age of ten, Madou made his first European tour. He continued to accompany his father up until Sidiki's very last performance in 1996 at the Festival Printemps des Cordes, or the Spring Festival of Strings, in Dakar. Although Madou has largely followed in the steps of his father, his style has been susceptible to new techniques and innovations. Today, he often claims that his older brother, Toumani Diabat√©, who is also a distinguished kora player, is his master, helping him to understand the endless potential of the kora. Since 1997, Madou has been playing lead kora with some of the most important West African singers and musicians, including Kandia Kouyat√©, Baaba Maal, and Salif Keita, among others. He has performed at more than forty festivals and over one thousand concerts throughout Africa, North America, Europe, and Australia. Madou can also play the balafon (framed xylophone,) and tamani (double-headed drum,) also of West African descent. Madou is renowned for his extensive knowledge of traditional kora repertoire and command of both jazz sensibilities and foreign influences. His style is often associated with the \\"Jazz Manding\\" music movement developing Mali today. While Madou prides himself on preserving the tradition and legacy of the kora, he is also known for having diverged from his father's style, inspired by afro-Latin groups like the Rail Band (also called the Super Rail Band, or Bamako Rail Band,) in addition to his brother's music (particularly Toumani's Bembeya Jazz). In 2004, Madou received a degree in music from the Institut National des Arts (INA), in Bamako, Mali. Madou now resides in with his wife, singer Safiatou Diabat√©. The Diabat√© Legacy The Diabat√© family has produced 72 generations of kora players and jalis, the Malian counterpart of griots, or West African historians. A jali transmits the ancient oral history of western Africa through poetry and praise songs, and, like the Diabat√© family, they are often also musicians. Madou's father, the late Sidiki Diabat√©, is widely known as \\"The King of Kora.\\" Sidiki was originally from The Gambia, where much of griot culture is said to originate. Sidiki migrated to Mali during the years between World War II and 1961. His songs‚Äô nationalist message became a powerful voice in the call for Independence. \\"Kaira,\\" one of Sidiki's more popular songs, shares its name with a collective of young jalis in the Kita region of western Mali. Although the group was banned by the colonial French, the song remained popular and encouraged support for the Malian branch of the African Democratic Rally, led by the first president of independent Mali, Modibo Keita. Sidiki Diabat√© also played an important role in the preservation of Malian and Mand√© history and culture. Sidiki performed with L'Ensemble Instrumental National du Mali, who performed Mandingo music and was one of West Africa's first national acoustic bands. They received the first prize at the Festival des Arts N√®gres in Dakar in 1966, and a gold-medal at the Pan-African Cultural Festival at Algiers in 1969. Sidiki was also featured as a soloist on the first recording to feature the kora exclusively.The recording, called \\"Ancient Strings,\\" brought together Mali's most respected korists; in addition to Sidiki Diabat√©, Djelimadi Sissoko, Batrou Sekou Kouyate and N'fa Diabat√©. Mamadou Sidiki Diabat√©'s brother, Toumani Diabat√©, is also a part of the family's growing musical legacy. Toumani was the first kora player to win a Grammy Award in 2006 and he has collaborated with musicians from all over the world, including Taj Mahal, Ketama, and Roswell Rudd. Toumani has led many bands, including the Symmetric Orchestra, which mixes both modern western and traditional Malian styles. The Symmetric Orchestra is a large \\"big band\\" ensemble whose sound is reminiscent of Mali's path-forging national, regional and municipal orchestras of the 1960s and 70s. The band features both western instruments (electric guitars, drum kits and synthesizers) and traditional Malian instruments (such as the kora, jembe, balafon, and ngoni). Toumani comments, \\"The Symmetric Orchestra reflects the spirit of Mali's new democracy since 1992 ‚Äì a spirit of equality, and creativity. There's a public in Mali today that love traditional music ‚Äì griot music ‚Äì but not the griot milieu. With the Symmetric, they feel free to enjoy this music without the obligations of tradition. And this gives us the freedom to present the tradition in new ways.\\"R. Skinner, \\"Artistiya: Popular music and personhood in postcolonial Bamako, Mali.\\" (Diss. Columbia University, 2009. Dissertations & Theses @ Columbia University, ProQuest. Web. 5 Dec. 2010) p. 212 The Symmetric Orchestra is just one example of Toumani's fusion of tradition and innovation; Toumani's album New Ancient Strings (1999) is a response to his father's classic recording Ancient Strings. Lucy Dur√°n writes that the album \\"is rooted in the timeless classical tradition of the Mali that was once, during the pre-colonial era, played at the courts of kings and emperors; but it is reworked to the contemporary styles that are currently in favour in Bamako ‚Äì the hot-house of many of West Africa‚Äôs finest musicians\\". Sidiki and Toumani both have had distinguished and ground-breaking careers as musicians and the Diabat√© family's legacy not only continues with Toumani and Madou, but also Sidiki Diabat√©, Toumani's son, who is also a kora player. Sidiki is the real-life inspiration for the children's book Sidikiba's Kora Lesson, by Ryan Thomas Skinner. The Mand√© Sound The Mand√© Sound, with which Mamadou Sidiki Diabat√© is often associated, is one of several regional varieties of Afro-pop. Mand√© is the broad cultural designation of several ethnic groups in West Africa, including (though not exclusively) the Mandinka, Maninka (or \\"Malike\\"), Sarakole, Bambara, and Dyula, residing primarily in Gambia, Senegal, Guinea, Mali, the northern regions of Ivory Coast, and the western regions of Burkina Faso. The Mand√© Sound is characterized by samba rhythms, parallel thirds vocal harmony, and smooth, virtuosic electric guitar leads. It makes use of modal scales (particularly common is the Lydian mode, with a raised fourth, taken from traditional music). This style frequently makes use of traditional Mand√© instruments such as the kora, ngoni (plucked lute,) and balafon (framed xylophone). Although women figure prominently as vocal soloists in traditional Mand√© music, they are less likely to be figured in the Mand√© Sound. The repertoire is heavily drawn from traditional jali music, either in popular arrangements of traditional songs or in new compositions in a traditional melodic style. The Mand√© Sound originated in Guinea with the founding of Africa's first national dance troupe (which included musicians,) founded by Keita Fodeba, with the intention of bringing West African music to a global stage. In 1958, and several years after, Guinea has celebrated its independence by producing albums of traditional and popular performers through Tempo Records of Hollywood. In 1970, Guinea pioneered the production of African popular music by establishing the first African label, Syliphone. By 1985, Syliphone had released over 80 LP discs of popular bands from all over Guinea boasting the Mand√© Sound. Madou's brother, Toumani Diabat√© was first recorded by this label with his ever-popular group Bembeya Jazz National. Mamadou Sidiki Diabat√©, along with his father Sidiki Diabat√© and Toumani Diabat√©, are one of a number of more traditionally-oriented kora players associated with the Mand√© Sound.

He is noted for his role in bringing western music to Japan during the late 19th century.Daisyfield Archive of Japanese Traditional Music About Rudolf Dittrich Biography Dittrich was born in Biala, Galicia (modern Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, Poland). He attended the Vienna Conservatory, where he specialized in violin, piano, organ, and music composition. His teachers included Anton Bruckner, who later became one of his sponsors. In November 1886, Dittrich married a singer named Petronella Josefine Leopoldine Lammer (15 September 1860 - 4 January 1891). Dittrich was hired by the Meiji government of Japan as a foreign advisor on a three-year contract and arrived in Tokyo in 1888 as the first Art Director of the Tokyo School of Music (now the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music). Dittrich and his wife both worked at the school, and also gave performances at the Rokumeikan. Dittrich was fluent in English, and also taught his students English conversation along with violin, piano, organ, theory, and composition. However, he was known as a very severe teacher, and at one point his students marched out on strike against him. However, many of his students went on to distinguished careers. Near the end of Dittrich's first term in 1891, his wife died from a pulmonary embolism. Furthermore, the school faced financial difficulties as the government withdrew its support to divert funds for the upcoming First Sino-Japanese War. In spite of his school's difficulties, Dittrich's contract was renewed in 1891 for another three-year period. Sometime in 1891 or 1892, Dittrich formed a relationship with a Japanese shamisen performer and instructor, Mori Kiku, with whom he had a son out of wedlock named Otto Mori. Mori Kiku also assisted Dittrich in translating the lyrics and transposing the music for the Japanese songs which appeared in his 1894 and 1895 publications. Dittrich left Japan one month before the expiration of his contract in August 1894, abandoning his common- law family, but leaving provisions to provide financial support for his son, who later became a professional violinist. His grandson was the movie actor Jun Negami. After returning to Vienna in 1894, Dittrich had to struggle to find a position. In the first years after his return he performed as a chamber music violinist and violist. In 1901, he was appointed as one of three Habsburg court organists, succeeding his mentor Anton Bruckner. In 1906 Dittrich became a professor at the Vienna Conservatory, and wrote for the organ in the Musikverein auditorium, where the Vienna Philharmonic plays its New Year's concerts. On 10 July 1900 Dittrich married his second wife, Katharina Kriegle, who bore him two sons. Dittrich collapsed while performing in a concert on 18 October 1916, and never fully recovered. He died in Vienna on 16 January 1919. Publications After returning to Europe in 1894, Dittrich published two collections consisting of piano arrangements of traditional Japanese songs. * Nippon Gakufu (\\"Six Japanese Popular Songs collected and arranged for the Pianoforte\\"), Breitkopf and H√§rtel, Leipzig, 1894. * Nippon Gakufu, Second Series (\\"Ten Japanese Songs collected and arranged for the Pianoforte\\"), Breitkopf and H√§rtel, Leipzig, 1895.

Early career in America After serving as an instructor in cardiology at Yale University Medical Center from 1957‚Äì1960, he was invited to establish a modern cardiology laboratory at District of Columbia General Hospital, George Washington University section. During Massumi's tenure as associate professor of Medicine at George Washington University and Head of Cardiology at D.C. General Hospital from 1960‚Äì1970, there were over 50 scientific contributions published in the field of cardiology. From 1970 to 1974, as Professor of Cardiology at the University of California, Davis School of Medicine, Massumi continued research in the new field of electrophysiology, contributing over 40 original papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Return to Iran From 1974 to 1980, Massumi returned to Iran by invitation from the Shah's Court to bring modern cardiology to Iran and establish modern techniques in the 350-bed cardiology center being constructed at the time. Simultaneously, as Professor and Chief of the Department of Cardiology at Tehran University, Massumi laid the groundwork for an up-to-date teaching center which, to this day, continues to produce qualified cardiologists. The pupils that Massumi has trained at the University of Tehran have become among the most respected cardiologists in Iran and have been the driving force in building ultra-modern cardiac centers in several major cities in the nation. Of these, the most recent center was built in the city of Shiraz in southern Iran in 2008. At the opening ceremonies, Massumi was referred to as the father of modern cardiology in Iran. The tumult of the 1979 Iranian Revolution led Massumi to decide to take his family back to the United States, where he has continued his career as a preeminent cardiologist since 1980. Impact on cardiology During his career, Massumi authored over 200 papers, 130 of which he was senior author, and authoring a chapter in the textbook \\"Cardiac Arrhythmias\\" and co-authoring \\"Complex Electrocardiography\\". He was a driving force behind the field's understanding of Prinzmetal-Massumi syndrome, a rare form of angina pectoris. Final years Prior to his death, Massumi was practicing in Beverly Hills, Californiahttp://www.healthgrades.com/directory_search/physician/profiles/dr- md-reports/dr-rashid-massumi-md-a689cc9e and was a member of the staffs of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he lectured regularly, UCLA Medical Center (where he served as a Clinical Professor of Medicine) and Brotman Medical Center. Into his 80s he continued to publish articles, as recently as October 2010 at the age of 84, making him a successful contributor to the academic body of knowledge in the field for seven decades. In June 2009, the cardiology fellows of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center gave Massumi the Lifetime Teaching Award in recognition of \\"his enduring devotion to the education of Cedars- Sinai Cardiology Fellows\\".

It was used as a virtue name by the Puritans.http://www.behindthename.com/name/hope Puritans also used Hope as an element in phrase names, such as Hope-for, Hopeful, and Hope- still.http://www.namenerds.com/uucn/listofweek/puritan.html The name is also the usual English translation of the Greek name of Saint Hope, an early Christian child martyr who was tortured to death along with her sisters Faith and Charity. She is known as Elpis in Greek and Spes in Church Latin and her name is translated differently in other languages. Faith, Hope and Charity, the three theological virtues, are names traditionally given to triplet girls, just as Faith and Hope remain common names for twin girls. There were 40 sets of twins named Faith and Hope born in the United States in 2009, the second most common name combination for twin girls. One example were the American triplets Faith, Hope and Charity Cardwell, who were born in 1899 in Texas and were recognized in 1994 by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's longest lived triplets.https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/garden/at-home-with- faith-hope-and-charity-285-years-young.html Hope has been among the top 1,000 names given to girls born in the United States since 1880 and has been among the top 500 since 1909.

His Montana birth certificate lists him as being 13/16th Cree by blood-quantum, his full sister, Shirley, is listed as 16/16ths. He is a former Department Head (2007‚Äì2010) of Indian Fine Arts at the First Nations University of Canada in Regina, Saskatchewan and former Chair (1999‚Äì2007) of Native American Studies, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.Blomberg 159 He is Professor Emeritus at the University of Lethbridge and University of Regina. Background Born in 1948 on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Browning, Montana, Young Man is the ninth child of fifteen brothers and sisters. His father Joseph Young Man White Horse (Sau-sti-qua-≈Ñis) and mother Lillian Katherine Boushie were both Cree and fluent in Cree and English. Young Man's paternal Cree grandmother Theresa Ground Woman Big Springs spoke Cree only and was married to Don't Talk Many White Horses, a Blackfeet Indian man. Since Don't Talk was deaf, he went by the nickname Deafy (pronoun: De√©-fee). Deafy was stricken with scarlet fever as a child in the late 19th century, as many Blackfeet children of his generation were, rendering him mute. Theresa and Deafy communicated their entire married lives using Indian sign-language. Theresa outlived Deafy to the approximate age of 113 years. Young Man's maternal grandfather Edward Boushie was Cree/M√©tis and Edward's wife Eliza was also Cree from the Erminskin Reserve in Hobbema, Alberta. Young Man grew up in East Glacier Park, Montana and spoke Cree as a child. Like nearly all Indian children of his generation, when Alfred was six years old he and his siblings were taken away to Cut Bank Boarding School, a Bureau of Indian Affairs government school located a short distance north of Browning. Physical punishment was an everyday occurrence and Cree and Blackfeet traditions and customs were illegal to practise under US government law. Young Man stayed in government Indian boarding schools at various times and places until he was 20 years old when he went to the Slade School of Art in London, England, in 1968, which was the first time ever that he attended an all-white school for any length of time. Alfred's memory of the Cree language is sparse and he speaks and understands only a little.Abbot, Larry. \\"Alfred Young Man, Cree.\\" Time of Visions. (retrieved 9 Dec 2010) Academic career Young Man attended the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico (1963‚Äì1968) where the German painter Fritz Scholder was his painting teacher for two years (1966‚Äì68). The IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts retains a considerable number of Young Man's paintings in its collection from the five years he spent there. Young Man went on to study painting, film history and photography at the Slade School of Fine Arts, University College London in London, England, for four years (1968‚Äì72), where he met many famous and influential artists and musicians, amongst these were Pop artist's Richard Hamilton and David Hockney who were visiting artists and who stopped by his painting studio on random occasions. While at the Slade, Young Man was tutored and mentored for two years (1970‚Äì1972) by Bernard Cohen; another tutor was landscape painter William Townsend (1909‚Äì1973). The director of the Slade during Young Man's time at the school was Sir William Coldstream, founder of the Euston Road School. While in London, Young Man met Jimi Hendrix just a month before the famous rock musician died in September 1970, introduced to Hendrix by Steven Stills of CSN&Y;, who was cutting what Stills described as his pink giraffe album in a sound studio in London. Young Man earned his M.A. at the University of Montana (1972‚Äì74), where George Longfish (Seneca-Tuscarora) was his teacher and mentor in the Graduate Program in American Indian Art. He graduated with his doctor of philosophy degree (Ph.D.) in anthropology from Rutgers University in New Jersey in 1997, where he studied anthropology as a student of William Powers. Young Man has been an art teacher since the early 1970s, beginning on his home reservation at the Rocky Boy Elementary School (1973‚Äì1974), after which he moved to the K.W. Bergan Elementary School in Browning, Montana, on the Blackfeet Indian reservation for a short time. He continued on to the Flathead Valley Community College in Kalispell, Montana (1975‚Äì1977), where he helped found the Total Community Education television training program. When that program came to a close, he moved on to the University of Lethbridge in 1977, where he eventually became chair of Native American studies (1999‚Äì2010). He taught in the Faculty Exchange Program at the University of Lethbridge/Leeds University Leeds, UK, in 1985 and the Faculty Exchange Program University of Lethbridge/Hokkai Gakuen University Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, in 1992. He remained tenured at the U of L up until 2007 when he chose early retirement and began work as department head of Indian Fine Art at the First Nations University of Canada in Regina, Saskatchewan.\\"Faculty Profile #1: Alfred Young Man.\\" First Nations University. 13 Feb 2010 (retrieved 9 Dec 2010) In addition to his teaching activities at the First Nations University, Young Man also worked as archival curator and custodian of the school's 1500 piece art collection. In August 2010 his employment at FNUC was terminated along with approximately 52 other professors and support staff, due to financial exigency budget cuts. He was appointed in 2015 Adjunct Professor to the Art Department, University of Calgary. Most recently in terms of his lifetime, Young Man did an artist/writer's residency at the Lab 26 Tejiendo Identitdad Entre Las Culturas Originarias de America, Galeria de Arte Contemporaneo Paul Bardwell, Centro Colombo Americano de Medellin, Medellin, Colombia in 2011. He has spoken at numerous conferences and other venues held on every continent on the planet throughout his long professional career. Pedagogically Young Man teaches his courses from the Native perspective, something unheard of when he began teaching Indian fine art at the University of Lethbridge in 1977 and something that, even today, very few if any Native art professionals of whatever category claim to do.\\"Native perspective not easily taught.\\" University of Regina Report. 14 June 2010 (retrieved 9 Dec 2010) Community involvement Young Man served as chair of the board of the Society of Canadian Artists of Native Ancestry, which was instrumental in convincing the National Gallery of Canada to include First Nations art and artists in its vast collection.

Plants susceptible to this disease generally include members of the Brassica family.http://www.growcom.com.au/_uploads/22010Control_of_White_Blister_Rust.pdf White rust has been known to cause agricultural losses in fields cultivating members of this family including broccoli, cauliflower, and Indian mustard. Despite the name, it is not considered a true rust. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of infection include chlorosis on leaf surfaces, white blister-like growths on the underside of leaves and on the stems of the plant, and swelling of the roots. In addition, abnormalities in the growth of the host can occur with more serious infections. These abnormalities can include deformation of flowers, twisting or distortion of the plant matter, and sterility.S. Koike, P. Gladders, A. Paulus. (2006). Vegetable diseases: a color handbook. Academic Press.http://www.extento.hawaii.edu/kbase/crop/Type/a_candi.htm Disease proliferation The white blisters contain sporangia; these sporangia are released from these blisters by bursting through the plant tissue. The sporangia, if dispersed to a proper host, can undergo two processes to continue the infection cycle. The first is germination and creation of a germ tube which will penetrate and infect the host through a stoma. Alternatively the sporangia can create and release up to 14 flagellated zoospores. These zoospores travel through films of water to reach a proper site from which to infect the host, at which point they germinate and infect through a stoma. The penetrating hyphae will then grow between the plant cells, producing haustoria to siphon off nutrients from the host. Once established, more sporangia along with sexual oospores, which are used as overwintering survival structures, will be produced.http://web.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/pdf_pubs/960.pdf Crop damage White rust can cause considerable crop damage in areas that are dependent on the cultivation of members of the Brassica family. For example, India has sustained significant losses in the cultivation of oilseed brassicas. Losses in areas of India have ranged between 17% yield loss and 60% yield loss in the case of mustard seed alone.Saharan, G.S., Kaushik, C.D., Gupta, P.P., Tripathi, N.N. 1984.

History  The style originated from the lower and middle-class neighborhoods of Mexico City in 2000 and 2001. It then moved to Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n in 2007, before moving to the United States in 2008. It was most popular in the metropolitan areas and southern states with highly Mexican-American populated areas in the early 2010s. One of the precursors and most popular of tribal guarachero producers is 3Ball MTY from Monterrey.  Characteristics  Tribal guarachero music is a fusion of genres such as regional Mexican music, including technobanda, and EDM genres such as techno, electro house and club music. With a 4/4 time signature, the genre is often made up of cascading triplets and a BPM of 140 to 280. The rhythm employs Afro-Cuban rhythms and Latin synths.  Usage  As a dance and EDM music style, tribal guarachero music can be used in solo dances with a unique dance movement, or in dance troupes to compete in danceoffs.

It is the oldest surviving building in Caloundra. The lighthouse was active between 1896 and 1968. The tower was relocated twice. In 1970 it was relocated from its original location to Woorim Park in Caloundra, and in 1999 it was returned to its original site on Canberra Terrace near downtown Caloundra, where it stands today. History Operation The need for a lighthouse at Caloundra Head arose in 1879 with the sounding of the North West Channel, a deep water channel into Moreton Bay and the Port of Brisbane, the principal port of Queensland. The channel went from Caloundra Head along the eastern shore of Bribie Island. Although the channel became the most used entry channel into the port, it was only lit in 1896, when a pair of mobile leading lights were established on Bribie Island, the Caloundra Head Light was constructed. Tenders were called in 1896, and the stations were constructed by day labor. Materials for construction were shipped by barge from Brisbane. The lighthouse was the fifth in a group of eight lighthouses of its type, made of hardwood frame clad with corrugated iron, which included, by order of establishment Little Sea Hill Light, Grassy Hill Light, Goods Island Light, Bay Rock Light, itself, North Point Hummock Light (demolished), Gatcombe Head Light (demolished) and Bulwer Island Light. Though the main purpose of the light was to mark the entrance to the North West Channel it also served as a harbour light. Lighthouse and Keeper's residence, ca. 1920 The light was officially lit in September 1896. The original lens was a fourth order Chance Brothers dioptric apparatus, and the original light source was a fixed kerosene lamp. It was attended by a single lighthouse keeper, living in a cottage constructed next to the light. The keeper's house also served as a postal office with telegraph service, and the lightkeeper also served as the telegraph office keeper. The telegraph service was discontinued in 1910, but telephone service was installed in 1912, so the post office remained at the site until 1934. The keeper's cottage also hosted the first Caloundra for a few months. In 1910 the apparatus was upgraded to an incandescent vapour kerosene lamp, also purchased from Chance Brothers, the first of its type in Queensland. Its intensity was 1,400 cd and it was visible for at least . By the 1930s the channel became even more popular and the lighthouse became a symbol of Caloundra, being used on maps, postcards and other promotional material. During World War II the lighthouse was controlled by the Royal Australian Navy which also set up an observation post within the grounds. In 1942 it was converted to electricity from the mains with a petrol operated engine-generator as a backup. The lighthouse was automated and demanned and the cottage was occupied by the Coastal Artillery forces, which also attended the light. A 1950s postcard promoting Caloundra After the war, the light remained unmanned, being connected to Brisbane by phone and attended from there. However, the connection to the mains proved quite unreliable, and a local, Charlie Bigg, was later engaged to attend the light from his nearby residence. The keeper's cottage was sold and moved down the hill in 1946. By 1950 the nearby ground was opened as a public park and the lighthouse was fenced off. The lighthouse's image continued to be used on promotional material as well crests and logos of local establishments. Changes in the shipping industry in the 1960s caused an increase in large container ships, which made the channel even more important. In May 1966 permission was granted for the construction of New Caloundra Light, a modern structure comprising a combined lighthouse, signal station and radar station. It was erected in 1967 right next to the old lighthouse. By 1968 it became fully operational and the old lighthouse was deactivated. The lighthouse's last active power source was a 500 Watt 110 Volt Philips lamp, fed by the Mains electricity. It showed a white light, with red showing in a sector. Having an intensity of 250,000 cd the white light was visible for while the red one was visible for . The light was shown at a focal height of . After deactivation The lighthouse remained at location until 1970 under constant threats of demolition. In 1970 volunteers from the Golden Beach Power Boat Club relocated it to Woorim Park, near their clubhouse. As funds for preservation were not provided, the tower continued deteriorating, the iron cladding rusted, and water leaking weakened the timber frames. At some point, the lighthouse was concrete rendered to seal it, but deterioration continued. In the late 1990s, it became apparent that the tower's integrity was threatened. In order to get the tower funded it needed to be registered by the Queensland Heritage Register, but as it was not in its original location it was not eligible. As the new lighthouse was deactivated in 1992, relocating the lighthouse back to its original location became an option. After a two-year campaign by local residents and the Caloundra City Council, a lease on the original location was obtained and A$50,000 were granted by the council to facilitate the relocation. However, a relocation attempt made on 22 March 1999 was almost disastrous. Though the lantern was successfully detached, as the tower was lifted about a metre off the ground a section below the first floor broke away due to the brittleness of the timber studs and the lighthouse fell to the ground. As the move was insured, the lighthouse could be saved. The tower was subsequently braced and repaired, and on 11 June it was transported successfully to its original location, where a new base has been built over the original one. Later that year the tower and the lantern were then restored, and the lantern was placed back on the tower. It took more than a year to get the official certifications to open the lighthouse to the public, and the public open day was held on 31 March 2001. The lighthouse's lease was held by the Caloundra City Council, which licensed it to the Lions Club of Caloundra and later to the Friends of the Caloundra Lighthouses Inc (which was established in 2007) until it expired in 2009. It was licensed to the Sunshine Coast Regional Council in 2010. As of early 2011, the Friends regained access to the buildings. By August 2012 they had readied the buildings for public visitation and signed a three-year licence with the Sunshine Coast Council. Structure Lighthouse plans, 1896 The tower construction is typical to Queensland lighthouses of the time. It is built of a hardwood frame and clad with corrugated zinc annealed iron. It is conical in form. The diameter at the based is , tapering to at the top. The base of the tower is a round concrete slab placed over the original footing in the 1999 relocation. The entrance is through the northern side, through a small wooden framed entry with an arched corrugated iron roof. The tower also has four small rectangular windows, two at ground level and two at the middle. Inside the tower are two platforms, accessed by two flight of stepladder and hatchways in the floors. The tower exterior is painted white, with a red border on the entry door. The tower is topped by the renovated metal lantern room, accessed via a lead-lined hatchway in the floor. The base of the lantern room is made of steel plates, and a hatch door allows access to the gallery. The lantern room is domed, and the dome exterior is painted red and topped with a ventilator cowl. The gallery floor is timber, supported by cast-iron brackets, and surrounded by a red painted lightweight tubular balustrade. A pedestal for the lens was installed in the lantern room, though the lens was removed. Site operation and visiting The site of the lighthouse is accessible. The tower itself was open to visitors and guided tours were offered until 2009, when the lease expired. As of early 2011, the plans are to have both the old and the new lighthouses open to the public later in 2011. As of August 2012, the lighthouse can be visited.

He is known for his studies of the consequences of new technology in art and aesthetics, which introduced a new theoretical perspective through concepts such as the \\"communication aesthetics\\", the \\"technological sublime\\", the \\"communication block\\", and the \\"aesthetics of flux\\". Early life and education Career Costa has had an extensive academic career. He has been Professor of Aesthetics at the University of Salerno and has taught Methodology and History of Literary Criticism at the University of Naples, and Ethics and Aesthetics of Communication at the University of Nice Sophia- Antipolis. He has authored some twenty books and numerous essays, published in Europe and America. In 1985, he founded Artmedia, the Laboratory of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication, at the University of Salerno, Department of Philosophy. As a director of Artmedia, he developed an intense activity of promotion of neo-technological art and contributed by arranging many conferences and events in Naples, Paris, K√∂ln, Toronto, Tel Aviv and S√£o Paulo. Thought His theoretical work followed two main paths of research: 1) the socio-political and philosophical interpretation of the 20th-century artistic avant-garde, and 2) the development of a philosophy of technique, through the analysis of the changes introduced by new technology into art and aesthetics.Costa, Mario (2005).

This led him to suggest a radical change in this theoretical field,Costa, Mario. L'estetica dei media. Avanguardie e tecnologia, op. cit. which was based on notions such as the \\"technological sublime\\" and the \\"aesthetics of flux\\". The technological sublime In the early 1980s, Costa started an investigation on media and communication technologies whose first result was the aesthetics of communication, a theory which conceptualizes the possibility of an aesthetics of simultaneity at a distance. The basic principles of this theory were stated in 1985.See News and Notes, Report by the International Center of Aesthetic Communication, Salerno, January 1986, and Mario Costa, L'estetica della comunicazione, Roma, Castelvecchi, 1999. In the 1990s, Costa defined a more general, comprehensive, aesthetic and philosophical, theory of new media, which he named the technological sublime.Costa, Mario. Le sublime technologique, op. cit. He traced the history of the sublime and of its metamorphosis: the rhetoric sublime of the ancient philosophy, the natural sublime of the 18th century, the industrial-metropolitan sublime of modernity, and finally what he considers to be the latest form of the sublime, namely the technological sublime. He argued that the excess from which any manifestation of the sublime comes from is represented by all the new electro-electronic and digital technology of image, sound, writing, communication, and spaces. According to Costa, new technologies - which are developing as an exorbitant, self-operating technological system - imply on the one hand the weakening of the subject and the disappearance of the art and of all related categories (beauty, style, artistic personality, expression, etc.). On the other hand, new technologies are at the origin of a new aesthetic dimension, the technological sublime, which is defined by new categories: the de-subjectivation of aesthetic production, the hyper-subject, and the suppression of the symbolic and the meaning.Costa, Mario. Le sublime technologique, op. cit.See also: * Architecture et technologies du sublime, in Le Carr√© Bleu, 3/4, 1992, pp. 23-27\\\\. * Paysages du sublime, in Revue d'Esthetique, 39, Paris, 2001, pp. 125-133. Contemporary art and the aesthetics of flux According to Costa, the whole theoretical apparatus developed by traditional aesthetics, from the 18th century, has become completely obsolete and useless to understand the present manifestations of art. The emerging techno-anthropological condition and its most significant aesthetic products need a new explanation and theory, in which the \\"form\\", i.e., the basic category of traditional aesthetics, is finally substituted by the category of \\"flux\\", which his analysis considers both from a philosophical point of view and in its diverse aesthetic manifestations. Costa extended his reflection from the \\"cinematographic flux\\" to the present \\"technological aesthetic fluxes\\", made possible by the advent of digital technology and networks. He concluded that technological fluxes may also highlight essential aspects of contemporary ontology, being closely tied to our experience of time and existential attitude.Costa, Mario.

He played as a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler. He made his Test cricket debut in the final match of the 2010‚Äì11 Ashes series. After several seasons playing for the Western Australian cricket team, in the 2016‚Äì17 season Beer returned to his home state of Victoria to continue his professional cricket career. Early life Beer grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Malvern and played his junior cricket for Malvern Cricket Club in the Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association. His family had strong ties with the club and his father was part of the club's \\"Team of the Century\\". He attended De La Salle College, which resides opposite the Malvern Cricket Ground and graduated in 2002. He made his way into the club's First XI before leaving to play with Victorian Premier Cricket club St Kilda when he was 17. Domestic career Beer had some success with St Kilda, taking over 100 wickets in two seasons and twice being selected in the Premier Cricket teams of the year. He was unable to make the Victorian cricket squad ahead of other spin bowling options such as Bryce McGain, Cameron White and Jon Holland. He did play some Second XI matches for Victoria in the Cricket Australia Cup and toured England with the Victorian Emerging Players in 2007. He won the Crusaders/Robert Rose Scholarship for 2006/07, having taken 43 wickets at a bowling average of 19.88. Following the 2009‚Äì10 domestic season, Beer moved from Victoria to Western Australia, where he was awarded a contract for the 2010‚Äì11 season with the Western Warriors. He made his debut in the Warriors first 2010‚Äì11 Ryobi Cup match against Victoria in October 2010. In the 2016-17 season Beer represented Victoria in the Matador Cup domestic one day competition. In his first game for his home state, Beer took a hat trick, becoming only the seventh Australian domestic bowler to take a one-day domestic hat trick, taking it across two overs against South Australia at the WACA Ground. International career Chris Tremlett bowls Michael Beer to complete England's 3-1 Ashes victory on 7 January 2011 In December 2010, after playing only five first-class cricket games for Western Australia, he was named in the Australian Test Squad for the third Ashes Test to be played at the WACA Ground. His selection in the squad came a day after retired Australian champion spinner Shane Warne suggested that Beer be included in the side after performing well in the 2010‚Äì11 season, taking 16 wickets, including five against the touring English side in November 2010. Tasmanian spinner Xavier Doherty was omitted from the squad after taking only one wicket in Australia's loss to England in the Second Test. The move was highly criticised by some, including former Australian Test bowlers Stuart MacGill and Nathan Bracken. Beer was named as the twelfth man for the match as Australia decided to play four specialist fast bowlers. Along with batsman Usman Khawaja, he debuted in the fifth Test in Sydney, on 3 January 2011. Beer was denied his maiden Test wicket when a catch by Ben Hilfenhaus at mid-off from England's opener Alastair Cook was overturned after a front-foot no ball. He claimed his first Test wicket by dismissing Paul Collingwood for 13, with the catch completed by Hilfenhaus at deep mid-on. Beer was the last batsman to be dismissed in Australia's second innings in the match, enabling England to complete a victory by an innings and 83 runs and a 3‚Äì1 series win. He had made two runs in the second innings to add to the two not out he had made in the first innings. Beer was picked for Australia's 2012 tour to the West Indies. He was not picked for the first Test, but in the second Test, he opened the bowling in both West Indies' innings.

The grape was once widely planted throughout Sardinia but its plantings were decimated when the phylloxera epidemic hit the island at the end of the nineteenth century. At the turn of the 21st century there were 552 hectares (1,364 acres) of the grape planted throughout Italy, mostly in the Sardinian provinces of Cagliari and Oristano.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 22-23, 411-412 Allen Lane 2012 Origins Ampelographers have speculated that the Gir√≤ may have originated in northeast Spain and was introduced to Sardinia when both regions were part of the Aragonese Empire. Wine historians and ampelographers have speculated that the grape has Spanish origins and may have been introduced to the island when it was ruled by the Crown of Aragon.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 79 Oxford University Press 1996 One theory suggest that the grape was brought to Sardinian around the same time that Mazuelo, Graciano and Pascale were introduced. Relationship to other grapes In ampelographical text, Gir√≤ is often listed as the same variety as Albaranzeuli nero. However while recent DNA profiling has determined that Gir√≤ is likely a parent of the Sardinian wine grape Albaranzeuli bianco, the exact relationship between Albaranzeuli Nero and Gir√≤ is not yet clear. There has similarly been a long association between Gir√≤ and the white Spanish wine grape Gir√≥ blanc grown in Majorca of the Balearic Islands. French ampelographer Pierre Galet was one of the first ampelographers to speculate that Gir√≤ and Gir√≥ blanc might be separate grape varieties and not just color mutations. Galet's hypothesis was confirmed by DNA analysis in 2007 showing that the two grapes were, indeed, different varieties. Viticulture and winemaking The Gir√≤ grape has shown itself to thrive in very hot and dry climates, though in these conditions the grapes will lack acidity. The grapes are considered mid to late-ripening and have the potential to accumulate high levels of sugars which lend itself well to the production of sweet wines. Some producers will allow their Gir√≤ to hang on the vine long after regular harvest, allowing the grapes to shrivel and desiccate, further concentrating the sugars. Other producers allow the grapes to dry after the harvest on straw mats or in drying rooms. Wine styles Gir√≤ is most commonly associated with the production of fortified wines that can be produced in both a sweet and dry style. Wine expert Jancis Robinson describes some of the sweeter examples of Gir√≤ to be lacking in acidity but having firm tannins and a characteristic cherry aroma. Gir√≤ di Cagliari DOC The Gir√≤ di Cagliari includes the southeastern province of Cagliari (dark blue) and extends northwest into the neighboring province of Oristano (purple). Based around the province of Cagliari and extending into vineyards around the commune of Oristano in the neighboring province is the DOC zone dedicated to production of varietal Gir√≤. Both a still red wines and fortified liquoroso styles are produced from grapes that are limited to a harvest yield no greater than 12 tonnes/hectare. All Gir√≤ di Cagliari DOC wines must be aged a minimum of nine months prior to release with wines labeled as Riserva requiring two years of aging with at least one of those years being spent in wood.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pp. 167 Firefly Books 2004 The basic DOC red wine must have a minimum alcohol level of 14.5% if it has some residual sugars or 14% if it is labeled as dry (secco). Both the sweet (Liquoroso Dolce Naturale) and dry (Liquoroso Secco) fortified styles must have a minimum alcohol level of 17.5%.

Activism Hall was active on behalf of various progressive movements. He was an admirer of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, French politician, philosopher and socialist, of Benjamin R.

He was opposed to Marxism and agreed with classical liberal political theorist Herbert Spencer, who called it \\"the coming slavery.\\" Hall was an early leader of the American Longshoremen's Union in New York City, established with the help of British socialist and trade unionist Tom Mann as part of a cross-Atlantic organizing drive for all maritime workers. In 1898, serving as general treasurer of that labor organization, he drew condemnation from delegates to New York City's Central Labor Union because he submitted a motion to oppose opening a Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War inasmuch as the latter country had agreed to arbitration in the Havana, Cuba, sinking of the battleship Maine. The motion lost by a small margin.\\"Workmen Discuss War,\\" New York Times, April 18, 1898 Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website. Before 1908 he established the Vacant Lot Gardening Association in New York City, which grew to \\"about 200 members\\" who \\"conducted a number of experiments in and near New York during its existence.\\" One of them included the use of thirty acres of land on Bronxdale Avenue, near White Plains Road, \\"which the Astor estate had allowed us to use and on which a number of families had been living.\\" Afterward, the association used property on Dyckman Street near Prescott Avenue, not for cultivation, but for the establishment of a tent city. The difficulty in getting free land for \\"vacant lot gardening\\" led Hall to establish the Little Land League, whose idea was to buy property no more than 90 minutes from New York for a training school, \\"and the people who have proved capable there we shall put on their feet as farmers on a larger piece of land further away.\\" In 1909 he made a trip to Europe to study vacant-lot gardening.\\"Helping the Poor Back to the Land,\\" New York Times, August 24, 1909 Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website. In 1910 he deeded some 68 acres of land to establish the egalitarian community of Free Acres in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, under which the residents pay only a single tax on land values to the community, which, in turn, pays a lump sum to the city.

In 2019, Walter Hood was awarded the Macarthur Fellowship, known as the \\"Genius Grant.\\" Career Hood has worked in a variety of settings including architecture, landscape architecture, art, community and urban design, and planning and research. Early life Hood grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, and has spent more than 20 years living and working in the heart of Oakland, California. He draws on his strong connection to the black community in his work. He has chosen to work almost exclusively in the public realm and urban environments. He went to school at North Carolina A&T; State University, receiving a bachelor's degree in Architecture in 1981. He has received both his Master of Architecture and Master of Landscape Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley in 1989. He also received his Master of Fine Arts from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2013 in studio arts and sculpture, exploring the role of sculpture and urbanism. Career Hood established Hood Design Studio in Oakland, California in 1992. Hood's work spans the range from local, community-based projects‚Äîsuch as Splash Pad Park, a converted traffic island alongside Interstate 580 in Oakland, California‚Äîto large-scale garden designs like the grounds for the new M. H. de Young Museum in San Francisco with Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron (2005). Hood's innovative public spaces are known for the way they embrace the essence of urban environments and for their links to urban redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization.http://www.larch.umd.edu/news/PDFs/2007_pdfs/Walter_Hood_lecture.pdf He is currently designing the landscape for the Autry National Center Southwest Museum in Los Angeles, designing an archeological garden within the context of the South Lawn Project at the University of Virginia, and developing a set of monuments and markers for a six-mile waterfront trail in Oakland, CA. Hood's published monographs Urban Diaries (Spacemaker Press, 1997) and Blues & Jazz Landscape Improvisations (Poltroon Press, 1993) illustrate his approach to the design of urban landscapes. These works won an ASLA Research award in 1996. His essay \\"Macon Memories\\" is included in Sites of Memory: Perspectives on Architecture and Race (Princeton Architectural Press, 2001). Hood has been praised as a \\"community whisperer,\\" creating spaces that have elements the residents want before they even know it: \\"Through his pioneering work as an 'urbanist,' Hood has integrated architectural features such as playgrounds, plazas and squares into city sites whose pasts are vibrant but forgotten. By reflecting the shifting cultural composition and respecting the evolving nature of neighborhoods throughout San Francisco and Oakland, he has created an oasis in these areas, and through his close involvement with the local communities, he developed tailored solutions for Bay Area based parks while retaining a cohesive artistic vision. Near Chinatown in Oakland, he created a communal square for women's tai chi practice while adults and children gather year round to take advantage of their newly revived local park.\\" He was the winner in 2010 of an international design competition to design the Solar Strand, a quarter-mile long solar-panel array, financed by the New York Power Authority, on the University at Buffalo's North Campus. In 2013, Hood served as one of six selection committee members for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.http://brunerfoundation.org/rba/index.php?page=committees&sidebar;=1 In 2014, Hood was commissioned by the Metro Nashville Arts Commission to create Witness Walls, a commemorative sculpture celebrating Nashville‚Äôs civil rights history during the 1950s and 1960s. A public dedication event for the project, Nashville's first civil-rights inspired public art, was held April 21, 2017. Awards and recognition In 1997, Hood was a fellow at the American Academy in Rome in Landscape Architecture. His work was featured in the 2006 exhibit \\"The Good Life: New Public Spaces for Recreation,\\" at the Van Alen Institute in New York.http://www.vanalen.org/projects/exhibitions/02_060708_GoodLife Hood was the 2009 recipient of the prestigious Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award for Landscape Design and has exhibited and lectured on his professional projects and theoretical works nationally and abroad. In 2018, The USC School of Architecture‚Äôs American Academy in China (AAC) selected Hood as that year‚Äôs research fellow. Hood is to design an installation to be executed using only local artisans and materials in Shanghai and Los Angeles; he will also give lectures in both cities.

Biography Bland was the son of Richard Bland and Elizabeth Randolph, the daughter of William Randolph I. He has been described as \\"a plain practical man, with but slender advantages of education, of an ample fortune and respectable character\\", and \\"a respected member of Virginia's glittering planter aristocracy\\". Reported to be \\"magnificent\\", \\"spacious\\", and \\"a hospitable seat of taste and elegance\\", Bland's plantation, Cawsons, was located on a promontory where the Appomattox River turned north to meet the James River. Around 1738, Bland married Frances Bolling, the daughter of Drury Bolling. They had six children: *Elizabeth \\"Patsy\\" Bland (born January 4, 1739) married John Banister and had three sons. *Theodorick Bland (March 21, 1741/42) *Mary Bland (born August 22, 1745) *Ann Bland (born September 5, 1747) *Jane Bland (born September 30, 1749) *Frances Bland (born September 24, 1752) first married John Randolph, the son of Richard Randolph, and had four children (including John Randolph of Roanoke); then later married St. George Tucker and had five children (including Henry St. George Tucker, Sr. and Nathaniel Beverley Tucker). Bland later married Elizabeth Randolph the daughter of Edward Randolph, the granddaughter of William Randolph I, and the widow of William Yates. On November 15, 1758, Francis Fauquier, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia Colony, appointed Bland colonel of the militia for Prince George County. Before the American Revolution, the Bland and Randolph families of Virginia frequently cooperated with each other to manage their plantations. After the Gunpowder Incident at the beginning of the war, Bland, along with his son, Theodorick Bland Jr, and his son-in-law, John Randolph, offered 40 slaves for sale to raise funds to replace the gunpowder seized by Lord Dunmore from the magazine in Williamsburg, Virginia. Around January 1781, St. George Tucker assisted Bland, his father-in-law, in escaping the advancing British Army commanded by Benedict Arnold. A few months later, the British Major-General William Phillips ordered that his troops in Prince George County not harm Bland's property. In 1775, Bland owned a sorrel mare that had been imported from England by William Byrd III. Quaker-Lass was described in one stud book as \\"the finest looking mare in Virginia, of her day\\".

Alt, P. Pleshko Scanning limitations of liquid-crystal displays, IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, vol. ED-21, pp. 146‚Äì155, Feb. 1974. This is generally known as cross-talk, and in matrix displays typically occurs in the horizontal and vertical directions. Cross-talk used to be a serious problem in the old passive-matrix (STN) displays, but is rarely discernable in modern active- matrix (TFT) displays. A fortunate side-effect of inversion (see above) is that, for most display material, what little cross-talk there is largely cancelled out. For most practical purposes, the level of crosstalk in modern LCDs is negligible. Certain patterns, particularly those involving fine dots, can interact with the inversion and reveal visible cross-talk. If you try moving a small Window in front of the inversion pattern (above) which makes your screen flicker the most, you may well see cross-talk in the surrounding pattern. Different patterns are required to reveal cross-talk on different displays (depending on their inversion scheme).

He was a mainstay on his father's wrestling programme On the Mat and briefly held the NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship in 1983. Rickard also had a successful 10-year amateur career representing New Zealand as an amateur wrestler in the United States. Career Ricky Rickard began his career as an amateur at the age of 10 performing at Raynor Greeks Hall. As a youngster, he trained on a very small canvas mat before his father, Steve Rickard, purchased a rubber round mat for several thousand dollars. Rickard went on to have a long and successful career in the amateur ranks and eventually represented New Zealand in competition in the United States. Rickard later built a traditional mini-roped ring under his father's gym, where many local professional wrestlers trained, and decided to turn pro in 1978. He started his career wrestling for Steve Rickard's All Star-Pro Wrestling, the country's single major company and overseas territory of the National Wrestling Alliance. He became very well known throughout his national tours with ASPW, which lasted around two years, as well as visits to Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and the United States. Rickard was also a regular on ASPW's popular wrestling programme On the Mat where he frequently battled both local and foreign wrestlers such as Ox Baker, King Curtis Iaukea, Larry O'Day and Abdullah the Butcher. His toughest opponent, according to Rickard, was against Stampede World Mid-Heavyweight Champion Bruce Hart. He also occasionally teamed with younger wrestlers such as Kid Hardy and Rick Martel. Ricky Rickard's brother Tony was also involved with the promotion as a referee. One On the Mat episode in 1980 featured a tag team match with Ricky as a participant, Tony refereeing the match and their father Steve Rickard commentating. This was one of the few occurrences in pro wrestling history that members of the same family wrestled in, refereed, and commentated on the same match at the same time and being unrelated to an active \\"storyline\\". One of the few storylines Rickard was the focus of, however, was when his leg was broken by Larry O'Day during an off-season tour in Southeast Asia in early-1981. Steve Rickard publicly addressed the incident when On the Mat returned for a new season. In its first return episode, originally airing on March 17, 1981, Rickard read a letter from Larry O'Day who bragged about breaking his son's leg and publicly accepted O'Day's challenge to a match for the NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship. Ricky Rickard did suffer legitimate injuries during his professional career including twice breaking his nose, leg, back sockets and collar bone. Soon returning to active competition, Rickard captured the NWA British Empire/Commonwealth Championship from Butcher Brannigan in 1983 before losing the title to Larry O'Day that same year. After the cancellation of On the Mat in 1984, Rickard retired and became a hotel manager. Though no longer active in professional wrestling, Rickard did grant an interview to Kiwi Pro Wrestling, one of New Zealand's three major companies, which was later published on its website in August 2007. Three years later, one of Rickard's matches, a tag team match between him and Kid Hardy against Merv Fortune and Larry O'Day (July 29, 1980) at the Canterbury Court Stadium, was included in one of two episodes of On the Mat chosen to be shown on NZ On Screen in early-2010. The match was later used to promote the series in an internet spoof video starring Tammy Davis of Outrageous Fortune.

Though a skirmish, it ended with a significant Apache victory when they forced the small garrison of California Volunteers to retreat to the Santa Rita Mountains. Fort Buchanan was the only American military post conquered during the war against the Chiricahua.Scott, pg. 401‚Äì403 Background Due to the major civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 and numerous conflicts involving the various Native American tribes, the Union Army was stretched thin on the frontier. The southern half of New Mexico Territory and the newly created Arizona Territory joined the Confederacy in 1861 so troops in California were raised to occupy the region. After Lieutenant George Bascom's 1860 confrontation with Chief Cochise sometimes called the Bascom Affair, the Apache began attacking Union and Confederate troops across Arizona. By early 1865 the Chiricahua War was still being waged. According to reports at the time of attack, only nine American cavalrymen manned the fort, which did not have walls and was just a collection of military buildings including a vedette station. Corporal Michael Buckley from Company L of the 1st California Cavalry commanded and with the eight others he occupied the vedette station that was very similar to a small house. Battle The battle began on the morning of February 17 twelve miles away from the fort when two surveyors of the General Land Office and a young Mexican boy were attacked. William Wrightson and Gilbert W. Hopkins were traveling from a ranch in the Santa Ritas towards the fort, presently three miles west of Sonoita. Suddenly, dozens of Apache warriors opened fire with both rifles and bows. All were mounted and so a chase ensued in the direction of Fort Buchanan. The three had nearly made it there when they were overwhelmed and killed; the United States Army reported that they three did not attempt to defend themselves, no gunshots were heard, and Corporal Buckley later said that he did not know that Wrightson and Hopkins were in the area. Mount Wrightson and Mount Hopkins, the two highest peaks of the Santa Ritas, were later named after the men. Apache warriors in their traditional tribal wear. Afterward, the Apache moved on to the nearby vedette station where Corporal Buckley was sitting on the porch while five other privates rested inside. The corporal did not know he was under attack and had beforehand sent two men to cut hay in a field nearby and one man to go hunting. The Apache achieved a surprise approach and commenced the attack by sniping the corporal. Buckley was still sitting on the porch when a warrior snuck up close to him and opened fire. A bullet lodged into Buckley's thigh and he then raised his revolver and killed the warrior who fired the shot. Buckley then crawled inside the station as a swarm of warriors quickly surrounded the building. A private at this time opened fire while covering Buckley and killed a second native. The Americans took up defensive positions against an enemy estimated by Buckley to be around seventy-five men. They fired their rifles through the port holes and fought off a first attack at close range. From then on the natives skirmished with the Americans at a further range. Eventually the Apache set fire to the building and several minutes later as the roof was caving in Buckley ordered his men to retreat. To do this they would have to charge through the enemy and into the surrounding hills. When the soldiers made their retreat they fired wildly and were chased until reaching the hills where the Apaches gave up. Corporal Buckley and his men marched on foot to the mines in the Santa Ritas and reached safety. Private George English, the soldier that had been sent hunting before the attack, was never seen or heard from again, he was first recorded as missing until being presumed dead.http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=english&GSbyrel;=all&GSdyrel;=all&GSst;=5&GScnty;=169&GScntry;=4&GSob;=n&GRid;=63153052&df;=all& The two soldiers that were cutting hay heard the sound of shooting and headed back to the fort, when they arrived they found it surrounded by warriors who were emptying the buildings of goods and burning them, they also retreated to the Santa Ritas and later rejoined their troop. Aftermath Mount Wrightson (center) and Mount Hopkins (right) Two Apaches were confirmed to have been killed by Buckley who also said that because of the smoke from their rifles and the burning station, he could not tell if there were other casualties. Six horses were captured along with 250 rounds of ammunition, 200 rations, two carbine rifles and six United States Cavalry uniforms. On the following day Captain John L. Miriam received news of the attack and proceeded to the fort with twenty-five men. Just outside the post, the bodies of Wrightson, Hopkins and the boy were discovered and buried. After examining the condition of Fort Buchanan Captain Miriam ordered it abandoned and returned to Fort Tubac to the west where the rest of Company L was.

Among three road stations that were constructed in Dardania during the Roman Period, Statio Vindenis, is one of the identified stations. This archaeological site is set at the area of the village of Gllamnik, Municipality of Podujeva. The site is located approximately 5 km south, southeast from Podujeva. The ancient Via Lissus-Naissus Roman road was a diagonal route, connecting the central Balkans region with the Adriatic coast, which passed through Vindenis. The settlement and Roman road station of Vindenis are stretched on the right bank of Llap River vicinity, measuring an area of more or less of 15-20 hectares. During the eighties of the last century, systematic archaeological excavations carried out at this site, uncovered an area in total of 550 m2. Among recorded archaeological findings and features here, the most characteristic ones are the grave burials with the grave goods. The burial rites documented here, tell us about the practise of cremation and inhumation burial rites. Besides, a heavy marble sarcophagus was discovered, most probably especially prepared for a distinguished person of high economical, social and political status. Nonetheless, archaeological investigations identified several dwellings, and in particular a distinguished discovery of a floor mosaic composed with geometrical motifs, at the central part of the mosaic, the figural display panel of the Orpheus, makes this mosaic a special discovery. A special finding discovered at this site, is a gold wedding ring with a cameo which clearly indicates shaking of the right hands, which means an agreement but also symbolizes loyalty and friendship. Geophysical, geomagnetic surveys or prospection‚Äôs conducted at this locality in 2008 and 2011, in an area of at least 11 hectares of this important archaeological site, identified traces of remains of different objects that at the first impression, resemble to a military field garrison, most probably stationed there to protect the surrounding area and the road station. The archaeological site of Vindenis, was active during the entire period of the Roman rule as well as during the late antiquity.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide,Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.62.

As the consumer trend today is towards preservative-free foods with a long shelf-life, industry is being forced to rethink its manufacturing methods. Instead of adding preservative agents, increased hygienic precautions can be taken during production. A clean and hygienic manufacturing environment is an essential prerequisite in order to keep contamination-related reject rates low. The utilization of surfaces in the manufacturing environment with antibacterial properties can significantly reduce contamination risks. The determination of the antibacterial activity (microbicidy) of surfaces is described in the following norms: ISO 22196ISO 22196:2007 Plastics ‚Äî Measurement of antibacterial activity on plastics surfaces and JIS Z 2801.JIS Z 2801:2000 Antimicrobial products- test for antimicrobial activity and efficacy The Japanese norm JIS Z 2801 was published in 2000 and published again in 2007 as the internationally valid norm ISO 22196. Therefore, ISO 22196 and JIS Z 2801 are identical. In the test, both a surface system coated with sporicide and an identical surface system without an antibacterial coating are charged with selected microorganisms. A once-only assessment of the reduction factor is carried out after 24 hours by determining colony counts on the reference surface and on the antibacterial surface.

The present building was designed by architect Philipp Hoffmann in Gothic Revival style and built from 1844 to 1849. Its twin steeples of 68 m (223 ft.) dominate the Luisenplatz. The parish is part of the Diocese of Limburg.  History   The first church St. Bonifatius  The first church St. Bonifatius, 1830, collapsed on 11 February 1831 As Wiesbaden was Protestant after the Reformation, the first Catholic parish after the Reformation was founded in 1800. The congregation first met in a Bethaus (oratory) in the Marktstra√üe. It soon became too small for the growing number of Catholics in the town, which prospered as a spa and Residenz of Nassau. The parish received grounds adjacent to the Luisenplatz from the Duke of Nassau, and from 1829 to 1831 Friedrich Ludwig Schrumpf built a rigidly Neoclassical church, in keeping with the buildings around the square. Soon after the building was completed, it collapsed on 11 February 1831. A likely reason is insufficient foundation on ground which had previously been ponds.Gottfried Kiesow: Das verkannte Jahrhundert. Der Historismus am Beispiel Wiesbaden, Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz, 2005, , p. 128 (in German)  The second church St. Bonifatius  On 24 May 1843, the young Philipp Hoffmann received the commission to build a church. He had already participated in building the town castle. His design is reminiscent of Gothic architecture, but also includes elements of Romanesque architecture and naturalistic ornaments to be found later in the Jugendstil. The foundation was laid on the day of the patron saint St. Bonifatius, on 5 June 1845. The interior was consecrated by the Bishop of Limburg Peter Josef Blum on 19 June 1849. A rib vault is supported by 22 columns. The facade was completed in 1856, and the towers in 1866. In World War II the church suffered severe damage. An air raid on 2 February 1945 destroyed all the windows, the roof, and part of the vault. Repairs made in 1949 replaced the vault with a simple construction. The vault was re-built in a general restoration in 1965, which also took into account the changes of the Second Vatican Council. A new altar by Elmar Hillebrand was added in 1967. The new windows are stained glass in mainly white, red and blue, designed by Johannes Beeck. Sculptor Karl Hoffmann created a crucifixion scene and a sculpture of both St. Francis and Teresa of √Åvila.  Church music  The organ, expanded by Hugo Mayer Orgelbau in 1985 Dvo≈ô√°k's Stabat Mater: concert on 26 October 2019 An organ was built in 1954 by . In 1985 the instrument was expanded by Hugo Mayer Orgelbau; in 1995 three electronic bass stops were added. The Kantor was Gabriel Dessauer from 1981 to 2019, the conductor of the 120-member Chor von St. Bonifatius, founded in 1862, the children's choir Kinderchor von St. Bonifatius, and the Schola for Gregorian chant. He was succeeded by Roman Twardy. The church choir sings at services, including regular orchestral masses of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert for Christmas and Easter. Every year, typically on 3 October, a choral concert is performed. Other annual features are choral and organ concerts organised around a theme, called Boni-Musikwochen, including concerts of organists such as Kent Tritle and Ignace Michiels, and the project choir Reger-Chor. On 7 November 2015, as part of the 21st festival Wiesbadener Bachwochen, the church presented a concert dedicated to French church music, Gabriel Faur√©'s Cantique de Jean Racine and Requiem and Olivier Latry's Salve Regina.

Bridge Street runs for in a west‚Äìeast direction with traffic flowing in both directions. It is situated in the northern portion of the central business district. The western terminus of Bridge Street is at George Street, with the eastern terminus at Macquarie Street, adjacent to the Chief Secretary's Building. From west to east, Bridge Street crosses Pitt and Phillip streets. Bridge Street was named by Governor Macquarie in 1810, derived from a small bridge located near the intersection with Pitt Street. The bridge used to cross the Tank Stream in the early days of the colony, with the stream now flowing underground via a series of suburban tunnels. The Bridge Street stop of the CBD and South East Light Rail is located south of the intersection of Bridge Street and George Street. History ca. 1900 View east along the middle section of Bridge Street, with the Department of Lands building on the right Many years before Bridge Street was named, it was the site of Sydney's first Government House and was the abode of first Governor of New South Wales, Captain Arthur Phillip. After establishing the site of the settlement, a substantial \\"temporary\\" government house was located on the corner of what is now Bridge Street and Phillip Street. It was built under the direction of James Bloodsworth, a convict builder responsible for the construction of most of the colony's buildings between 1788 and 1800. This building, the first 'permanent' building in Sydney, was completed by 1789 using English bricks, native stone and a quantity of convict baked sandstock bricks from the Sydney region. After the initial completion the house was of two stories in height, contained six rooms and was the hub of the colony for 56 years. Eight successive governors complained of the living conditions within, each making improvements by adding their own extension. It was here on 4 June 1789, that Governor Phillip and his guests celebrated the birthday of King George III. In 1845 the entire complex was demolished to allow access and extend the street to Macquarie Street. The foundations of the house were exposed by archaeologists in 1983. The site, on the corner with Phillip Street, is now occupied by the Museum of Sydney. In March 1899, workmen installing a telegraph tunnel discovered a copper plate wedged between two stones. It was later found that it was the foundation stone of the first Government House that was laid 15 May 1788. The plate is now displayed at the Museum of Sydney. Heritage buildings Bridge Street has a number of significant buildings and sites. The following were listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. Exchange Corner (the location of the Sydney Stock Exchange) on Bridge Street, with Department of Lands building on the right and Macquarie Place on the left, ca. 1900 Macquarie Place in the 1920s * The Department of Lands building is a sandstone building designed by the Colonial Architect, James Barnet, and built 1877-90. It is three storeys high and features a copper dome and a clock tower that is a distinctive feature in the area. The building is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. * The Department of Education building is a six-storey, sandstone building designed by the government architect, George McRae. It was built ca. 1912 and features an inner structure of steel and reinforced concrete. The building is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. *Burns Philp Building: this three-storey, commercial building was built from 1898-1901. It was designed by Arthur Anderson of McCredie and Anderson in a Romanesque style. Like the other buildings, it was constructed predominantly of sandstone, with a combination of dressed stone and rough stone. The interior features elaborate cedar-work. The building is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. * The Chief Secretary's building, also designed by Barnet with later additions by Walter Liberty Vernon, is situated on the south corner of Bridge and Macquarie Streets and constructed in ca. 1878, consisting mainly of dressed sandstone. The building is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. * The former Premier's Office or Old Treasury Building is situated on the north corner of Bridge and Macquarie Streets. This two-storey sandstone building was designed by Mortimer Lewis in a Classical Revival style and built ca. 1849. A large extension was designed by Vernon and built ca. 1896. It has more recently been converted for hotel use as part of the InterContinental Hotel Sydney. In 1999 the building was added to the NSW State Heritage Register. * Macquarie Place Park is an historic site is situated on the north side of Bridge Street and was originally part of the first Government House. Governor Lachlan Macquarie intended it to be a significant public square but it was gradually whittled down over the years. It includes the obelisk designed by Francis Greenway and constructed in 1818; the bronze statue of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort erected in 1883; the cannon and anchor from HMS Sirius, the anchor having been placed on its pedestal in 1907; the Christie Wright Memorial Fountain, and the men's lavatory built in 1908, which features stucco and a glazed dome. In 2010 the site was added to the NSW State Heritage Register. * Booth House: at 44 Bridge Street, on the corner of Young and Bridge Streets and situated on land which originally formed part of the gardens of First Government House. Built in 1938, this nine-storey building is an excellent and rare expression of the Functionalist style meeting a need for continuous natural light, through bands of windows, to accommodate wool-broking activities on completion. A stylised ram's head is etched into the red granite lintel above the entrance, pale green terracotta tiles remain under copper cladding the uprights between the windows. It is now an unusual mix of commercial and residential units. *Liner House, also known as Moran House, located at 13-15 Bridge Street, is a heritage-listed office building completed in 1960 for shipping agents, Wilh. Wilhelmsen. The building has since been repurposed and in 1999 was added to the NSW State Heritage Register.

Opened in 1868, it forms part of the Pisa‚ÄìLa Spezia‚ÄìGenoa railway, and is situated between La Spezia and Genoa. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia. All of these companies are subsidiaries of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location The station is located at Piazza dei Molfino, right in the centre of the town. History On 7 November 1859, at the request of the Kingdom of Sardinia (soon to become part of the Kingdom of Italy), a resolution was proposed in the Rapallo city council for a railway linking the Italian Riviera with La Spezia, and ultimately with Rome. On 27 October 1860, the resolution was approved, and the necessary significant construction work authorised. In relation to the railway line, or more specifically to its routing, significant conflict broke out between neighboring towns in the Golfo Paradiso and Tigullio Occidentale districts. As the construction of the railway proceeded very slowly, mainly due to the structure of the terrain, the two of Recco and Rapallo decided to make a combined request to the Ministry of Public Works for a change to the routing. The two comuni proposed a design for a direct connection between themselves, and then passing under the Mount of Portofino, in place of the proposed \\"on paper\\" stations at Camogli and Santa Margherita Ligure. The two latter comuni did not wait long to respond. They also appealed to the Ministry, in opposition to the new proposed project. In 1862, the Ministry decided definitively to reject the Rapallo‚ÄìRecco proposal, prompting congratulations from the other two coastal municipalities. Thus, the railway ultimately followed the route previously chosen in 1859. In 1867, there was once again an appeal by the town of Rapallo to divert the route slightly, and this ended up causing the demolition of the chapel of St. Augustine, which was in the way. On the morning of 31 October 1868, after years of hard work, a steam locomotive embarked on its maiden voyage from San Michele di Pagana railway station to Rapallo. Regular passenger services commenced on 5 December 1868. Further changes occurred to the railway in 1909, at the request of the municipalities of Recco and Rapallo, and prompted by the first train crash in the resort of Santa Margherita Ligure on 23 August of that year. The changes included a significant expansion of the Rapallo station, making the passenger building larger than its predecessor. Features The passenger building has recently undergone a sympathetic restoration. This included the repainting of the facade in a new yellow-red colour scheme (replacing the former pink and white colours) and a move of the ticket office from the first floor to the ground floor. The old goods yard, used mostly only for the unloading of goods, is now no longer used, except for the stabling of rolling stock owned by private railways. The former perimeter of the goods yard is now part of a new parking garage owned and operated by Trenitalia. Despite the importance of the station, its track layout has recently been transformed, under operation \\"rete snella\\" (streamlined network), into a mere halting point, with no secondary tracks or points. Similar changes have also been made to several other stations on the line. Passenger and train movements The station has about 2.3 million passenger movements each year. It is served by all regional trains, and also some InterCity and Eurostar Italia trains. Interchange In the square in front of the station, there are bus stops for bus services to San Michele, Santa Maria, Savagna, Ruta and Pianello.

It contains 304 maps and 70,000 placenames in total. The Concise Historical Atlas of China () was published in 1991.  Contents  The atlas consists of 8 volumes: # Archaeological findings, Xia, Shang dynasties and Zhou dynasty (Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn period and Warring States period) # Qin dynasty, Western and Eastern Han dynasties # Three Kingdoms and Western Jin dynasty # Eastern Jin dynasty, Sixteen Kingdoms and Southern and Northern Dynasties # Sui dynasty, Tang dynasty and Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period # Song dynasty, Liao dynasty and Jin Empire # Yuan dynasty and Ming dynasty # Qing dynasty On each map, ancient places and water features are shown in black and blue respectively, superimposed on modern features, borders and claims, shown in brown. All country-wide maps, from Paleolithic onward, include an inset showing the Nine-Dash Line in the South China Sea. Placenames are given in simplified characters, though an edition of the atlas published in Hong Kong uses traditional characters.  Reception  The Atlas is considered the most authoritative compendium of ancient place names and administrative boundaries, and a tremendous improvement on its predecessor, Yang Shoujing's Lidai yudi tu (Yangtu, \\"Yang's atlas\\", 1906‚Äì1911). However, more controversial has been Tan's historical conception: This vision has been criticized as anachronistically projecting 20th-century minority policy and border claims into the distant past, resulting in a distorted view of the history of peripheral areas, portraying their incorporation into China as an inevitable organic process, rather than the result of conquest. Similarly, early states are often given overly precise and extensive outer borders, often based on contentious claims. In his afterword to volume 8, written in 1987, Tan regretted expanding the borders of Chinese empires to encompass jimi and tusi regimes.

Written by Louis Aragon, it was first published in 1926 by Editions Gallimard. It was dedicated to the surrealist painter Andr√© Masson and its preface was on the theme of a modern mythology. The two main sections of the books describe two places in Paris in great detail: Le Passage de l'Opera and Parc des Buttes- Chaumont. The detailed descriptions provide a realistic backdrop for surrealist spectacles such as the transformation of a shop into a seascape in which a siren appears and then disappears. This literary device is le merveilleux quotidien -- a contrast of the mundane with the marvellous. Arnold Bennett described the work as stimulating but uneven. He thought it the best of the six books which he bought in Paris when visiting there in 1927. Walter Benjamin was deeply affected by the book, which became a point of departure for his unfinished magnum opus, The Arcades Project.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/benjamin/#BioSke Louis Aragon was disappointed with the book's reception by the French literary establishment which he considered too bourgeois and commercial.

This practice is common in the UK, where several agencies dominate the market. Motorhome hire is a type of vacation rental. History Motorhome hire agencies emerged in the UK in 2005, after motorhome hire as a practice began to take off with holidaymakers in the UK. In recent years, motorhome hire agencies in the UK have become increasingly popular for two reasons. Firstly, many UK motorhome owners have sought to earn an additional income from their motorhome due to recession-related issues such as job losses. This led to many motorhome owners fearing the repossession of their vehicle. Secondly, UK holidaymakers were looking for a cheaper alternative to overseas travel and travellers from outside the UK benefited from a favourable exchange rate. How it works The concept of motorhome hire is similar to that associated with holiday cottage rentals. Motorhome owners list their vehicles with a hire agency. The vehicle is typically given an online profile and marketed by the hire agency. Bookings come through the agency and the company deals with all the financial matters and insurance. The customer is then able to collect the motorhome from the owner and the owner is paid a fee. Most UK agencies work on a commission basis. For example, hirer X may pay ¬£1000 for a 1 week hire. The motorhome hire agency will then subtract the VAT and insurance costs before paying a commission percentage to the motorhome owner. The percentage paid varies between different companies with some paying 50% or lower, and some up to 75%. Whilst the vehicle is on hire with the agency it is protected by their insurance and breakdown cover. In the event of damage or an accident, the motorhome hire agency will retrieve the necessary cost of repair from the hirer. Any motorhome owner can register their motorhome with a hire agency provided that they can supply it in clean working order to customers. Taxable income In the UK, residents are required to declare income from the hire of motorhomes, whether privately or through an agency, to HM Revenue and Customs. This applies whether the overall earnings are below or above the taxable threshold. Industry developments The first major motorhome hire agency industry development came in 2006 when the first online availability search was implemented by Motorhome Group. This was also coupled with online booking; allowing customers to book and pay for privately owned motorhome over the internet.

Medical supplies are scanned into the system, stored and then dispensed at the pharmacy sales counter using conveyor technology. The company has its headquarters in Kelberg, Eifel and employs over 300 staff. There are subsidiaries in Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. In 2011 turnover reached about 64 Million Euros and the company is one of the top 100 companies in Rheinland-Pfalz in terms of turnover. In 2011, Rowa was integrated in the global medical device company CareFusion, San Diego.  History  Rowa Automatisierungssysteme GmbH was founded in 1996 by Rudolf Wagner and Markus Willems. In 2006, Dirk Wingenter joined the management board and in 2009, Dr Christian Klas became the fourth member of the board. In 2011, Jean-Michel Deckers became a member of the board. The original business idea was triggered by a couple of pharmacists. They were keen to restructure workflows effectively in the modern pharmacy. In 1997 the first automated storage and dispensing system was installed in a Dresden pharmacy. Today about 10,000 pharmacies and hospitals all over the world are using Rowa Systems. PharmaXie, presented as the pharmacy of the future at the world fair Expo 2000, was equipped with Rowa storage and dispensing systems.  Product range  Rowa produces and distributes automated stock handling systems for pharmacies. These systems are developed individually for each pharmacy or hospital. Like in a high-bay warehouse, medicaments are stored in random storage according to their size and height. These systems are developed individually for each pharmacy or hospital and store medication supplies as if in a high-bay warehouse without being ordered by size or depth. With high flexibility of the size, the systems can be adapted to the particular requirements of each pharmacy. Additional options include fully automated storage, or a consultation and dispensing terminal for pharmacies. In the latter case, patients can get advice through a video-conferencing facility and medicine can be dispensed remotely. This system, known as Visavia, is currently being contested in Germany. As a result of a decision (Reference Number 3C 30.09 and 31.09) by the German Federal Administrative Court, it is only partially approved. In other countries this type of terminal is in extensive use.

Belhaven Neighborhood is named after Confederate veteran Jones S. Hamilton's house, which became the namesake of Belhaven University. Belhaven is a historic district and one of Jackson's oldest neighborhoods and cultural centers as well as home to many of the city's oldest houses and buildings. Many popular and successful locally owned businesses are located within Belhaven, including a number of restaurants, shops, stores, and a bed and breakfast inn. Belhaven is considered to be one of the most architecturally diverse neighborhoods in the United States, much of which can be seen through the Greater Belhaven Neighborhood Architectural Tour. Confederate Colonel Jones S. Hamilton, whose old house is the namesake of the Belhaven Neighborhood. The Fountain on the campus of Belhaven University, one of The Greater Belhaven Area's best-known landmarks. Belhaven Subdivisions Belhaven is subdivided into two major areas: Belhaven and Belhaven Heights. The borders of Belhaven are generally considered to be Woodrow Wilson Avenue to the North, Interstate 55 (I-55) to the East, Fortification Street to the South, and State Street to the West. The borders of Belhaven Heights are generally considered to be Fortification Street to the North, Interstate 55 (I-55) to the East, High Street to the South, and State Street to the West. The Greater Belhaven Neighborhood Foundation represents the citizens of both areas and their interests. Belhaven Heights is noticeably more hilly than Belhaven, although both areas are among the highest elevations within Jackson. Although local residents tend to refer to the area north of Fortification Street as \\"Belhaven\\" and the area south of it as \\"Belhaven Heights\\", most residents refer to both areas collectively as \\"The Greater Belhaven Area\\" or simply \\"Belhaven\\" when used in the context of The City of Jackson as a whole.  Bright Lights, Belhaven Nights Festival Once per year near the beginning of Autumn, Belhaven hosts \\"Bright Lights, Belhaven Nights\\", a neighborhood-wide festival and block party featuring food from a variety of local restaurants, music from local musicians and bands, and a variety of other entertainment, as well as a number of souvenir and street vendors. History The area now known as Belhaven Neighborhood or \\"The Greater Belhaven Area\\", then located to the north of Jackson city limits, remained largely unsettled until shortly after the American Civil War. Many Jackson residents, seeking refuge after the destruction and chaos wrought by Union soldiers during and after the Siege of Jackson, moved northward and began rebuilding their homes. Jones S. Hamilton, a veteran of the Confederate States Army who became a millionaire from convict leasing after the war, built a \\"palatial home [...] on Boyd Street, east of Jefferson.\\" Hamilton named it Belhaven after his ancestors's house in Scotland. In 1894, he donated it to the \\"Belhaven College for Young Ladies\\", a new college chartered by Dr. Lewis Fitzhugh in what is now Belhaven Heights. In 1910, the house burned down but was reopened in 1911 as \\"Belhaven Collegiate and Industrial Institute\\" at its current location on Peachtree Street. In 1915, the school was renamed \\"Belhaven College\\". Subsequently, residents began referring to the area around the school as \\"The Belhaven Neighborhood\\" or simply \\"Belhaven\\". Over the years the name has extended to include what became known as Belhaven Heights. Today, the use of the name \\"Belhaven\\" can refer to \\"The Greater Belhaven Area\\" (meaning both \\"Belhaven\\" and \\"Belhaven Heights\\", Belhaven University, or both. Fortification Street, which runs East and West through Belhaven, is paved over what was once one of the last Confederate battle lines during the Siege of Jackson. Although most structures in Jackson were burned by Union soldiers employing a Scorched Earth Policy during and after the siege (under the direction of General Ulysses S. Grant), many of Belhaven's older structures remained untouched. Locally Owned Businesses Belhaven is home to many of Jackson's finest restaurants including Lou's Full-Serv, Keifer's Restaurant (Greek casual fare), The Pizza Shack, The Manship Wood Fired Kitchen,http://themanshipjackson.com and La Cazuela Mexican Grill‚Äîeach of which has won several \\"Best of Jackson\\" awards from the Jackson Free Press. Fenian's Pub, an authentic Irish Public House or \\"Pub\\", is also located in Belhaven and is one of Jackson's most popular bars. Belhaven is also home to many other locally own businesses, such as McDade's Market and Kat's Wine Cellar. New Stage Theatre is also located in Belhaven and is one of only a handful of theaters located in the Jackson-Metro Area. The Fairview Inn, located on Fairview Street and built as a private mansion in 1908, is today run as a luxury bed and breakfast inn and spa. Old House Depot, located on Monroe Street, is an architectural salvage warehouse and retail store which specializes in antiques and vintage housing decor. Residents Belhaven houses one university within the neighborhood itself, Belhaven University, and is located within relative proximity to two other universities, The University of Mississippi Medical Center and Jackson State University, as well as two colleges, Millsaps College and Mississippi College School of Law. Thus, many of Belhaven's residents are either faculty or staff working at one (or more) of these institutions, or students. As a result, Belhaven has an eclectic mix of young residents, many of which are from out-of-state and often remain only as long as they are attending school, living alongside older residents who tend to be more permanent. Likewise, Belhaven is home to a widely diverse dog and cat community. Often in the mornings and evenings many dogs can be seen walking or jogging beside their owners on the various sidewalks paved throughout the neighborhood. As well, there are a number of local, outdoor cats who are known by many of the residents on any particular street, most of whom are friendly.

He was born in the town of Jelsa on the island of Hvar. As the youngest of five brothers, he spent his childhood in a warm community with his parents, father Gianni and mother Margarita, who published a book of poems in ƒçakav≈°tina dialect. As a 5-year-old child, on Christmas Eve, Gianni was introduced to his first microphone and climbed onto a stage of the local church. The event was all the more special because he performed a song written and composed by his mother. In 1989, he arrived at Zagreb and enrolled in the University of Theology. Six years later Gianni founded a vocal ensemble klapa ‚ÄúJelsa‚Äù and recorded two albums with them. Later that year Gianni attended an audition for the Croatian National Theater‚Äôs choir, which resulted in permanent engagement. Cooperation with a vocal coach, professor Stojan Stojanov, resulted in his first solo opera engagement in 'La Traviata', an opportunity offered by the Opera Director at the time, Maestro Vladimir Kranjƒçeviƒá. Ever since 2001, Ivo Gamulin has made noteworthy appearances in many operas staged at the Croatian National Theater: La Traviata, Aida, Don Carlos, Rigoletto, Nabucco, Simon Bocanegra (G. Verdi), PLA≈†T (G. Puccini), Boris Godunov (M. P. Musorgski), Tristan I Izolda (R. Wagner), West Side Story (L. Bernstein), KORIOLAN (S. ≈†ulek). In collaboration with the symphonic orchestra and Croatian Radio Television choir he appeared in: Animal Farm and Glagolitic Requiem (I. Kuljeriƒá), PETAR SVAƒåIƒÜ (J. Gotovac), Porin (V. Lisinski), Vukovar Requiem (D. Bobiƒá), Pozdrav Svijetu (M. Kelemen), Muka Gospodina NA≈†EGA Isusa Krista (B. Papandopulo), Misa Solemnis (L. Ebner), Misa Solemnis in C (J. P. Haibel), Krunidbena Misa (W.A. Mozart) and Stihovi Pokajanja (A. Schnittke). At Vara≈ædin Baroque Nights he had many performances: Vivaldi's SPIRITUAL MUSIC with Slovenian chamber choir and Slovenian philharmonic, Musaical Scenographic Overview from the Opus of J. Bajamonti with Split chamber orchestra and festival choir, as well as the world premiere of Cavalli's opera Pompeo Magno directed by Paul Eastwood. He appeared alongside Slovenian chamber choir in the performance of Croatian Mass by Boris Papandopulo. Together with the choir, Gianni also recorded an album. Collaboration with various ensembles continued, whereas his performances were accompanied by the Slovenian philharmonic in Ljubljana, Kri≈æevci, Vara≈ædin and Po≈æega, the Symphonic orchestra of RTV Slovenia, the Croatian Radio Television choir, the Croatian National Theatre choir from Rijeka in Beethoven's 9th SYMPHONY and the Chamber orchestra in Mozart's REQUIEM. At 3rd International Tenor Competition in Trogir Gianni won the third prize and in 2005 he was nominated for the Croatian Acting Guild prize for the role of Ismaile in NABUCCO (G. Verdi) and a young sailor in TRISTAN AND ISEULT (R. Wagner). He presented himself to a wider audience in 2007 with an album released by Dallas Records Ljubav to si ti, incorporating pop songs into it. Ever since then the tenor achieved a series of notable performances in Croatia and neighboring countries. Gianni has been performing alongside big names in Croatian music, such as: Tereza Kesovija, Radojka ≈†verko, Doris Dragoviƒá, Maja Blagdan and others. As for international singers, he continuously collaborates with the Slovenian music diva Helena Blagne and the Macedonian singing star Kaliopi. In the year of 2009 Gianni held a gala benefit concert at Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall with the Revue Orchestra of the Zagreb Philharmonic. The exclusive guest of the concert was a celebrated Italian diva Anna Oxa. In the summer of 2010 Gianni had an honor to perform at the shows of the great American singer Natalie Cole in Croatia as an exclusive guest of her entire European tour. Apart from numerous collaborations with both Croatian and international stars, together with Dallas records Gianni has recorded a Christmas album called Bo≈æiƒána priƒça, which has been released in December 2010 and contains a duet with an American music icon Gloria Gaynor, accompanied by the Symphonic Orchestra of Croatian Radio Television. All songs were arranged by the composer John Cameron.

He was the second-eldest son of Ammittamru II. Ibiranu's older step-brother and heir apparent to the throne, Utri-Sarruma, decided to leave the kingdom when his mother's marriage was annulled, and Ibiranu became the next king of Ugarit.Watson, 1999, p. 681 Ibiranu reigned between c. 1235 and 1225/20 BC, and was a contemporary of Tudhaliya IV and Arnuwanda III of Hatti. As a vassal state of Hatti the king was answerable to the viceroy at Carchemish.Leick, 1999, p. 75 After he became king, Ibiranu failed to present himself to the Hatti overlord as the diplomatic protocol of a vassal state required him to do. His failure to do so, and to send valuable gifts to compensate for his mistake raised concerns and he received several letters of reprimand from the local viceroy, Ini-Teshup, and the king's son, Pihawalwi. The letters, discovered among the cuneiform tablets found at Ugarit, also revealed that Ibiranu failed to send sufficient troops to participate in the king's campaigns.Bryce, 2003, pp. 215‚Äì217 On suspicion that Ibiranu was keeping his best chariots in Ugarit, a letter from the Carchemish viceroy states that an inspector from the Hatti king would be sent to Ugarit to verify the number of troops at Ibiranu's disposal.Watson, 1999, p. 686 The king's reluctance to present his allegiance to the Hittites seems to suggest a loss of confidence in their protection. This explanation is corroborated by a letter found in the Ugaritic archives addressed to Ibiranu from the Assyrian king, Tukulti-Ninurta I, describing the heavy defeat he inflicted on the Hittites in northern Mesopotamia.

Lawrence is a British amateur astronomer best known for his popularization of astronomy on the BBC's The Sky at Night with Sir Patrick Moore, Paul Abel and Prof. Chris Lintott. He is also well known for his high resolution images of the Sun, Moon and Planets.  Biography  Lawrence first became interested in astronomy when he was a small boy, around the time of the Apollo Moon landings. His parents bought him a small 40mm refractor telescope and very soon, after hunting down the planet Saturn with it, he was hooked. Lawrence recalls 'I remember Sir Patrick Moore visiting my school and leaving such a strong lasting impression that I decided I just had to have a larger telescope. Being a schoolboy at the time, my funds were limited so my next telescope was completely homemade; I even ground the main 8.75\\" mirror myself!' Mirror grinding is a very labour-intensive task, and it took Lawrence a long time to make the mirror. The final instrument was successfully used for a number of years prior to Lawrence leaving home to study astrophysics at University. After gaining his degree, Lawrence moved into software development and was the director of a computer software company called Data Graphic Applications Limited for many years. Astronomy became his main focus again after the loss of his youngest brother, James, in 2004. To date, many of Lawrence's images have been published both in magazines, books and on the internet. He has had more than 200 images published on the popular Spaceweather website as well as having numerous Astronomy Picture of the Day entries published. All of his current work have been published under the name Pete Lawrence. Lawrence is probably best known for innovative approaches to imaging, which show astronomical events and phenomena in unusual ways. Examples of this include the Lunar Parallax Demonstration Project (Lunar Parallax Demonstration Project ‚Äì 2004 update) and the Search for the Shadow of Venus (Search for the Venusian Shadow ‚Äì part 2). In recent years Lawrence joined the team of co-presenters on the BBC's The Sky at Night, he has also written many articles on the subject and provides the monthly Sky Guide for the BBC Sky at Night Magazine. He provided general astronomical advice for the BBC Wonders of the Solar System series and acted as astronomical consultant for the BBC Stargazing Live series aired in early January 2011. He was also the astronomical consultant for the long running BBC Radio 4 series, The Archers. He frequently produces high resolution images of the Sun in particular and the Moon and planets from his observatory in Selsey.  Academic Background  Lawrence attended and graduated from the University of Leicester with an honours degree in Physics with Astrophysics, but the fortuitously timed lure of an interesting job in computer software development diverted him away from any further academic studies.  Popular Astronomy  Lawrence continues to promote astronomy through popular articles and television. He has appeared on Blue Peter and his skills and advice are much sought after in the field of solar and planetary imaging. His interest in the night sky continues unabated today, and he has merged his computer expertise with astronomy, using digital cameras for astrophotography. Here, the lure and challenge of being able to capture images of dynamic astronomical events proved irresistible and after many years he now has an extensive library of images.

The formal name in Japanese was the \\"August 1993 Heavy Rain\\" (Âπ≥Êàê5Âπ¥8ÊúàË±™Èõ®). The death toll was 71, and about 2,500 people who were in cars, buses and trains were saved by fishing boats and ferries which carried them to Kagoshima through the Kagoshima Bay. Weather in 1993 The 1993 Japanese rainy season was longer than usual, as a high pressure area in the Pacific Ocean was weak, marking a cold summer. The Japan Meteorological Agency had earlier declared the end of the rainy season only to cancel it. Toward the end of July, three typhoons landed; of them, two on Kyushu. In August, Typhoon No. 7 came close to Kyushu, and toward the end of August, Typhoon No. 11 approached the Kanto area and later landed on Hokkaido. A total of six typhoons landed in Japan. The cold summer lowered production of rice and led to the rice shortages in the Heisei era. Weather in Kyushu The total rain amounted to 1000 mm in southern Kyushu, causing landslides or floods. On August 1, torrential rain in the Aira district reached 104 mm an hour at Mizobe, 405 mm in one day. The death toll reached 23 in the central parts of Kagoshima Prefecture. National Highway No.10, Kyushu Expressway Motorway and Japan Railway railroads were completely out of service. Buildings in the Sakurajima Service Area were destroyed. On August 6, Kagoshima city was badly hit with 99.8 mm /hour rain (at Kohriyamacho). There were 48 people who were killed and one was lost. Of the five stone bridges built in the Edo era on Kohtsuki River, two were destroyed. Damage The damage caused by the debris flow was large. In the Ryugamizu area, where mountains were close to the sea, and highways and railroads are situated, 22 debris flows occurred and 2500 people were trapped in 1200 cars, as well as buses and trains, until they were saved by fishing boats and ferrys which carried them to Kagoshima city through Kagoshima Bay.

Because of his contributions to Wang Jian's cause, he, like few under Wang Jian's command, was given military governorships (Jiedushi). Wang Jian eventually became suspicious of his intentions and put him to death.  Background and initial service under Wang Jian  It is not known when Hua Hong was born, but it is known that he was originally from Yingchuan (ÊΩÅÂ∑ù, in modern Xuchang, Henan).Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 39. (As Wang Jian himself started his military career at Zhongwu Circuit (), which was headquartered at Yingchuan, Hua probably became Wang's follower while Wang served as an officer there.)See Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 35. The first reference in history to a campaign involving Hua was in 891, soon after Wang had taken control of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), with the assistance of his ally Gu Yanlang the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan). That winter, after Gu Yanlang died and was succeeded by his brother Gu Yanhui, Yang Shouliang the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), who had recently joined a campaign of resistance against Emperor Zhaozong of Tang headed by his adoptive uncle, the eunuch Yang Fugong, attacked Dongchuan with the intent of seizing it from Gu Yanhui. Gu sought aid from Wang, and Wang sent Hua, along with the officer Li Jian () and his adoptive sons Wang Zongkan () and Wang Zongbi, to assist Gu against Yang Shouliang's forces. Wang Jian, however, secretly informed the Xichuan officers that he sent that, after they defeated Yang's forces, Gu would invite them to a feast, and that they should seize Gu at the feast so that he could take over Dongchuan without a campaign. After Wang Zongkan subsequently defeated Yang Shouliang's brother Yang Shouhou () to force Shannan West forces' retreat, however, Wang Zongbi leaked Wang Jian's instructions to Gu, and Gu took precautions and so was never seized by the Xichuan forces.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. In 892, when Wang Jian sent his nephew Wang Zongyu (), Wang Zongkan, and Hua to attack Yang Sheng () the military governor of Weirong Circuit (Â®ÅÊàé, also headquartered in modern Chengdu) at Weirong's capital Peng Prefecture (), Yang Shouliang tried to come to Yang Sheng's aid by sending his officer Fu Zhao () to attack Xichuan's capital Chengdu. Wang Jian summoned Hua back to Chengdu to resist against Fu's attack. Hua led his forward troops personally and rushed back toward Chengdu, but pretended to have a much larger army by having his soldiers beat drums loudly. Fu, believing incorrectly that the Xichuan forces had all returned from Peng Prefecture, withdrew. Later in the year, when Wang Jian sent Hua to attack Yang Shouliang's forces at Lang Prefecture (Èñ¨Â∑û, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan), Hua defeated Yang's forces there.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. In winter 895, Wang Jian began his campaign against Gu in earnest. As part of the operations at that time, Hua inflicted a great defeat against Dongchuan forces at Qiulin (Ê•∏Êûó, modern location unknown), killing or capturing tens of thousands of Dongchuan soldiers.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. As Wang continued the campaign, Hua continued to be a major participant, and it was during the campaign, in 896, that Wang formally adopted him as a son (as Wang did with many officers), changing his name to Wang Zongdi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261.  After adoption by Wang Jian  With Wang Jian's forces capturing Dongchuan's prefectures one by one and eventually putting Dongchuan's capital Zi Prefecture () under siege, Gu Yanhui committed suicide with his family members in summer 897. Wang Jian took over Dongchuan and made Wang Zongdi the acting military governor. (Emperor Zhaozong initially tried to make the imperial official Liu Chongwang () the new military governor of Dongchuan, but recalled Liu upon hearing that Wang Jian already made Wang Zongdi the acting military governor; he also confirmed Wang Zongdi as acting military governor.) Meanwhile, Wang Zongdi, believing that Dongchuan's territories were too vast to be effectively governed as one circuit, suggested that five prefectures be carved out of Dongchuan and be made into a circuit of their own; subsequently, Wang Jian suggested it to the imperial government, which approved of the proposal, so five prefectures were carved out into a new Wuxin Circuit (), with its capital at Sui Prefecture (ÈÅÇÂ∑û, in modern Suining, Sichuan). In winter 898, Emperor Zhaozong officially commissioned Wang Zongdi as the military governor of Dongchuan. In 900, Wang Zongdi was given the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). In 901, Wang Zongdi offered to resign on account of illness, and Wang Jian sent Wang Zongyu to replace him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. Later in 901, after the powerful eunuch Han Quanhui forced then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong of Tang to leave Chang'an to go to the territory of Han's ally Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), whom Emperor Zhaozong's chancellor Cui Yin had just summoned in order to carry out Cui's plot of slaughtering the eunuchs (and whose plot Han was reacting to), attacked Fengxiang to try to recapture the emperor. Both Li and Zhu sought aid from Wang Jian. Wang Jian tried to play both sides by outwardly agreeing with Zhu and rebuking Li, but sent secret messengers to Fengxiang to encourage Li to hold out ‚Äî while sending Wang Zongdi and another adoptive son, Wang Zongji, north to attack Shannan West Circuit, which Li possessed at the time. In 902, after a siege in which Wang Zongdi and his soldiers scaled the walls of Shannan West's capital Xingyuan (), Li's adoptive son Li Jimi () the military governor of Shannan West surrendered it, allowing Wang Jian to take it under possession.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263.  Death  Wang Jian initially commissioned Wang Zongdi as the military governor of Shannan West, but Wang Zongji and several other generals, jealous of Wang Zongdi, submitted false accusations against Wang Zongdi. Wang Jian, who was already apprehensive of Wang Zongdi because Wang Zongdi's bravery impressed the soldiers, further was apprehensive that his own headquarters, which were painted red, were referred to by the people as the \\"Red Paint Tower\\" (Áï´Á¥ÖÊ®ì, Hua Hong Lou). Wang Jian thus recalled Wang Zongdi to Chengdu and rebuked him over the accusations that Wang Zongji and the others laid against him. Wang Zongdi responded, \\"The Three Shus [(i.e., Xichuan, Dongchuan, and Shannan West)] have been pacified, while the Prince [(i.e., Wang Jian, who had been created the Prince of Shu by Emperor Zhaozong)] listens to false accusations. It is time to kill those with accomplishments.\\" Wang Jian subsequently had his close associate Tang Daoxi get Wang Zongdi drunk, and then strangle him to death. It was said that when the people heard of Wang Zongdi's death, the merchants stopped their trades, and the soldiers in the barracks all cried. After Wang Jian established his own state of Former Shu in 907 as its emperor, he issued an edict in which, while continuing to blame Wang Zongdi for having improper ambitions, also recounted his accomplishments and posthumously restored his offices.

The question of succession to Muhammad, the nature of the Imamate, the status of the twelfth Shia Imam, and other areas in which Shia Islam differ from Sunni Islam have been criticized by Sunni scholars, even though there is no disagreement between the two regarding the centrality of the Quran, Muhammad, and many other doctrinal, theological and ritual matters. Shia commentators such as Musa al-Musawi and Ali Shariati have themselves, in their attempts to reform the faith, criticized practices and beliefs which have become prevalent in the Shia community. Image veneration Common representations of some Imams Sunnis are particularly critical of the \\"love of visual imagery evident in Shia popular devotionalism\\" and regularly cite this characteristic (often referred to as 'Shia iconography') as proof of Shia deviance or heresy. Occultation Jamkaran in Iran, supposed site of a historical appearance of Muhammad al-Mahdi In the tradition of Twelver Shia Islam, the twelfth and final Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is also considered by Twelver Shia to be the prophesied redeemer of Islam known as the Mahdi, went into ghaybah (\\"occultation\\") in 873. However, this belief has long been criticized by Sunni scholars who \\"often speculate that the twelfth Imam never existed, but was a myth designed to keep the Shia cause alive.\\"The Routledge Handbook of Religion and Security, by Chris Seiple, Dennis R. Hoover, Pauletta Otis, 2012, page 60 Meanwhile, western scholars have also cast doubt upon the existence of an occulted Imam. According to Robert Gleave, the occultation of the 12th Imam \\"became subsequent orthodox doctrine\\" after none of the competing theories that sought to explain the succession to a childless 11th Imam \\"seemed satisfactory\\".A Companion To The History Of The Middle East, edited by Youssef M. Choueiri, page 93 According to Bernard Lewis, the occultation and subsequent return of the Imam became a characteristic Shi'ite doctrine following the \\"suppression of many risings and the disappearance of their leaders\\"; where the leader disappears and \\"his followers say that he is not dead; he has gone into concealment\\". With each new leader \\"who disappeared and did not return\\", this belief was \\"enriched\\" and became more detailed and \\"essential\\" as a \\"feature of Shia Islam.\\"Islam and the West, by Bernard Lewis, 1993, page 163 However, according to Wilferd Madelung in Encyclopedia of Islam, the doctrine of the Occultation was well-documented by traditions of the Imams before the occultation of the Twelfth Imam whom the majority of the Imamiyya came to consider as the Mahdi after the death of the eleventh. As an example he mentions that \\"the pattern was already set in regard to Mu·∏•ammad b. al-·∏§anafiyya, whose death was denied by the KaysƒÅniyya [q.v.]. They believed that he was hidden in the mountains of Ra·∏çwƒÅ and would return to rule the world. Similar beliefs arose around Mu·∏•ammad b. al-·∏§anafiyya‚Äôs son Ab≈´ Hashim\\"al-Mahdƒ´. Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill Online, 2012. Reference. University of Southern California. 18 June 2012 Moreover, Madelung names several Sunni scholars who have similar beliefs. In a Hadith upon whose authenticity Shias and Sunnis agree, Muhammad had said, \\"If there were to remain in the life of the world but one day, God would prolong that day until He sends in it a man from my community and my household. His name will be the same as my name. He will fill the earth with equity and justice as it was filled with oppression and tyranny.\\" However, the majority of Sunnis do not consider the son of eleventh Imam as the promised Mahdi. Shias claim the only possible occasion that the son of eleventh Imam is said to have made a public appearance was at the time of his death, then as a child the boy was seen no more. His birth, Shia says, like the case of the prophet Moses, was concealed due to the difficulties of the time, and because of the belief that he was the promised Mahdi, the caliphs of the time had decided definitely to put an end to the Imamate in Shi'ism once and for all. Nikah mut'ah Nikah mut‚Äòah (lit. \\"pleasure marriage\\"), is a fixed-term marriage practiced in Twelver Shia Islam. The duration of this type of marriage is fixed at its inception and is then automatically dissolved upon completion of its term. For this reason, nikah mut‚Äòah has been widely criticised as the religious cover and legalization of prostitution.Iran talks up temporary marriages, by Frances Harrison, BBC News, Last Updated: 2 June 2007.Temporary 'Enjoyment Marriages' In Vogue Again With Some Iraqis, by Nancy Trejos, The Washington Post, 20 January 2007. Law of desire: temporary marriage in Shi'i Iran, by Shahla Haeri, pg.6.Islam For Dummies, by Malcolm Clark.Islam: a very short introduction, by Malise Ruthven. The Christian missionary Thomas Patrick Hughes criticized Mut'ah as allowing the continuation of \\"one of the abominable practices of ancient Arabia.\\" \\"In permitting these usufructuary marriages Mu·∏•ammad appears but to have given Divine (?) sanction to one of the abominable practices of ancient Arabia, for Burckhardt (vol. ii. p. 378) says, it was a custom of their forefathers to assign to a traveller who became their guest for the night, some female of the family, most commonly the host‚Äôs own wife!\\" Hughes, T.

Russia and Iran in the great game: travelogues and Orientalism. Routledge studies in Middle Eastern history. 8. Psychology Press. pp. 162‚Äì163. . \\"Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution.\\" have written that this kind of marriage is prostitution. According to Shahla Haeri, in Iran the middle class itself considers it to be prostitution which has been given a religious cover by the fundamentalist authorities.Haeri, Shahla (1989). Law of desire: temporary marriage in Shi'i Iran. Contemporary issues in the Middle East. Syracuse University Press. p. x. . \\"Outside of the religious establishment and the ongoing disputes between Shi'i and Sunni scholars, the attitude toward temporary marriage has been primarily one of ambivalence and disdain. Before the revolution of 1979, the secular Iranian middle classes dismissed temporary marriage as a form of prostitution that had been legitimized by the religious establishment, who, to use a popular Persian expression, 'put a religious hat on it.'\\" Even though nikah mut øah is rejected by Sunni schools of law, there are several types of similar marriages including misyar,  øurfi, halala marriages and in fundamentalist circles, jihad al nikah which are practiced in the Sunni world. None of which are accepted by the Shia Muslims because they are bid‚Äòah (innovation in religion), not found in the sunnah or the Quran as opposed to mut‚Äòah which was initially practiced and is found in both. Nikah mut‚Äòah was practiced at the time of Muhammad and Abu Bakr, but was outlawed by the second Caliph, Umar ibn Khattab. Therefore, it is forbidden among Sunnis, but Shia consider Umar's account as legally and religiously invalid, as they argue it's legitimated by Quran 4:24.Temporary marriage, Encyclopedia IranicaMichel Foucault, Discipline and punish: The birth of Prison, Trans Alan Sheridan (New York: Vantage, 1979)Mahnaz Afkhami, Erika Friedl - 1994 In the eye of the storm: women in post-revolutionary Iran - Page 105 Shia have systematically contested the criticism that it is a cover for prostitution, and argue their rationales regarding the legal uniqueness of temporary marriage, which distinguishes Mut'ah ideologically from prostitution.Sachiko Murata, Temporary Marriage in Islamic Law Children born of temporary marriages are considered legitimate, and have equal status in law with their siblings born of permanent marriages, and do inherit from both parents. The bride must not be married, she must attain the permission of her wali if she has never been married before, she must be Muslim or belong to Ahl al-Kitab (People of the Book), she should be chaste, must not be a known adulterer, and she can only independently do this if she is Islamically a non-virgin or she has no wali (Islamic legal guardian). At the end of the contract, the marriage ends and the wife must undergo iddah, a period of abstinence from marriage (and thus, sexual intercourse). The iddah is intended to give paternal certainty to any children should the wife become pregnant during the temporary marriage contract. Some Shia scholars also view Mut'ah as a means of eradicating prostitution from society.Said Amir Arjomand (1984), From nationalism to revolutionary Islam, page 171 Taqiyya (dissimulation) Taqiyyah is a Shi'ite practice under which it is permissible to hide one's faith in order to preserve life. The Shia have been criticised for this practice, an act deemed against the virtues of bravery and courage.Mu·∏•ammad ·∏§usayn ·π¨abƒÅ·π≠abƒÅ ºƒ´, Muhammad H. Al-Tabataba'i. Shi ªite Islam. Issue 5 of The Persian studies series. SUNY Press, 1977. , . Pg 227 Critics argue that the Twelvers have taken dissimulation far beyond life-threatening situations and have allowed its use in any scenario that is judged to benefit the continuation or propagation of the Twelver creed, as is emphasized by the \\"celebrated\\" reputed saying of the 6th Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, \\"[t]aqiyyah is my religion and the religion of my forefathers\\"; along with his other often quoted saying from Kitab al-Kafi: \\"Nine tenths of faith is taqiyya.\\" The practice is widely criticized by Sunni Muslims as indicative of the problems that they face when interacting with Shi'ites. According to Patricia Crone, Twelvers even extended the use of taqiyya \\"to protect their secret wisdom from exposure to the uncomprehending masses (including their own co-religionists), who might pervert it or denounce it as heretical.\\" This view has been supported by Faysal Noor in his book Taqiyyah: The Other Face. Living as a minority among the Sunni majority, however, made such a doctrine important to Shia. Besides, the practice of concealing one's beliefs in dangerous circumstances originates in the Qur'an, which deems blameless those who disguise their beliefs in such cases. The practice of taqiyya in difficult circumstances is considered legitimate by Muslims of various sects. Sunni and Shia commentators alike observe that verse refers to the case of 'Ammar b. Yasir, who was forced to renounce his beliefs under physical duress and torture. This practice was emphasized in Shia Islam whereby adherents may conceal their religion when they are under threat, persecution, or compulsion.\\"Taqiyah\\". Oxford Dictionary of Islam. John L. Esposito, Ed. Oxford University Press. 2003. Retrieved 25 May 2011. Taqiyya was developed to protect Shia who were usually in minority and under pressure. In the Shia view, taqiyya is lawful in situations where there is overwhelming danger of loss of life or property and where no danger to religion would occur thereby. Shia commentators have argued that taqiyya has precedents from the time of Muhammad, including the story of Ammar ibn Yasir, Such commentators argue that to not avoid certain death is illogical, and that dissimulation is permissible under various circumstances, such as to preserve life, to protect the chastity of women, or avoid destitution. Disrespect to Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman One allegation commonly leveled against the Twelvers is that they disrespect the Sunni Caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman who supported Mohammad, as per Sunni belief,Nicholas Schmidle. To Live Or to Perish Forever: Two Tumultuous Years in Pakistan. Macmillan, 2010. , . Pg 23 during the early days of the Islamic Ummah but later turned enemies of his household (Ahl al Bayt), as per Shi'ite belief.The History of al- Tabari, Volume IX, The Last Years of the Prophet, p186-187, SUNY Press Such Shi'ite practices include the recited Dua Sanamain Quraish, which calls God's curse on the first two Sunni caliphs following Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr and Umar. Following the Safavid empire's conversion to the Shia sect of Islam, the first three caliphs, whom the Shia felt usurped Ali's right to be caliph, were cursed during Friday sermons.Patrick Cockburn. Muqtada: Muqtada al-Sadr, the Shia revival, and the struggle for Iraq. Simon and Schuster, 2008. , . Pg 25 As Sunni scholar Shaykh Saleh Al-Fawzan summarises the views of the Rafidis as compared to the Nasibis: :The Raafidis are the opposite: they love the Prophet's family (ahl al-bayt) - or so they claim, but they hate the Saahaaba, whom they curse, denounce as kaafirs, and criticize.Muhammad Saed Abdul- Rahman. Islam: Questions and Answers - Schools of Thought, Religions and Sects, Volume 8. MSA Publication Limited, 2003. , . Pg 102 During the 1960s, when an incipient ecumenical movement called for the unification of Shia and Sunni Islam, religious writers cited this \\"disrespect\\" for the Sahabah as a barrier to unification. In the 1980s and 1990s, three major religious writers in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan again cited this argument, noting that until all \\"profanity\\" against the Sahabah was abandoned, dialogue with Shia scholars could not begin.Jamal S. Suwaidi. Iran and the Gulf: a search for stability. I.B.Tauris, 1996. , 9781860641442. Pg 165 In 2010, Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa which bans any insult to the companions of Muhammad, as well as his wives. The fatwa was issued in an effort to reconcile legal, social, and political disagreements between Sunni and Shia. The same fatwas were issued from Ali al-Sistani and other Shiite Marja'. However, some Shi'ite scholars in the past, such as Shaykh Tusi,Abu Ja'far al Tusi wrote in his book \\"al Iqtisad\\", page 36: \\"Ayesha was adamant upon waging war against Ali (as), and she did not repent. This proves her kufr and her remaining on it.\\" Muhammad Baqir Majlisi,Allamah Baqir Majlisi wrote in Bihar al-Anwar, volume 22, page 233: ( \\"Allah (swt) says in Qur'an [Allah has cited for the kuffar the example of the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut.] (66:10), I (i.e. Allamah Baqir Majlisi) declare: It is not a secret for the discerning critic (reader/observer) and the one who is clever and knowledgeable that what is mentioned in these verses is an exposure, in fact an explicit declaration of the hypocrisy of Aisha and Hafsah as well as their kufr (disbelief).\\" Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi, Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, Hossein Vahid Khorasani,On 24th Jumada Al-Awwal 1438 AH (which coincided with 22 February 2016), Grand Ayatollah Sheikh Wahid Al-Khorasani said that Abu Bakr and Umar took the land of Fadak from Fatima unjustly, and so they have no right being buried in the house of the Holy Prophet, as \\"it is usurped land\\". In the presence of hundreds of scholars, students of knowledge, and believers, then went on to say: \\"It is therefore the duty of every single Muslim now to dig up the graves of these two men (i.e. Abu Bakr and Umar), and to exhume what remains of their corpses. In fact, the ruling of burial in usurped property is the obligation of exhumation according to legal consensus. This is the principle and this is the conclusion.\\" See: . Ruhollah Khomeini,Kitab al-Taharah Volume 3 Page 457: As for the other groups of the Nawasib, actually the Khawarij, even though they'll get more punished than the Kuffar, yet this is not proving them to be Najis (impure). Hence, if a ruler makes Khurooj (opposes/fights) Amir Al- Mu'mineen (as) not for religious reason, rather for worldly reason (seeking power) or other motives like A'isha, Zubair, Talha, Mu'aawiya and their likes, or if someone holds Nasb/enmity towards him or one of the [twelve] Imams (as), not due to religious reason rather because of his enmity towards the Quraish, or Bani Hashim or the Arabs or because [Ali] killed one of his children or his father etc. Apparently none of those are necessarily considered Najis (impure) from an apparent point of view, in fact they are more impure than dogs and pigs. See: Mohammad Jamil Hammoud al-Amili,On his official website, the Grand Ayatollah \\"reaffirmed\\" the Shia belief that \\"Aisha committed zina\\". See: Yasser Al-Habib, cursed and/or allowed for disrespecting of the figures revered by the Sunnis, on the grounds that religious truth cannot be compromised in the name of a false unity. Mourning Husayn and self- flagellation during Ashura Moharram, Bahrain, 2011 Twelvers have been criticised for the practice of Tatbir (a form of self-flagellation) during Ashura, the observation of the martyrdom of Husayn, traditionally accompanied by acts of ritual self-harm, which is often described as barbaric. The practice is contested among Shi'ite clerics: while traditionalist clerics allow believers to indulge in Tatbir, modernist clerics deem it not to be permissible because it is considered as self-damage and haram in Islam. Suffering and cutting the body with knives or chains was banned by the Shi'ite marja Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran and by Hezbollah in Lebanon.Edith Szanto, \\"Sayyida Zaynab in the State of Exception: Shi‚Äòi Sainthood as ‚ÄòQualified Life‚Äô in Contemporary Syria,\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 44 no. 2 (2012): 285-299. Khamenei issued a fatwa on 14 June 1994 banning this practice. He considered it irreligious and not suitable for good Muslims. According to Salafi Sunni scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah and Abd al- Aziz ibn Baz, the celebration of Ashura is itself a blatant and primary example of the propensity of the Shia to indulge in Bid‚Äòah (religious innovation). They argue that the annual mourning occasion for Husayn (or any other individual) was never instituted or practiced by Muhammad ‚Äî not even for his closest family members ‚Äî and hence has no validity in Islam.Iqtida' as- Sirat al-Mustaqim (Following The Straight Path), by Ibn Taymiyyah, p. 300-301.Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah, by Ibn Taymiyyah, vol. 4, p. 554-556.Fataawa al-Shaykh ‚ÄòAbd al-‚ÄòAzeez ibn Baaz (8/320). Likewise, Ibn Rajab in his Kitab al-Iata'if argued against Ashura: \\"Neither God ..., nor His Messenger ... have ordered that days on which prophets met with calamities and the day of their death be instituted as a day of mourning. How much more is this true for a person lesser than they?\\" Child Imams Three of the Twelve Imams, held by the Twelver Shia to be God's representatives on Earth, were less than ten years old when they assumed the undisputed and exclusive leadership of the Twelver Shi'ite community. The 9th Imam, Muhammad al-Taqi, was 7 and a half years old at the time he assumed the Imamate; the 10th Imam, Ali al-Hadi, was between 6.5 and 8.5 years, and the 12th and final Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, was 4 and a half years old. Pakistani Islamic scholar and polemicist Ehsan Elahi Zaheer argues against the possibility of these personalities assuming the leadership of the Imamate at such young ages.Shia's and Shiaism, there Genesis and Evolution: Shia Sects , by Allama Ehsan Elahi Zaheer. Text quotation: \\"If God had commanded us to obey an adolescent, He would have also ordered the adolescent to obey His injunctions. Just as it is unlawful to declare a non-adult as \\"Mukallaf\\", similarly he is not legally empowered to arbitrate among people. He can not grasp the subtleties and intricacies involved in the solution of problems; he is not fully conversant with religious injunctions and the rules and regulations of Sharia. The Sharia introduced by the holy Prophet (peace be upon him) which is the basic need of the Ummah till the arrival of the doomsday is obviously beyond the range of an adolescent's comprehension. If a non-adolescent can handle these complicated and sensitive issues, then we can also expect a child who is in his cradle and swings to the rhythms and melodies of nursery rhymes, to show an awareness of these issues and to suggest solutions to dis-entangle their knots. But it all sounds absurd because adolescence is not the same things as non-adolescence and a child can not rationally be expected to behave like a grown-up person. The perceptions and reflections of the former do not operate at the same wave lengths as those of the latter.\\" Wilferd Madelung notes, however, that in Shi'ite belief, the knowledge of an Imam comes from \\"inspiration, not acquisition\\", and thus that even a young Imam is not considered unprepared, receiving revelation upon the death of his predecessor.An Ismaili heresiography, by Wilferd Madelung, Paul Ernest Walker, pg.114-115 As for the ninth Imam, the Shia could not help asking from his father, the eighth Imam whether a child at that age could take on such a responsibility if something happened to Imam Ali al-Ridha; and al-Ridha used to illustrate the story of Jesus who was even younger when he had become the prophet of his time John the Baptist was also a child when he was given wisdom. His reading and understanding of the scriptures, surpassed even that of the greatest scholars of the time.A‚ÄìZ of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, B. M. Wheeler, John the Baptist Shia'ites claim that their account of Al-Ma'mun's first meeting with Muhammad al-Jawad shows that wisdom is given to the Twelve Imams. After which the Caliph called together a great gathering in which all kinds of questions were asked from the young Imam, who astonished them all with his judgment and learning. Then al-Ma'mun declared formally that he gave him his daughter in marriage thereby. However, Sunnis themselves believe that numerous lay people could assume a role of scholarly leadership at the very young age. Sunni Al- Tabari is said to have memorized the Qur'an at seven, was a qualified prayer leader at eight, began to study the prophetic traditions at nine, and left home to study when he was twelve. Other criticisms include the Sunni belief that Imamah is allegedly not mentioned in the Quran and the absence of such a crucial pillar in Shia Islam brings into question the validity of such claims. The Twelver Imamah doctrine is not shared by the majority of Sunni Muslims. The Syrian Salafi mufti Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 728 AH/1328 AD) composed a long refutation of it in his Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah.See \\"Ibn Taymiyya‚Äôs Critique of Shia Imamology. Translation of Three Sections of his \\"MinhƒÅj al- Sunna\\", by Yahya Michot, The Muslim World, 104/1-2 (2014), pp. 109-149. Numerous Shia scholars proved the concept of Imamah as being in the Qur‚Äôan; Usama al-Altar,YouTube; Is Imamah mentioned in the Holy Quran? Moustafa al- Qazwini.YouTube; Imamah in the Quran Infallibility of Imams Twelver Shi'ism has been criticized for exaggerating the holiness and infallibility of its Imams. Al-Kulayni in al-Kafi claims that the Imams know when they die and they do not die unless by their own choice, they know everything in the past and in the future and every time when God informs Muhammad, He orders him to inform Ali too. In Islamic Government Khomeini writes: \\"Amongst the necessities in our doctrine is that our Imams have a dignity which no favored angel nor sent prophet could ever reach. As it has been narrated, the Imams were lights under the shadow of the throne before creating this world.\\"I. M. N. Al-Jubouri. Islamic Thought. page 314 According to critics this purity is close to that of the prophet Muhammad, if not quite on the same level, and reflects excessiveness of view.I. M. N. Al-Jubouri. Islamic Thought.page 107 Shia Islam has been criticised for magnifying the role of the Imams alongside, or even above, that of Muhammad.M. F.Sayeed. Fundamental doctrine of Islam and its pragmatism.page 298 Both Shia and Sunni are in agreement over the two functions of prophet-hood: to reveal God's law to men, and to guide men toward God. However, while Sunnis believe that both have come to an end with the death of Muhammad, Shi'ites believe that whereas legislation ended, the function of guiding and \\"explaining divine law continued through the line of Imams.\\" In Shi'ite theology, thus, God does not guide via authoritative texts (i.e. the Qur'an and Hadith) only but also guides through some specially equipped individuals known as Imams. This constitution, Shi'ites say, is not limited to Islam, but each great messenger of God had two covenants, one concerning the next prophet who would eventually come, and one regarding the immediate successor, the Imam. For example, Sam was an Imam after Noah, Ishmael was an Imam after Abraham, Aaron or Joshua after Moses, Simon, John and all the disciples after Jesus, and Ali and his descendants after Muhammad. It is narrated from the sixth Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, \\"where there to remain on the earth but two men, one of them would be the proof of God\\". The difference between apostles (Rasuls), the prophets (Nabi) and the Imams, thus, is described as follows: \\"Rasul sees and hears the angel in awakeness and sleep. Nabi hears the angel and sees him while asleep, but does not see him while awake though hears the speech. Imam (muhaddith) is the one who hears the angel in awakeness while does not see him in awakeness or sleep.\\" According to Shia, the status and authority attributed to Imams will be senseless if they are prone to the same weakness found in general people. God must assign someone similar to prophet in his attributes and Ismah as his successor to guide the people and to interpret the Quran. Shi'ites claim their sources state that the Ahl al-Bayt, which are described purified of sin in the Verse of Purification, are Ahl al-Kisa, involving only specific members of the Prophet's family, and Shias claim this as an argument for their infallibility. Fatimah's divine revelations According to some Twelver Shia scholars, Muhammad's daughter Fatimah received divine revelations after her father's death. During the 75 days that Fatimah had contact and communication with Gabriel, her husband Ali wrote down and recorded the revelations that were made to Fatimah which she dictated to him, to form the Book of Fatimah.Kitab Al-Kafi, Chapter 40 (Statements about al-Jafr, al-Jami‚Äò and the Book of Fatima (a.s.)) , H 639, Ch. 40, h 5, translated by Muhammad Sarwar. A sound tradition according to Grand Ayatollah Khomeini in: \\"THE POSITION OF WOMEN FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF IMAM KHOMEINI\\", pg. 10-11. This tradition quotes Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, as saying: \\"After the death of her father, Fatima, upon whom be peace, lived for 75 days. She was in this world and she was overcome with grief. Gabriel, the Trusted Spirit, came to her regularly to console her and tell her of future events.\\" Sunnis argue that Fatimah never received divine revelations from Allah. According to the Twelver Shi'ite fifth Imam, however, this kind of revelation is not the revelation of prophethood but rather like the inspiration (ilham) which came to Mary (mother of Jesus), the mother of Moses and to the bee. Khums Khums is a tax to pay one-fifth of Muslims' acquired wealth from certain sources toward specified causes. It is treated differently in Shi'ite and Sunni Islam.Abdulaziz Sachedina (1980), Al-Khums: The Fifth in the ImƒÅmƒ´ Shƒ´ øƒ´ Legal System, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 276-277, 275-289, note 10 In Sunni Islam tradition, the scope of khums tax has been the spoils of war, while according to Twelver religious practice, Khums is an annual taxation on 20% of all profits. This wealth is collected and managed by Shi'ite religious leaders. However, according to scholars such as Musa al-Musawi, the modern development of the practice of collecting khums exclusively by Shia religious leaders, especially the Sayyid clerical elite, is simply a case of the usurpation of the place of the hidden Imam Mahdi, and as a way of enriching the clerical class.al-Shra wa-l-taskih, Musa al-Musawi, pp. 65-76The Just Ruler in Shi'ite Islam, Abdulaziz Sachedina, pp. 237-45Shi'a Islam: From Religion to Revolution, Heinz Halm, pp. 93-94 Khums, according to Shiah, is divided into two portions. One portion went to the descendants of Muhammad, the other portion was divided equally and one part given to Imam and clergy, while the other part went to the orphaned and poor Muslims.John L. Esposito (2004), The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, Oxford University Press, , pp. 174 Khums became a major source of income and financial independence of the clergy in Shi'ite regions. Shi'ites justify the practice of khums by the fact that unlike Sunni religious leaders, non-Iranian Shi'ite ones, are not state sponsored and supported in their mission. For example, Turkish \\"Presidency of Religious Affairs\\" only trains and employs all of Turkey's Sunni imams, as well as administers only Sunni worshiping places, despite the fact that Shias make up 25-30% of Turkish citizens, and on non- voluntary basis, participate in the financing of the Sunni mosques and the salaries of Sunni imams, while their places of worship, which are not officially recognized by the State, do not receive any funding. Three prayer times per day While Sunnis have 5 salat (prayer) sessions per day, Twelvers can opt to pray only 3 times per day by doubling their prayers on 2 occasions2017? How to Survive: Road-Testing the Options, Looking for Loopholes, by Kevin Staffa, p. 66.Islamic Customs and Culture, by Jason Porterfield, p. 10.Textbook on Muslim Law, by Rakesh Kumar Singh, p. 26.‚Äîcombining the 2nd prayer with the 3rd and the 4th prayer with the 5th.Muslim Cultures Today: A Reference Guide, edited by Kathryn M. Coughlin, p. 91.Islam: A Concise Introduction, by Neal Robinson, p. 98. However, Sunnis argue this very practice defeats the purpose of having 5 distinct prayers, since God ordered 5 prayers for 5 separate times of the day rather than 3 prayers for 3 separate times of the day and that Shia have misrepresented the ambiguity of the issue in the Quran for their own convenience.Muslims: Bio- cultural Perspective, by S. H. M. Rizvi, Shibani Roy, p. 5.World Criminal Justice Systems: A Comparative Survey, by Richard J. Terrill, p. 605. Twelvers extract this ruling from the two most important sources of jurisprudence which are the Quran and the Sunnah of the Messenger Muhammad who was praying this way, as it is also reported by Sunni sources, thus they believe this backs their claims accepted within a Sunni point of view. It is even reported from the hadith that the Messenger did this so that no one among his Ummah should be put to [unnecessary] hardship however this can also be interpreted for people in long journey or ill health, Shias believe this is enough to reject any accusation of not basing their actions from Quran and Traditions. Rejection of predestination Twelvers reject predestination.Need of Religion, by Sayyid Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi, p. 14.Islamic Beliefs, Practices, and Cultures, by Marshall Cavendish Corporation, p. 137.Religions of Man, by Charles Douglas Greer, p. 239.Muslims, by S. H. M. Rizvi, Shibani Roy, B. B. Dutta, p. 20. This has led to Sunni criticism of Twelvers, along with their associated belief in Bada' (change in God's will), as being deniers of God's complete sovereignty, and as being imitators of the Mu'tazila school of Islamic theology.Ethnic Composition and Crisis in South Asia: Pakistan, by Haraprasad Chattopadhyaya, Sanat K. Sarkar, pp. 766-7.The Sunni-Shia Conflict in Pakistan, by M≈´s√° ·∏¥·∫ñƒÅn JalƒÅlza ºƒ´, pp. 279-80. Shia states that matters relating to the human destiny is of two kinds: definite and indefinite; to explain the definitive one, Shia argues that God has definite power over the whole of existence, however, whenever He wills, He can replace a given destiny with another one; and that is what is called indefinite destiny. Some of these changes of destiny, thus, are brought about by man himself, who can through his free will, his decisions, and his way of life‚Äîlay the groundwork for a change in his destiny as pointed out in the verses: Truly, God will not change the condition of a people as long as they do not change Their state themselves. Both types of destinies, however, are contained within God's foreknowledge, Shia argues, so that there could be no sort of change (Bada)concerning His knowledge. So the first type of destiny does not mean a limitation of God's power; since God, in contrast to the belief of Jews who says the hand of God is tied‚Äô asserts: Nay, His hands are spread out wide .... So God has the power to change everything he wills and God's creativity is continuous. Accordingly, as Sobhani puts it, \\"all groups in Islam regard \\"bada\\" as a tenet of the faith, even if not all actually use the term.\\" Corruption of the Quran Twelvers are often criticised by Sunnis for believing that the Quran was altered by the Sahaba (companions of Muhammad). Groups such as the Deobandis accuse Twelvers of believing that the complete version of the original Quran is in the possession of their 12th Imam. Twelvers are also accused of believing that the present Quran is omitted of the verses which support the Imamate of Ali because Caliph Uthman removed them during his compilation of the book ‚Äî noting the incompatibility of the belief that the codification and propagation of the Quran was truthfully undertaken by the Sahaba, who, in Shi'ite tradition, represent the earliest people to take the Caliphate from its rightful claimants and to have corrupted the religion of Islam. As a result, such Sunni groups reject the Shi'ite defense that they believe in the same Quran as Sunnis, accusing Shi'ites of lying in line with their practice of taqiyyah so as not to expose themselves to the certain Sunni backlash. Most of Shi'ites nowadays believe that nothing have been omitted or added to the Quran, however, traces of earlier views can be found in some books of Shi'ite ahadith like Bihar al-Anwar. The contemporary Shi'ite scholar Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei states that even if the Book of Ali (a copy of Quran written by Ali containing Ali's commentary, which sometimes is called the Book of Ali) incorporated additions that are not part of the existing Quran, this does not mean that these additions comprised parts of the Quran, and have been dropped from it due to alteration. Rather, these additions were interpretations or explanations of what God was saying, or were in the form of revelations from God, explaining the intention of the verses in the Quran. These additions were not part of the Quran and not part of what the Messenger of God was commanded to convey to the Muslim community. Karbala shrine of Husayn in Karbala, Iraq Twelvers have been accused of raising Karbala in Iraq to holiness and prominence ‚Äî which in itself is \\"frowned upon by Sunnis\\" ‚Äî above even Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. This belief is exemplified by the attribution of the title Karbala-i for one who has performed pilgrimage there (just as one who makes the Hajj is titled Hajji), its annual attraction of more pilgrims for Ashura and Arba'een than the Hajj (seen as \\"a counterweight and a challenge to the annual haj taking place in Mecca\\"), prostrating during salat on turbah, commonly made from the clay of Karbala, and to numerous ahadith attributed to the Imams which are interpreted by critics as placing the land of Karbala above the Kaaba. Violence and persecution Iran, the Twelver Shi'ite bastion, is accused of the persecution of its Sunni minority and the historical persecution of Sunnis since at least Safavid times, e.g. there are no Sunni mosques in any of Iran's large cities. It is also accused of supporting the suppression of Sunnis in such countries as Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, both directly and through the militias it funds, such as Hezbollah and the private militias in Iraq. Another common target of persecution by the Iranian Twelver religious establishment is the Bah√°'√≠ community, which itself is a religion that branched off from Shi'a Islam. However, Twelvers have themselves often been victims of Anti-Shi'ite violence.  Responses to criticism  Shi'a religious scholars and converts to Shia Islam gave responses and refutation to the suspicions raised about Shi'a Islam, published it in books and lectures, These are the most prominent books : Debates & discussions section (shia islam) See also *Criticism of Islam *Criticism of religion *Islamic schools and branches *Akhbari-Usuli Controversies *Shia‚ÄìSunni relations *Sunni fatwas on Shias Notes References * Category:Twelvers Category:Shia Islam Category:Anti-Shi'ism Category:Criticism of Islam Category:Islam-related controversies ","title":"Criticism of Twelver Shia Islam"},{"id":"29998039","text":"Fustius sterlingi is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Michael Fibiger in 2010.

Budziszewski (born 1952) is professor of government and philosophy at the University of Texas, Austin, where he has taught since 1981. He specializes in ethics, political philosophy and the interaction of these two fields with religion and theology.UT College of Liberal Arts Budziszewski has written widely, in both scholarly and popular venues, about a variety of moral and political issues including abortion, marriage, sexuality, capital punishment, and the role of judges in a constitutional republic. His principal area of publication is the theory of natural law. He has been a leading advocate for natural law theory over the past twenty years.Kevin Lee: \\"Contemporary Challenges to Natural Law Theories\\", The Catholic Social Science Review 12 (2007): 41. In this context, he has given particular attention to the problem of moral self-deception: What happens when human beings tell themselves that they don't know what they really do. Among his research interests are also virtue ethics and the problem of tolerance. Apart from his scholarly philosophical work, Budziszewski is known for articles and books of Christian apologetics, addressed to a broad audience including young people and college students. Known as one of the prominent evangelical intellectuals in America and former atheist, Budziszewski was received into the Roman Catholic Church on Easter Sunday 2004. After his conversion, he continues to address his writings and lectures on Christian themes to Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians, as well as to those who are uncertain of their beliefs but are sincerely seeking.Audio Library Download  Education  After graduation from high school in 1970, Budziszewski began studies at the University of Chicago, choosing it partly because of its biopsychology program (which in fact he never entered) and partly because of its reputation as a hive of left-wing activity. Intellectually, Budziszewski was then obsessed with mind-body problems; politically, he was far to the left. After two years, however, he quit school in the conviction that he should learn a trade and join the proletariat. Becoming a welder, he worked a variety of jobs, ending up at the Tampa shipyards. When he realized that he belonged in college after all, he earned his BA at the University of South Florida, his MA at the University of Florida, and his PhD at Yale University. He has been teaching at the University of Texas at Austin since finishing his doctoral studies in 1981, where he teaches courses on the American Founding and the natural law tradition of Thomas Aquinas.  Research on self-deception  One of Budziszewski's research interests has been to analyze what he regards as general human tendency to self-deception.For the most accessible treatment of this theme, see What We Can't Not Know: A Guide (Spence Publishing, 2003, second edition forthcoming 2011 from Ignatius Press); for the most scholarly treatment, see The Line Through the Heart: Natural Law as Fact, Theory, and Sign of Contradiction (ISI Books, 2009). The problem arises from a theoretical tenet defended by Thomas Aquinas, who he said \\"we must say that the natural law, as to general principles, is the same for all, both as to rectitude and as to knowledge.\\"Thomas Aquinas: Summa Theologiae, I II, Q. 94, Art. 4 This claim amounts to saying that the most general principles of right and wrong are not only right for everyone but known to everyone, even though the same cannot be said of their remote implications. According to Budziszewski, Aquinas is right. He argues that often, even when people appear to be ignorant of the moral basics, the hypothesis that they are self deceived provides a better explanation of their actual behavior.J. Budziszewski: What We Can't Not Know: A Guide, chapter 7; see also The Revenge of Conscience: Politics and the Fall of Man. This leads to Budziszewski's theory of guilty knowledge, of violated conscience. Following Aquinas, Budziszewski distinguishes between synderesis, which supplies the first principles of practical reason and which he calls \\"deep conscience,\\" and conscientia, which he calls \\"surface conscience\\" and supplies judgments about particular acts. According to Budziszewski, conscience operates in three different modes: In the cautionary mode, it alerts us to the peril of moral wrong and generates an inhibition against committing it. In the accusatory mode, it indicts us for wrong we have already done. In the avenging mode, it punishes the individual who knowingly does wrong but refuses to admit that he or she has done so. Conscience is therefore teacher, judge, or executioner, depending on the mode in which it is working.J. Budziszewski: What We Can't Not Know: A Guide, chapter 7; see also The Revenge of Conscience: Politics and the Fall of Man. The most original part of this schema is what Budziszewski says about the avenging mode. The most obvious penalty of guilty knowledge is the feeling of remorse. Remorse is not always present. However, Budziszewski suggests that even when remorse is absent, guilty knowledge generates objective needs for confession, atonement, reconciliation, and justification. Calling these other four \\"Furies\\" the \\"greater sisters of remorse,\\" he argues that they are \\"inflexible, inexorable, and relentless, demanding satisfaction even when mere feelings are suppressed, fade away, or never come.\\" He argues that > [t]he normal outlet of remorse is to flee from wrong; of the need for > confession, to admit what one has done; of atonement, to pay the debt; of > reconciliation, to restore the bonds one has broken; and of justification, > to get back in the right. But if the Furies are denied their payment in > [their proper] coin, they exact it in whatever coin comes nearest, driving > the wrongdoer's life yet further out of kilter. We flee not from wrong, but > from thinking about it. We compulsively confess every detail of our story, > except the moral. We punish ourselves again and again, offering every > sacrifice except the one demanded. We simulate the restoration of broken > intimacy, by seeking companions as guilty as ourselves. And we seek not to > become just, but to justify ourselves.J. Budziszewski: What We Can't Not > Know: A Guide, p. 140; see also The Revenge of Conscience: Politics and the > Fall of Man Budziszewski holds that the only way to break this vicious circle is to admit that one has done wrong and to repent, in reliance on the grace of God. Failure to break out of the vicious circle leads to a variety of moral pathologies in the individual, the culture, and the body politic.J. Budziszewski: What We Can't Not Know: A Guide,chapter 7; see also The Revenge of Conscience: Politics and the Fall of Man.  Research on tolerance  A second major area of Budziszewski's scholarly work is the problem of toleration. Budziszewski considers toleration one of the virtues. Like the Aristotelian moral virtues, it lies in a mean between extremes. One way to miss the mark is overindulgence, whereby we tolerate what we ought not tolerate. The other way is narrowmindedness, whereby we fail to tolerate what we ought to tolerate. Because \\"tolerating\\" means not just putting up with things, but to put up with things that we find false, bad, or offensive, the question may arise why toleration is a virtue at all. According to Budziszewski, the answer is that sometimes the nature of the good itself requires putting up with some evil. Christians, for example, tolerate atheists not because they are in doubt about the truth of Christian beliefs, but because of their conviction that faith, by its nature, cannot be coerced, and that God does not desire unwilling obedience.J. Budziszewski: The Line Through the Heart, chapter 10. See also J. Budziszewski: True Tolerance: Liberalism and the Necessity of Judgment (Transaction, 1992) This analysis of tolerance makes Budziszewski a sharp critic of contemporary liberal theories of toleration, which are commonly based on moral neutrality, on suspension of judgment about goods and evils. Budziszewski insists that if we were to suspend judgment consistently, we could neither defend the practice of toleration, nor decide which bad things should be tolerated. The true foundation of toleration is not suspension of judgment, but better judgment, and not neutrality about goods and evils, but deeper insight into them. Indeed, argues Budziszewski, the proponents of neutralist theories actually suspend judgment only selectively, using a facade of neutrality in order to smuggle their moral views into policy without having to defend them.  Research on the natural law tradition  A significant portion of Budziszewski's work focused on the natural law tradition. His understanding of the natural law is much indebted to that of Thomas Aquinas.J. Budziszewski: The Line Through the Heart: Natural Law as Fact, Theory, and Sign of Contradiction. Wilmington: Del: ISI Books. 2009. In his book, The Line Through the Heart, Budziszewski attempts to show us how the natural law continues to illuminate the ethical and political dimensions of human existence today despite our best efforts to ignore it.Steven McGuire: Book Review of J. Budziszeski's \\"The Line Through the Heart\\". http://lehrman.isi.org/blog/post/view/id/461 Natural law is a fact in that it is real, we know it, and we cannot change it. It is a theory because we can reflect on our pre-theoretical knowledge of the natural law and attempt to develop a systematic account of it. Finally, the natural law is a scandal, it angers us because it confronts us.  Research on Thomas Aquinas  Most recently, Budziszewski has become known for an ongoing series of publications on the work of Thomas Aquinas, especially line-by-line commentaries on portions of the Summa Theologiae (see Works.)

Early career  He attended SV≈† Vazovova in Bratislava (1966‚Äì1969) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the Comenius University in Bratislava (1969‚Äì1974).Mgr. Peter Kres√°nek: √önia miest Slovenska His desk was History of art and architecture. He is fluent in English, German and Russian.  Political career  On January 16, 2000, Peter Kres√°nek was one of the co-founders of Slovak Democratic Christian Movement (Slovak: Slovensk√° demokratick√° a kres≈•ansk√° √∫nia (SDK√ö)). Before, he was a member of Christian Democratic Movement (Slovak: Kres≈•anskodemokratick√© hnutie (KDH)).  Case little trains (Kauza vlaciky)  The case involved the buying of 35 leightweigt motor trains with ties to the Minister of Transport Jozef Macejka (SDKU) and the Prime Minister of Slovakia Mikul√°≈° Dzurinda (SDKU). There was a police investigation but no one was charged. At a political level, Prime Minister Dzurinda recalled Jozef Macejka from his post of Minister. A letter written by Peter Kres√°nek to the Prime Minister of Slovakia at that time Mikul√°≈° Dzurinda leaked to the public. It contained the legendary line: \\"Gabo (note: a very familiar form of Gabriel (Palacka) who was the treasurer of Slovak Democratic and Christian Union ‚Äì Democratic Party) takes the thing alternatively according to the fact that the background is the same for the party.\\"http://www.sme.sk/c/5608887/koalicia-kritizovala-trnku-davno-aj- dzurinda.html Peter Kres√°nek was later expelled from his political party SDKU.http://www.ineko.sk/file_download/9/publikacie_heso_2002.pdf  Responsibility  As the Mayor of Bratislava Peter Kres√°nek supervised the sale of city buildings to various (at that time) opposition political parties, including the headquarters of SDƒΩ and D√ö. For example a similar demand by coalition party SNS was denied. The most scandalous sale was a large building on ≈Ωabotova street (today the headquarters of KDH), which was sold under non- transparent circumstances in 1997 for a fraction of its cost. Analysts from one company (P67 Value) estimated that Mayor Kres√°nek's additions to the contract alone cost the city 4 million crowns.http://www.sme.sk/c/108039/aky- je-druh-zodpovednosti-petra-kresanka.html Kres√°nek is also politically responsible for bringing the public transport in Bratislava to the brink of collapse. Despite the city continuing to grow, under his tenure the bus service was reduced for the first time on April 18, 1994. On September 5, 1994, the bus lines were reduced again. The management of public transport under his tenure as Mayor of Bratislava resulted in a situation when in mid-1990s during peak hours it was common for people only being able to squeeze themselves into the second or third bus in a row at some busy bus stops. The undignified conditions in public transport and strong preference of personal transport within the city infrastructure coupled with the new economic freedom caused a surge in personal vehicles in Bratislava, creating transport problems for years to come.

It aired on the BBC in four episodes between 27 November and 11 December 1991. It was based on the novel Clarissa published in 1747-48 by Samuel Richardson. It follows a virtuous young woman who is oppressed by her ambitious family and a rake who becomes obsessed with her. Plot The virtuous Clarissa (Wickham) inherits a fortune from her grandfather but gives it into the control of her jealous family. Clarissa is the image of a youthful, virtuous young woman. Lovelace (Bean) arrives to seduce Clarissa's sister Arabella (Baxter) and the two go out for a walk. Clarissa is also in the gardens and comes across the two in embrace. Lovelace catches sight of Clarissa and is immediately enchanted by her, which Arabella notices and becomes disgusted. From that point onwards, Lovelace attempts to see Clarissa again even as her family tightens their grip of control on her and bans her from seeing Lovelace. This control is primarily backed by her devious sister Arabella and brother James (Phillips), both of whom plot to foil any chances at happiness for Clarissa. Eventually the family decides that Clarissa will marry the wealthy Mr. Solmes (Firth). In an attempt to force her hand in this marriage, the family bans Clarissa from writing or sending letters and removes Clarissa's dear friend Anna Howe (Norris) from the household, also replacing a maid who informs James about Clarissa's every move. Clarissa repeatedly tries to reach her family, including having her new handmaid deliver letters to her uncle, father, and mother. All three of whom she used to be close to, the handmaid returns with all three letters having been ripped up and unread. Her brother and sister also physically incapacitate Clarissa and force the realization of a dull future with Mr. Solmes onto her. Realizing the severity of her situation and feeling isolated, Clarissa feels forced to seek the protection of Lovelace and his family. Clarissa delivers a letter to Lovelace through a loose brick in the henhouse. Clarissa dreams that night of her wedding, all in white, with her family in attendance. Lovelace appears and draws his sword on her family in threat before turning it towards Clarissa and fatally stabbing her through the heart. Lovelace acts genuine towards Clarissa but is actually a rake who wants to seduce her. Clarissa leaves on the night of her letter to meet Lovelace and ends up, reluctantly, going with him to an inn. The two sleep in separate rooms but Lovelace blatantly hints at his true intentions. They bicker the next day and Clarissa continues to hold on to her virtue and deny Lovelace his affections. Lovelace continues to press her, but changes tactics to beg Clarissa for help in becoming a better man himself. He approaches Clarissa with the Bible and informs her that he is practicing reformation. She agrees to assist him in his repentance but wonders what Lovelace's true intentions are. He lodges her with a madam and her prostitutes. Her reputation ruined, she tries to run away, but is tricked into coming back, ostensibly to marry him and restore her reputation. As the whores hold her down, Lovelace rapes her. He insists he wants to marry her, but she wants no part of him and escapes. Distraught, Clarissa starves herself to death. Lovelace's family reject him and his erstwhile friend kills him for ruining her.

Marie Kude≈ô√≠kov√° (also known as Maru≈°ka Kude≈ô√≠kov√°) (24 March 1921, Vnorovy, today Hodon√≠n District, Czechoslovakia ‚Äì 26 March 1943 Breslau, Lower Silesia, Nazi Germany, today Poland) was a student active in the Czech resistance to Nazi occupation during World War II. In 1941 she was arrested by Gestapo and at a subsequent trial she was sentenced to death. She was executed in 1943. While in prison, she wrote 32 letters, later published under the title \\"Zlomky ≈æivota: listy z vƒõzen√≠\\" (Fragments of Life: Letters from Prison). Kude≈ô√≠kov√° was a sympathizer of communist ideas and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia later used her legacy as its propaganda tool. Her life story was featured in the film And Give My Love to the Swallows by the Czech director Jaromil Jire≈°.  Biography  Kude≈ô√≠kov√° was born to a Catholic family in Vnorovy, Moravian Slovakia. Her father, Josef Kude≈ô√≠k, was a member of the Czechoslovak Legions in Russia. During the difficult period of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia he actively participated in anti-German activities in south-eastern Moravia. At that time, his oldest daughter Marie began attending gymnasium in Str√°≈ænice. There she befriended Julius Kramariƒç, a young supporter of communist ideas who came to the school from the Slovakia. Under his influence, she found an interest in Marxist ideas, which caused a conflict in her religious family. She later commented: \\"Julek (meant Julius) laid the theoretical foundation of my whole future work.\\" They both graduated in 1940, at the time when Germans decided to close Czech universities. Kude≈ô√≠kov√° went to study in a language school in Brno and Kramariƒç left Vnorovy. The pair broke up shortly before that, which Kude≈ô√≠kov√° later mentioned with pain in her letters from prison. The language school was moved from Brno to Veversk√° B√≠t√Ω≈°ka, and at that time Kude≈ô√≠kov√° joined the Youth Union, an organization closely connected to the banned Central Committee of the Communist Party. She helped to organize the production of banned publications and posters. She once even attempted to burn down a local factory warehouse. Later she focused her activities on carrying out sabotage with a group of young people from surrounding towns and villages. In mid-1941, during a wave of arrests, she found a shelter in the village of La≈æ√°nky. In autumn of the same year she left for Brno, where she continued her activities in the Youth Union. Kude≈ô√≠kov√° was arrested by the Gestapo on 5 December 1941 in Brno. The interrogations took place in Brno and Prague and the trial was held on 16 November 1942 in Wroc≈Çaw (then Breslau). Both her parents attended the trial. She was sentenced to death by beheading. After that she spent more than 100 days in prison waiting for the execution. During her imprisonment, she worked as a painter of children's toys and began writing the recollections of her life in the form of letters. She managed to secretly sent her letters out of the prison with the help of a friend and a prison guard. Kude≈ô√≠kov√° was executed on 26 March 1943, two days after her 22nd birthday. In her last letter, written the same day, she wrote: \\"Farewell to you, I greet, I love. Do not weep, I'm not crying. Without wailing, without a tremor of fear, without pain I leave, I come to what should be the goal, not the means.\\" The brutal method of her execution (beheading by axe) shocked Czech society, although it was illegal to talk about the circumstances of her case. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia and the subsequent establishment of the communist regime, her life story and heroism became a suitable theme for the political and ideological education of young generations living under the communist regime. Kude≈ô√≠kov√° appeared as an important historical personality in the textbooks of Czechoslovak schools. Following the fall of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, the legacy of Maru≈°ka Kude≈ô√≠kov√° was questioned in a documentary made by Czech Television. Among other things, the documentarythe documentary is titled Pam√°tky na mƒõ... M√Ωtus a pravda o Maru≈°ce Kude≈ô√≠kov√© (Memories of Me... The Myth and Truth of Maru≈°ka Kude≈ô√≠kov√°) notes that a poorly organized resistance action arranged by Kude≈ô√≠kov√° and her collaborators led to the imprisonment of many innocent persons in German concentration camps.

The Montana Natural Heritage Program has identified a number of monocot species as Species of Concern.Species of Concern are native taxa that are at- risk due to declining population trends, threats to their habitats, restricted distribution, and/or other factors. Designation as a Montana Species of Concern or Potential Species of Concern is based on the Montana Status Rank, and is not a statutory or regulatory classification. Rather, these designations provide information that helps resource managers make proactive decisions regarding species conservation and data collection priorities. See the latest Species of Concern Reports for more detailed explanations and assessment criteria. Monocotyledons are one of two major groups of flowering plants (or angiosperms) that are traditionally recognized, the other being dicotyledons, or dicots. Monocot seedlings typically have one cotyledon (seed- leaf), in contrast to the two cotyledons typical of dicots. Monocots have been recognized at various taxonomic ranks, and under various names (see below). The APG II system recognises a clade called \\"monocots\\" but does not assign it to a taxonomic rank. There are between 50,000 and 60,000 species within this group; according to IUCN there are 59,300 species. The largest family in this group (and in the flowering plants as a whole) by number of species are the orchids (family Orchidaceae), with more than 20,000 species.Peter H. Raven; Ray Franklin Evert; & Susan E. Eichhorn. (2005) Biology of Plants, 7th ed., page 459 In agriculture the majority of the biomass produced comes from monocots. The true grasses, family Poaceae (Gramineae), are the most economically important family in this group. These include all the true grains (rice, wheat, maize, etc.), the pasture grasses, sugar cane, and the bamboos. True grasses have evolved to become highly specialised for wind pollination. Grasses produce much smaller flowers, which are gathered in highly visible plumes (inflorescences). Other economically important monocot families are the palm family (Arecaceae), banana family (Musaceae), ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and the onion family Alliaceae, which includes such ubiquitously used vegetables as onions and garlic.

Background  When the Dutch police arrested a 16-year-old in December 2010 for personally creating a substantial botnet and independently conducting a DDoS attack on websites such as Mastercard.com and Visa.com, a subset of those present and involved at the time decided to move towards more long-term-viable goals such as promoting dialogue and spreading the reach of the WikiLeaks cables. The name is a pun on the \\"Leekspin\\" joke animation.  Structure  As with all actions by Anonymous, it has arisen in an ad hoc fashion and holds neither a centralized leadership nor an enforceable command structure.http://forums.whyweprotest.net/splashpage.html Forums.whyweprotest.net Due to the decentralized nature of the project, several independent websites are participating in the effort. It is not clear how much co-ordination, if any, exists between these sites. A list follows: * Cable Wiki: Meant to serve as a wiki for the translation of cables to multiple languages, together with additional analysis of the cables * Sinde Gate: local group providing translations and explanations of cables related to the scandal \\"Wikileaks cables reveal that the US wrote Spain's proposed copyright law\\". \\"Sinde Gate\\" is named after the name of the responsible Spanish minister. * Operation Leakspin Quality Control: a forum for quality control on the translation/analysis of the cables. * Operation Leakspin Blog: a blog informing about the operation Leakspin. * Operation AnonPress: An operation dedicated to pushing the US Embassy Cables further into the public domain.  Goals  Official Operation Leakspin propaganda Leakspin represents a sharp departure from the tactics of Operation Payback. Rather than attacking perceived enemies of the pro-WikiLeaks movement, the sole focus is on propagating material determined to be of public interest. This potentially could lead to media outlets and the general public focusing on the issues uncovered by the released diplomatic cables rather than the morality or sensibility of DDoS attacks as a form of protest or Julian Assange's current legal travails. It is not clear if Operation Leakspin participants and organizers are working towards a massive global protest movement, such as Anonymous's Project Chanology. Several WikiLeaks-themed demonstrations have occurred globally, but appear to be isolated movements.Heraldsun.com.au It is difficult to ascertain how much support Operation Leakspin has garnered in the Anonymous community.  Legal questions  Although WikiLeaks and Julian Assange are potentially being targeted for criminal investigations in the United States in connection with releasing classified documents, there is no real possibility that Leakspin participants could be at legal risk in the USA due to the protections inherent in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Although arrests have taken place in connection with other pro- WikiLeaks actions,http://www.eip-news.com/2010/12/hackers-shut-down-dutch- public-prosecution-website-after-arrest/EIP-news.com there have so far been no reports of any Leakspin websites or activists being investigated.

He was succeeded by his son Frederick VI, Margrave of Baden-Durlach.  Life  Frederick V was the son of Margrave George Frederick of Baden-Durlach and his wife Juliana Ursula of Salm- Neufville. He was educated in Sulzburg by, among others, superintendent J. Weininger. In the years 1613 and 1614, Frederick V made his Grand Tour to France, Great Britain and the Netherlands. In 1622, the Aulic Council decided to award the margraviate of Baden-Baden to Edward Fortunatus. Disappointed, Margrave George Frederick abdicated on 22 April 1622, in favour of his son, Frederick V. Frederick ruled Baden Durlach until his death in 1659. After Baden-Durlach lost the Battle of Wimpfen, the country was devastated by the troops of Tilly. Durlach and other unprotected towns were burned down or looted and pillaged repeatedly. Frederick V did not receive his imperial investiture until 1627, and then only under severe conditions. The people suffered unspeakably during this period. In 1648, the plague broke out in Durlach and further decimated the population. The Protestant Frederick V was deposed by Emperor Ferdinand II during the Thirty Years' War. Ferdinand II enfeoffed Baden-Durlach to the Catholic Margrave of Baden-Baden instead. Frederick then retired from politics until the end of the war. Frederick V married Duchess Barbara of W√ºrttemberg on 21 December 1616. His wife died on 8 May 1627 after nine years of marriage at the age of 33 years. Without observing the obligatory year of mourning, Frederick married Eleonore of Solms-Laubach on 8 October 1627. His second wife died on 6 July 1633. After a very brief period of mourning, he married his third wife, Mary Elizabeth on 21 January 1634; she died on 19 February 1643. On 13 February 1644, Frederick V married Anna Maria of Geroldseck, the widow of Count Frederick of Solms- Laubach. Anna Maria died on 25 May 1649 and the following year, on 20 May 1650, Frederick married his fifth and final wife, Elizabeth Eusebia of F√ºrstenberg. Frederick V of Baden-Durlach - engraving by Jacob van der Heyden, 1636 In 1632 Prince Louis I of Anhalt-K√∂then made Frederick V a member of his Fruitbearing Society. The Society gave Frederick the nickname der Verwandte (\\"the Kinsman\\") and the motto the grape and as his emblem the common grape hyacinth (Hyacinthus botryoides L.). In the Society Book in K√∂then, Frederick can be found as entry number 207. To evade the Edict of Restitution, Frederick V joined King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden and he renewed his alliance with Sweden and France in 1635 after the Battle of N√∂rdlingen. Consequently, Frederick V was excluded from the amnesty granted by the Diet in 1640. At the peace negotiations in M√ºnster that led to the Peace of Westphalia, Frederick was represented by his councillor, Amtmann John George of Merckelbach from Badenweiler. Baden-Durlach was returned to Frederick V, but not Upper Baden. He returned to Durlach in 1650 and devoted himself to his studies. In 1654, he promulgated a new civil code, which his father had created in 1622. Frederick V died on 8 September 1659 at the age of 65 years at the Karlsburg Castle in Durlach.  Marriages and issue  Frederick V. of Baden Frederick V married on the 21 December 1616 with Barbara of W√ºrttemberg (born: 4 December 1593; died: 8 May 1627), the daughter of the Duke Frederick I of W√ºrttemberg.

The campaign was centred on the cities of Hu·∫ø (Th·ª´a Thi√™n-Hu·∫ø Province) and Da Nang (Qu·∫£ng Nam Province), with secondary fronts in the provinces of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i. The campaign began on March 5 and concluded on April 2, 1975. During the spring season of 1975, the PAVN High Command in Hanoi made the decision to seize the major South Vietnamese cities of Hu·∫ø and Da Nang, and also destroy the various South Vietnamese units in I Corps Tactical Zone, led by ARVN General Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng. Originally, the campaign was planned to take place over two phases; during the seasons of spring-summer and autumn. However, as the North Vietnamese forces rolled over South Vietnamese defences on the outskirts of Hu·∫ø and Da Nang, President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu ordered General Tr∆∞·ªüng to abandon all territories under his control, and pull his forces back to the coastal areas of I Corps. The South Vietnamese withdrawal quickly turned into a rout, as the PAVN 2nd Army Corps picked off one South Vietnamese unit after another, until Hu·∫ø and Da Nang were completely surrounded. By March 29, 1975, PAVN troops had full control of Hu·∫ø and Da Nang, while South Vietnam lost all territories and most of the units belonging to I Corps. The fall of Hu·∫ø and Da Nang did not spell the end of the misery suffered by the ARVN. On March 31, ARVN General Ph·∫°m VƒÉn Ph√∫‚Äîcommander of II Corps Tactical Zone‚Äîattempted to form a new defensive line from Qui Nh∆°n to cover the retreat of the ARVN 22nd Infantry Division, but they too were destroyed by the PAVN. By April 2, South Vietnam had lost control of the northern provinces, as well as two army corps. Background North Vietnam During the Hu·∫ø‚ÄìDa Nang Campaign of 1975, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong (VC) forces were organised into three formations; the PAVN 2nd Corps, Tri Thien Military Zone, and Military Region 5 Command. The 2nd Corps fielded three infantry divisions (304th, 324B and 325C Divisions), the 673rd Air- Defence Division, the 164th Artillery Brigade, the 203rd Armoured Regiment, the 219th Combat Engineers Brigade, and the 463rd Communications Regiment. The 2nd Corps was led by Major-General Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu An, with Major-General Le Linh as Political Commissar. Colonel Hoang Dan was the deputy commander, and Colonel Nguyen Cong Trang was the deputy political commissar.Hong & Thang (2006), p. 13 Led by Brigadier-General L√™ T·ª± ƒê·ªìng, the Tri Thien Military Zone had three infantry regiments (4th, 46th and 271st Regiments), and two battalions (the 21st Independent Battalion and the 6th Local Force Battalion). Military Region 5 had one infantry division (2nd Division), which was supported by the 141st Regiment (from the 3rd Division), the 52nd Independent Brigade, two artillery regiments (368th and 572nd Artillery Regiments), two local battalions (70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions), and two local regiments (94th and 96th Local Force Regiments). North Vietnamese and Viet Cong units of Military Region 5 were placed under the responsibility of Major- General Chu Huy M√¢n, with Vo Chi Cong as political commissar.Tan (1989), p.139 Objectives Tri Thien On February 21, 1975, PAVN field commanders from Tri-Thien Military Zone and the 2nd Army Corps held a conference to establish their objectives, which were planned to occur in two phases; the spring-summer phase that would begin in March and probably conclude in May, and the autumn phase to last from July to August 1975. The PAVN objective was to take control of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, isolate the city of Hu·∫ø and, if the opportunity presented itself, capture the entire Tri Thien-Hu·∫ø area.Thach & Khang (2008), p. 228 To isolate Hu·∫ø, the PAVN 2nd Army Corps would move against their target from the north-west direction along Route 12 down to the south-west along Highway 14, thereby isolating the region from South Vietnamese forces in II Corps Tactical Zone.Hong & Thang (2006), pp. 26‚Äì27 In preparation for the Hu·∫ø‚ÄìDa Nang Campaign, the PAVN 2nd Army Corps had successfully captured several important base areas that surrounded South Vietnamese units in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province and Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province. Those areas included ƒê√¥ng H√†‚Äì√Åi T·ª≠ to the north, Khe Sanh-Ba Long to the west, and A L∆∞·ªõi- Nam Dong in southern Hu·∫ø. The main body of the 304th Division and the 3rd Regiment, 324th Division, had assembled in Nong Son and Th∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ª©c to attack Da Nang from the west. In Military Region 5, the 2nd Division had established its positions in Ti√™n Ph∆∞·ªõc, Tra My and Tr√† B·ªìng in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province, and ƒê·∫Øk T√¥ and T√¢n C·∫£nh in Kon Tum Province.Hong & Thang (2006), p. 25 Qu·∫£ng Tin-Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Once Hu·∫ø had been isolated, Military Region 5 Command would initiate the Tin-Ngai Campaign from the provinces of Qu·∫£ng Tin and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, to isolate Da Nang from the Central Highlands.Thach & Khang (2008), p. 315 PAVN units such as the 2nd Division, the 141st Regiment, the 52nd Brigade, along with two artillery regiments (368th and 572nd Artillery Regiments) would coordinate their efforts with the VC 94th and 96th Local Force Regiments, and the 70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions. As part of their overall objective, they would tie down the ARVN 2nd Division, the 11th Armoured Squadron and the 912th Regional Force Company in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province, and, if the opportunity arose, they would also capture B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province and the city of Qui Nh∆°n.Thach & Khang (2008), pp. 316‚Äì319 Da Nang In the final phase of their operation, the PAVN and VC would cut off Da Nang from the surrounding regions which made up I Corps Tactical Zone, and prevent reinforcements from retaking the city. Then, depending on the situation, the PAVN would organize an attack to capture the major South Vietnamese army, navy and air force installations in the city.Thach & Khang (2008), p. 311 South Vietnam South Vietnamese military forces in Hu·∫ø and Da Nang belonged to the ARVN I Corps Tactical Zone. Commanded by Lieutenant General Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng, the South Vietnamese I Corps was considered to be the strongest amongst all the military formations of South Vietnam.Cu, Dao & Quang (2003), p. 535 It had three infantry divisions (1st, 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions), the Airborne Division (led by Major General Le Quang Luong), the Marine Division (led by Major General Bui The Lan) and the 11th, 12th, 14th and 15th Ranger Groups. The Airborne and Marine Divisions each had an assigned strength of four brigades. In addition to the infantry units, there were also the 5th Armoured Brigade, five squadrons of armored vehicles (4th, 7th, 11th, 17th and 20th Armored Squadrons), 13 armored companies, and 21 artillery battalions. Local defense in I Corps was provided by 50 battalions and five companies of Regional and Popular Forces, and six companies of military police. Support for ground forces in the area came in the form of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) 1st Air Force Division (commanded by Brigadier-General Nguyen Van Khanh), with two Republic of Vietnam Navy squadrons operating on the coast and another two along the rivers. Overall, I Corps fielded about 134,000 soldiers; 84,000 were regular soldiers and 50,000 belonged to the Regional and Popular Forces. Those forces were equipped with 449 tanks and armored vehicles, 418 artillery pieces, 64 M42 Duster light air-defense weapons, 373 aircraft of different types, and 165 naval vessels of different sizes. Defensive strategy In combination with the ‚ÄòLy Thuong Kiet Military Plan‚Äô and experiences gained during the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive, Lieutenant General Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng organised the defenses of I Corps into three phases, to be staged from three different areas.Hao (1980), pp. 180‚Äì181 Defensive phases The first phase, known as the ‚Äòorange phase‚Äô, was considered to be the most important because it provided South Vietnamese units in I Corps with a platform to stop enemy attacks, and even attack them if necessary. To accomplish the objectives of the ‚Äòorange phase‚Äô, General Tr∆∞·ªüng placed several elite combat units such as the Ranger groups and armoured forces on constant combat alert. The second phase, known as the ‚Äògreen phase‚Äô, was designed to delay enemy forces and buy more time for the South Vietnamese to regroup in order to stage a counter-attack, in the scenario that enemy forces managed to overcome the ‚Äòorange phase‚Äô. In the final phase, or the ‚Äòblue phases‚Äô, require South Vietnamese units to secure their areas of defence, then destroy and push enemy forces out of I Corps. Areas of defence General Tr∆∞·ªüng's areas of defence were centred on Tri Thien-Hu·∫ø, Da Nang, and Qu·∫£ng Nam-Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i. Tri Thien-Hu·∫ø The task of holding Tri Thien and Hu·∫ø was entrusted to the 1st Division, the 4th and 15th Ranger Groups, the 913th and 914th Regional Forces Companies, the 17th and 20th Armoured Squadrons, 10 artillery battalions, one squadron of helicopters, two squadrons of reconnaissance aircraft, and one coastal patrol squadron. Those forces were commanded by Lieutenant-General L√¢m Quang Thi. Nam-Da Nang Da Nang was under the direct responsibility of Lieutenant-General Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng. It was home of the 3rd Division, the 4th and 7th Armoured Squadrons, the 11th and 14th Ranger Groups, the 911th Regional Force Company, the 1st Air Force Division, one coastal patrol squadron and two riverine squadrons. Qu·∫£ng Tin-Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Qu·∫£ng Tin and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i was held by the 2nd Division, the 12th Ranger Group, the 11th Armoured Squadron, three artillery battalions, the 912th Regional Force Company, one coastal patrol squadron and one riverine squadron. Brigadier-General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Nh·ª±t commanded the 3rd Infantry Division, and all other units in Qu·∫£ng Nam and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i. Prelude On March 5, 1975, the PAVN 2nd Army Corps officially commenced its campaign against South Vietnamese forces of I Corps. The opening shots of the campaign was marked by an attack on South Vietnamese military convoys on the Hai Van Pass and the destruction of An Lo Bridge on Highway 1, located north of Hu·∫ø. Positions held by the ARVN 913th Regional Force at Dong Ong Do and Hill 368 also came under attack, as Phu Bai Airbase was subjected to intense artillery bombardment. While the South Vietnamese were busy dealing with those attacks, General Nguyen Huu An secretly redeployed the 325th Division and the 9th Regiment of the 304th Division, from Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã towards Hu·∫ø in the south. The 46th and 271st Regiments then moved into positions previously held by the 325th Division and 9th Regiment. In order to fool South Vietnamese intelligence agencies, the North Vietnamese moved tank and artillery units to Cua Viet, Thanh Hoi and Ai Tu to cover their main thrust.Thach & Khang (2008), pp. 291‚Äì292 Movement of North Vietnamese units in I Corps Tactical Zone Between March 6 and 7, the VC 4th Local Force Battalion assaulted and overran Mai Linh and 11 other surrounding military sub-sectors in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. On the following day, General L√¢m requested reinforcements from General Tr∆∞·ªüng in Da Nang, as a response to PAVN attacks in his area of control. Meanwhile, the PAVN 2nd Army Corps continued their onslaught, with the 324th Division launching attacks on South Vietnamese positions on N√∫i Bong () and N√∫i M√¥ Tau () and on Hills 75, 76, 224 (), 273 () and 303 all located near Ph√∫ L·ªôc, south of Hu·∫ø and north of the Hai Van Pass.Duc & Linh (2004), p. 77 By March 10, the 1st Battalion, 54th Infantry Regiment, 1st Division was destroyed on Hills 224 and 273; the ARVN 47th Armoured Squadron was overrun by the PAVN 1st Regiment, 324th Division, on Mount Nghe; and the ARVN 113th Regional Force Battalion conceded Pho Lai to the PAVN 4th Regiment, which was supported by the 223rd Artillery Regiment. General Thi then ordered the 15th Ranger Group and the 2nd Battalion, 54th Infantry Regiment, with support from the 27th and 37th Tank Squadrons, to mount a counter-attack on Hill 224. Over the period of one week, both sides fired over 8,000 rounds of artillery shells on Hill 224, and the RVNAF conducted over 60 bombing sorties in an attempt to halt the advances of the PAVN 2nd Corps.Duc & Linh (2004), p. 78 On March 13, amidst heavy fighting in the northern provinces, General Tr∆∞·ªüng flew to Saigon for a meeting with President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu. In this meeting, President Thi·ªáu outlined his decision to abandon most of the provinces in I Corps, and ordered General Tr∆∞·ªüng to withdraw his forces towards the coastal regions of central Vietnam instead. In addition, the Airborne Division would be redeployed to the Mekong Delta region, where it could protect the nation's capital. Unwilling to concede the northern provinces to the enemy, General Tr∆∞·ªüng tried unsuccessfully to convince President Thi·ªáu to reverse his decision in the belief that he could hold onto I Corps, and recapture lost territories by using the Airborne and Marine Corps Divisions.Kiet (2003), p. 155 After he returned to his headquarters that afternoon, General Tr∆∞·ªüng decided to redeploy his forces instead of carrying out President Thi·ªáu's order straightaway, for several reasons. Firstly, he wanted to convince the President that most South Vietnamese units were still intact and that they still had the time to recapture lost territories, and secondly, General Tr∆∞·ªüng did not want to create confusion amongst his subordinates, when the military situation in I Corps was still under control.Kiet (2003), p. 156 Thus, General Tr∆∞·ªüng reorganised his defences in order to deal with the threat posed by PAVN formations located south of I Corps; he designated Da Nang to be the main centre of South Vietnamese defence in I Corps, with Tri Thien in the north, and with Qu·∫£ng Nam and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i in the south. To make up for the loss of the Airborne Division, General Tr∆∞·ªüng ordered the 369th Marine Brigade to replace the 3rd Airborne Brigade in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province, and the 258th Marine Brigade to take over from the 2nd Airborne Brigade on Mount Phu Gia, located north of Hai Van.Thach & Khang (2008), p. 298 Meanwhile, between March 13 and 15, the PAVN 6th Regiment launched several attacks on Chuc Meo, La Son, Hill 300 and Hill 511 located west of Hu·∫ø, forcing elements of the ARVN 1st Infantry Division to pull back towards Dong Tranh and Binh Dien. On March 17, the PAVN High Command predicted that South Vietnamese units could withdraw into the cities of Hu·∫ø and Da Nang, so the following orders were issued to PAVN field commanders: General L√™ T·ª± ƒê·ªìng's forces were to capture Phu Bai Air Base to prevent aerial transportation, and cut off a section of Highway 1 north of Hu·∫ø, and General Nguyen Huu An's 2nd Army Corps must secure Highway 1 south of the city, with the aim of isolating both Hu·∫ø and Da Nang from the rest of the country. On the following day, General Dong's forces staged their attacks from two main directions, from Thanh Hoi and Tich Tuong-Nhu Le, moving along Route 68 and National Highway 1 respectively. The 2nd Corps, on the other hand, assaulted South Vietnamese positions in Phu Loc and Phu Gia. By 8:30 pm on the evening of March 18, most of northern Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã was under North Vietnamese control. ARVN Colonel Do Ky, also the provincial chief of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, tried to lead what was left of his troops back to Hu·∫ø but was pursued by the North Vietnamese along National Highway 1 until they reached An Lo. As the fighting in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã unfolded, General Tr∆∞·ªüng flew back from Saigon where he tried to obtain approval from President Thi·ªáu for his new defensive plan, and hastily reorganised South Vietnamese defences in the northern regions of I Corps.Hong & Thang (2006), pp. 68‚Äì70 Subsequently, General Tr∆∞·ªüng sent out the following orders: the 480th Marine Brigade to leave Da Nang and to guard the north-western flank of Hu·∫ø; the 1st Infantry Division, the 15th Ranger Group and the 7th Tank Squadron to protect south-western Hu·∫ø; and the 258th Marine Brigade and the 914th Regional Force Battalion were to secure a section of Highway 1 which connected Hu·∫ø with Da Nang.Thach & Khang (2008), p. 300 Battle Fall of Hu·∫ø While General Tr∆∞·ªüng was still busy reorganising South Vietnamese units in I Corps, on March 20 the Tri Thien Command finalised their plan to capture Hu·∫ø, with the objective of preventing South Vietnamese forces from regrouping there. At 2:30 pm on the same day, President Thi·ªáu phoned the ARVN I Corps Headquarters and ordered General Tr∆∞·ªüng to defend only Da Nang due to the lack of resources.Hao (1980), 187 Beginning at 5:40 am on March 21, the PAVN 325th and 324th Divisions attacked South Vietnamese units positioned astride Highway 1. At the same time, elements of the K5 Special Forces Battalion destroyed Thua Luu Bridge, which connected a stretch of road on Highway 1 between Hu·∫ø and Da Nang, forcing thousands of South Vietnamese civilian and military vehicles heading towards Da Nang to turn back. The ARVN 20th Tank Squadron was then sent out to reopen Highway 1, but was defeated by the PAVN 203rd Armoured Regiment.Thach & Khang (2008), p. 304 In light of the worsening military situation on the evening of March 22, General Tr∆∞·ªüng authorised General Thi to pull his forces back to Da Nang. However, as the main roads were blocked by the PAVN, General Thi's only option was to use a coastal corridor between Thu·∫≠n An and Tu Hien, and board transport vessels belonging to the 106th Navy Squadron and head back to Da Nang. On the morning of March 23, the PAVN 324th Division advanced through Hill-303 and N√∫i M√¥ Tau, and assaulted northern Phu Loc, while the PAVN 325th Division captured Mui Ne, Phuoc Tuong, and encircled Tu Hien located south of Hu·∫ø. In the north, the VC 4th, 46th and 271st Regiments pursued a retreating South Vietnamese formation consisted of the 147th Marine Brigade, the 14th Ranger Group, 5th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division and the 17th Armoured Squadron, heading towards Thu·∫≠n An. At 4.30 pm on March 23, the PAVN 101st Regiment, 325th Division overran Luong Dien and surrounded Phu Bai Air Base, to close the main corridor leading into Hu·∫ø from the south. Simultaneously, the VC 46th Regiment destroyed South Vietnamese defences on Bo River, captured the districts of Quang Dien, Quang Loi and H∆∞∆°ng Can and secured the main roads on the outskirts of northern Hu·∫ø.Hong & Thang (2006), pp. 52‚Äì53 People's Army of Vietnam soldiers entering the old Imperial City, Hu·∫ø, in 1975 Between March 24 and 25, the PAVN 3rd and 101st Regiments continued their drive towards Hu·∫ø, after they successfully captured Phu Bai Air Base. At the same time, the 1st Regiment, 324th Division along with the VC 4th and 271st Regiments were able to destroy the last elements of the 147th Marine Brigade and the 15th Ranger Group, before they could board navy vessels anchored off the shores of H∆∞∆°ng Thuy, Luong Thien and Ke Sung and Cu Lai.Thach & Khang (2008) p. 309 By the evening of March 25, the PAVN had secured all major points surrounding Hu·∫ø, and South Vietnamese units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, the PAVN claimed to have captured large numbers of South Vietnamese prisoners and military hardware. In all, a total of 58,722 South Vietnamese soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 South Vietnamese government officials and employees, who reported to the PAVN authorities. The South Vietnamese military in Hu·∫ø also surrendered vast quantities of weaponry, which included 140 tanks and armoured vehicles.Thach & Khang (2008), p.310 Tin-Ngai Campaign Beginning at 4:30 am on March 10, PAVN and VC forces proceeded to capture the following targets: the PAVN 38th Regiment overran the highpoints of Nui Vu, Nui Ngoc, Duong Con, Soui Da and Nui Vy; the 36th Regiment destroyed South Vietnamese strong points at Trung Lien, Mount Da, Mount Khong ten, Ho Bach and Hill-215; the VC ‚ÄòBa Gia‚Äô Regiment held their positions on Hill-269 and Hill-310, to stop South Vietnamese counter-attacks from Tuan Duong; while the 52nd Independent Brigade captured Go Han, Phuoc Tien, Duong Ong Luu, Duong Hu·∫ø, Nui My, Hon Nhon, Deo Lieu, and Mount ƒê·∫•t ƒê·ªè. Thus, 23 positions held by units of the ARVN 12th Ranger Groups were captured after four hours of fighting.Chon & Tan (1990), 154 At 9:00 am on March 10, PAVN soldiers of the 368th Artillery Regiment dragged 12 pieces of artillery which included 85mm, 105mm and 122mm guns onto the top of Nui Vu and Han Thon, and aimed their guns directly on Hill 211 and the administrative centre of Tien Phuoc, to support the 31st Regiment attacking those areas. At 1:30 pm, following two failed counter-attacks, South Vietnamese units in Phuoc Lam deserted from the battlefield. In the meantime, however, South Vietnamese troops in Tien Phuoc held their ground with support from two A-37 bombers, after South Vietnamese commanders on the ground had called for reinforcement from Chu Lai. By 4:00 pm, Tien Phuoc was captured by the PAVN 2nd Division. Due to the loss of Tien Phuoc and Phouc Lam, the ARVN 916th Regional Force Battalion retreated from the area. Thus, Tam K·ª≥, the capital of Qu·∫£ng Tin Province, was threatened to be overrun by the PAVN. On March 11, General Tr∆∞·ªüng ordered General Nh·ª±t to mobilise the 2nd Division, the 12th Ranger Group, elements of the 11th Armoured Squadron and one regional force battalion to mount a counter-attack from Tuan Duong to Cam Khe and Duong Con. General Tr∆∞·ªüng also ordered the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division to depart from Da Nang, and protect Tam K·ª≥, so that General Nh·ª±t's forces could be freed up to fight the PAVN.Thach & Khang (2008), pp. 313‚Äì315 However, between March 14 and 15, the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment was forced to turn back from Tam K·ª≥ to deal with an attack on Thang Binh, by the VC 70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions. In southern Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, the VC 94th Local Force Regiment attacked Binh Son, cut off a section of Highway 1 near Chau O, and the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division was pinned down trying to deal with VC attacks. Thus, South Vietnamese attempts to stage an effective counter-attack were quickly blunted by the combined PAVN/VC forces in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province. Recognising that he no longer had the manpower to mount a counter-attack, General Nh·ª±t ordered his troops to abandon Tra Bong and Son Ha, and concentrate his units in Tam K·ª≥ and Chu Lai instead.Thach & Khang (2008), pp. 316‚Äì317 Following the failed counter-attack, South Vietnamese forces in I Corps were further weakened when President Thi·ªáu pulled the Airborne Division back to Saigon. Now that the South Vietnamese 2nd Infantry Division and the 12th Ranger Group was overstretched between Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i and H·ªôi An, with Tam K·ª≥ only defended by the ARVN 5th Infantry Regiment and one battalion from the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment, PAVN General Chu Huy M√¢n decided to utilise the advantage to capture Tam K·ª≥. Beginning at 5:30 am on March 21, the PAVN 2nd Division attacked Suoi Da, the last South Vietnamese outpost outside Tam K·ª≥.Thach & Khang (2008), pp. 319‚Äì320 At around 12:00 noon, ARVN General Nh·ª±t ordered the rest of the 4th Infantry Regiment out from Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i in an attempt to hold Tam K·ª≥, so South Vietnamese defences in that province was further weakened. Again, taking advantage of the situation, General M√¢n ordered the 52nd Independent Brigade and the 94th Local Force Regiment to attack Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i. By 7:00 am on March 24, the cities of Tam K·ª≥ and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i were simultaneously attacked by PAVN/VC forces. In Tam K·ª≥, the ARVN 4th and 5th Infantry Regiments were destroyed after two hours of heavy fighting, while the 37th and 39th Ranger Battalions (from the ARVN 12th Ranger Group) in the outskirts of the city simply fled from the battlefield. At 10:00 am on March 24, PAVN and VC soldiers of the 2nd Division, the ‚ÄòBa Gia‚Äô Regiment, and the 31st Regiment successfully captured Tam K·ª≥. In Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, the PAVN 52nd Independent Brigade, with support from two special forces battalions as well as tanks and armoured vehicles from the 574th Regiment, rolled over South Vietnamese defences. At around 2:00 pm, the surviving elements of the ARVN 6th Infantry Regiment, the rest of the 12th Ranger Group and the 4th Tank Squadron was ambushed by the VC 94th Local Force Regiment along Highway 1 when they tried to retreat towards Chu Lai without a fight. As a result, over 600 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed, and around 3,500 others were captured. At 11:30 pm on March 24, the PAVN was in full control of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i City.Chon & Tan (1990), p. 161 O On March 25, 1975, the Tin-Ngai Campaign concluded with PAVN/VC forces in full control of Qu·∫£ng Tin and Qu·∫£ng Ngai Provinces, leaving Da Nang as the only major city in I Corps still held by the South Vietnamese. As such, out of the 44 provinces in South Vietnam, 10 were occupied by the PAVN, and three ARVN infantry divisions were rendered ineffective. In addition, the elite ARVN 147th Marines Brigade ceased to exist as a fighting force.Alan Dawson (1990), p. 35 Fall of Da Nang South Vietnamese dispositions By 1975, Da Nang had been become the second largest city in South Vietnam, with close to a million inhabitants. It was a major economic and political centre in I Corps, and was home to the largest military installations which incorporated the South Vietnamese army, navy and air force. Logistically, the military infrastructure within the city could hold thousands of tons of weaponry, ammunition, food supplies and other essential war materials. It also had four large seaports, and major airports at Da Nang and Nuoc Man.Hao (1980), pp. 191‚Äì192 So, on March 25, following the loss of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, Th·ª´a Thi√™n, Qu·∫£ng Nam and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, President Thi·ªáu ordered South Vietnamese commanders at all levels to hold what was left of I Corps until the very end.Hao (1980), p. 193 On March 26, General Tr∆∞·ªüng gathered what was left of his units, about 75,000 soldiers, and organised them into the following order: *Outer Defensive Line: The 258th Marines Brigade and the 914th Regional Force Battalion to hold all areas between Phuoc Tuong and Lien Chieu. The 369th Marines Brigade and the 57th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division were to protect Dai Loc and Dong Lam. The surviving elements of the 147th Marines Brigade and the Marine Division Headquarters would hold Nuoc Man airfield. Meanwhile, the remnants of the 3rd Infantry Division would hold Vinh Dien and Ninh Que, while the 15th Ranger Group held Ba Ren.Thach & Khang (2008), pp. 324‚Äì325 *Inner Defensive Line: The 912th Regional Force Battalion, and the last elements of the 11th and 20th Armoured Squadrons held Phuoc Tuong-Hoa My. The last three battalions of the 1st Infantry Division, the 2nd Infantry Division, the 12th Ranger Group, and about 3,000 freshly trained soldiers from the Hoa Cam Training Camp were ordered to defend all key areas between Hoa Cam and Nuoc Man. All independent Regional and Popular Force battalions were placed in reserve, and could go into combat when required. General Tr∆∞·ªüng also had 12 artillery battalions at his disposal, as well as the 1st Air Force Division based at Da Nang and Nuoc Man, which were still intact despite the early clashes in I Corps. North Vietnamese plan of attack Following the conclusion of the Tri Thien and Tin-Ngai Campaigns, the PAVN High Command ordered General L√™ Tr·ªçng T·∫•n to journey south from Hanoi and personally take charge of the Da Nang Campaign. Subsequently, on March 25, the North Vietnamese came up with a plan to attack Da Nang from four directions: *North: The 325th Division (without the 95th Regiment), with support from one tank battalion and one artillery battalion, were ordered to advance along Highway 1 and capture the ARVN 1st Brigade Headquarters, the South Vietnamese 1st Air Force Division at Da Nang, and then move on to the Son Tra Peninsula to capture the main seaport there. *North-West: The 9th Regiment, 304th Division, with support from one tank battalion, one artillery battalion and one anti-aircraft gun battalion, were ordered to advance along Highway 14B, and capture the ARVN 3rd Infantry Division Headquarters at Phuoc Tuong, and then move on to Da Nang Air Base. *South & South-East: The 2nd Division, with support from one artillery unit (the 36th Artillery Regiment), one artillery battalion, one tank-armoured vehicles battalion, one anti- aircraft gun battalion, and one anti-tank weapons company, were ordered to take Da Nang Air Base and the ARVN 1st Brigade Headquarters, then capture the city itself. The 3rd and 68th Regiments were placed in reserve. *South-West: The 2nd Corps (without the 9th Regiment, 304th Division) was ordered to take all positions held by the 369th Marine Brigade along the defensive line at Thuong Duc-Ai Nghia-Hiep Duc, then advance toward Nuoc Man airfield. The 24th Regiment, 304th Division was required to capture Hoa Cam and then move on to Da Nang.Thach & Khang (2008), pp. 329‚Äì331 The fight begins Before the North Vietnamese finalised their plan to capture Da Nang, the 2nd Corps had already begun making preparations for the final attack on the city. On March 24, the PAVN 325th Division fought with the 258th Marine Brigade and the 914th Regional Force Battalion at north Hai Van, and overran Phuoc Tuong, Nuoc Ngot, Tho Son and Thua Luu. Consequently, PAVN forces captured enemy artillery positions in Phuoc Tuong, and made good use of it during the following weeks. On March 27, with air-support from A-37 attack aircraft from Da Nang, the 258th Marine Brigade and the 914th Regional Force Battalion tried to hold off PAVN forces at Phu Gia and Hai Van, but they were pushed back and sustained heavy casualties in the process. The PAVN 325th Division then continued their advance through So Hai, Loan Ly, An Bao and LƒÉng C√¥. Soon afterwards, more than 30 artillery pieces belonging to the PAVN 84th and 164th Artillery Regiments were placed at various high points in Son Thach, Son Khanh and Mui Trau; beginning at 5:30am on March 28, PAVN artillery units bombarded South Vietnamese positions around Da Nang.Thach & Khang (2008), p.339 Meanwhile, the 369th Marine Brigade quickly abandoned their position at Son Ga, after they had detected elements of the PAVN 304th Division conducting reconnaissance missions on the battlefield. On March 28, the PAVN 66th Regiment, 304th Division attacked and captured the administrative area of Ai Nghia and Nuoc Man airfield, while the PAVN 24th Regiment attacked Hoa Cam and Toa in the outskirts of Da Nang.Toan & Dinh (1990), p. 214 The H·∫£i V√¢n Pass The 369th Marine Brigade then tried to pull back towards An Dong and My Khe, but they were pursued by the PAVN 2nd Division. Meanwhile, the 3,000 South Vietnamese soldiers at Hoa Cam mutinied against their commanding officers, and surrendered to the PAVN.Hoa (1980), p. 195 South of Da Nang, the PAVN 2nd Division, with support from tank and artillery units was able to overrun Ba Ren at around 9:00 am on March 28. In response, General Tr∆∞·ªüng ordered Air Force Brigadier-General Nguyen Van Khanh to send a squadron of four A-37 bombers to destroy the main bridges at Ba Ren and Cau Lau, but they could not prevent the PAVN 2nd Division from crossing the river using canoes, and other small river craft. At 5:55 am on March 29, the outer South Vietnamese defence line located south of Da Nang succumbed to the PAVN.Hong & Thang (2006), p. 151 At 6:30 am on the same day, the last South Vietnamese strongholds in and around Hai Van were overrun by the PAVN. The PAVN 325th Division then secured Lien Chieu, the Nam O Bridge and the Trinh Me The Bridge, thereby clearing the main road for the supporting tank and armored units to advance on Son Tra. As PAVN troops were closing in, General Tr∆∞·ªüng and other high-ranking South Vietnamese officers were airlifted out to the coastal areas, where they boarded the navy transport ship HQ-404. At 12:00 pm, the ARVN 1st Brigade Headquarters was finally captured. At 12:30 pm, the 9th Regiment, 304th Division also captured the ARVN 3rd Infantry Division Headquarters, and quickly established their control over the entire Phuoc Tuong area.Thach & Khang (2008), pp. 343‚Äì344 Vietnamese civilians fleeing from Da Nang in March 1975 By the time Da Nang fell into North Vietnamese hands, South Vietnamese commanders on the ground simply lost control of their men as military discipline collapsed. On March 28, about 6,000 soldiers of the 2nd Infantry Division deserted, and left the battlefield. And then the soldiers of the ARVN 3rd Infantry Division also retreated, thereby leaving the rear of the Marine Division exposed to enemy attacks.Kiet (2003), p.161 Since March 25, from the CIA Station in Da Nang, Al Francis and the U.S. Embassy in Saigon began formulating an evacuation plan, in order to evacuate U.S. citizens and South Vietnamese government officials out from Da Nang. As part of the plan, aircraft belonging to civilian airliners were to be used. And in addition to the South Vietnamese navy vessels of I Corps, U.S. General Homer D. Smith also provided five barges, six passenger liners, and three cargo ships to help with the evacuation process.Snepp (2001), pp. 162‚Äì164 Even though the evacuation plan was designed to be carried out in an orderly manner, chaos and confusion quickly descended on the civilian and military population of Da Nang as people fought each other to board the vessels anchored off the coast. On the afternoon of March 29, North Vietnamese soldiers of the 2nd, 304th, 324th and 325th Divisions, as well as the 203rd Armoured Regiment, entered the city of Da Nang.Thach & Khang (2008), p. 345 Aftermath Casualties The struggle for Hu·∫ø and Da Nang had cost South Vietnam its entire army corps. According to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam's official history, apart from the 16,000 soldiers and civilians who managed to escape, over 120,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed, wounded or captured after the fall of Hu·∫ø and Da Nang. In abandoning I Corps, the South Vietnamese military left behind vast quantities of U.S.-supplied military hardware. The North Vietnamese claimed to have captured 129 aircraft of different models, 179 tanks and armored vehicles, 327 artillery pieces, 184 transport vehicles and 47 naval craft. More than 10,000 tons of bombs, ammunition, grenades, food supplies, combat rations, and other materials were also captured.Hao (1980), p. 198 Total PAVN/VC casualties are unknown. Loss of northern provinces of South Vietnam President Thi·ªáu's decision to abandon the Central Highlands and the coastal regions of I Corps had a severe negative impact on ARVN morale, especially as the northern provinces of South Vietnam were driven into chaos. On March 31, after the fall of Hu·∫ø and Da Nang, ARVN General Ph·∫°m VƒÉn Ph√∫, commander of II Corps Tactical Zone, held a meeting with his General Staff and the provincial chiefs of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh, Kh√°nh H√≤a, Ph√∫ Y√™n, Ninh Thu·∫≠n and B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n and requested them to form a defensive line from Qui Nh∆°n into the Mekong Delta to cover the retreat of the ARVN from the Central Highlands.Hao (1980), p. 199 Subsequently, General Phu issued the following orders: Rear Admiral Hoang Co Minh was to oversee military operations in the Qui Nh∆°n region, Brigadier-General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn C·∫©m to hold Ph√∫ Y√™n, Brigadier-General Nguyen Ngoc Oanh and Brigadier-General Nguyen Van Luong was tasked with holding Nha Trang. Meanwhile, General Phan Dinh Niem, the commander of the ARVN 22nd Infantry Division, was required to form a defensive line linking Qui Nh∆°n with Di√™u Tr√¨ and Deo Ca, with the purpose of delaying the PAVN.Hao (1980), p. 200 The withdrawal plan formulated by General Ph·∫°m VƒÉn Ph√∫ and his General Staff was made with the belief that the PAVN would stop and consolidate their territorial gains before they could go on the attack again. However, North Vietnamese commanders were more than willing to maneuver their units away from newly captured territories, in order to pursue retreating South Vietnamese units. Furthermore, South Vietnamese commanders never realized that Hanoi had given its field commanders the full flexibility to respond to the changing circumstances on the battlefield and had supplied the PAVN with weaponry that was required to achieve their objectives.Dawson (1990), p. 54 Ultimately, the average South Vietnamese soldiers would have to pay for the miscalculation of their commanders. At 5:15 am on March 31, the 47th Infantry Regiment, 22nd Infantry Division was ambushed by the 2nd Regiment, 3rd Division while it was withdrawing towards Phu An-Lai Nghi. Upon their arrival at Phu Cat, the remnants of the ARVN 47th Infantry Regiment was encircled and assaulted by the PAVN 198th Regiment, and ceased to exist as a fighting unit by 12:30 pm.Hao (1980), p. 201 The 41st Infantry Regiment, 22nd Infantry Division also came under attack from the PAVN 95th Regiment as it moved from Nui Mot to Phu Phong. Throughout the evening of March 31, the 41st Infantry Regiment fought with the PAVN 141st Regiment, as soon as they reached Phat Giao. In contrast to the other units, the 42nd Infantry Regiment, 22nd Infantry Division was able to escape the PAVN onslaught, but their strength was significantly reduced before they reached Dieu Tri.Hao (1980), p. 202 On April 1, Quy Nhon fell to the PAVN, which was followed by Tuy H√≤a on April 2. ARVN General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn C·∫©m was captured in Tuy H√≤a after his helicopter had landed on the ground, where he tried to survey the battlefield. The destruction of the ARVN 22nd Infantry Division, which had about 10,000 fully equipped men, caused chaos in Nha Trang; more than 3,000 South Vietnamese recruits from the Lam Son Army Training Centre retreated into the city, and another 1,000 soldiers went on a rampage and looted goods on the main streets. The chief of Kh√°nh H√≤a Province, Colonel Ly Ba Pham, boarded a military aircraft and flew out to Phan Rang Air Base after he had notified Saigon that \\"the situation is irreversible\\". On the afternoon of April 2, Nha Trang was overrun by the PAVN, and not a single battle was fought in its defence. By 2:00 pm on April 2, ARVN General Ph·∫°m VƒÉn Ph√∫ had lost every military unit and territory under his control.Hao (1980), p.203 Decisions of President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu According to many academics, both in Vietnam and in the West, the major factor which contributed to the rapid collapse of South Vietnamese defences in 1975 was the numerous and contradictory orders issued by President Thi·ªáu.Dreyfrus (2004), p. 62 During the various phases of the South Vietnamese retreat from the northern provinces, namely in I and II Corps Tactical Zones, Thi·ªáu had at least three different plans and decisions laid out before him, and all lacked consistency or simply contradicted one another.Snepp (2001), p. 147 For example, on March 13, Thi·ªáu ordered General Tr∆∞·ªüng to abandon I Corps, and return the elite Airborne Division to the Mekong Delta region of III Corps. Soon afterwards, similar orders were issued to Major-General Ph·∫°m VƒÉn Ph√∫ to evacuate from the Central Highlands. On March 17, with intervention from General Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n, Thi·ªáu contradicted his previous orders when he approved Tr∆∞·ªüng's defensive plan to hold the major cities of Hu·∫ø and Da Nang.Hao (1980), p.187 However, the very next day, Thi·ªáu ordered Tr∆∞·ªüng and General Thi to abandon Hu·∫ø and to concentrate only sufficient numbers of South Vietnamese units to hold Da Nang. On March 29, as Tr∆∞·ªüng was about to board the navy transport ship HQ-404, he received a phone call from Thi·ªáu, who ordered him to turn back and retake Da Nang from the North Vietnamese forces. By then, however, South Vietnamese units in I Corps had virtually disappeared, and their commanding officers had fled from their posts.Kiet (2003), p. 163 Tr∆∞·ªüng refused to carry out Thi·ªáu's orders. Between April 3 and 4, Thi·ªáu reprimanded General Ph√∫ and General Thi for the debacles in II and I Corps respectively, and Generals Ph·∫°m Qu·ªëc Thu·∫ßn and D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng for the fall of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long in 1974. Even though Thi·ªáu used the defeat of the South Vietnamese forces as a justification for the arrest of those generals, his real intention behind the arrests was to avert an imaginary military coup against him. For that reason, he chose to pull the Airborne Division back to III Corps, which was commanded by loyalist officers, instead of the Marine Corps Division.Kolko (2003), p. 428 General Tr∆∞·ªüng and General L√™ Nguy√™n Khang were spared, but both men responded strongly to Thi·ªáu's reaction. Tr∆∞·ªüng considered the aforementioned generals to be victims of an injustice, as they were far more competent than Thi·ªáu's loyalists in Saigon. In addition to the military disasters suffered on the battlefield, Thi·ªáu also caused instability within his own government during the final days of South Vietnam's existence.Kolko (2003), p. 429 For example, on April 2, Thi·ªáu requested the country's National Assembly to dissolve Prime Minister Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m's cabinet and to replace him with Nguy·ªÖn B√° C·∫©n. The National Assembly quickly approved Thi·ªáu's request. The same day, Thi·ªáu ordered the arrest of seven individuals who had worked for Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ for fear they were plotting to overthrow him. William Colby, the CIA Chief of Station in Saigon, wrote in a report that the balance of power had leaned in Hanoi's favour. Thus, if South Vietnam were to survive the North Vietnamese onslaught, Thi·ªáu's replacement would have to accept a resolution to the conflict on North Vietnamese terms.Snepp (2001), p. 148 References Sources *Alan Dawson.

The project was formally authorized by United States Congress in 1938. It offered training and employment in WPA training centers giving demonstrations of housework. The WPA designed it to promote the employment of women certified as qualified for private household employment and to promote the techniques of household service. Accomplishments The project trained 30,000 women. Middle-aged women were preferred due to the perceived unreliability and increased risk of marriage of younger women. The project employed 1,700 women to give two- and three-month courses in cooking and serving food, house and child care, washing, ironing, and marketing. Other skills taught included table setting, home management, budgeting and knitting. The Program In Washington, during the course of their training, trainees were paid $46 a month. After passing written and oral exams, diplomas were awarded to graduates. After completing training, a graduate could make $60 a month as a domestic. Locations Demonstration sites were located at 400 South Capitol Street in Washington, DC, and at 217 E Boone Ave in Spokane, Washington.

He ruled as margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach from 1603 to 1625, succeeding his cousin George Frederick and succeeded by his son Frederick III.  Life   Youth  minster in Heilsbronn Joachim Ernst was the son of the elector John George of Brandenburg and his third wife, Elisabeth of Anhalt-Zerbst. He took over in 1603, the government of the Margraviate of Brandenburg-Ansbach, after the old line of Franconian Hohenzollerns died out with the death of George Fredrick the Elder of the Ansbach-J√§gerndorf branch. Joachim Ernst founded the younger branch of Ansbach line of the Franconian Hohenzollerns.  Succession rules  Charter of association of the Protestant Union in Auhausen on 14 May 1608 (now in the Bavarian State Archives): the signature of Margrave Joachim Ernst of Brandenburg is in the center His predecessor, George Frederick had settled the succession of his two Franconian possessions (Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Kulmbach) in the House Treaty of Gera of 1598. In accordance with the provisions of this treaty, Margrave Joachim Ernst ruled Brandenburg- Ansbach and his brother Christian ruled neighboring Brandenburg-Kulmbach (Christian later moved his capital to Bayreuth, thereby changing its name to Brandenburg-Bayreuth).  Protestant Union  In the religious conflicts of the early 17th Century, Joachim Ernst tended to be in the Protestant-Calvinist camp and he also supported the Dutch struggle for independence. He took an active part in bringing about the Protestant Alliance of the Protestant Union, which was founded in 1608 on his territory, in the secularized monastery at Auhausen, near N√∂rdlingen. The Union was, however, dissolved again in 1621, after the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, in view of the military superiority of the imperial camp. After the dissolution of the Union, Joachim Ernst was held responsible for the outbreak of war by his Catholic opponents and he then completely distanced himself from his former allies.  Marriage and issue  In 1612, he married Sophie of Solms-Laubach (1594‚Äì1651). They had five children: * Sophie (1614‚Äì1646) : married in 1641 Margrave Erdmann August of Brandenburg-Bayreuth (1615‚Äì1651) * Frederick III (1616‚Äì1634), Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach * Albert (1617) * Albert II (1620‚Äì1667), Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach : married firstly in 1642 Princess Henriette Louise of W√ºrttemberg-M√∂mpelgard (1623‚Äì1650) : married secondly in 1651 Countess Sophia Margaret of Oettingen-Oettingen (1634‚Äì1664) : married thirdly in 1665 Princess Christine of Baden-Durlach (1645‚Äì1705) * Christian (1623‚Äì1633)  Ancestors   References  * Gerhard Taddey: Lexikon der deutschen Geschichte, Stuttgart, 1998, * M.

It is based in Seyssinet- Pariset near Grenoble in France. It was founded in 2009 by its current CEO Jean-Ren√© Bouvier. Buzzinbees's products are currently active in more than 135 countries worldwide. In December 2015, Gemalto acquired Buzzinbees for an undisclosed amount. Olivier Piou stated that the acquisition was motivated by Buzzinbees activation solution, especially for machine to machine. History Buzzinbees was created by Hewlett-Packard senior executives in October 2009. A strategic licensing agreement with the IT giant allows Buzzinbees to continue to develop and enhance products that have been deployed for more than 20 years by HP (it is acknowledged that HP started to provide telecommunication operators and equipment providers with carrier grade signaling as soon as 1988). HP has become one of Buzzinbees's customers, buying signaling platforms as well as other products to embed them into its telecommunication solutions. In February 2010, Buzzinbees announced its collaboration with PT on a messaging server: Bee-IRON. The Bee-IRON platform is a flagship product from Buzzinbees which can deliver and route 2,500 SMS per second in a single node. It complements PT's MicroTCA server. In May 2010, Buzzinbees focused its attention on automatic SIM activation, targeting fast growing markets such as African, Asian and Latin American operators. This effort became visible at the 2012 next generation telecom summit in Nairobi. Buzzinbees's name was inspired by the highly social communicating bees. Indeed, bees do communicate in order to recruit other worker bees to forage in the same area they found flowers. The Buzzinbees logo ‚Äî pictured left ‚Äî \\"sports a hexagonal cell\\" reminiscent of \\"honeycombs but also cellular networks\\" as well as 3 pairs of bee \\"antennas\\". In November 2015, Buzzinbees's CEO created another company, Facts Haven SAS with a new logo. Following the Gemalto acquisition, his LinkedIn profile indicates that he no longer works for Buzzinbees. However, the Buzzinbees company still exists as a legal entity. Products Buzzinbees's portfolio encompasses network nodes built atop a comprehensive suite of signaling products providing complete development platforms based on global telecommunication standards and protocols. These products work indeed with SS7 (signaling system #7), IMS (IP multimedia subsystem) and LTE (long term evolution) protocols. They augment networks with intelligent functions (intelligent network). Buzzinbees's distribution channel is very specific: it sells to independent software vendors and equipment providers, as opposed to selling directly to operators. Since 2011, Buzzinbees openly focused on automatic SIM activation and the nascent machine to machine market, pushing their Bee-SOON (SIM on-off node) product. Following the Gemalto acquisition, it introduced the concept of SIM reactivation whereby operators can let users reuse expired SIM cards instead of purchasing new ones when they wish to re- subscribe to that operator.

Buckingham A Pictorial History. Phillimore & Co, 1994, page xviii It had a history of the tower and spire collapsing several times and in 1776 it collapsed for the final time.

Barracuda Books, 1984, page 112 A new site became available on Castle Hill and the decision was taken to move the church.Act of Parliament \\"An Act for building a new Church within the Town and Parish of Buckingham\\", 1777 The foundation stone for the new church was laid by Robert Bartlett, bailiff of Buckingham, on 25 November 1777 at a grand ceremony, including the singing of a hymn specially composed for the occasion followed by the roasting of an ox with beer and bread supplied by Earl Temple. On 6 December 1780, the church was consecrated by Thomas Thurlow, Bishop of Lincoln following a detailed petition letter sent to the Bishop which described the reasons for the new church. The petition read as follows: ‚ÄúThat the Tower of the ancient fabric of the Parish Church of Buckingham having fallen down destroyed the Great parts of the Church, and that the inhabitants were unable to rebuild the same, that in consideration of such inability, the Right Hon Richard Earl Temple generously under took by Virtue of an act of Parliament to build a new Church... that the said Church is now completely finished for the celebration of divine worship, by the Right Hon George Earl Temple, Heir to the said Richard Earl Temple. That the ground on which the said Church is erected, together with commodious passages thereto and an area surrounding the same has been freely given and legally conveyed for the use of the said Parish by the Right Hon Ralph Earl Verney of the Kingdom of Ireland.\\"Whyte, Warren. The History and Architecture of the Parish Church of St Peter & St Paul Buckingham, 2008  Architecture  The Church design originally had just two elements: the tower with octagonal plan spire, and the nave with a sanctuary formed within this main volume and was quite a simple Georgian building. The current Victorian Gothic Revival church seen today is the result of many 19th century alterations by George Gilbert Scott including the significant structural repairs and new buttresses and internal alterations started in 1860, a chancel added in 1865 and a porch in 1867. The new chancel was funded by a ¬£358 donation from the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. The additions were consecrated by Bishop Wilberforce in 1867,Elliott, Douglas. \\"Buckingham The Loyal and Ancient Borough\\".

Life The son of Johann Kusser, a Protestant cantor in Bratislava, Johann Sigismund and his parents moved to Stuttgart in 1674 because of religious persecution. Two years later he went to spend six years in Paris and the Palace of Versailles. There he met the French court composer Jean-Baptiste Lully and learned from him how to compose in the French style. Kusser was then employed at the princely courts in Baden-Baden and Ansbach, before taking a trip to Germany in October 1683. In 1690 he became the first Kapellmeister of the new opera house in Braunschweig. In the following years he married Hedwig Melusine von Damm, daughter of a local Ratsherr. Their daughter Auguste Elisabeth married the Braunschweig chronicler Philipp Julius Rehtmeyer. During his time there, Kusser wrote eight operas, enriching the Italian-influenced repertoire. Disagreements in 1694 with the librettist and court poet Friedrich Christian Bressand led Kusser to move to the Oper am G√§nsemarkt in Hamburg. He then left Hamburg at the end of 1695 and, after spells working in Nuremberg and Augsburg, took a post at the court of Eberhard Louis, Duke of W√ºrttemberg in 1699, being made Hofkapellmeister there the following year. At the end of 1704 he moved to London as a composer and private music teacher. In 1707 he went to Dublin and in 1711 was made Chapel-Master of Trinity College, Dublin. He was then appointed \\"Chief Composer\\" and \\"Master of the Musick, attending His Majesty's State in Ireland\\" in 1716, dying in Dublin in 1727. His tasks included the composition of annual birthday odes for the English king and other festive occasions; his Dublin serenatas were staged like semi-operas. Kusser's works are now rarely played, but he influenced the following generation of composers, such as Reinhard Keiser, Johann Mattheson, Georg Philipp Telemann, Christoph Graupner, Georg Caspar Sch√ºrmann and George Frideric Handel.

At the turn of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C., Parnavaz, the king of Iberia, married a woman from a Vainakh tribe in order to get support from the Highlanders.209 They fought alongside the Georgian kings for centuries. Vainakhs loved Queen Tamar and named their daughters, bridges and other constructions after her. In this way, high-level interaction and fusion among Vainakhs, Georgians and other many highlander tribes existed in history.210 In the process of Vainakhs‚Äô settlement in Georgia, they were assimilated into Georgian society. In fact, there are tribes who insist that their origins are based on Chechnya and Ingushetia among Tushs, Khevsurs, Pshavs and Georgians in Kakheti and Mtskheta-Mtianeti.

Map of Caucasus 1676, Dzurdzukia located north-east ¬´Zuirie¬ª. According to the Georgian royal annals: Durdzuk was mentioned by the Chronicles as \\"the most distinguished among the descendants of Kavkas\\", who led his people, the Durdzuks, into the mountains, where they would become the ancestors of today's Vainakh peoples.Anchabadze, George. http://eprints.iliauni.edu.ge/1855/1/The_Vainakhs..pdf \\"The Vainakhs.\\" (2009). The mighty state of Durdzuketi has been known since the 4th century BC. The name Durdzuk traces back to the ancient city north of Lake Urmia, not far from Nakhichevan / Nakhchivan. Durdzuks and Nakhchmateans were remnants of the Urartians. In the Armenian Chronicles, the Durdzuks defeated Scythians and became a significant power in the area in the region in the first millennium BC. Durdzuks allied themselves with Georgia, and helped the first Georgian king Pharnavaz I of Iberia consolidate his reign against his unruly vassals. The alliance with Georgia was cemented when King Pharnavaz married a Durdzuk girl. Later on, the Durdzuks are mentioned fighting the Mongols alongside their Georgian allies as well as the Osses.Howorth, Henry Hoyle. History of the Mongols, from the 9th to the 19th century. No. 85. Burt Franklin, 1888. Page 11. Durdzuk soldiers are mentioned fighting alongside Georgians against the troops of Jalal-ad-Din of Khwarezm. Queen Tamar of Georgia was highly esteemed, and the Durdzuks named daughters as well as bridges and other buildings after her. The \\"Gate of Durdzuks\\" mentioned in Georgian sources is thought to have been in the Assa gorge of Ingushetia, which is a path connecting the North and South Caucasus regions. The Durdzuks were known as the Dourts in the Geography of Armenia.

Construction  The bridge was built in 1959 by constructor Dowsett to carry two diameter water pipes across the Tees. The bridge arch, weighing 200 tonnes was assembled on the Durham bank from prefabricated parts and rolled out across the river on a temporary Bailey bridge, then moved sideways onto its pre-prepared concrete abutments.  Operation  A third pipe was added in 1979 and there is strictly no public access across the bridge. The bridge is best accessed on foot from the Jubilee Bridge along the river bank.

The \\"Royal Road\\" to the Unconscious. Dreams embody the involuntary occurrences within the mind throughout various stages of sleep. Throughout the early part of the twentieth century, psychologist Sigmund Freud made incredible advances in the study and analysis of dreams. Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams (1900) used an evolutionary biological perspective to infer that these nightly visions are a product of one's individual psyche. As the \\"royal road to the unconscious\\", dreams allow for accessibility to parts of the mind that are inaccessible through conscious thought. According to his psychoanalytic theory, dreams‚Äîlike most psychological experiences‚Äîcan be understood through two distinct levels: manifest and latent. Modern research continuously proves that dreams contain fundamentally meaningful information. Therefore, appropriate interpretations of these two layers can facilitate assistance in understanding, ‚Äúwhether, when, and how unconscious processes are truly relevant to daily life‚Äù (Friedman & Schustack, 2012). Definitions Manifest content The manifest content can be interpreted as the information that the conscious individual remembers experiencing. It consists of all the elements of actual images, thoughts, and content within the dream that the individual is cognitively aware of upon awakening. Illustrated through iceberg imagery, the manifest content would be identified as the ‚Äútip‚Äù: it is barely exposed above the surface with an enormous portion still hidden underneath. As the hallmark of psychoanalytic theory suggested, what is observed on the surface is only a partial representation of the vastness that lies beneath (Friedman & Schustack, 2012). Although images may initially appear bizarre and nonsensical, individual analysis of the dream can reveal its underlying meaning. Latent content Related to yet distinctly separate from manifest content, the latent content of the dream illustrates the hidden meaning of one's unconscious thoughts, drives, and desires. The unconscious mind actively suppresses what can be revealed from the latent content in order to protect the individual from primitive feelings that are particularly difficult to cope with. Freud (1900) believed that by uncovering the meaning of one's hidden motivations and deeper ideas, an individual could successfully understand his or her internal struggles through eventually resolving issues that create tension in their lives. In contrast to the information easily recognizable, latent content makes up everything underneath the surface. Illustrated once again through iceberg imagery, the depth of meaning that can be derived from examining this layer can reveal deeper underlying thoughts within an individual's unconscious. Interpreting dreams The technique of free association, actively utilized by Freud in dream interpretation, often begins with a psychoanalyst's analysis of a specific dream symbol followed by the proceeding thought that automatically comes to a client's mind. To further this investigative practice, Freud classified five separate processes that facilitate dream analysis. # Displacement occurs when the desire for one thing or person is symbolized by something or someone else. # Projection happens when the dreamer places their own personal desires and wants onto another person. # Symbolization is illustrated through a dreamer's unconscious allowing of repressed urges and desires to be metaphorically acted out. # Condensation illustrates the process by which the dreamer hides their feelings and/or urges through either contraction or minimizing its representation into a brief dream image or event # Rationalization (also referred to as secondary revision) can be identified as the final stage of dreamwork in which the dreaming mind intently organizes an incoherent dream into something much more comprehensible and logical for the dreamer Modern research on dreams Until recently, most psychoanalytic dream researchers have followed Freud's theoretical approach by interpreting dreams as one's unconscious desires. Currently, most modern day psychologists are concerned with \\"tracing out the metaphoric meanings of dreams rather than investigating what they might be expressing more literally with social and personal experience\\" (Hollan, 2009, p. 313). Trauma researchers especially have focused their efforts on patients' experiences with nightmares, reoccurring memories, and flashbacks as unique manifestations of psychiatric disorders, particularly PTSD. A few previous research studies including Barrett (1996) have delineated a strong pattern of post-traumatic nightmares, in which the dreams follow an extremely close reenactment to a particular event. These updated analytic techniques expand on Freud's theoretical framework and provide a more holistic approach of dream understanding. Latent Semantic Analysis Altszyler et al. (2017) have shown that text mining techniques, such as Latent Semantic Analysis, can be used to extract word associations from dreams reports. These tools allow us to measure word associations in dream reports and to identify the meaning of words in their context. References Sources * Cash, Adam.

Before engaging in any marketing campaign, we should examine the reason why it's needed: to increase your market share, brand awareness, the profitability of the business, either way, the purpose of a digital marketing plan for any organization is to guide you through the process of researching and enunciating the goals of your digital initiatives. In a digital marketing campaign, we should identify a sustainable goal that will help create exposure to company values, build service into a brand for a target market, generate positive actions and huge traffic to the company/website and increase customer loyalty. We should be able to change our vision from the traditional goal, which focuses on meeting business objectives such as brand recognition, profits, etc. to a sustainable goal that concentrates on a benefit for the community as well as the business. We must be able to establish relevance for our targeted audience by designing a campaign that will help your company form a link between your messaging and your audience that will strengthen the effectiveness of your campaign. Is it a good strategy to emphasize audience metrics such as likes, retweets, views per page even though it little to do with product sales?

Drosky is from Riverdale, Georgia where he graduated from Riverdale High School in 1982. Before becoming a coach at his alma mater, Alan Drosky was an All-American distance runner for the Yellow Jackets before graduating in 1987 with a degree in Industrial Management. He later returned to Tech to receive his master's degree in Management in 1989.Wilson, Jane. Blueprint 1987. The Board of Student Publications. 1987. Coach Drosky's immense impact on both the Georgia Tech Cross-Country and Track programs as both a coach and runner have helped to make both programs flourish over the last 30 years. Running career Although Drosky did not begin his running career until his senior year at Riverdale High; it did not take long for him to become a star. In his first year running competitively, he won the state championship in the mile with a time of 4:14 and placed second in the 800m. Drosky initially enrolled at the University of South Carolina, but then transferred to Georgia Tech before his sophomore year. As a transfer student, Drosky redshirted his sophomore year and ran unattached. Going into his junior year and first eligible year at Georgia Tech, Drosky had a personal best of 1:49.47 in the 800m and 3:43.58 in the 1500m, which showed his potential for success at Tech.Zang, F. (1986). 1986 Georgia Tech Track. Toccoa, GA: Currahee Printing Company. During his junior year, Drosky led the Yellow Jackets at NCAA Regionals with a 53rd-place finish in the 10K with a time of 31:51. He also placed 31st in the ACC Championship with a time of 26:27.Zang, F. (1986). 1986 georgia tech track. Toccoa, GA: Currahee Printing Company. He began to truly shine during indoor season, setting the school record in the 1000m (2:23.20) and the distance medley relay running the 800m leg (10:17.80). Drosky also earned All-American honors placing 6th in the indoor mile. He continued his record-breaking year going into the outdoor season breaking four more records in the 1500m (3:43.38), the mile (4:04.70), the 3200m Relay, running with Prouty, Head and Macoy (7:36.40), and distance medley relay with Morrison, Macoy, and Head (9:59.30).Naylor, Larry. The Blueprint 1986. Dallas, Texas: Taylor Publishing Company, 1986. Print. For Drosky and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, 1986-87 seasons proved to be very memorable. During cross- country season, Drosky was named team captain and had a lot of responsibility being the only upperclassmen on the team.Wilson, Jane E. 1987 Blueprint. Board of Student Publications, 1987. 429. As captain, Drosky was the best runner, placing first for team in each race. He also accomplished great individual success, winning the individual state cross-country title and finishing 8th at the ACC Championship, the highest finish by a Tech athlete at the tournament in school history. Track season marked the opening of the new George C. Griffen Track and Field Facility where Drosky finished his running career at Tech in style. He was an ACC Champion in the indoor mile, All-ACC in the outdoor 1500m by second, and was an All-American in the 1500m at the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship with a school record of 4:04.7.Wilson, Jane E. 1987 Blueprint.

Coaching career Alan Drosky began his coaching career as a graduate assistant from 1987 to 1989 while he took classes to get a master's degree in Management. He became a full-time assistant coach in 1990 and then took over as the head coach of the men's and women's cross-country teams in 1992. As the head cross-country coach, Drosky coached three NCAA All-Americans, Kevin Graham (1994), Beth Mallory (1995), and Renee Metivier who finished second in 2001. He also coached eight NCAA qualifiers.Georgia Tech Sports Information Department. \\"Alan Drosky.\\" Official Home of Georgia Tech Athletics. Available from http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/sports/m-xc/mtt/drosky_alan00.html. Internet. Retrieved 1 October 2010. Drosky hit the pinnacle of success as a cross- country coach in 1994 and 2001. In 1994 the men's and women's cross-country teams both placed third in the ACC, the highest placing the team had ever reached. In 2001 the women won the NCAA Regional South division, qualifying them for Nationals for the second consecutive year. The men placed a very respectable fourth. The success of both of his teams propelled Drosky to be named the South Region Coach of the Year by the U.S. Track Coaches Association in 2001. In 1996, he took over as head coach of the Women's Track and Field team and also began working with the men's distance team. His success as the women's head coach is marked by Georgia Tech's Atlantic Coast Conference Indoor Track title in 2002, the first ACC Championship Georgia Tech has won in track. Coach Drosky has also coached many extremely successful distance runners. From 1994 to 1998, Drosky coached David Krummenacker who won back-to- back NCAA Men's Indoor Track and Field Championships in the 800m. Krummenacker was also a 12 time individual ACC Champion, an 8 time All-American, and broke many school records including both the indoor and outdoor 800m and 1500m. David Krummenacker also won the U.S. National Championship in 2001 under Coach Drosky's guidance. Krummenacker later went on to win two more U.S. National Titles and won the 800m IAAF World Indoor Championship in 2003. Drosky also coached Brandon Mahoney who was an All-American and ACC individual champion. Considered one of the most outstanding distance runners in Tech's history, Mahoney placed 7th in the mile at the 2002 NCAA Indoor Championships, 8th in the 800m at the 2002 NCAA Outdoor Championships, and also got on the podium for the 1500m at the Outdoor NCAA Championships to receive a total of three All-American honors. In 2004, Mahoney won individual ACC titles in the indoor 800m and mile as well as the outdoor 800m and 1500m. For these impressive performances, Mahoney was named ACC Performer of the Year for both the indoor and outdoor seasons. Coach Drosky remains at the head men's and women's cross- country coach and the women's head track coach to this day. Personal life Alan Drosky is married to Kim Drosky, a former runner at Georgia State University. Together they have two daughters, Hannah and Hayley.

Biography  Juravinski was born in Saskatchewan, and his childhood was spent in the difficult years of the Great Depression. In 1942, the family relocated to Hamilton, Ontario motivated by job opportunities arising from wartime industry. From the mid-to-late 1950s, Juravinski worked in the construction industry, and in 1958 along with his brother-in-law founded Wilchar Construction Limited based in Dundas, Ontario. In 1971, the company closed and Juravinski opted to launch a racetrack in nearby Dundas, Ontario, with shareholder John Grant. Flamboro Downs opened on April 9, 1975 and proved very successful. He managed the racetrack until 2003 when he sold it to Magna Entertainment. Following his retirement, he and his wife Margaret made considerable endowments to the City of Hamilton and McMaster University, permitting the establishment of a new state-of-the-art cancer care facility at the former Henderson Hospital, now renamed Juravinski Hospital.

The Argoza River cuts through this historic-artistic complex, an example of the medieval, rural Cantabrian villages. Said by the Cantabrian tourist bureaus to be the oldest town in Cantabria, it was declared a historic-artistic site in 1979 because of its state of preservation. With the declaration, funds were made available to repair the access road leading to it to make it easier for tourists to get to making it the end of the road (the road being CA-817, or Cantabria Provincial route 817). The road is in good condition, but the height of the surrounding mountains brings an early onset to dusk and a late dawn. It is known not only for its rustic architecture but also for its rural cuisine, such as, cocido monta√±√©s or game meat. Only residents may drive motor vehicles through the village, so most tour guides and advisers recommend walking through its streets to see its medieval character and look up at the surrounding mountains. It is now one of the most visited towns in the Cantabrian interior. In the town, one can find an ancient Roman Road that has been in continual use for almost two millennia. The houses and buildings are examples of the rural medieval stone mountain construction with wooden balconies and windows. To maximize the heating effect of the sun, most of the buildings face the south. The village contains historic laundries in the public square, bakeries, barns, stables, carpentry shops, gift shops, and restaurants. Local cattle can be heard in their pastures ringing the bells draped from their necks as they graze. The architecture shows early forms of the woodworking that became a distinguishing facet of Cantabrian architecture, the wooden balcony. As well as the balconies, local woodworkers produce cattle yokes, sandals, canes, and cutlery that are distinctive to rural Cantabria. During the 1920s through the 1970s, it was a favorite hunting site for wealthy sportsmen who liked the seclusion and the abundance wild game. It was also a popular spot for the hunting of Iberian bears and wolves before they became endangered. The lack of opportunity for local youth and its remoteness was leading to a population decline heading toward its abandonment until the government's injection of funds to make it a tourist destination in 1979. Many hiking trails lead out of the village up into the mountains. The terrain is quite steep, but verdant with much local fauna passing through.

The film was produced and distributed by Associated First National. Flaming Youth is based on the novel Flaming Youth by Samuel Hopkins Adams. In his retrospective essay \\"Echoes of the Jazz Age,\\" writer F. Scott Fitzgerald cited Flaming Youth as the only film that captured the sexual revolution of the Jazz Age. The film is now considered partially lost.Flaming Youth at TheGreatStars.com; Lost Films Wanted(Wayback Machine) One reel survives and is housed at the Library of Congress.Flaming Youth at silentera.com database American Silent Feature Film Survival Database Flaming Youth Plot When Mona Frentiss dies, she has her confidante \\"Doctor Bobs\\" watch over her family, especially her youngest daughter Patricia. The family has been raised in a most unconventional manner, with Mona having a much younger lover and the father Ralph keeping his own lover on the side. As Patricia grows older, she attracts the attention of her mother's former lover, the much older (than Patricia, who in the book is in her early to mid teens) Cary Scott. Patricia tempts fate with her wild ways, nearly loses her virtue to a musician aboard an ocean-going boat, and is saved in time by Cary. Realizing that he is the man for her, she settles down into an experimental marriage.

The film's marketing played up the racier aspects of the story, and a \\"skinny-dipping\\" sequence shot in silhouette (which still largely survives in the Library of Congress) was used in the films advertising extensively. The ads also boasted \\"neckers, petters, white kisses, red kisses, pleasure mad daughters, [and] sensation craving mothers.\\"Savage, Jon. Teenage: The Creation of Youth Culture. New York: Viking, 2007. p. 205. The book contained adult subjects which were largely glossed over in the film. To counter potential negative backlash, a good deal of humor was injected into the film, so that many audiences thought the film was actually a burlesque of the whole flapper movement when, in fact, it was intended to be a dramatic film.Gebhart, Myrtel. Los Angeles Times (May 18, 1924) Reception Public success The public reaction to the film was enthusiastic, and it firmly fixed in the public's imagination a new kind of female behavior. In his retrospective essay \\"Echoes of the Jazz Age,\\" author F. Scott Fitzgerald cited Flaming Youth as the only motion picture that captured the sexual revolution of the Jazz Age. He lamented that its runaway success prompted \\"Hollywood hacks\\" to create a number of similar but less daring films and to run \\"the theme into its cinematographic grave.\\" He also emphasized the fact that Flaming Youth persuaded certain moralistic Americans that their young girls could be \\"seduced without being ruined.\\" Fitzgerald also praised Colleen Moore's performance in the film, remarking that: \\"I was the spark that lit up Flaming Youth, Colleen Moore was the torch.\\" Critical reviews While Flaming Youth was successful enough to be held over in most American cities, reactions from film critics were mixed. The December 1923-February 1924 issue of The Exhibitor's Trade Review cites a review from the Chicago News which called the movie \\"one of the best-told screen novels that has come along,\\" and another review from the Cincinnati Enquirer in which the critic pointed out that the film wasn't completely faithful to the book. He added that \\"throughout the production, scarcely a single admirable character appears, and the audience is regaled with the antics of a lot of childish adults and adulterated children. Consequently, the members of the cast, though many of them are talented, work against unfair handicaps.\\" A reviewer for the Indiana Star wrote, \\"In spite of an awkward story, Miss Moore contributes much merriment to the occasion and Elliott Dexter and Milton Sills lend the frontier element of the film a certain degree of stability.\\" A critic for the New York Times wrote, \\"Colleen Moore gives a vivid performance of the jazz-devoted novice once she gets her hold of the theme. There are moments in the beginning when her rendition is a little artificial. But after her awkward trip downstairs in exotic pajamas‚Äîwhich are not really graceful‚Äîshe lives the part of a pert young thing, whose hair is cut with a bang on the forehead, whose eyes are full of mischief and whose arms are long and slender.\\" The New York Times critic also described Milton Sills as \\"sympathetic\\" and Myrtle Stedman as \\"charming.\\" Censorship When Flaming Youth debuted in Qu√©bec cinemas in January 1924, Judge Philippe-Auguste Choquette was petitioned by a delegation of Montreal women to ban the motion picture. They asserted the foreign American film was \\"obscene\\" and morally corrosive to young Canadian girls. In response, Judge Choquette ordered all film prints to be seized and all lobby cards to be confiscated. Additionally, theater owners and projectionists who exhibited the film were arrested. Due to these highly-publicized actions, a legal court case ensued over the film. The case regarding the film was transferred to Judge Arthur Lachance of the Court of Sessions. Lachance privately viewed the film and deemed its contents to be \\"immoral.\\" Shortly thereafter, the Canadian board of censors rescinded their previous approval of the film and, thenceforward, Flaming Youth could not be shown at any cinema in Canada \\"without violating the Canadian criminal code.\\" See also *List of incomplete or partially lost films References External links  * Category:1923 films Category:1923 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by John Francis Dillon Category:First National Pictures films Category:Lost American films Category:1923 lost films Category:Lost drama films ","title":"Flaming Youth (film)"},{"id":"29999956","text":"SGHC may refer to: * High Court of Singapore * Sporulenol synthase, an enzyme ","title":"SGHC"},{"id":"29999969","title":"Marathon Oasis de Montreal"},{"id":"29999972","text":"HMS Severn was an of the British Royal Navy, launched in 1813 as one of five heavy frigates built to match the powerful American frigates. The shortage of oak meant that she was built of \\"fir\\" (actually pine), which meant a considerably shortened lifespan. Nonetheless, the ship saw useful service, especially at the bombardment of Algiers in 1816, before being broken up in 1825. Background Severn was ordered as a of 38 guns, and was to have borne the name Tagus. Relative to her prototype, she received two more guns forward. Tagus was renamed Severn on 7 January 1813, i.e., well before her launching. War of 1812 Initially commissioned under the command of Captain Joseph Nourse, Severn served in the North Atlantic. On 18 January 1814 she was escorting a convoy from England to Bermuda when she encountered the French 40-gun frigates Sultane and √âtoile. Severn drew them away from the convoy, saving it. After a long chase, the French frigates gave up and sailed away. Later the same year, on 1 May, she captured the American privateer schooner Yankee Lass, armed with nine guns and carrying a crew of 80 men. She was 20 days out of Rhode Island and had not made any captures. At the time, Severn was in company with . Severn was among the several British warships that shared in the proceeds of the capture on 10 July of the American schooners William, Eliza, Union, and Emmeline, and the capture on 2 July of the schooner Little Tom. In the late summer and autumn of 1814, Severn was an important participant in the War of 1812, as she was stationed in Chesapeake Bay to blockade the Patuxent River. It was from this point that the British launched their invasion of Maryland, which led to the Battle of Bladensburg and then the subsequent burning of Washington D.C. On 2 July Severn and Loire captured two schooners, two gun-boats, and a sloop. They also destroyed a large store of tobacco. On 20 August Severn, the frigate , and the gun-brig sailed up the Patuxent to follow the boats as far as possible. Admiral Alexander Cochrane and his force of marines and seamen entered Washington on the night of 24 August. The British then burnt the White House, the Treasury, and the War Office. They left at 9 o'clock on the evening of the next day and returned to Nottingham, Maryland, on the Patuxent where Cochrane boarded Manly. The campaign cost the Navy one man killed and six wounded, including one man of the Corps of Colonial Marines killed and three wounded. The draught of this class of frigate was too deep to permit Severn and her sister ships from sailing into the harbour at Baltimore. Her sailors had to kedge rafts holding small cannon and rocket launchers seven miles up the river to Fort McHenry. During the attack on Baltimore Admiral Sir George Cockburn raised his flag on Severn. Although the navy contributed seamen and marines to the land attack, and took casualties, Severn did not suffer any losses. Between 1 October 1814 and 25 March 1815, Severn captured thirteen mostly small American merchant vessels, but with several armed vessels among them. These were: * schooner Speedwell, of five men and 34 tons; * brig May Flower, of 8 men 60 tons; * ship Anna Marie, of six men and 120 tons; * ship Betsy; * ship Virginia; * schooner Nonsuch, of five men and 65 tons; * ship Buonaparte; * ship Anna; * schooner Virginia; * schooner Brant; * ship Necessity, of four guns, 12 men, and 309 tons; * schooner Amelia, of 40 tons; * schooner Resolution; and * privateer brig Ino, of nine guns, 130 men, and 250 tons.{{refnOn 20 December Severn also captured the American letter of marque schooner Banyer. She was armed with four guns and carried a crew of 31 men. On 10 January 1815, Cockburn landed on Cumberland Island in an effort to tie up American forces and keep them from joining other American forces to help defend New Orleans, Louisiana, and the Gulf Coast. The naval squadron consisted of (74-guns), Regulus (44 guns; en flute), Brune (56 guns; en flute), Severn, Hebrus (36 guns), Rota (38 guns), Primrose (18 guns), and (both bomb vessels of 8 guns), and the schooners Canso (10 guns) and (12 guns). Five days later a British force first bombarded and then landed near Fort Peter on Point Peter by the town of St. Marys. The British attacked and took the fort without suffering any casualties. They then headed for St. Marys along the St. Mary's River and captured it after skirmishing with a small American force. The British captured two American gunboats and 12 merchantmen, including the East Indiaman Countess of Harcourt, which an American privateer had captured on her way from India to London. The British ended their occupation of St. Marys after about a week and withdrew to Cumberland Island. On 26 February 1815, Severn recaptured the merchantman Adventure, which she sent in to Bermuda. This earned Severn salvage money for the vessel and her cargo. Lastly, on 3 March, Severn destroyed the American privateer Ino (see above). American accounts report that Ino grounded outside of Charleston on 7 March. As her crew was attempting to free Ino, Severn came on the scene and launched her boats to board Ino. Inos crew, unaware that the war had ended on 15 February 1815, fired grapeshot and small arms at the British boats, causing them to shear off. Inos crew then set fire to her and took to their boats and some improvised rafts. A schooner that came out from Charleston rescued almost all. Inos crew believed that Captain Nourse of Severn had known for some days that the war had ended. The delay of payment of the head money may have been due to the need to adjudicate the case. Post-war Severn was fitted at Chatham for foreign service between February and July 1816. In February the Hon. Frederick W. Aylmer assumed command of Severn. He then sailed her to Gibraltar and then took part in the bombardment of Algiers on 27 August. British casualties were heavy, though those of the Algerines were much heavier. Severn herself had three men killed and 34 wounded. As a result of the attack, the Dey agreed to abolish the enslavement of Christians in perpetuity, and to free all slaves whatsoever then in Algiers. The British also destroyed four large frigates, five large corvettes, numerous gunboats, and numerous merchant vessels. King Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies bestowed on Aylmer the cross of a Commander of the Royal Sicilian Order of St. Ferdinand and of Merit. Other captains and officers received similar awards. In May 1818 the participants in the battle were granted an award of ¬£100,000. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Algiers\\" to the 1328 surviving claimants from the battle. Severn initially remained in the Mediterranean, first under Captain James Gordon and then under Captain Robert Spencer. From May 1817 Severn saw service off the Kent and Sussex coasts in the Royal Naval Coast Blockade for the Prevention of Smuggling. under the command of Captain William (\\"Flogging Joey\\") McCulloch, scourge of the smugglers. On 6 August 1817 she seized a boat with foreign spirits and five empty boats. Three weeks later she seized Mary, with four smugglers and a quantity of tea, and also seized two empty boats. On 15 December Severn seized Po, which was carrying a cargo of foreign spirits. On 29 March 1818 Severn seized Linot, which was carrying foreign spirits, and two smugglers. Fate Severn was in ordinary at Portsmouth in 1822, but by 1824 was at Deptford. She was put up for sale in June 1825 at Deptford, and sold to John Small Sedger, Rotherhithe, for ¬£3,610 on 20 July.

This commonly refers to people having \\"physical and economic access\\" to food that meets both their nutritional needs and food preferences.\\"Food Security\\". World Health Organization. 2010.

World Food Programme. 2010. Ethiopia was ranked 104 in the world in Global Hunger Index 2017.  Background  Accounting for 84% of the country's labor force, agriculture in Ethiopia is the largest contributor to economic growth and the economy's most important sector. Especially among the poverty-stricken rural population, the livelihood of most Ethiopians depends on agriculture. Although it is a country with \\"significant agricultural potential because of its water resources, its fertile land areas, and its large labor pool,\\" this potential goes largely undeveloped.\\"Improving Food Security, Livelihood in Ethiopia Though Agricultural Growth. \\" US Fed News Service, Including US State News 1 Oct. 2010, Research Library, ProQuest. Web. 9 Dec. 2010. Ethiopian agriculture is incredibly sensitive to shifts in weather. When rainfall is erratic or insufficient for even a few successive rainy seasons, the entire country is prone to falling into famine. The most highly publicized example of this is 1984, when Ethiopia experienced one of its worst droughts in recent history and hundreds of thousands of people (one million people is the estimate most often cited) died or became destitute due to the famine that ensued.  Current statistics  According to an early 2010 report, 5.2 million people in Ethiopia face a precarious food security situation. The worsening food security situation is attributed primarily to poor rainfall last year during the February‚ÄìMay and June‚ÄìOctober seasons.\\"Ethiopia: Food Assistance Needs Rising for 2010, UN Relief Wing Reports\\". UN News Service. 3 February 2010. http://allafrica.com/stories/201002031062.html A series of successive droughts had already weakened Ethiopia's food situation, with \\"poor and erratic rainfall over the last two years.\\" Global conditions such as the high food and fuel prices that have persisted in the country since 2008 and the global financial crisis have also contributed to Ethiopia's failing food security. Ethiopia is considered a least developed country ranked 171 out of 182 countries in the UNDP Human Development Index for 2009. In the 2010 Global Hunger Index, which ranks developing countries and countries in transition based on proportion of undernourished people, proportion of underweight children under five, and child mortality rate, Ethiopia was given a 29.8, on a scale of 0-100, with 0 being the best and 100 the worst possible score. Ethiopia is one of the countries that made the most absolute progress improving its score between 1990 and 2010; in 1990 it had a score of 43.7, and now it's down to 29.8. However, this score is still highly troubling ‚Äì it's currently ranked 80th out of 84 countries. The level of hunger in Ethiopia can also be measured based on child growth, which is \\"internationally recognized as an important indicator of nutritional status and health in populations.\\" In 2005, 20% of babies had low birth weight (less than 2500g at birth). 53.5% of children under five and 30.6% of pregnant women were anemic. 34.6% of children were considered underweight, which contributes to child mortality, since \\"evidence has shown that the mortality risk of children who are even mildly underweight is increased, and severely underweight children are at even greater risk.\\" 50.7% of children suffered from growth retardation as a result of inadequate diets, and 12.3% were \\"wasting\\", which refers to a condition brought on by severe under-nutrition and causes permanent impairment of the immune system, making them much more susceptible to infectious diseases and death. These high levels of under-nutrition, particularly in children and mothers, have serious implications for Ethiopia's future. High child mortality, impaired immune system, and the results of stunting due to inadequate diet, which include delayed mental development and intellectual capacity and decreased performance in school, have long-term effects, not only for those children but for economic productivity as a whole. Small, undernourished women are also more likely to experience complications in during childbirth, and are more likely to give birth to low birth-weight babies, further \\"contributing to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition\\".\\"Country Profile ‚Äì Ethiopia\\". World Health Organization. 2008. http://apps.who.int/nutrition/landscape/report.aspx?iso=eth  International aid and development projects   United Nations Development Programme  Ending hunger internationally is a major part of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The first goal is to \\"eradicate extreme poverty and hunger\\", and the fourth is to \\"reduce child mortality rate\\", in which preventing malnutrition in mothers and children is integral. In order to fulfill these goals in Ethiopia, in 2007 the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) developed the Food Security and Recovery Project, which is intended to run from January 2007 to December 2011 and to \\"contribute to the achievement of food security in the country including disaster risk management and early recovery capacities.\\" It is designed to promote institutional coordination and community participation in order to achieve disaster risk reduction and food security. By 2011, UNDP hopes to significantly strengthen Ethiopian government capacity to take appropriate action to respond to emergency situations, ensuring the population's survival and recovery. They delivered $725,000, $6,815,000.00 and $4,538,000, in 2007, 2008, and 2009 respectively.\\"Food Security and Recovery\\". UNDP. 2008. http://www.et.undp.org/index.php?option=com_project&id;=15 As part of the Food Security and Recovery Project, UNDP also supports the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX), the country's first formal, organized marketplace. Located in Ethiopia's capital city, Addis Ababa, ECX is intended to give buyers and sellers a place to trade, \\"assured of quality, quantity, payment, and delivery\\", by informing them of commodity prices throughout the country, and guaranteeing payment and delivery on transactions made through the exchange. Since its founding in April 2008, ECX has become fully operational, currently trading coffee, sesame, haricot beans, maize, and wheat.\\"Company Profile\\". Ethiopia Commodity Exchange. 2009. http://www.ecx.com.et/CompanyProfile.aspx With the help of UNDP, they also organized an Africa-wide Knowledge Sharing Forum entitled \\"The Making of a Market: Global Learning from Commodity Exchange Experiences\\" and hosted the first Africa commodity exchange meeting, which included representatives from twelve other African countries.  World Bank  The World Bank also supports development of food security in Ethiopia. In 2010 World Bank approved a plan to devote $150 million to the Ethiopian government ($108.4 million of which as credit and $41.6 million as a grant) \\"to support increased agricultural productivity, enhanced market access for key crop and livestock products, and improved food security\\". The Agricultural Growth Program (AGP) was designed to target high-potential districts and, in an attempt to \\"increase resilience to climate variability and promote jobs and small business development\\", it is supposed to increase the participation of Ethiopians themselves, mostly farmers, women, and children, in defining specifically what support they need to achieve these goals. According to the World Bank, the AGP will support the Ethiopian government in developing food security and sustainability in five ways: *\\"Providing farmers with improved access to knowledge and information, market, finance and other services through support from key public and private institutions, including farmer organizations and public advisory services *Increasing agricultural productivity and household income by scaling up best practices among farmers and rural businesses as well as in public sector institutions *Strengthening value chains to increase the value and volume of sales of key selected agricultural commodities; *Supporting small-scale agricultural water development and management that would strengthen the management of micro-watersheds and thereby increase agricultural production and income, reduce environmental degradation, and mitigate weather-induced risks including those related to climate change; and *Supporting the establishment or upgrading of rural roads and physical markets to improve market access for agricultural produce and, thereby, farmers' income.\\" .  Productive safety net programme  Founded in January 2005, The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) is the second largest social transfer program in Africa (after South Africa). Its goal is to \\"tackle chronic food insecurity and break Ethiopia's dependence on food aid\\".Sabates-Wheeler, Rachel and Stephen Devereaux. \\"Cash Transfers and High Food Prices: Explaining Outcomes on Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme\\". Food Policy. Volume 35, Issue 4, August 2010, Pages 274-285 Traditionally, food insecurity in Ethiopia was primarily addressed by deployments of \\"emergency\\" food aid. However, over the last decade these \\"emergencies\\" have become a chronic, rather than transitory, condition. Every year from 1994 to 2003 emergency food aid was mobilized for more than five million Ethiopians, and despite these yearly efforts, the rural population remained as vulnerable as ever to food insecurity. The PSNP is designed to respond to this problem, aiming to provide \\"predictable transfers to meet predictable needs\\". Supported by international aid, the Ethiopian government gives support to chronically food-insecure households for six months of the year for up to five years, so that these households are able to build up their resilience against shocks like drought or rise in food prices that traditionally cause food emergencies requiring tremendous financial assistance. \\"Although emergency relief would continue to be required in years of severe shocks, if the PSNP is successful then millions of people would be removed from the annual emergency appeal process, and there would be a gradual shift towards a flexible multi-year safety net that expands and contracts according to need\\". PSNP was born in 2005 out of deliberations of the government of Ethiopia, UN organizations such as UN-OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affair), and international NGOs. The PSNP system is rooted in the FSP(Food Security Programme) as an initiative of the World Bank and IMF championed Ethiopian Poverty Reduction strategy with an annual budget of US$107 million.Grosh, Margaret. \\"For Protection and Promotion: The Design and Implementation of Effective Safety Nets\\". World Bank, 2008, p. The PSNP aims to provide a security against abrupt income changes. In addition, it ties relief to development by giving food aid in exchange for labor effort to construct public works. Since the efficiency and standard of outputs on public work have been typically low and maintenance on the infrastructure insufficient, food aid has been given as in incentive to work on them. To its government, this is one way of bridging relief to development.\\"The Food Price Crisis and Its Impact on the Ethiopian Productive Safety Net Programme\\". Humanitarian Exchange Magazine, 2008, p. 42.\\" It includes many building blocks guided towards local development; block grants are made accessible to workdays for activities such as water harvesting, irrigation, feeder roads and household agricultural packages and direct, unconditional payments for elderly, the handicapped, pregnant women. Evaluations by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) show that PSNP is well-targeted towards the most food insecure and poorest households residing in the areas in which the program operates and that the program has improved household food security and expenditures .

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands beside the road between Grantham and Lincoln. History The church dates from the 11th century, with additions and alterations made during each of the following four centuries. Further changes were made in 1845 when the vestry was added, and the chancel and the north wall of the nave were largely rebuilt. The church was declared redundant in February 1974. Architecture Exterior Constructed in limestone and ironstone rubble, the church has ashlar dressings. Its roofs are covered in lead, tiles and slates. The plan consists of a three-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, and a south porch, a two-bay chancel at a lower level with a north vestry, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages separated by string courses, and has a splayed base. At its top is a carved corbel table and a plain parapet. In the lowest stage is a three-light west window. This is decorated with ball flowers, and in the centre of its tracery is a carved head. The middle stage contains a small window with a trefoil head in each side and on each side of the top stage is a two-light bell opening. The north wall of the north aisle contains two two-light windows and buttresses, and in its west wall is a lancet window. The north wall of the clerestory also contains two windows. Its parapet is battlemented, it is decorated with carved shields, there are two gargoyles, and the bases of pinnacles which are no longer present. The east wall of the nave is also battlemented and has a cross finial at the apex of its gable. At the east end of the chancel is another cross finial, and three lancet windows. On the south wall of the chancel are a two-light window and a lancet window, separated by a buttress. In the east and south walls of the south aisles are two-light windows, and the window in the west wall is a lancet. The south wall has three windows, similar to those in the north wall. Inside the south porch are stone benches. Interior Both arcades have two bays. The south arcade is Norman in style and dates from the late 12th century. It is carried on circular piers. The north arcade is from the late 13th century and has octagonal piers. The tower arch dates from the late 12th century, and the chancel arch from the 13th century. In the chancel is a 19th-century piscina and aumbry. The hexagonal pulpit is from the 17th century, over which is a tester. The pews date from the 19th century. Over the tower arch are the Royal arms of George IV. On the walls of the tower are a commandment board from the mid-19th century and a benefactors' board dated 1758. The font is from the 12th century. It is plain and consists of a circular bowl on a round base. In the west window are fragments of 14th-century glass. Commemorated by plaque, electric lighting was first installed by resident Thomas Chambers in memory of his only son, John, who died in the Second World War aged 20.http://www.wildfire3.com/haslemere.html External features The churchyard contains the war grave of a Royal Field Artillery soldier of the First World War.

Life Higgs was born at South Stoke, Oxfordshire, the second son of Griffith Higgs by Sarah, daughter of Robert Paine of Caversham in the same county. After attending Reading school he entered St John's College, Oxford, in 1606, and acquired a reputation both as an orator and disputant. He graduated B.A. on 26 June 1610. In 1611 Higgs was elected probationer fellow of Merton College, and proceeding M.A. on 27 June 1615 (Wood, Fasti, &c.;, i. 362), had two small cures successively bestowed on him by the college. He served the office of senior proctor 1622‚Äì3 (ib. i. 404) 'with great courage, tho' of little stature.' He commenced B.D. on 1 April 1625 (ib. i. 423), and in 1627 went to the Hague as chaplain to Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, in which capacity he remained for twelve years. His preaching was greatly admired by the queen, who made him several presents, as he mentioned in his will. On 12 Feb. 1629‚Äì30 he took his doctor's degree at Leyden, and was incorporated at Oxford on the 27th of that month (ib. i. 452). with the support of Archbishop William Laud, he was appointated precentor of St David's on 21 May 1631 (Le Neve, Fasti, ed. Hardy, i. 316), instituted vicar of Cliffe, Kent, about 1636 (Hasted, Kent, iv. 32), and in 1638 made dean of Lichfield (Le Neve, i. 563), 'the cathedral of which,' says Wood, 'he adorned to his great charge.' He was also chaplain in ordinary to the king. When the civil war broke out he lost all his preferments, and retired to South Stoke, but afterwards to Oxford, where he remained until its surrender. For this he was adjudged a delinquent and his estate sequestered. He only obtained a pardon by paying a fine of ¬£480 on 21 Sept. 1647. Death and legacy Higgs died unmarried at South Stoke on 16 December 1659 and was buried in the chancel of the church. According to his will dated 22 Aug 1659, he allotted funds to the church of South Stoke, some specified to buy land for the poor of that town. He also donated funds to purchase free land of socage for the maintenance of a schoolmaster there, which was to be managed by the warden and fellows of Merton College, who were appointed patrons of the school to be erected at South Stoke. He left funds for the purchase of divinity books for the Bodleian Library, St. Merton's and St. John's College. His library, which had been scattered during the war, the greatest portion being kept at Stafford, he left to Merton College but the corporation of Stafford successfully resisted the attempts of the college to obtain the books . Higgs likewise gave money to found a divinity lecture at Merton College and an annual sum to augment the allowance of the postmasters. Upon his death, Higgs donated ¬£1,500 to Merton College, stipulating that ¬£10 was earmarked as librarian's annual stipend. He also left his entire personal library to Merton College and more than 650 titles remain there today. While it was not uncommon for an educated man of his position to donate a collection to a library, his endowment of a librarianship is unique. He left detailed instructions about the librarian's qualifications and responsibilities. A code of conduct was suggested for librarians at the college. He also provided guidelines for cataloging the collection, maintaining books and managing acquisitions. Although his wishes were largely ignored, his practical instructions are essential to understanding the concept of librarianship in the 17th century. Works He wrote a life of Sir Thomas White, the founder of his college, in Latin verse, which was preserved in manuscript in the college library. Bound up with it is another manuscript by Higgs, entitled 'A True and Faithfull Relation of the Risinge and Fall of Thomas Tucker, Prince of Alba Fortunata, Lord of St. John's, with all the Occurrents which happened throughout his whole Domination,' an account of the mock ceremonie on choosing a lord of misrule at Christmas. Of this narration 250 copies were printed in 1816 by Philip Bliss, under the title 'An account of the Christmas prince: as it was exhibited in the University of Oxford in 1607,' London. Appended are several extracts from the dramas acted on the occasion. His other writings are: 1\\\\. Problemata Theologica, Leyden, 1630. 2\\\\. Miscellane√¶ Theses Theologic√¶, defended by him when he was made D.D., Leyden, 1630. He left other works in manuscript. He has verses in Ultima Linea Savilii, 1622. The Griffith Higgs of South Stoke whose epitaph is printed in 'Notes and Queries,' 1st ser. vol. x. p. 266, was Higgs's nephew. He died in 1693, not 1698.

OCCRP is the only full-time investigative reporting organization that specializes in organized crime and corruption. It publishes its stories through local media and in English and Russian through its website. In 2017, NGO Advisor ranked it 69th in the world in their annual list of the 500 best non-governmental organizations (NGO). History OCCRP was founded by veteran journalists Drew Sullivan and Paul Radu. Sullivan was serving as the editor of the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIN) and Radu worked with an early Romanian center. The team paired with colleagues in the region on a story looking at energy traders. The project showed traders were buying power at below production rates while the public was paying increasingly higher fees. In 2007 the project won the first ever Global Shining Light Award given out by the Global Investigative Journalism Network. Radu and Sullivan realized more cross-border investigative reporting was needed and started OCCRP with a grant from the United Nations Democracy Fund. OCCRP was an early practitioner of collaborative, cross-border investigative journalism by non-profit journalism organizations, an approach that is gaining recognition in the United States and now Europe. It is a partner of the Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) in Jordan, Connectas in Colombia, the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting in South Africa, InsightCrime in Colombia, and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington. It has worked with hundreds of news organizations including The Guardian, Financial Times, Le Soir, the BBC, Time magazine, Al Jazeera and other major media. Work Investigations The project has been involved in a number of high-profile investigations, including looking at the offshore services industry, organized crime ownership in football clubs, casinos and the security industry. In 2013, it broke new ground on the Magnitsky case, the largest tax fraud in Russian history, and demonstrated that funds stolen from the Russian treasury ended up in a company now owned by the son of Moscow's former transportation minister. Some of the money was used to buy high-end real estate near Wall Street. US prosecutors have since sought to seize $18 million in property from the company. Working with SVT Swedish Television and the TT News Agency, it uncovered that the Swedish/Finnish Telecom giant TeliaSonera (now Telia), Vimpelcom and other phone companies had paid about $1 billion in bribes to companies controlled by Gulnara Karimova, daughter of Uzbekistan's president Islam Karimov. More than $800 million in assets were seized or frozen by law enforcement after the scandal. Vimpelcom paid a $775 million fine for their part in the bribes. The story won numerous international awards. OCCRP worked on the Panama Papers project with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and S√ºddeutsche Zeitung producing more than 40 stories on corruption through the use of offshore entities including how friends close to Russian President Vladimir Putin were receiving large sums of money through offshore companies, how the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev owned a majority of his country's mining industry through offshore companies and how President Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine had violated Ukrainian law and avoided taxes using offshore companies. It investigated an assassination attempt on a Russian banker which led the Moldovan government to ban the pro-Russian Patria political party from the 2014 elections and the party's leader to flee the country. It also looked at a massive money laundering scheme, the Russian Laundromat, that moved tens of billions of dollars into Europe using offshore companies, fake loans and bribed Moldovan judges. Some of the Russian banks involved were owned in part by Igor Putin, a cousin of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Its stories on Montenegro's long-time President and Prime Minister Milo ƒêukanoviƒá led to street demonstrations, calls for his removal and intense scrutiny by the European Union and NATO of its membership applications. Two series looked at the cozy ties between ƒêukanoviƒá and organized crime. One series traced the President's family-owned bank, Prva Banka (First Bank), and how the president privatized it to his brother cheaply, moved massive state funds into the bank and then loaned the money out to his family, friends and organized crime on overly favorable terms. When the bank failed under the weight of these bad loans, the president bailed it out with taxpayer money. The Central Bank said the government lied about repaying the loan simply shuttling funds back and forth and claiming the loan was repaid. A second series examined how the president through his staff kept close relationships to international drug traffickers like , to the point where municipalities controlled by the president's party gave prime coastal property almost for free to the wanted kingpin. It also showed how the Italian mafia was smuggling cigarettes to Italy from an island off the coast of Montenegro owned by his good friend Stanko Subotic and controlled by his head of security. Drew Sullivan said that Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte \\"has made a mockery of rule of law in his country. While he is not your typical corrupt leader, he has empowered corruption in an innovative way. His death squads have allegedly focused on criminals but, in fact, are less discriminating. He has empowered a bully-run system of survival of the fiercest. In the end, the Philippines are more corrupt, more cruel, and less democratic.\\" Person of the Year Award Since 2012, OCCRP has dedicated the Person of the Year Award that \\"recognizes the individual or institution that has done the most to advance organized criminal activity and corruption in the world\\". * 2012 ‚Äì Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan ‚Äì Other mentions: Naser Kelmendi, Milo ƒêukanoviƒá, Vladimir Putin, Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá, Islam Karimov, * 2013 ‚Äì Parliament of Romania ‚Äì Other mentions: Darko ≈†ariƒá, Gulnara Karimova * 2014 ‚Äì Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation ‚Äì Other mentions: Viktor Orb√°n, Milo ƒêukanoviƒá * 2015 ‚Äì Milo ƒêukanoviƒá, Prime Minister of Montenegro ‚Äì Other mentions: First Family of Azerbaijan, Nikola Gruevski * 2016 ‚Äì Nicol√°s Maduro, President of Venezuela ‚Äì Other mentions: Rodrigo Duterte, Bashar al-Assad, ISIL/ISIS, Ra√∫l Castro/Luis Alberto Rodr√≠guez, Vladimir Putin * 2017 ‚Äì Rodrigo Duterte, President of the Philippines ‚Äì Other mentions: Jacob Zuma, Robert Mugabe * 2018 ‚Äì Danske Bank, for the money laundering scandal * 2019 ‚Äì Joseph Muscat, for the flourishing of criminality and corruption under his leadership as Prime Minister of Malta Daily Updates The website of the organization provides daily updates about alleged instances of corruption and organized crime around the world, which reach 6 million readers every month. Mission OCCRP's goal is to help the people of the world understand how organized crime and corruption resides in their countries and in their governments. The organization does not belong to any country, political philosophy or set of beliefs other than that all people should be allowed to choose their own governments and lead their own lives in safety, liberty and opportunity. Its reporters and editors come from dozens of countries. OCCRP's mission statement says, \\"Our world is increasingly polarized. The world‚Äô media channels are rife with propaganda, misinformation and simply wrong information. We must all strive to understand how our increasingly complex society works. We must be able to find the truth to make the kinds of decisions we need to. We are committed in our small way to telling the truth the best we can.\\" OCCRP has become one of the world's largest investigative reporting organizations, generating more than 60 cross-border investigations per year. The OCCRP Network websites inform more than 6 million readers and viewers every month, and 200 million other readers and viewers have access through legacy media which publish its work. The ever-widening impact of OCCRP stories demonstrates that when enough people possess the right kind of information they can bring about the right kind of change. The organization also trains reporters and partners in advanced journalism techniques, builds practical, high-use tools used to improve the efficiency of reporting and publishing and is actively reinventing investigative journalism to be more interactive, more effective, more impactful and relevant to readers. Impact Since 2011, OCCRP's reporting has led to: * US$6.5 billion in fines levied and assets seized by government agencies * 382 government actions * 150 civil actions * 91 corporate actions * 308 criminal investigations * 442 arrests, indictments, or sentences * 52 resignations or sackings of key figures, including a President, Prime Minister and CEOs of major international corporations Members Member centers include the Center for Investigative Reporting (Bosnia and Herzegovina) (CIN) in Sarajevo, the RISE Project in Bucharest, the Centar za istra≈æivaƒçko novinarstvo - Serbia (CINS) in Belgrade, Investigative Journalists of Armenia (HETQ) in Yerevan, the Bulgarian Investigative Journalism Center in Sofia, in Budapest, MANS in Montenegro, Re:Baltica in Riga, SCOOP-Macedonia in Skopje, Bivol.bg in Bulgaria, Slidstvo.info in Ukraine, The Czech Center for Investigative Reporting in Prague and RISE Moldova in Chisinau among others. It is also partnered with Novaya Gazeta in Moscow and the Kyiv Post in Kiev. New member centers were added to the OCCRP Network between 2015 and 2016, including the Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPI), Direkt36 in Hungary, Slidstvo.Info in Ukraine, and DOSSIER in Austria. Since 2017 OCCRP expanded to Africa, Middle East, and Central Asia. The first Central Asian member of OCCRP is Kloop in Kyrgyzstan. Its parent organization is the Journalism Development Network, a Maryland-based non- profit organization which operates the organization on behalf of the member centers. Romanian journalist Paul Cristian Radu is the executive director and American Drew Sullivan is the project's editor. Funding and Partnerships OCCRP is supported by grants by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), the United States Department of State, the Swiss Confederation, Google Ideas, Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Knight Foundation. The OCCRP network also has projects and programs funded in part or done in partnership with other organizations including the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the Stockholm School of Economics, InSight, Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ), Connectas, and the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR). OCCRP is a registered name of the Journalism Development Network, a Maryland-based charitable organization (501(c)3). Awards and recognition OCCRP is one of the most-decorated media organizations in the non-profit media world. It won the 2015 European Press Prize Special Award for its work, with the judges saying \\"the OCCRP is a memorably motivated, determined force for good everywhere it operates. Its members do not get rich, but the societies they serve are richer and cleaner for the scrutiny only true, independent journalism can provide.\\" It won the 2015 Investigative Reporters and Editors Tom Renner award for \\"The Khadija Project,\\" an initiative to continue the work of imprisoned OCCRP/RFE reporter Khadija Ismayilova. It has been a finalist for three years running for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Daniel Pearl Award for Outstanding International Investigative Reporting. It was a 2010 finalist for its project on the illegal document trade. It won the 2011 Daniel Pearl Award for its project \\"Offshore Crime, Inc.\\", a series of stories documenting offshore tax havens, the criminals who use them and millions of dollars in lost tax money. It was again a finalist in 2013 for its story about an international money laundering ring called the Proxy Platform. It won the Global Shining Light Award in 2008 for investigative reporting under duress for its series on energy traders. OCCRP was double finalist for the same award in 2013 for its stories on the first family of Montenegro's bank, \\"First Family, First Bank\\". It won the award for its stories on the first family of Azerbaijan's ownership of major companies in that country. It partnered with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists for a project on tobacco smuggling that won the Overseas Press Club Award and Investigative Reporters and Editors's Tom Renner Award for crime reporting. It was a finalist for the 2013 Online Journalism Award for small website investigative reporting and won the South East Europe Media Organisation's 2013 SEEMO award with Center for Investigative Reporting (Bosnia and Herzegovina) for its story on boiler-room scams. Controversy Journalist Khadija Ismayilova OCCRP and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Khadija Ismayilova, based in Baku, Azerbaijan became a cause c√©l√®bre when she was blackmailed by an unknown party with video captured in her bedroom using a camera installed in the wall. The camera was planted two days after OCCRP/RFERL published a story by Ismayilova about the presidential family in Azerbaijan and how it secretly owned Azerfon, a mobile phone company with a monopoly 3G license. A note threatened to show the videos if Ismayilova did not stop her work. She refused and the videos were shown on at least two websites. Ismayilova complained that prosecutors were doing very little to identify the culprits who are widely believed to have been the government of Azerbaijan. After this incident, Ismayilova went on to publish articles showing that the first family also owned shares in six major goldfields and they owned one of the construction companies that built the new showcase Crystal Hall auditorium in Baku, the site of the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest. She was detained by state prosecutors in December 2014 on charges that she incited a fellow journalist to commit suicide by denying him a chance to return to his job at Radio Free Europe, despite the fact that she had no hiring authority. The journalist later retracted his statements on his Facebook page and attempted to flee to Moscow. The arrest was criticized around the world by dozens of governments, media and civil society organizations. OCCRP started the Khadija Project, an investigative reporting effort to continue Ismayilova's work. Editor Drew Sullivan, when initiating the project, said if governments arrest one investigative reporter, twenty would take their place. They vowed to look at the political elite in Azerbaijan and how they have materially benefited from their high positions. OCCRP did more than a dozen major investigations including some using the Panama Papers. OCCRP found the First Family of Azerbaijan had more than $140 million in high end London Property, owned a large percentage of the luxury hotel and banking businesses in Baku, had received more than $1 billion in bribes from telecom companies and other stories. Ismayilova was released from prison on May 25, 2016.

It was named after the astronomers Fran√ßois and Monique Spite, who published the discovery in 1982. The element lithium was first produced during the Big Bang that created the observable universe. The cosmic abundance of lithium is of interest because it provides several constraints to the various Big Bang models. Those models that fail to satisfy these constraints are therefore subject to rejection or correction by the scientific community. Lithium is readily consumed by fusion with protons at temperatures above , such as is found in the cores of stars. Thus, if the convection zone of a main sequence star carries lithium to the core region, the abundance of lithium in the star can decrease. Likewise, lithium can be produced in interstellar matter by spallation collisions with cosmic rays, or by the evolution of stars of moderate mass. To obtain a good estimate of the primordial abundance of lithium, astronomers Fran√ßois and Monique Spite measured the abundance of lithium in old, population II stars (or old halo stars). Such stars were formed early in the universe out of material that had not been significantly modified by other processes. Their results showed that the curve on a graph of the abundance of lithium versus effective surface temperature formed a plateau among old halo stars for effective temperatures below about: : log Teff ~ 3.75 or roughly 5,600 K. This suggested that the plateau represented the primordial abundance level of lithium in the Milky Way, and thus they were able to estimate that the abundance of lithium at the beginning of the galaxy was: : NLi = (11.2 ¬± 3.8) √ó 10‚àí11 NH where NH is the abundance of hydrogen. The current estimates for the primordial abundance of lithium, as measured by this technique, are in tension with the predictions of the standard model of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, a discrepancy known as the lithium problem.

After leaving the army, due to the harsh conditions of warfare and poor motivation, they hid in the woods, as outlaws. They numbered several tens-of-thousands and were operative in areas of Croatian territory and Syrmia. The groups subsisted in part on food and clothing supplied by sympathetic rural people, but also lived on income generated by robbing traders and rich farmers. General Stjepan Sarkotiƒá got in February 1918 the order to get involved with the \\"Green cadres\\". The term Green cadres was previously unknown in the Austro-Hungarian army (as Green cadres referred to the bodyguards of the Emperor of Russia.http://www.napoleon-online.de/html/ru_1812leibdragoner.html) The Croatian Committee was formed opposed to the Yugoslav Committee.

Overview The 321st Strategic Missile Wing was the sixth, and last United States Air Force LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM wing. In 1962, the Air Force announced that the Grand Forks AFB would be first to deploy the new LGM-30F Minuteman II missile (The previous deployments were all Minuteman I). Sylvania won the contract to build all the Launch Control centers and the launcher sites. Flooding during the winter and spring of 1964 and 1965 proved to be a serious issue with the missile silos under construction, as many flooded components, such as diesel generators, had to be returned to the factory for rehabilitation. The Launch Control Centers were built by Sylvania, rather than Boeing which constructed the facilities at the other Minuteman bases and were much larger and had a different underground design. Also, the site designation system at Grand Forks was different with each Flight LCC or MAF ending in zero rather than one as in the other 5 Minuteman Wings. In addition, the Grand Forks launch facilities had a hardened Launcher Equipment Building as opposed to the earlier five Minuteman wings that had softer Launcher Support Buildings. The Sylvania Minuteman system of the 321st Missile Wing at Grand Forks AFB as well as the Odd Squad 564th Strategic Missile Squadron at Malmstrom AFB utilized a double or redundant Deuce communication system with the Hardened Intersite Cable System or HICS backed up with radio capability for command and control of the missiles. On 1 November 1964, the 321st SMW was activated by Strategic Air Command. As personnel began to report to the 321st, the wing trained for the day when the Minuteman II missile would be placed on alert status. In August 1965, the 321st received its first Minuteman II missile, shipped by train from assembly plant 77 at Hill AFB, Utah. During the following March, the base received the first Minuteman II to be shipped via aircraft, an Air Force first. On 26 April 1966, the 447th Strategic Missile Squadron and its 50 Minuteman II missiles were declared operational. Additional flights came on line throughout 1966. On 7 December the 321st Strategic Missile Wing, with its component 446th, 447th, and 448th Strategic Missile Squadrons, became fully operational. From December 1971 to March 1973, the 321st converted to LGM-30G Minuteman III missiles. These missiles represented a significant technological advancement, having multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). With the restructuring of the Air Force after the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s the 321st first came under Air Combat Command and then Air Force Space Command jurisdiction. In March 1995, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) selected the 321st Missile Wing for inactivation. Initially downgraded to a Group in July 1994, the 321st was inactivated, with its three component missile squadrons on 30 September 1998. The 446th Strategic Missile Squadron completed its mission of mission transfer first in late November 1996, followed by the 448th Strategic Missile Squadron in September 1997 and lastly the 447th Strategic Missile Squadron in June 1998.

Destruction of silos and control facilities began in October 1999 with (Alpha-04) being imploded on 6 October. The last silo (Hotel-22) was imploded on 24 August 2001, being the last US silo destroyed per the 1991 START I treaty. Sites (Oscar-Zero) and (November-33) were preserved by the North Dakota State Historical Society as the Ronald Reagan Minuteman Missile Site. Facilities The Missile Alert Facility (MAF) consists of a buried and hardened Launch Control Facility (LCC) and Launch Control Equipment Building (LCEB). MAFs were formerly known as Launch Control Facilities (LCFs) but terminology was changed in 1992 with the inactivation of Strategic Air Command (SAC). In addition, a MAF has a landing pad for helicopters; a large radio tower; a large \\"top hat\\" HF antenna; a vehicle garage for security vehicles; recreational facilities, and one or two sewage lagoons. The entire site, except for the helicopter pad and sewage lagoons are secured with a fence and security personnel. About a dozen airmen and officers are assigned to a MAF. The underground LCC Launch Control Center (LCC) contains the command and control equipment for missile operations. It is staffed by the two launch officers who have primary control and responsibility for the 10 underground and hardened Launch Facilities (LF)s within its flight which contains the operational missile. Each of the five LCCs also has the ability to command and monitor all 50 LFs within the squadron. The LF is unmanned, except when maintenance and security personnel are needed. A squadron is composed of five flights; flights are denoted by a letter of the alphabet with the facilities controlled by the flight being designated by a number. The first site in each flight is #00 and designates the Missile Alert Facility. The Launch Facilities (LFs, i.e. missile silos) are numbered 01 through 10, 11 through 20, and so on up to 50.

From 1982 it has been part of The Old House of Charity, built in 1841 which highlights the Byzantine style church built in 1881. The Font de Mussa Mosaic is one of the most highlighted pieces. In 1995 began the complete restoration of the building, carried out by the architect Rafael Rivera. The House of Charity, now the Museum of Prehistory, has a ground floor and two stories arranged around five courtyards. On the ground floor are located the shop, cafeteria, two temporary exhibition rooms, workshops, warehouses and the Restoration and Quaternary Wildlife laboratories, as well as offices of the Prehistoric Research Service, while the Church has become the Hall. On the first floor are the Library and the Permanent Facilities dedicated to Paleolithic Neolithic and Bronze Age. On the second floor permanent galleries devoted to the Iberian culture and the Roman World.  Prehistory Research Service  The Mogente Warrior, Iberian work housed in the Valencia Museum of Prehistory. The Prehistory Research Service (Servicio de Investigaci√≥n Prehist√≥rica, SIP) of the Diputaci√≥n of Valencia and the Museum of Prehistory are founded in 1927 at the request of Isidro Ballester Tormo as a scientific institution dedicated to research, preserve and promote the archaeological heritage of Valencia. In the museum have worked some of the most notable archaeologists of Spain Llu√≠s Pericot Domingo Fletcher or Enrique Pla, who directed the SIP, or Miquel Tarradell Miracles Gil-Mascarell or Carmen Aranegui, who worked closely with this service. Since its creation, the SIP developed an intense archaeological field work as in the Bastide de les Alcuses of Moixent, the Black Cave (Cova Negra) of X√†tiva, the Cova del Parpall√≥ of Gandia or Tossal de Sant Miquel of Ll√≠ria. The materials obtained from these excavations soon formed a collection whose scientific and heritage value has made the SIP and its museum one of the most important in Spain. Currently, research projects cover all phases of the Prehistory and Antiquity of Valencia, with major actions developed in Cueva de Bolomor in Tavernes de la Valldigna, where appeared the oldest human remains in Valencian lands. Also excavations are conducted at the Eneolithic sites of Fuente Flores y Cinto Mariano (Requena), in the Bronze Age sites of Lloma Betx√≠ (Paterna) and Les Raboses (Albalat dels Tarongers), in the Iberian villages of Bastida de les Alcusses and Los Villares (Caudete de las Fuentes) and the Ibero-Roman city of La Carencia de (Tur√≠s).  The Library of the Prehistory Research Service  The SIP library was created in parallel with the Valencia Museum of Prehistory in 1927. It is a specialized library which began its bibliographic collection with donations and acquisitions. During the formation of the Library, the acquisitions of monographs were made taking into account a range of needs and would include: general works or reference, other studies that discuss the prehistory and archaeology prior to the founding of the SIP and those dealing with the latest advances in archaeology. Similarly, from the outset there was the need to create a network of exchanges of publications, in order to increase the number of copies and to publicize the institution's own publications. Initially it was planned with the \\"Archivo de Prehistoria Levantina\\" although due to economic difficulties, it took 16 years between publication of the first and the second volume, as a result, the bibliographic exchange was performed with the Annual Report.  Publications  The SIP research task obtains results that are disseminated through scientific publications. The SIP edits the journal \\"Archivo de Prehistoria Levantina\\", and the series of monographs \\"Serie de Trabajos Varios\\" as well as catalogs of exhibitions held by the SIP, brochures, educational books, monographs, etc.  See also  * List of museums in Spain References  External links  * Website of the Prehistory Museum of Valencia Valencia Category:Museums in Valencia Category:Tourist attractions in Valencia ","title":"Prehistory Museum of Valencia"},{"id":"30000449","text":"Kate Hollywood (born 28 May 1986) is an Australian former field hockey player who represented the Australian national team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and won two Commonwealth Games gold medals, in 2006 and 2010. Domestically, Hollywood played for the New South Wales Arrows in the Australian Hockey League (AHL). Known for her \\"speed, vision, and accuracy in passing\\", Hollywood played predominantly in midfield and was a member of the national team from 2005 to 2011, earning over 150 international caps. Early life Born to Carolyn and Bob Hollywood on 28 May 1986, Hollywood is originally from Gymea Bay, New South Wales. From a hockey-playing family her father played first-grade hockey in Sydney she began playing hockey at four years of age for her local team, Sutherland Hockey Club. Career After her debut season with the New South Wales Arrows in the Australian Hockey League (AHL) in 2005, Hollywood was selected to play for the Australian team for their 2005 tour of the United States. Hollywood made her international debut on that tour as a 19-year-old and, after an impressive showing, she became a constant fixture in the Australian team. In July, Hollywood was selected to play for the Australian under-21 team at the Junior World Cup. Several months after her senior debut, Hollywood played at the 2005 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy where she won a silver medal, losing the final in a penalty shootout to the Netherlands. The next year, Hollywood played for Australia at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Australia won the gold medal, defeating India 1‚Äì0 in the final, which Hollywood described as the \\"highlight of her career\\" and her \\"greatest moment\\". Hollywood also played at the 2006 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy, but the Australians could not repeat their performance of the previous year and did not feature in the medals. Despite being a regular in the Australian team for the majority of the year, Hollywood was not selected to the Australian squad for the 2006 World Cup. The 2007 season saw Hollywood suffer her first major injury setback, as she was sidelined for four months to recover from surgery due to compartment syndrome. Hollywood made her way back into the Australian team in time for the 2007 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy where Australia lost the third place playoff to Germany. Prior to the 2008 Olympics, Hollywood competed at the 2008 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy where Australia finished a distant fifth. Hollywood then proceeded to complete a \\"childhood dream\\" by playing at her first Olympic Games. Although there was speculation in the lead-up that Australia was a gold medal contender, the Australians finished third in their group and did not progress to the semi finals. Australia ended up finishing a disappointing fifth overall. The next year Hollywood, who had become one of the national team's senior players due to multiple retirements after the Olympics, played at the 2009 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy. Hollywood played her 100th international match at the tournament, as the Australians won the silver medal, losing to Argentina in a penalty shootout in the final. Australia failed to qualify for the Champions Trophy in 2010, so the first major tournament that Hollywood was scheduled to play was the World Cup. After breaking her hand in June, Hollywood raced to become fit in time for the World Cup, which began in late August. Hollywood did recover in time and, in what was becoming a pattern for the Australian team at major tournaments, they again finished fifth after failing to make the semi finals. Hollywood played at her second Commonwealth Games later in the year, where she was one of only five players who had also represented Australia at the previous Games. She scored one goal for the tournament as the Australians won the gold medal‚ÄîHollywood's second Commonwealth Games gold‚Äîwinning the final against New Zealand in a penalty shootout. Despite winning the Commonwealth Games in 2010, the Australian team fell to fifth in the world rankings. As a result, a new coach, Adam Commens, was appointed. He began his time in charge of the Hockeyroos by dropping five experienced players, Hollywood included, from the Australian national squad, citing an \\"emphasis on youth\\". Hollywood was subsequently moved to the development squad to \\"develop on areas [she] needs to work on\\", with Commens declaring that it was not the end of Hollywood's career. As she had changed from a midfielder to a defender in the Australian off-season, Hollywood said that it \\"wasn't a major shock\\", but that she had enjoyed the move and was determined to win her way back into the Australian side for the 2012 Olympics. During the year, Hollywood finished her bachelor's degree in physical education; played professionally for Dutch side, Rotterdam; and also played domestically in New Zealand. In October, Hollywood was rewarded with a call-up to the national team for a series against China. Commens said that she had \\"done well for Australia A during various matches throughout the year\\" and that \\"with some strong performances in this series against China she could challenge for a spot in the [Olympic] squad\\". Despite playing well in the series against China, including scoring a goal from a penalty corner, Hollywood was left out of the 27-person Australian training squad for the 2012 Olympics. Hollywood played another season in the Netherlands for Rotterdam and again followed that up with a stint playing professionally in New Zealand for Auckland Fury, returning home to Australia in September 2012. She then decided to take a break from playing hockey and started doing some junior coaching. Hollywood subsequently started work as a physical education teacher in Sydney. She is also an ambassador for Autism Spectrum Australia. In July 2013, Hollywood stated that she was unsure if she would return to hockey.

Women Filmmakers of the African & Asian Diaspora: Decolonizing the Gaze, Locating Subjectivity (SUI: 1997)Foster (1997), 2 Black women filmmakers The film industry has been difficult for black women to break into. According to Nsenga Burton, writer for The Root, \\"the film industry remains overwhelmingly white and male.\\" In her book Black Women Film and Video Artists, Jacqueline Bobo notes that \\"there is a substantial body of work created by Black women film/video makers, extending back to the early part of this century. Unfortunately, the work is overlooked not only by many distributors, but also by critical reviews and scholarly analyses, with the notable exception of those by Black women scholars, have been few and far between.\\"Bobo, Jacqueline, ed. Black Women Film & Video Artists. New York: Routledge, 1998. p. 6. One of the issues concerning the involvement of Black females in film making is not simply the involvement or lack in numbers, but the influence given to them. As Ada Gay Griffin examines in Seizing the Moving Image the issues in telling a Black story in film cannot be resolved by adding a couple of black actors or hiring black crews to produce the film, but by seizing control of the image as Griffin argues and this is done by gaining production ownership of the films which can be done by Black women gaining more Studio Executive positions in the film industry which is severely lacking. Therefore, when looking at Hollywood's industry Black women filmmakers become the most unnoticeable, they become existent only in the periphery of the industry. In other words, it may be somewhat apparent that Black women filmmakers are small in numbers but the fact of the matter is that there are many black woman filmmakers that are actively contributing to the film industry. Jacqueline Bobo, an associate professor in the women's studies program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, argues that the general public sees Black women's works as small, irregular works of interest to small circle of intimate friends.Bobo, Jacqueline, ed. Black Women Film & Video Artists. New York: Routledge, 1998.  History  Jacqueline Bobo establishes that black women filmmakers have been productive throughout the twentieth century. Dating back to the 1900s, black women filmmakers have created a Genesis of a Tradition. Through Gloria J Gibson-Hudson's essay titled \\"The Ties That Bind: Cinematic Representations By Black Women Filmmakers,\\" she notes that these black women have developed a framework or \\"commonalities\\" that evolved from social and historical circumstances.  1900s   1910s  Documentation exists of Black women producing and directing films during the prolific interim of Black film production from 1910 through the 1920s. Archivist and film scholar Pearl Bowser notes that Black women worked behind the camera on numerous films during this time on what were known as race films, that is, independent films produced by Black filmmakers, rather than white-controlled films about Black life. Historical records show that two women were especially noteworthy in filmmaking during this period. Madame C.J. Walker, one of the first Black millionaires, made her fortune manufacturing and distributing cosmetics and hair-care products for Black women. In addition to her retail business, Walker owned the Walker Theater in Indianapolis, Indiana and produced training and promotional films about her cosmetics factory. The theater still stands today and was recently purchased by IUPUI for renovations. These films, Bowser declares, \\"offered a visual record of women's work history\\" and the \\"development of cottage Industries.\\" Bowser also points to the importance of Madam Toussaint Welcome, Booker T. Washington's personal photographer, who produced at least one film about Black soldiers who fought in World War I.Bobo, Jacqueline, ed. Black Women Film & Video Artists. New York: Routledge, 1998, pp. 6-7  1920s  There are disputes concerning whom the first black women filmmaker is. Tressie Souders wrote, directed and produced a feature film called A Woman's Error in 1922. The film was hailed by the black press as \\"‚Äúthe first of its kind to be produced by a young woman of our race.‚Äù Zora Neale Hurston, best known for her novels including the renowned Their Eyes Were Watching God, was also a folklorist who created work centering on ethnographic films, she earned her MA in Cultural Anthropology at Columbia University. Hurston created the film Children's Games in 1928, which is the first non-silent film to be directed by a black woman.Bobo, Jacqueline, ed. Black Women Film & Video Artists. New York: Routledge, 1998, pp. 6-7 Hurston lived from 1891‚Äì1960, and her plays and scripts have been preserved by the Library of Congress. Hurston was trained as an anthropologist, and created documentaries, particularly about the lives of black people in the south. Eloyce King Patrick Gist produced short religious films with her husband James Gist, including the 16mm silent motion pictureHell Bound Train(1929-30), which preaches temperance. Eloyce Gist's work had a spiritual mission and \\"remains unique in its explicitly non- theatrical definition and its purpose as a tool for moral education and social uplift.\\"  1930s   1940s  Eslanda Goode Robeson, better known as author of Paul Robeson, Negro (1930), the biography of her husband, and the travelogue African Journey (1945), shot ethnographic film footage during the 40s. This material is held by the Library of Congress but, as of 2012, is not available for public screening due to fragile condition.  1970s  Madeline Anderson is considered \\"a trailblazer in the world of nonfiction filmmaking\\" recognized particularly for I Am Somebody (1970) and the earlier A Tribute to Malcolm X (1967). Safi Faye, a Senegalese film director, was the first Sub-Saharan African woman to direct a commercially distributed feature film, Kaddu Beykat, which was released in 1975.  1980s  Kathleen Collins wrote, produced and directed, Losing Ground (1982) her landmark film, after writing her 1977 manifesto \\"A Place in Time and Killer of Sheep: Two Radical Definitions of Adventure Minus Women\\" which \\"charged that films like Shaft and Superfly did nothing more than reproduce, in a different hue, the phallocentric conventions of white Hollywood cinema\\". Euzhan Palcy wrote and directed Sugar Cane Alley (1983) her seminal masterpiece and put the French West Indies on the World cinema map. winning the Silver Lion at the 40th Venice Film Festival in 1983, a first for a black director. The following year, she made history again when she became the first woman and the first black director winner of the Best First Work C√©sar Awards In 1989, she co- wrote and directed A Dry White Season (1989) becoming the first black female director produced by a major Hollywood studio (MGM) Furthermore, Ms. Palcy is the first black woman filmmaker to direct an actor to an Oscar nomination with Marlon Brando being recognized for his performance as Ian McKenzie in A Dry White Season (1989).  1990s  In 1991, Julie Dash became the first black female filmmaker to have a full-length general theatrical release in the US for her film Daughters of the Dust. Considered \\"an historical marker...suggestive of what will hallmark the next stage of development-a more pronounced diasporic and Afrafemcentic orientation\\", the film was recognized in 1999 by the 25th annual Newark Black Film Festival as one of the most important cinematic achievements in black cinema in the 20th century. Daughters of the Dust was placed on the National Film Resgistry by the Library of Congress in 2004, making it one of 400 other American-made films that are preserved and protected as national treasures. In 1996 Cheryl Dunye's The Watermelon Woman became the first film directed and written by a Black lesbian to explore Black lesbianism. Dunye's work has been influential in both Black and LGBTQ filmmaking spheres.  2000s   2010s  Ava DuVernay, a pioneer of black female filmmakers, became the first black woman to win the US Dramatic Directing Award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival.

His photography is primarily of youth and subcultures.[2][3] He began his career working for style, music and culture magazines The Face and Sleazenation and has since transplanted himself into groups of young people and musicians to form numerous personal projects, as well as making films for Massive Attack , The Streets and The Charlatans and undertaking commercial work. His photography series have included Open Mic, UKG and Kick over the statues.[4] He has self-published a number of photobooks including a series of zines called Guapamente. Life and work Spencer studied Editorial Photography under photographers Paul Reas and Mark Power at the School of Art and Design at the University of Brighton.[5] He graduated in 1997. In 1999 he worked photographing nightlife, such as the UK garage scene, for fashion and lifestyle magazine Sleazenation.[1] Between 2001 and 2005 Spencer photographed the American rock band The White Stripes.[6][7][8] Initially for the NME he photographed shows from their first UK tour onwards, including candid backstage photographs.[8][9] In 2010 he self-published Three's a Crowd,[6]documenting the early stages of the band's rise to popularity.[10] In 2002 photographer Martin Parr tipped Spencer as the most promising newcomer of that year.[10] Spencer is also a noted photographer of London's grime music scene, for which he has received widespread acclaim[11][12][13] and which resulted in his book Open Mic, which was awarded a Yellow Pencil certificate for photographic publishing by D&AD; in 2005.[14] Martin Parr, in his introduction to Open Mic said:[2] Ewen Spencer has already established his reputation, in recent years, as a photographer of much talent with his work on youth culture, but now he turns his attention to the 'grime' music scene in London... This is where Spencer's quality as a photographer really begins to work. He has thrown himself into this whole scene with such enthusiasm and dedication that he has won over the confidence of the key players on the grime circuit. This demonstrates how the potential magic of contemporary photography begins to operate. Because Spencer's photography is so compelling, the viewer begins to understand what attracted him in the first place... This scene is about energy... Ewen Spencer's photographs are also about energy, making visual sense of the wonderful anarchy of grime. Spencer brings the same raw passion to his photographs; I think those who view them benefit from this engagement. Alice Vincent writing for the Huffington Post in 2012 said \\"it is his photography from the front line of genuine youth culture that are the most striking. The rituals of sex and socialising are prominent, with Spencer's images seeming to be captured by an invisible voyeur.\\"[3] In a 2012 interview for The Guardian, Spencer named Dick Hebdige, Tom Wood, and Pete Townshend as influences. In 2013 GOST published Spencer's book of photographs of the UK garage scene, UKG. Writing in The Guardian, Mike Skinner said of UKG that: Ewen's photographs start when the scene was moving at its fastest, and go right up to Moving Too Fast. The first thing I wondered when I saw them was how he didn't get beaten up for snapping such intimate moments of some pretty certified-looking badmen. But my second, more lasting impression was how much more rich in detail they were than my fading typecast memory... But the important and exciting thing about Ewen's photos are that they take you back to the real thing... [15] In 2016 he was commissioned by Photoworks and Fabrica to produce a body of work for Brighton Photo Biennial. With Kick over the statues Spencer‚Äôs intention was to re-establish a belief in youth tribes and style. Young Londoners were cast along the route of the August 2016 Notting Hill Carnival and against locations in Liverpool. These cities celebrate and enhance the idea of a UK diaspora, through style and cultural background with an association to music and culture that recalls the history of British Subcultures and invents its own contemporary incarnations. The gallery installation resembled a snapshot of how photography is often encountered in the streets of a modern city. Large format images posted onto custom-built billboards are supplemented with music and projected images. His photography has featured in The Guardian[9][16] and he has worked for the NME,[6][9] The Face, Nike, Apple, Smirnoff, Footlocker, JD Sports, Sony, Reebok, T-Mobile, Toyota, Vodafone and Channel 4 (photographing on the set of E4's series, Skins).[3][13] He took the inner liner photographs for the album Original Pirate Material by The Streets.[3][10][17] Spencer is also a documentary short film director. His Brandy & Coke (2014), about the UK garage scene, was broadcast on Channel 4 in 2014 as part of the first of their Music Nation music documentary series with Dazed.[18]Sam Richards, writing in The Guardian in 2014, called it \\"excellent\\".[19] Open Mic (2014), about grime music, was broadcast in the second series.[20][21] Ellen E. Jones, writing in The Independent in 2014, said \\"There are enough ideas in 'Open Mic', the opening film from Ewen Spencer, to justify a whole series of films on grime music alone.\\"[22] In 2015 Spencer was commissioned by i-D to make a four-part series for Channel 4, Street, Sound and Style,[23] describing how music and street style subcultures have changed the face of British pop culture.[24] Publications Publications by Spencer The cover of Three's a Crowd Vol.1 * Open Mic.

Hosted by Barbara Walters, the list was broadcast annually on the second Thursday of December on ABC from 1993‚Äì2015. Though produced by ABC News, the specials are not presented under the 20/20 banner, the network's flagship newsmagazine. History After becoming the first woman to co-anchor an evening network newscast in 1976, Barbara Walters left the ABC Evening News in 1978 to concentrate on The Barbara Walters Specials, an occasional series of interviews with heads of state, newsmakers, sports stars, and other public figures. During the early years of the primetime 'specials', Walters secured the first joint interview with Egypt's President Anwar Sadat and Israel's Prime Minister Menachem Begin. The specials continued to air sporadically throughout the year and saw Walters conduct interviews with a plethora of public and political figures including former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In a 1993 special, Walters compiled a list of twelve figures who defined that year. The top person for the year was Hillary Clinton. The program proved popular and led to it returning with ten figures every year except 2000 and 2001. Initially, 2013 was to be Walters' final installment of the special, which happened to end with the same person as in the debut year; however, Barbara has continued the program in both 2014 and 2015. Format The format of the broadcast consists of ten short-form biographical profiles, often interspersed with a recently recorded interview with the subject. The profiles are introduced by Walters from a set which has a computerized backdrop and she often commentates on why the figure has been chosen to qualify for inclusion in the program. Similar to other end- of-year annual lists like the Time 100, the ten profiles are not ranked in any order. However, since 2002, Walters has ended each show with her \\"Most Fascinating Person\\". In 2007, this honor went to author JK Rowling, who was the only one of the ten not to be interviewed for the show. In 2011, this honor was awarded posthumously to Apple founder Steve Jobs, the only person who was deceased at the time.

History of a voyage to the land of Brazil, otherwise called America. University of California Press, 1993. Print. was a former French Dominican friar who was one of the voyagers attempting the French colonization of Brazil called France Antarctique. His theological theories brought him into conflict in the French fort of Coligny (in present-day Rio de Janeiro), resulting in two Huguenots being expelled. Later on, Jean de Cointac himself was expelled from the fort. France Antarctique Jean de Cointac was a student at the Sorbonne and a Dominican friar who converted to Calvinism. Cointac was aboard the second set of ships to reach France Antarctique, after Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon and his crew made the first successful voyage in November, 1555. At the time, many Huguenots were seeking a safe haven from religious persecution in France. King Henry II, although Catholic, financially supported these voyages to the New World in an effort to avoid religious conflict at home and to expand his kingdom, though the Treaty of Tordesillas technically did not permit this colonization. The second embarkation headed to France Antarctique was prepared under the name of King Henry II, under Bois-Lecompte, a nephew of Villegagnon, with 290 voyagers sailing on three ships.Washington, Charles. History of the Huguenot Emigration to America. Howard Press, 2010. Print. After sailing for four months, they landed at Fort Coligny on March 9, 1557. Jean de Cointac was among a group of new arrivals who participated in theological debates in the new land, which eventually filled the fort with wranglings, factions, and feuds. Villegagnon took part with the student, and together devised a new religious doctrine that denounced both Catholicism and Calvinism. Supposedly inspired by the opinions of Cointac, Villegagnon declared that his opinion of Calvin had changed, and that he now held the so-called reformer to be an arch- heretic and an apostate. By 1558, the Portuguese overtook the Fort Coligny, destroying France Antarctique. See also * Villegagnon Island References * Parkman Francis, Jr. Pioneers of France in the New World. 2008. Print.

The set of 11.5 million confidential financial and legal documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca included detailed information on more than 14,000 clients and more than 214,000 offshore entities, including the identities of shareholders and directors including noted personalities and heads of state‚Äîgovernment officials, close relatives and close associates of various heads of government of more than 40 other countries. The German newspaper ' first received the released data from an anonymous source in 2015. After working on the Mossack Fonseca documents for a year, ICIJ director Gerard Ryle described how the offshore firm had \\"helped companies and individuals with tax havens, including those that have been sanctioned by the U.S. and UK for dealing with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\\" History In 1997, the Center for Public Integrity began \\"assembling the world's first working network of premier investigative reporters.\\" By 2000 the ICIJ consisted of 75 world-class investigative reporters in 39 countries.\\" In early November 2014, the ICIJ's Luxembourg Leaks investigation revealed that Luxembourg under Jean-Claude Juncker's premiership had turned into a major European centre of corporate tax avoidance. In February 2015, the ICIJ website released information about bank accounts in Switzerland under the title Swiss Leaks: Murky Cash Sheltered by Bank Secrecy, which published information on 100,000 clients and their accounts at HSBC. In February 2017, ICIJ was spun off into a fully independent organisation, which is now governed by three committees: a traditional board of directors with a fiduciary role; an Advisory Committee made of supporters; and an ICIJ Network Committee. ICIJ was granted nonprofit status from US tax authorities in July the same year. In 2017, the ICIJ, the McClatchy Company, and the Miami Herald won the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting \\"for the Panama Papers, a series of stories using a collaboration of more than 300 reporters on six continents to expose the hidden infrastructure and global scale of offshore tax havens.\\" In total, the ICIJ won more than 20 awards for the Panama Papers.

Offshore banking series The ICIJ partnered with The Guardian, BBC, Le Monde, the Washington Post, SonntagsZeitung, The Indian Express, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung and NDR to produce an investigative series on offshore banking. They reported on government corruption across the globe, tax avoidance schemes used by wealthy people and the use of secret offshore accounts in Ponzi Schemes. In June 2011, an ICIJ article revealed how an Australian businessman had helped his clients legally incorporate thousands of offshore shell entitles \\"some of which later became involved in the international movement of oil, guns and money.\\" In April 2013, a report (Offshore Leaks) disclosing details of 130,000 offshore accounts some of which conducted international tax fraud. In early 2014, the ICIJ revealed that relatives of China's political and financial elite were among those using offshore tax havens to conceal wealth. In July 2019, the Mauritius Leaks showed how Mauritius was being used as one such tax haven. In January 2020, Luanda Leaks revealed how Angola's richest woman, Isabel dos Santos, used a network of Western advisors to amass a fortune. The investigation exposed two decades of corrupt deals that made dos Santos Africa's wealthiest woman and left oil- and diamond-rich Angola one of the world's poorest countries. The investigation showed how dos Santos and her husband, Sindika Dokolo built their empire taking advantage of many secrecy jurisdictions. Panama Papers Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates named in the leak on 15 April 2016 The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung received a leaked set of 11.5 million confidential documents from a secret source, created by the Panamanian corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca. The so-called Panama Papers provided detailed information on more than 214,000 offshore companies, including the identities of shareholders and directors which included government officials, close relatives and close associates of various heads of government of more than 40 other countries.

FinCEN Files  The FinCEN Files are leaked documents from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that describe suspicious financial transactions across multiple global financial institutions.  Data journalism  In the course of the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers investigations, ICIJ was challenged to learn about and implement various technologies to manage international collaboration on terabytes of data ‚Äì structured and unstructured (e.g. emails, PDFs) ‚Äì and how to extract meaningful information from this data. Among the technologies used were the Neo4J graphic database management systems and Linkurious to search and visualize the data. The data-intensive projects involved not just veteran investigative journalists, but also demanded data journalists and programmers.

Early life Williams was born in 1892. His father was in the hardware business and, according to Williams, the demand for tents in Caddo, Oklahoma where he grew up at the turn of the century was such that they were purchased before they had even been unloaded from wagons.\\"History of Caddo\\".

A verbal confrontation escalated to a shootout resulting in Brannan murdering Deputy Dinkheller. The murder continues to receive national attention because the traffic stop and shootout were captured on a personal video recorder Dinkheller had placed on his patrol car dashboard and activated when he stopped Brannan. The recording is widely used for training purposes in U.S. police academies. In the shootout, Dinkheller was armed with his semi- automatic pistol, and Brannan had an Iver Johnson M1 Carbine. Dinkheller shot and wounded Brannan. Despite this, Brannan fired the rifle, reloaded it, fired a lethal shot into Dinkheller's eye, and fled the scene in his Toyota pickup truck. The next morning, police found Brannan still in Laurens County, hiding in a sleeping bag beneath a camouflage tarp. Police arrested him for the murder of Dinkheller. Brannan pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming in part that he suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) stemming from his military service as a soldier in the Vietnam War. Because Dinkheller's video recorded most of Brannan's actions, the jury found he murdered Dinkheller in a premeditated, torturous, and cruel manner. Two years following the murder, on January 28, 2000, the jury convicted Brannan. On January 30, he was sentenced to death. Nearly fifteen years later, on January 13, 2015, the State of Georgia executed Brannan by lethal injection. Confrontation and shootout Deputy Kyle Dinkheller encountered a speeding Toyota pickup truck near Dudley, Georgia, United States, which he clocked at around . The deputy pulled the truck over on Whipple Crossing Road, adjacent to Interstate 16. The traffic stop at first appeared to be routine, with both the deputy and Andrew Brannan exiting their vehicles and exchanging greetings. Brannan, however, placed both hands into his pockets, at which point Dinkheller instructed him to remove his hands and keep them in plain view. At this point, Brannan became belligerent and yelled at the deputy to shoot him. He then began to dance and wave his arms in the middle of the road. Dinkheller radioed the dispatcher for assistance and issued commands for Brannan to cease his behavior and approach the cruiser. When Brannan saw that Dinkheller was calling for other units, he ran toward the deputy in an aggressive manner. Dinkheller retreated while issuing commands and utilized his baton to keep Brannan at bay. On Dinkheller's dashcam video, Brannan was heard shouting that he was a \\"goddamned Vietnam combat veteran.\\" Despite commands issued by Dinkheller, Brannan walked back to his pickup truck and drew an Iver Johnson M1 Carbine from underneath the driver's seat, taking cover near the driver side door. Dinkheller positioned himself near the passenger door of his cruiser and gave Brannan commands for approximately forty seconds before Brannan stepped away from his pickup truck, pointed his rifle at Dinkheller and fired several shots. Dinkheller fired the first shot at Brannan but missed, leading some to speculate that it might have been a warning shot. Dinkheller did not strike the suspect initially and thus was forced to reload. At this point, Brannan ran from his truck toward Dinkheller and began to fire again, hitting the deputy in exposed areas such as the arms and legs. Brannan then began to reload his weapon as the now-injured Dinkheller tried to position himself near the driver side door of his cruiser and pleaded for his life. Brannan appeared to go back to his car to retreat before another shot from Dinkheller was heard. This enraged Brannan, who began advancing and firing at the deputy, hitting him numerous times. Before being disabled from gunfire, Dinkheller was able to inflict a gunshot wound to Brannan's stomach. Dinkheller had been shot nine times when Brannan took careful aim, said, \\"Die fucker,\\" and fired a final fatal shot into Dinkheller's right eye. Brannan then retreated into his truck and fled the scene. Aftermath Brannan was arrested the next morning without incident; he told the investigating authorities that \\"they can hang me\\". He was found guilty on January 28, 2000, for the murder of Dinkheller and was sentenced to death. On January 2, 2015, the Georgia Department of Corrections announced that an execution date of January 13 had been set for Brannan. On January 6, a clemency hearing was set for January 12, at which the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles voted to deny clemency. On January 13, Brannan was executed by lethal injection, the first person in the U.S. to be executed in 2015. Victim Kyle Wayne Dinkheller was a deputy with the Laurens County Sheriff's Office (LCSO) in the U.S. state of Georgia. After his death, he was named the 1998 Deputy Sheriff of the Year by the Georgia Sheriffs' Association. Dinkheller was born on June 18, 1975, in San Diego, California to Kirk Dinkheller. He graduated from California's Quartz Hill High School in 1993. He joined the LCSO as a jailer in March 1995 and became a certified police officer with the State of Georgia in 1996. He was 22 years old when he was murdered. Dinkheller and his wife, Angela, had children Ashley and Cody, the latter of whom was born eight months after his father's death; Ashley was twenty-two months old. Dinkheller is buried in the Garden of Remembrance at Fountainhead Memorial Park in Brevard County, Florida. Perpetrator Early life and education Andrew Howard Brannan was born on November 26, 1948, and graduated from high school in 1967. Career In August 1968, Brannan joined the U.S. Army and received his induction training at Fort Benning in Georgia. In February 1969, he entered the artillery officer candidate school at Oklahoma's Fort Sill and was commissioned as an artillery officer in July 1969. While he was still in the U.S., Brannan served with the 82nd Airborne Division. In July 1969, he was ordered to South Vietnam to serve in the Vietnam War, where he served in the Field Artillery Branch as a forward observer and executive officer with the 23rd Infantry Division at Chu Lai until July 1971. During this time, Brannan witnessed an officer being killed after stepping on a landmine, an incident he later recalled during a psychiatric interview in 1989. He also assumed command of a company on two occasions, after its commander was killed. Afterwards, Brannan arrived at Washington's Fort Lewis, where he transferred to the U.S. Army Reserve, in which he served periodically for two weeks at a time until being discharged in June 1975. During his time in the Army, Brannan was awarded the Bronze Star and two instances of the Army Commendation Medal. While in the military, his superiors spoke favorably of him, saying that he was an \\"outstanding\\" and \\"exemplary\\" officer. Later life and death Brannan's defense was that he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as the result of serving in battle. In 1975, he was married, although the couple divorced six years later as a result of Brannan's violent behavior stemming from his PTSD. A psychologist for the defense during Brannan's trial indicated that the bizarre encounter with Dinkheller in January 1998 \\"was likely the result of a flashback to Brannan's time in combat.\\" In 1994, the Department of Veterans Affairs had declared Brannan 100% disabled for experiencing depression and bipolar disorder. Although Brannan's lawyers tried to get his death sentence commuted on the grounds that he was not criminally responsible for his conviction by reason of insanity, both the Georgia Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene on his behalf on the day his execution was scheduled to take place. Brannan was executed by lethal injection at 8:33 p.m. (EST) on January 13, 2015, the first person executed in the U.S. in 2015. He was 66 years old at the time of his death at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison near Jackson, Georgia. Brannan made a final statement, in which he said, \\"I extend my condolences to the Dinkheller family, especially Kyle's parents and his wife and his two children\\" and \\"I feel like my status was slow torture for the last fifteen years. I had to say that with them here. I have to tell the truth. I'm certainly glad to be leaving.\\" A pastor then delivered a prayer and Brannan was executed. He was executed one day after the 17-year anniversary of the shooting.  The \\"Dinkheller video\\"  The video recording of the murder, known as the \\"Dinkheller video\\", has become ubiquitous in U.S. police academies. According to Vox, the video's purpose in training \\"is to teach officers that any situation could escalate to violence. Cop killers lurk around every corner.\\" The video has, for instance, been adapted to include an interactive sequence in which trainees can kill Brannan before he kills Dinkheller. Police trainers use this setup to test officers' willingness to use deadly force, and to impart to them that \\"there could be a time when pulling the trigger is the only way\\". In popular culture * The incident is the focus of the 2014 short film, Random Stop. * On January 12, 2018, to mark the 20th anniversary of Dinkheller's death, film maker Patrick Shaver released his documentary film, Dinkheller, which tells \\"the story of those who held Dinkheller close to their hearts\\". The documentary premiered at Theatre Dublin in Dublin, Georgia. * The audio from the dashcam is used in a song \\"i just killed a cop now im horny\\" by the artist JPEGMafia.

Dec. 2008. Web. 1 Dec. 2010. . The use of weapons and fear are commonplace in trafficking which often lead to other crimes in the process. The structures of many of these organizations are of a para-military nature using armed combatants to protect their stock of illegal drugs from growth to delivery.  History  In 1914, the Harrison Narcotic Act was passed by congress making a medical prescription necessary for products with high levels of opiate or narcotics.\\" Brecher, Edward M. \\"The Harrison Narcotic Act (1914).\\" DRCNet Online Library of Drug Policy. 1972. Web. 1 Dec. 2010. . With laws against the use of un-prescribed drugs such as opium, cocaine, morphine, and heroin now in effect, the black market grew to continue supply to addicted or prospective users. Rising domestic enforcement of illegal growing and production operations, coupled with increasing legislation against illegal drugs, forced suppliers outside the country. Drug trafficking organizations from nations with lesser, or no drug laws emerged with the opportunity to make large profits from illegal trafficking into the United States. These organized crime syndicates would use any means necessary to exploit the weak border protection of the US. The drugs were shipped, flown, and trucked into the country and distributed from within. In many cases, \\"American mercenaries provided their services as pilots making trips between over 150 clandestine landing strips in South America and the US. In a 1986 Report from the President's Commission on Organized Crime, it was believed that nearly 2/3 of the cocaine from Colombia was flown into the country.\\"President's Commission on Organized Crime. \\"Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime.\\" DRCNet Online Library of Drug Policy. 1986. Web. 1 Dec. 2010. . Rampant drug epidemics and rising gang dealing would eventually lead to a massive operationalization of drug enforcement. The US formed federal agencies and initiatives such as the \\"Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in 1973, and High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area centers with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, coordinating efforts to slow the flow across borders and within the country.\\" Office of National Drug Control Policy. \\"HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREAS (HIDTA) PROGRAM.\\" Office of National Drug Control Policy / Publications. July 2010. Web. 01 Dec. 2010. .) These agencies, along with academics, would formally define the groups that traffic drugs and study their operations.  Organization and structure   Structure  Over the past few decades, drug trafficking organizations have increased in number and diversified in structure. They range from family based operations in which secrecy is essential, and where trafficking of large shipments are discreetly sent to associates across the border, to organizations involving hundreds of players with different roles. This varying structure can often make it difficult to identify the groups as each has a different MO and scale. In 1998, Mangai Natarajan, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, \\"studied court records of 39 trafficking organizations in New York City to classify drug syndicates into four main types. \\"Freelance\\" networks are composed of small nonhierarchical entrepreneurial groupings of individuals; \\"family businesses\\" are cohesive organizations with clear structure and authority and trust based on family ties; \\"communal businesses\\" are flexible organizations bound together by a common tie such as ethnicity, religion, nationality, or neighborhood residence; and \\"corporations\\" are large organizations in which there is a formal hierarchy and a well-defined division of labor.\\"Desroches, Frederick. \\"RESEARCH ON UPPER LEVEL DRUG TRAFFICKING: A REVIEW.\\" Journal of Drug Issues 37.4 (2007): 827-844. SPORTDiscus with Full Text. EBSCO. Web. 15 Nov. 2010. While these \\"corporations\\" are obviously the most organized, they often take years of investigation to trace up to the head operator. Many times these organizations are run from outside the country and therefore extradition and conflicting laws may prohibit the investigation. Another perspective argues that DTOs are politico-military groups that operate in failed states and have political agendas. Situations such as Mexico and Afghanistan today may support this claim, and perhaps, extend further connecting funds to terrorist groups.  Mexican DTOs  Mexican drug trafficking organizations have taken control of the US market in recent years, superseding Dominican and Colombian groups that held it for decades. These groups began as hierarchical with clear and defined leadership and a ladder of command down to the street dealer. In response to increasing law enforcement efforts and understanding of this system, many Mexican DTOs have shifted their command structure to an equally organized, but more independent system of decentralized cells. According to a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Initiative (HIDTA) in the Midwest, the Mexican DTOs have \\"compartmentalized duties, employed advanced security and communications techniques, gathered intelligence, and used violence and intimidation to control organization members and secure smuggling territories.\\" Midwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. \\"Drug Market Analysis 2010.\\" U.S. Department of Justice National Drug Intelligence Center. May 2010. Web. 01 Dec. 2010. . With a state of virtual lawlessness, futile domestic enforcement efforts, and rampant corruption fueled by the drug money, Mexico has grown into a massive drug producer. Production is unmatched when it comes to marijuana, heroin, and cocaine with methamphetamines an increasing trend.  Colombian and Dominican DTOs  Colombian and Dominican DTOs operate in hierarchical command structures and often launder money into non-drug legitimate industries such as real estate and high income businesses as an investigation by ICE learned in 2010 where a multibillion-dollar Colombian DTO was taken down.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \\"ICE Takes down Billion-dollar Colombian Drug Trafficking Organization.\\" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 18 June 2010. Web. 1 Dec. 2010. . Controlling the US market for many years, these groups established undetectable transportation techniques and became deeply connected to domestic gangs. The insurgence of Mexican DTOs has brought increased violence and competition for large cities and territory control. Heroin and cocaine are the primary drugs produced in the countries which have been under the control of cartels for decades.  Asian DTOs  Asian DTOs have filled in the gaps left by the major players by producing and trafficking MDMA known commonly on the street as ecstasy or X. \\"While once a competitive supplier of heroin, the groups have avoided strife by targeting the high potency marijuana market growing in both Canada and the US to avoid border raids.\\"DOJ National Drug Intelligence Center. \\"Drug Trafficking Organizations ‚Äì National Drug Threat Assessment 2010.\\" Welcome to the United States Department of Justice. Feb. 2010. Web. 1 Dec. 2010. .  Impact of DTOs   Finance, violence and terrorism  While an exact financial figure is not known to US authorities, DTOs are believed to make tens of billions of dollars annually depending on size of the organization. With this staggering income from illegal trade, the longevity and persistence of these organizations is understandable. For groups based in economically struggling regions, the illegal trafficking of drugs is a tempting and extremely profitable illegitimate business with little domestic risk. A variety of methods are used to conceal and move the cash made from the network of drug deals. Money laundering techniques involve the wiring and constant movement of funds from different banks and accounts. This technique makes tracking the money more difficult, and can cost banks millions in losses each year. Aside from financial detriment, these groups can be very violent extending their police record to countless offences. In a constant struggle for territory and control of the market, DTOs will not hesitate to use deadly force against rival organizations, or threats to their business. The use of automatic weapons, threats, and bribery are common in maintaining control. \\"Narcoterrorism\\" is not a new threat but has become a domestic fear for the US after the attacks on September 11. With the formation of terrorism task forces and intelligence community initiatives, a greater understanding of the relationship between drug trade and terrorism has taken place. Many terrorist organizations have the drug trade as their major income - for instance the Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan's poppy fields and made opium its largest source of taxation which became one of the mainstays of Taliban income and their war economy. According to Rashid, \\"drug money funded the weapons, ammunition and fuel for the war.\\" In the New York Times, the Finance Minister of the United Front, Wahidullah Sabawoon, declared the Taliban had no annual budget but that they \\"appeared to spend US$300 million a year, nearly all of it on war.\\" He added that the Taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money: \\"poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden.\\" According to Alfred McCoy, during the Cold War the CIA provided Afghan drug lord allies such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar with transport, arms, and political protection in the fight against Soviet forces in Afghanistan. According to Loretta Napoleoni terrorism later shifted from being mainly state sponsored to gaining financial independence from their sponsors and becoming self-financed. In a CBS news article, the Chief of Operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration Michael Braun called \\"groups like the FARC, the Taliban, Hamas and Hezbollah: \\"hybrids\\" stating that they are one part terrorist organization, and are becoming one part global drug trafficking cartel.\\"Hendin, Robert. \\"DEA Digging Into Al Qaeda Drug Links ‚Äì CBS News.\\" Breaking News Headlines: Business, Entertainment & World News ‚Äì CBS News. 18 July 2008. Web. 1 Dec. 2010. . With this new \\"hybrid\\" threat, the violence aimed at political impact meets the already violent world of drug trafficking in a perfect storm. These narco-terrorist groups have been linked to car bombings, hostage situations, and mass killings of police and politicians which opposed the operation and could perhaps pose the greatest threat to the US in the future.  Gang involvement  Operationally, DTOs rely on street gangs to distribute the product to their customers. This collaboration supports turf wars between rival gangs like the Bloods and Crips that ensures their participation in the drug trade. These gangs which make headlines daily, rely on the illegal drug trade to support their gangs across the US. The money generated by this process, among other factors, draws youth into the gang lifestyle continuing the cycle of violence on the street.  Combating drug trafficking organizations   Enforcement  With emerging involvement in these organizations, law enforcement agencies from all levels have stepped up operations against high intensity drug trafficking. Beginning with Vice units in Florida and other border states, law enforcement has grown exponentially in counter narcotics. Currently there is a large network of agencies, police, military, initiatives, and even private sector involvement to combat DTOs. Federal agencies such as the DEA, FBI, ICE, Border Patrol, and even the National Guard, work independently but cohesively to analyze and investigate organizations with the most impact. These agencies are dependent on local and state law enforcement officers who have the street interactions with members of the drug world. This data is collected and disseminated to initiatives such as HIDTAs which were formed as switchboards for drug Intel in target regions of the US. Using a wealth of knowledge, and ever improving technology in networks and analysis, law enforcement efforts finding greater success in dismantling organizations in the US.  Public health  Another approach has been initiated using campaigns for anti drug use in an attempt to reduce the demand for illegal drugs from within. This public health approach utilized TV programs and advertisements, as well as D.A.R.E. programs which are aimed at youth with the hope of prevention before enforcement.

The fort also was used by the Spanish colonial government to maintain good relations with the Osage Nation. Sold by the Chouteau family in 1802, the fort was abandoned the same year by its new owners.Hoig, 24. By the time of an 1806 visit by Zebulon Pike on his expedition through southern Louisiana, the buildings were in disrepair.Neely, 16. Although archaeological remains of the fort and its buildings were extant in 1874,Campbell, 623. a congregation known as the Church of Israel (affiliated with the Christian Identity movement) has occupied the site since the 1940s.O'Neill, 1. Origins Starting in the mid-1700s, the Osage Nation traded furs with French and Spanish settlers, especially the French brothers Pierre Chouteau and Auguste Chouteau from the settlement of St. Louis. The Chouteaus were authorized to trade by the Spanish colonial government, and by 1787 built a temporary trading post along the Osage River in what is now western Missouri.Blackmar, 658. Francisco Luis Hector, Baron of Carondelet, namesake of Fort Carondelet Spanish Governor General Esteban Rodr√≠guez Mir√≥ first proposed a fort in western Missouri in 1791, looking to strengthen Spanish allies living among the Osage.Burns, 127. Before the fort was built, Miro was replaced as Spanish governor general by Francisco Luis H√©ctor de Carondelet.Burns, 128. Concerned that the Osage would ally themselves with the French, Carondelet requested a peace meeting with six Osage chiefs in mid-1794, at which the Osage chiefs agreed (in exchange for peace) to allow the construction of the fort. Carondelet was informed that the fur trader, Auguste Chouteau, would financially support the construction of the fort as a replacement for his temporary trading post along the Osage River.Burns, 129.Houck, 210. In a letter to Carondelet, Chouteau described the proposed fort buildings in detail: Given his desire for peace with the Osage, Carondelet accepted Chouteau's proposal. According to the terms of the agreement between Chouteau and Carondelet, Chouteau received $2,000 annually to support twenty soldiers at the fort and a six-year monopoly on trade with the Osage, unless the Spanish government itself supplied the soldiers (in which case, Chouteau would receive the monopoly but no more). Use and abandonment After its construction in 1795, Fort Carondelet was used as the farthest western outpost for the Chouteau trading operations and not as a military fort.Hoig, 23. Pierre Chouteau operated the post, bringing his sons to live among the neighboring Osage. His sons in turn became familiar with the culture of the Osage and the life of indigenous peoples in general.Hoig, 21. For their part, members of the Osage Nation accepted Chouteau and his family.Hoig, 22. Other tribes (such as the Miami) became jealous of the perceived favoritism shown to the Osage Nation. One of the major effects of the fort was its role in expanding the Chouteau trade operation. While commander of the fort, Pierre Chouteau (along with his son, Auguste Pierre Chouteau) expanded trade from Fort Carondelet to other Osage settlements near the Arkansas River by 1796. By 1800 rivals to the Chouteau operation began demanding that the government break its contract monopoly. That same year, new Spanish Governor General Juan Manuel de Salcedo gave the Chouteau's trade rights to one of their Spanish rivals, Manuel Lisa. In 1802, abandoning his effort to maintain his monopoly, Pierre Chouteau sold Fort Carondelet to Lisa, who withdrew the garrison and abandoned the fort. During the transfer of the Louisiana territory to the possession of the United States in 1804, Auguste Chouteau was employed by Spain to remove any remaining Spanish property from the fort.Hoig, 27. Zebulon Pike, American explorer who visited the site in 1806 After 1802, the fort's buildings fell into disrepair, and by 1806, they were overgrown with vegetation.Houck, 145. According to an entry in the journal of Zebulon Pike during his expedition through southern Louisiana: After the Pike Expedition, few travelers reported the site of the fort. The last report of the fort's existence derives from an 1874 Missouri travel guidebook relating the physical characteristics of Vernon County.Campbell, 622‚Äì624. While not explicitly mentioning the fort, the guidebook noted the top of Halley's Bluff had \\"the foundations of three furnaces\\" and \\"the remains of works‚Äîboth earth and stone, covering the approaches to the furnaces and the descent to the excavations below, as if thrown up for fortifications. Later, the guidebook suggested that the works were remnants of French explorers who had built a headquarters for their operations there.Campbell, 623‚Äì24. In the early 20th century, Halley's Bluff (and the site of the fort) became the possession of a Mormon group that eventually separated from the Church of Christ (Temple Lot).Kaplan, 183. This group, known as the Church of Christ at Halley's Bluff, controlled the property as a compound from 1945 until 1979. Since a dispute over control of the church in the 1970s, the compound has been the property of the Church of Israel, a Christian Identity group.O'Neill, 1 In the 1980s, the church compound was home to Eric Robert Rudolph, who committed the Centennial Olympic Park bombing in 1996.

He was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the second round of the 2012 NFL Draft and has also played for the San Francisco 49ers. He played college football for the Stanford Cardinal. Early life and education Martin's father, Gus Martin, is a Harvard University graduate and a professor of criminal justice administration at California State University, Dominguez Hills. His mother, Jane Howard-Martin, is also a Harvard graduate and is a corporate lawyer for Toyota. Martin has a total of nine relatives who graduated from Harvard including his grandfather, a professor in international development, and his maternal great grandfather, one of a dozen black students there in the 1920s. Martin attended John Thomas Dye School in the Los Angeles area and for high school, he attended nationally ranked Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, California. He was an all-section and All-Mission League selection as a senior in 2007 and earned All-Mission League honors as a junior in 2006. Regarded as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Martin was ranked as the No. 44 offensive tackle prospect in the class of 2008, which was highlighted by Mike Adams and Matt Kalil. Martin originally committed to play for the UCLA Bruins. However, after getting cleared academically by Stanford University, he de-committed from UCLA and committed to the Cardinal on January 11, 2008. College career Martin as a Stanford Cardinal, 2011. At Stanford University, Martin majored in classics. As a redshirt freshman in 2009, Martin started 11 of 13 games at left tackle. He was one of two freshman starters on the offensive line, along with left guard David DeCastro. Despite its inexperience, the Cardinal offensive line allowed a Pac-10-low seven sacks on the year, enabling Stanford's freshman quarterback Andrew Luck to lead the conference in passing efficiency at 143.47. On the ground, Cardinal running back Toby Gerhart rushed for a school-record 1,871 yards and 28 touchdowns in 2009. Martin was an honorable mention All-Pac-10 selection and a second team freshman All-American by CollegeFootballNews.com. In his sophomore year, Martin started all games at left tackle and was named a first team All- American by Scout.com. Fellow linemen DeCastro and center Chase Beeler also received All-America recognition, as the Cardinal offensive line allowed just six sacks on the season, the second fewest in the FBS behind only Air Force. Quarterback Andrew Luck led the Pac-10 in passing efficiency for the second year in a row. As a junior, Martin again started all games and earned All- America honors by Scout.com and the Walter Camp Foundation. Professional career 2012 NFL Draft On January 3, 2012, Martin announced he was declaring for the 2012 NFL Draft. He was regarded as the No. 3 tackle prospect in the 2012 NFL Draft, behind Matt Kalil and Riley Reiff. He was projected to be a late-first or early-second round selection. At the 2012 NFL Draft, Martin was selected in round 2, with the 42nd overall pick by the Miami Dolphins. Despite playing mostly at left tackle in college, the Dolphins drafted him to play at right tackle. Miami Dolphins During his rookie season, Martin started at right tackle from the beginning of training camp and struggled early in preseason with giving up sacks and penalties. On October 2, Martin was fined $10,000 for illegal clipping. In December 2012, Martin was moved over to left tackle to take over for Pro Bowler Jake Long, who had been placed on injured reserve with a torn tricep. Martin had started the first 12 games of the season at right tackle, ranking 63rd out of the 69 NFL tackles who had played at least 300 snaps, according to Pro Football Focus‚Äô grading system. For the 2013 season, Martin was slotted at left tackle in order to replace Long, who had left in free agency, and was noted to struggle throughout the early part of the season in pass protection. On October 21, 2013, the Dolphins signed Bryant McKinnie to take over at left tackle, moving Martin back over to right tackle. The Miami Herald reported that the Dolphins were concerned about moving Martin due to the impact on him. Writing for the Herald, Armando Salguero reported \\"It was clear Martin isn't thrilled about the move. \\"You can approach this two different ways,\\" Martin said. \\"You can go in the tank and be one of those guys who bitches and moans and is a cancer in the locker room, or you can be a guy who goes out there and can be a professional and plays as hard as I can.\\" Martin stated he'll be the latter. On October 30, 2013, it was reported that Martin had left team facilities two days earlier, citing \\"emotional\\" reasons. It was initially reported that he had been mistreated by some teammates during lunch that day when they asked him to sit with them, but then promptly got up and left the table when he sat down. Martin was subsequently listed on the injury report with an unspecified injury and missed the Dolphins' game on October 31. It was later reported that during this period Martin had briefly checked into a hospital for emotional distress before flying to his parents' home in California, where he is \\"preparing a detailed document for his cooperation with a league investigation into a string of alleged multiple incidents he says led to his emotional distress and exit from the team\\". On November 2, it was reported that Richie Incognito's ring-leading role in the harassment of Martin dating as far back as the 2012 season was being reviewed by the NFL Players Association. On November 3, Incognito was suspended by the Dolphins for \\"conduct detrimental to the team.\\" The next day, it was reported that Incognito had sent numerous texts and voicemails making threats against Martin and Martin's family. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the most egregious of these exchanges was a highly graphic voicemail Incognito left in April 2013, in which Incognito called Martin a \\"half-nigger piece of shit,\\" threatened to slap Martin's mother across the face and even uttered a death threat against Martin. Until obtaining the tape from Martin's legal team, the Dolphins had publicly maintained the charges against Incognito were pure speculation. Schefter said that as late as the afternoon of November 3, the Dolphins didn't even know the voicemail existed. However, within hours of hearing the tape, Incognito had been suspended. On November 5, the Sun-Sentinel reported that the message that ultimately led to Incognito's suspension was made after Martin missed two days of the team's voluntary workout program. The coaches asked Incognito to help \\"toughen up\\" Martin and \\"get him into the fold\\". On November 11, a source close to Martin told ESPN's Lisa Salters that Martin was not willing to play for the Dolphins again, and planned to sit out the remainder of the 2013 season, which he did. In February 2014, a 144-page report by Ted Wells‚Äîan attorney hired by the NFL to investigate the scandal‚Äîfound that Incognito and fellow linemen John Jerry and Mike Pouncey \\"engaged in a pattern of harassment\\" toward Martin, another offensive lineman, and an assistant trainer. San Francisco 49ers On March 11, 2014, it was reported that the Dolphins had agreed to trade Martin to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for a conditional draft pick. Under the conditions of the deal, the Dolphins would receive a 2015 seventh round draft pick if Martin was on the 49ers' opening 53-man roster. With right tackle Anthony Davis out due to injury, Martin started the first game of the 2014 season with the 49ers against the Cowboys. On March 26, 2015, Martin was waived by the 49ers. Carolina Panthers On March 27, 2015, the Carolina Panthers claimed Martin off waivers. Retirement and later life Martin retired from the NFL on July 27, 2015, citing a back injury that would have made him miss the entire 2015 season. One month later, he posted a message to Facebook describing mental health struggles and suicide attempts as among additional factors in his decision to leave the sport. On February 23, 2018, Martin was taken into police custody following a post to his Instagram account with an image of a shotgun and a caption that read: \\"When you're a bully victim & a coward, your options are suicide, or revenge.\\" Following the post, which also mentioned his former high school, Harvard- Westlake School, the school shut down for the day.

Life Morfit was born in Herculaneum, Missouri on 19 November 1820 and was educated at the Columbian University in Georgetown (Washington, D.C.). Before graduating, he began to study chemistry in the laboratory of James C. Booth in Philadelphia. He assisted Booth in development of a new method of refining gold, and in 1850 was assigned a share of the patent rights. In 1853 he established a laboratory at Pikesville Arsenal in Maryland, where he investigated gun metal, co-authoring a report with James Booth on the subject for the United States Ordnance department. He was the first teacher at the chemical department of the Maryland Institute, and from 1854 to 1858 was professor of applied chemistry there. He then moved to New York City, where he continued to practice chemistry until emigrating to London in 1861. Morfit was a fellow of the Chemical Society of London and the Institute of Chemistry. His principal works were Applied Chemistry in the Manufacture of Soaps and Candles (1847); Chemical and Pharmaceutical Manipulations (1848); A Report of the Progress of the Chemical Arts, prepared with Booth for the Smithsonian institution (1851); Perfumery, its Manufacture and Use (1852-5); Oleic Soaps (1871); and Mineral Phosphates (1873). He and James Booth were co-editors of the Encyclopedia of Chemistry, and he wrote many other books and articles. Morfit died in London on 8 December 1897.

Born in Britchany, Bessarabia in what was the Tsarist empire, now Romania. He came to Palestine in 1929 where he joined kibbutz Sha'ar Ha'amakin, near Haifa. Four years later he was sent back to Romania as a Zionist youth movement organiser. He returned to Palestine in 1936 where a year later he was elected to the executive committee of Ha-kibbutz Ha'artzi and was involved in organizing political work in Haifa and illegal Jewish immigration. A talented and efficient organizer he was given the task of setting up Hakibbutz Ha'artzi's Arab Department. Party policy advocated an undivided and Socialist Palestine and to this objective he gave lectures and issued bulletins to party members advocating good relations with Arabs. In 1942 he pressed his party into joining the League for Jewish Arab Rapprochement and Cooperation. That year he joined the Histadrut's Arab Department which had a budget of ¬£P 1,800. He had been, and remained, sceptical of Histadrut policy of creating its own Arab trade unions rather than working with existing organizations.Lockman, Zachary. \\"Comrades and Enemies. Arab and Jewish Workers in Palestine, 1906-1948\\".University of California Press, 1996. . Pages 276, 288. In 1948, he became head of Mapam's \\"Arab Department\\". He was the author of \\"Our policy towards Arabs during the War\\" a Mapam policy statement endorsed by their Political Committee and distributed to all party workers on 15 June 1948. It opposed the expulsion of civilians and advocated a return of refugees after the war.Morris, Benny. 'The birth of the Palestinian refugee problem, 1947-1949.' . (1987). Pages 142,159,166. In the 1949 elections he supervised the Popular Arab Bloc, Mapam's party for Arabs, which failed to gain any support. In 1964 he published \\"Israel and the Arab World\\". An English translation was published in 1970. He argues that during the 1920s and early 1930s the British administration encouraged local resistance to Zionist activities.Cohen, Aharon (1970) Israel and the Arab World. W.H. Allen. . Page 196. He gives accounts of negotiations, some of which he was active in, with senior Arab figures from the second half of the 1930s up to 1945. He claims that these initiatives failed to make progress due to the refusal of the Jewish Agency to commit to any definite proposals. Referring to contacts made in 1943 he writes: \\"Advocacy of negotiations was ridiculed, even vilified. The Arab negotiators could not fail to note the indifference and even hostility with which the attempt had been received by official Jewish leaders and by the Jewish community.\\"Cohen. Pages 231-335. Quote page 312.

The Germans succeeded in capturing several individual forts but failed to breach the fortified Metaxas Line in general. The 2nd Panzer division (XVIII Mountain Corps) with an enveloping move crossed the Yugoslavian borders, overcame Yugoslav and Greek resistance and captured Thessaloniki on the 9th of April. The capture of Thessaloniki forced the Greek East Macedonia Army Section to surrender on the 10th of April and the Metaxas Line battle was over. German General Wilhelm List, commander of the German forces attacking Greece, admired the bravery and courage of these soldiers. He refrained from taking the Greek soldiers prisoner and declared that the army was free to leave with their war flags, on condition that they surrender their arms and supplies. He also ordered his soldiers and officers to salute the Greek soldiers (Beevor 2005, p. 20). At the time, the Metaxas line was poorly manned, as most of the Greek Army was involved in the Greco-Italian War on the Albanian front. Prelude Origins of the campaign The origins of the battle lie in the Italian invasion of Greece, which took place on 28 October 1940. The failure of the Italian Army to bring a favourable end to this Greek- Italian war, forced the Germans to intervene, with an operation they dubbed Operation Marita. For the purpose of the invasion of Greece, Germany tried to bring Greece's northern neighbours, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, to the Tripartite Pact alliance. Bulgaria agreed to allow passage of German troops for the attack on Greece, although Bulgarian troops would not participate in combat. Yugoslavia also agreed, but a coup overthrew the Yugoslav government. Although the pact was not denounced, Hitler decided to attack Yugoslavia as well as Greece. The Metaxas Line The fortification of the area informally known as the Metaxas Line was conceived as a defensive measure against Bulgaria. Bulgaria had refused to sign the Balkan Pact signed by Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey and Romania in 1934 which aimed at maintaining the geopolitical status quo in the region following World War I. The Metaxas Line was a series of independent forts along the Greek-Bulgarian border, built on possible routes of invasion. Each fort's garrisons belonged to the division or brigade which controlled the respective border sector. The fortifications were built with the meagre resources that Greece could muster, and exploited at fullest the terrain. Construction had begun in 1936; however, by 1941 the line was still incomplete. Opposing forces German The German unit detailed for the invasion of Greece was the 12th Army under Field-Marshal Wilhelm List, with a total of 15 divisions and other elements. Of those the XVIII and XXX Corps were to be used against Metaxas Line: XVIII Mountain Corps (Lt. Gen. Franz B√∂hme) *2nd Panzerdivision (Lt. Gen. Rudolf Veiel) *5th Mountain Division (Mj. Gen.

It reached number 3 on the Oricon singles chart. Composition Guitarist Sugizo cited \\"Rosier\\" as one of the songs wherein he tried to replicate the \\"psychedelic feel of shoegaze bands\\" by using effects, \\"like playing fast with a wah-wah pedal, or using tape-echo and harmonizers. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how they did it, so I just made it into my own thing.\\" The fast spoken English words in the middle of the song were written and performed by J. As a staple of Luna Sea concerts, J throws his mic stand over his head and behind his back after finishing his vocal part. This single version of \\"Rosier\\" is slightly different from the album's. An 8cm CD of a live version of the song was given away to winners of a magazine contest. Live versions also appear on the band's Never Sold Out and Never Sold Out 2 albums. Music video The music video for \\"Rosier\\" opens with the camera spiraling down on to a coffin, similar to the single's cover art, with roses on it covering the glass window at its head. The majority shows the band performing the song against a white backdrop with smoke flowing along the ground. Black and white and light blue filters were also used, as was slow motion. A dominant feature is the camera work; a crane takes the viewer over the band 180 degrees from the front of its members, ending upside down at their backs, the opposite is also seen. 360 degree shots around the band are also shown. Close-ups of the band members against a dark backdrop, separated from the camera by fluorescent lights, which provide the shots' only light, are inter-cut. During J's vocal part, the English lyrics appear flashing over the video in a typed font. Instead of ending with the English phrase \\"I'm the trigger\\" as heard on the released track, the video's audio fades out while it climaxes with a shot zooming in to the coffin's supposed glass window and a hand reaches out grabbing the camera. However, the phrase is viewable in the video as it is written in red on the white drumhead of Shinya's snare drum and as font during J's vocals.

Hit-testing may be performed on the movement or activation of a mouse or other pointing device. Hit-testing is used by GUI environments to respond to user actions, such as selecting a menu item or a target in a game based on its visual location. In Web programming languages such as HTML, SVG, and CSS, this is associated with the concept of pointer-events (e.g. user-initiated cursor movement or object selection). Collision detection is a related concept for detecting intersections of two or more different graphical objects, rather than intersection of a cursor with one or more graphical objects. Algorithm There are many different algorithms that may be used to perform hit-testing, with different performance or accuracy outcomes.

It contains tool assemblages from the Iron Age, the Bronze Age, the Neolithic and the Paleolithic. Because its deepest assemblage has been dated to 125,000 years ago, it was thought to be the world's most ancient settlement yet discovered of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa at the time of its discovery in 2011. Finds of a yet earlier date have since been found at Misliya cave in the Levant. The finds from excavations at Faya and surrounding digs are displayed at the Mleiha Archaeological Centre.  Site history  Excavations at Jebel Faya were first conducted between 2003-2010 by Simon J. Armitage, Sabah A. Jasim, Anthony E. Marks, Adrian G. Parker, Vitaly I. Usik, and Hans-Peter Uerpmann. Knut Bretzke, Nicholas J. Conard, and Hans- Peter Uerpmann also reported on the FAY-NE1 sequence after conducting excavations between 2009-2013. Additional excavations have studied the site's environmental and geologic context (see Bretzke et. al. 2013, Parton et. al. 2015, and Rosenberg et. al. 2011). Although Jebel Faya's Paleolithic-aged context has been more intensively studied, in 2013 Hans-Peter Uerpmann, Margarethe Uerpmann, Adelina Kutterer, and Sabah A. Jasim published findings on the Neolithic period at the site.  Findings   Site description  Jebel Faya is a limestone mountain outlier in the Central Region of the Emirate of Sharjah, measuring about long. The archaeological site itself is called FAY-NE1, a rock shelter located at the northeastern endpoint of Jebel Faya. Archaeologists have excavated several trenches at the site, with an area of over 150 meters2 excavated in total. It has a deep stratified sequence of archaeological levels, containing deposits from the Bronze and Iron Ages, the Neolithic, and the Paleolithic.  Environmental context  Paleolithic occupations at Jebel Faya have been linked to humid periods in southern Arabia, in which freshwater availability and vegetation cover of the area would have increased and supported human subsistence. In 2013, Bretzke et. al. analyzed sediment columns from trenches at FAY-NE1. While Assemblages A, B, and C showed evidence of vegetation, the layers lacking archaeological deposits showed evidence of desiccation. Additional studies of alluvial fan records and relic lake deposits in the region have supported this theory that humid periods may have offered multiple opportunities for human dispersal in southern Arabia.  Deposits  The Paleolithic layers at FAY-NE1 were first described by Armitage et. al. and were dated using single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). The horizons are as follows, from top to bottom: ; Assemblage A Dated to approximately 40,000 years ago. Recovered tools include burins, retouched pieces, end scrapers, sidescrapers, and denticulates. ; Assemblage B Not yet dated. Recovered tools resemble those of Assemblage A. ; Assemblage C Dated to approximately 125,000 years ago. Recovered tools include small hand axes, foliates, end scrapers and sidescrapers, and denticulates. Evidence of the Levallois production technique is unique to Assemblage C. Stone tools are thought to have been associated with Homo sapiens living in Africa at that time, and this shows that modern sapiens may have expanded Africa more quickly than thought. Paleolithic Assemblages D and E are also present, but have not been discussed in detail due to a small number of finds.  Neolithic levels  The Neolithic levels at FAY-NE1 consist of approximately 1 meter of sediment. A layer of sand above Assemblage A seals the Neolithic context from the Paleolithic. This layer contains Faya arrowheads and shell fragments, dated to about 9500 years BP. Hans-Peter Uerpmann and his colleagues attribute these artifacts to the first reoccupation of the site since its last abandonment in the Paleolithic. The layers above this sand level are less distinct and have not provided significant information about late Neolithic occupation. Jebel Faya, seen from the desert East of the range  Significance  Although no human fossils have been found at Jebel Faya, Armitage and others have argued that the Assemblage C artifacts, dated to 125,000 years BP, were produced by anatomically modern humans (AMH). This is because Assemblage C resembles contemporary east and northeast African technology more than the technology found at sites elsewhere on the Arabian peninsula. As a result, the evidence at Jebel Faya has been used to support the idea of an early dispersal of AMH from the Horn of Africa across southern Arabia and into southern Asia. According to this theory, modern humans dispersed out of Africa before the eruption of the Toba supervolcano 70-75,000 years BP. This claim is based on excavations at Jwalapuram in India by Petraglia et. al., who argue that assemblages found in pre- and post-Toba eruption layers indicate the continuous presence of AMH. For Petraglia and his colleagues, the presence of AMH at Jebel Faya 125,000 years ago could be evidence of an early dispersal route out of Africa, which humans could have followed to south Asia. However, there is strong opposition to this notion, as critics have argued that the Assemblage C evidence is not enough to confirm the presence of AMH from Africa. According to Paul Mellars, who believes that significant modern human dispersals did not occur until after the Toba eruption, ‚ÄúThere's not a scrap of evidence here that these were made by modern humans, nor that they came from Africa.‚Äù Studies about Jebel Faya's environmental context have indicated the potential for human dispersals out of Africa during humid periods in southern Arabia. These periods coincide with occupation at FAY-NE1, and depict activity at Jebel Faya as a cycle of occupation and abandonment according to the availability of water and vegetation. However, although these studies demonstrate the site‚Äôs attractiveness during humid periods, there is an ongoing debate about the identity of its occupants. Due to their dissimilarity from any other Middle or Late Stone Age assemblages, Assemblages B and A have been attributed to indigenous developments, which may indicate that Jebel Faya was inhabited continuously. However, this conclusion has been questioned due to genetic evidence of a more rapid dispersal of AMH out of Africa, meaning the Paleolithic assemblages may be the products of unrelated populations.

The film follows the story of one woman‚Äôs overwhelming faith in her talented but emotionally defenceless sister. The film starred Megan Follows and Amanda Plummer as the sisters and opera singer Teresa Stratas as their mother. (Paywall) Stratas won a Gemini Award as best supporting actress for her performance. (Paywall) The film is loosely based on the life experiences of Dolly and Henrietta Giardini. Sullivan had seen their story on an episode of 20/20 and was moved by the potential of it. Henrietta was born an autistic savant; though her mental/emotional faculties have never fully developed, she possesses an extraordinary gift for memorization and for music. The two sisters lives were crucial to each other's survival as Dolly was handicapped, born with a paralyzed arm. Synopsis The film is set in the 1940s and 1950s. Franny Basilio is determined to help her musically gifted autistic sister Rosetta have a life of her own. Their mother Regina, who gave up a promising career as an opera singer to raise her children, refuses to acknowledge Rosetta‚Äôs talent and believes she will never be capable of looking after herself. Franny vehemently disagrees with her mother, which has caused friction between them since she was a child. Eventually, Regina‚Äôs bitterness, ignorance and desire for acknowledgement of her own talent cause a rift between her and her daughters. Franny ultimately moves out of the house causing Rosetta to hurt herself in a desperate cry for help. Rosetta is hospitalized and assessed by doctors who recommend to Regina that her daughter be lobotomized for her own good. Franny must summon all of her courage in order to prevent her mother from allowing Rosetta to have the operation and be committed to an institution for the rest of her life.

Supreme Court of India Involvement in the NCPEDP The Rajiv Gandhi Foundation created the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People in 1995 and appointed Abidi as its director. Abidi collaborated with business executives from IBM, Apple Inc., Oracle Corporation, Cisco Systems, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard to employ disabled individuals in these companies and in the high-tech industry in general. In 2000, Abidi urged the Archaeological Survey of India to install wheelchair ramps at various prominent monuments, including the Red Fort, Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and Jantar Mantar. The impetus for the ramps was to accommodate Stephen Hawking while he visited these sites.

Prelude Port Toulouse was of strategic importance to the French because it was the closest settlement to the British occupied mainland Nova Scotia and it was the closest base to the Mi'kmaq. Mi'kmaq chiefs came to Port Toulouse annually for their alliance renewal with the French not only from √éle-Royale but also from the mainland. The two greatest ongoing royal expenditures in the southeastern corner of √éle-Royale had to do with maintaining the alliance with the Mi'kmaq and with keeping Port Toulouse defensible. The two were inter- connected. Port Toulouse was also the logical location for the French to launch attacks against the British at Canso. Port Toulouse was home to a garrison of 23 soldiers of the Compagnies Franches de la Marine. Port Toulouse was only one of two places on Ile Royale, outside of Louisbourg, assigned any kind of military capability.The other was present-day Englishtown, Nova Scotia. There were modest earthworks and a palisade at Port Toulouse. The approximately 200 Acadians who were there began vacating the village in the fall of 1744 after the French attack on Canso. Pierre Maillard led a mission of Mi'kmaq at St. Peter's during this time of about 80 families. Battle Closeup of plaque on monument in St. Peter's. The New England expedition set sail from Boston in stages beginning in early March 1745 with 4,200 soldiers and sailors aboard a total of 90 ships. The force was under the command of William Pepperrell of Kittery (in the portion of the Massachusetts colony that is now the state of Maine), and a fleet of colonial ships was assembled and placed under the command of Captain Edward Tyng. The force stopped at Canso to reprovision and there they were met by Commodore Peter Warren, enlarging the expedition by 16 ships. In late March, the naval forces began to blockade Louisbourg just as the ice fields were being swept from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the seas off Louisbourg. On May 2, Pepperell sent Jeremiah Moulton with 70 soldiers and two vessels to capture the fortified village of Port Toulouse. The New Englanders were only able to capture a single sloop and burn a few houses before being repelled by the French soldiers, Acadians and Mi'kmaq. They wounded three New Englanders when they were retreating.George A. Rawlyk. Yankees at Louisbourg: The Story of the First Siege, 1745.

The Acadians who escaped from Port Toulouse made their way to the Isthmus of Chignecto at Beaubassin and Quebec. The Acadians returned in 1749, after the war ended, to Port Toulouse in greater numbers. They were deported again after the second Siege of Louisbourg (1758).

Martial arts Bustillo began studying martial arts at the age of 8 with eskrima in his native Hawaii at the Gray YMCA Center in Palolo Valley, Hawaii under his father. He learned to box when he was 10 and competed in PAL boxing under the Veterans Boxing Club in Honolulu's Aala Park.Lumsden (2010) p.8-11 At the age of 14 Bustillo studied Kajukenbo with the Kempo/Karate Club of Waipahu until graduating from High School and moving to California to pursue a college education.

At age 24 Bustillo began his study of Jeet Kune Do under Bruce Lee at the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Los Angeles. In 1967, with training partner Dan Inosanto, Bustillo researched and studied the Filipino martial arts (kali, escrima, arnis) under Angel Cabales and other instructors. This began a revival of these arts with worldwide interest. In 1976, Bustillo was promoted by Sifu Inosanto to senior instructor level in Bruce Lee's Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do. In 1978 Bustillo studied Muay Thai and achieved the title Kru (teacher) in 1985 from Thailand's former Olympian and Muay Thai Champion Nanfa \\"Lot\\" (Chiridichoi) Satenglam.Lumsden (2010), p. 100 Bustillo taught Jeet Kune Do, Filipino martial arts, Boxing, Muay Thai, wrestling, mixed martial arts and other arts at his Torrance, California school, the IMB Academy.

Bustillo was a certified law enforcement defensive tactics instructor and a member of the American Society of Law Enforcement Trainers. Additionally, Bustillo was a member of the Search & Rescue Team of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and was a Reserve Peace Officer.Lumsden.(2010)pp.195‚Äì197 He continued to train with martial artists such as the Machado (Brazilian) Jujitsu USA Team. In addition, he was well known for promoting the Filipino Martial Arts. Bustillo was a founding member of the Bruce Lee Foundation and was the Jeet Kune Do Instructor to Bruce Lee's children, Brandon Lee and Shannon Lee. Legacy Together, with Guro Dan Inosanto, Bustillo is credited with generating worldwide interest in the study of Jeet Kune Do and Filipino Martial Arts. In 1976, Bustillo and Inosanto founded the Filipino Kali Academy in Torrance, California. Shortly after this school was founded, Bustillo became popular as a workshop instructor, even teaching Martial Arts to the Dallas Cowboys under coaches Tom Landry and Bob Ward with Dan Inosanto.Lumsden (2010), pp. 93‚Äì95 He founded the IMB Academy in Carson, California, in 1984.

Family and early life Born around 1700, Mary Lepell was the daughter of Brigadier-general Nicholas Wedig Lepell and his wife, Mary Brooke, daughter and co-heiress of John Brooke of Rendlesham, Suffolk. Her tombstone states that she was born on 26 September 1700; there is, however, some uncertainty about the date of her birth and the baptism registers state it was 16 September 1699.Kilburn (2004) Her father was born in Germany. While a page of honour to Prince George of Denmark, he married in 1698, and in the following year obtained an act of naturalisation. On 3 April 1705 he received a Commission to raise a new regiment of foot, and on 1 January 1710 was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general, before being appointed Supreme Commander of the British Forces in Spain, which position he held until 1712.Kilburn (2010) In 1715, through family connections, she was appointed a maid of honour to Queen Caroline. According to a letter written by the Duchess of Marlborough in December 1737, Mary was made a cornet by her father \\"in his regiment as soon as she was born ‚Ä¶ and she was paid many years after she was a maid of honour. She was extreme forward and pert, and my Lord Sunderland got her a pension of the late king George I, it being too ridiculous to continue her any longer an officer in the army.\\" Encomia At court Mary Lepell divided the honours for wit and beauty with her friend Mary Bellenden, subsequently the wife of Colonel John Campbell, who became the fourth Duke of Argyll. Pope and Gay sang her praises. William Pulteney, first Earl of Bath and Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth Earl of Chesterfield wrote a joint ballad in her honour to the tune of \\"Molly Mogg\\". Voltaire, another of her numerous admirers, addressed a copy of verses to her beginning with the lines: Hervey, would you know the passion You have kindled in my breast? which are the only English verse now extant of his composition. They were subsequently transcribed and addressed to one Laura Harley, the wife of a London merchant, by one of her lovers, and formed part of the husband's evidence in his proceedings for a divorce.Churton Collins, Essay on Voltaire in England, 1886, pp. 248‚Äì9 Even Horace Walpole, who became a correspondent of hers later in life, and in 1762 dedicated to her his Anecdotes of Painting in England, always spoke of her with the greatest respect and admiration.see Letters, v. 129 Her good sense and good nature won for her the esteem of the ladies as well as the flatteries of the wits. Marriage Her marriage with John Hervey, afterwards 2nd Baron Hervey of Ickworth, was announced to have taken place on 25 October 1720. It must, however, have occurred several months earlier (21 April 1720), as in a letter preserved at Ickworth, and dated 20 May 1720, Lord Bristol congratulates her on her marriage, which he calls a secret. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu records, in a letter written to the Countess of Mar, in July 1721, \\"the ardent affection\\" shown to her by Mrs Hervey and \\"her dear spouse\\". They had eight children: # Lady Mary Hervey (c. 1720‚Äì), married 31 October 1745 George FitzGerald of Turlough, County Mayo and had issue, including George Robert FitzGerald # Hon. George William Hervey, later 3rd Baron Hervey, later 2nd Earl of Bristol (1721‚Äì1775), died unmarried # Lady Lepell Hervey (15 April 1723 ‚Äì 11 May 1780), married 26 February 1742/3 Constantine John Phipps, 1st Baron Mulgrave, and had issue # Hon. Augustus John Hervey, later 3rd Earl of Bristol (1724‚Äì1779), died without legitimate issue # Hon. Frederick Augustus Hervey, later 4th Earl of Bristol (1730‚Äì1803), married 1752 Elizabeth Davers, and had issue (including Lady Elizabeth Foster) # General Hon. William Hervey (13 May 1732 ‚Äì 1815), died unmarried # Lady Amelia Caroline Nassau Hervey (1734‚Äì1814), died unmarried # Lady Caroline Hervey (1736‚Äì1819), died unmarried In spite of her husband's infidelity she lived with him on very amicable terms, and was an admirable mother to a large family of troublesome children, who inherited those peculiar qualities which gave rise to the well-known saying, ascribed to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu among others, \\"that this world consisted of men, women, and Herveys\\". She appears to have been always a warm partisan of the Stuarts. Though she suffered greatly from severe attacks of the gout, she retained many of the attractions of her youth long after her husband's death. Chesterfield, in a letter to his son dated 22 October 1750, directed him to \\"trust, consult, and to apply\\" to Lady Hervey at Paris. He speaks in the most admiring terms of her good breeding, and says that she knows more than is necessary for any woman, \\"for she understands Latin perfectly well, though she wisely conceals it\\". Death and legacy She died on 2 September 1768, aged 68, and was buried at Ickworth, Suffolk. The epitaph on her tombstone was written by Horace Walpole. Lady Hervey was a lively and intelligent letter writer. Her letters to the Rev. Edmund Morris, formerly tutor to her sons, written between 1742 and 1768, were published in 1821. Several earlier letters of hers written to the Countess of Suffolk are in the two volumes of Lady Suffolk's Letters, 1824. Two portraits of Lady Hervey are in the possession of the National Trust at Ickworth. Another, formerly belonging to the Strawberry Hill collection, painted by Allan Ramsay, was lent by Lord Lifford to the Exhibition of National Portraits at South Kensington in 1867. An engraving from a miniature, also formerly at Strawberry Hill, is in Walpole's Letters.

Its full name is Omai: or, a trip round the world Production The sets were designed by Philip James de Loutherbourg who took great care to try to make his depictions as authentic as possible by studying sketches made on all three of Cook's voyages and consulting with John Webber an artist who had sailed with Cook.Claydon & McBride p.274 The play was produced a year and a half after official Admiralty records of Cook‚Äôs final voyage were released and played a major part in the hero-isation of Cook.Claydon & McBridge p.273 Although much of its material was intentionally whimsical and inaccurate, it helped shape Western views of the Pacific Ocean and its inhabitants. It was first performed at Covent Garden Theatre in December 1785 an afterpiece to Nicholas Rowe's Jane Shore. Synopsis Omai, the heir to the throne of Tahiti, is due to marry Londina, the daughter of Britannia, which will symbolically join the two countries together. However Omai has a number of rivals, who wish to prevent the marriage and the union of the two countries. To escape them he and Londina embark on a voyage that takes them through various destinations visited by Cook including Kamchatka, Antarctica, New Zealand, Tonga and Hawaii.

It grows in shrubby and scrubby desert habitats, grasslands and prairie, woodlands, and other habitat types. It can be found among desert plants such as honey mesquite, smooth mesquite, ocotillo and creosote. Description Ziziphus obtusifolia is a shrub with many branches forming a thorny tangle which may exceed tall and approach at times. The leaves are deciduous and are absent for much of the year, leaving the shrub a naked thicket of gray twigs coated in waxy whitish hairs. The ends of the twigs taper into sharp-tipped thorns. The thick, glandular gray or green leaves have oval blades 1 or 2 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a cluster of several dull yellow-green flowers. The fruit is a mealy, juicy drupe containing one seed. The fruit provides food for many species of birds and mammals.

He is best known for his published account of the 1837-38 schism of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America entitled The Catastrophe of the Presbyterian Church.  Biography  The son of Zebulon, Sr. and Sarah Crocker, Zebulon Crocker was born and raised on a farm in Wellington, Connecticut. A strong student and educator, he taught in the vicinity of his hometown before entering Yale Divinity School, an opportunity that was intermittently interrupted by periods of serving as an instructor of the Ellington School of Mr. John Hall. Crocker graduated from Yale in 1831. After graduating from Yale, Crocker taught mathematics for a short time at the Ellington School before he was licensed to preach by the Hartford South Association of Ministers. Crocker then accepted a call to serve the Congregational Church in Middletown Upper Houses, now Cromwell. Ordained and installed there on May 2, 1833, Crocker remained at the Church, until his death in 1847. Crocker married Elizabeth Porter. They had no children. Crocker served as a delegate from the General Association of Connecticut to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in 1837, the infamous assembly at which five synods of the Presbyterian Church were exscinded, constituting a major schism. The following year, he published a 300-page historical account of the schism, The Catastrophe of the Presbyterian Church, in which Crocker discussed the controversies had led to excision of the synods. Citing the debate over the institution of slavery in America as a secondary cause of schism, Crocker focused on the relationship between New England Congregationalists and Southern Presbyterians, a relationship that had been formalized in the 1801 Plan of Union. The plan, largely designed to facilitate western expansion and evangelism in both the Congregational and Presbyterian churches, had prompted much controversy over a number of social, political, confessional, and theological matters. Crocker‚Äôs account, in many ways a defense of New England and New Haven position, also argues for the effectiveness of the plan for ‚ÄúThose that were organized under it, from the Hudson to the Mississippi, (who) appreciated its blessings.‚Äù He claimed that ‚Äúnot a murmur of complaint was uttered against it by those who had seen its operations, and experienced its effects.\\" Crocker noted three main reasons for the 1837 abrogation of the Plan of Union. First, it was unconstitutional since the General Assembly in 1801 had no right to ‚Äúform these important standing rules without the approbation of a majority of the presbyteries.‚Äù Second, that the General Association of Connecticut had no authority to act as a party in the agreement. Third, that ‚Äúmuch confusion and irregularity have arisen from this unnatural and unconstitutional system of union.‚Äù Elucidating upon this final reason, Crocker notes ten specifications that ultimately demonstrate why the Plan of Union, according to the General Assembly of 1837, ‚Äúhas had the slow but inevitable effect to subvert the order and discipline of the Presbyterian Church.\\" Regarded as an authoritative account of the 1837-38 schism, Crocker's work was regarded as \\"valuable and lucid\\" by his contemporaries.

She wrote choral, orchestral and chamber works, music for films and radio-dramas, electro-acoustic works, as well as music for children. She has won numerous awards for her music for children. Biography Ludmila (Lida) Frajt was born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia into a family of musicians. Her father Jovan (Jan) Frajt, born in 1882 in Plzen (nowadays in Czech Republic), settled in Serbia in 1903. He worked as a violinist, organist, conductor, composer and music publisher. He founded a publishing house Edition Frajt in Belgrade. After his death in 1938, his son Stevan Frajt, also a musician, continued to run this family business. Ludmila Frajt received her first music lessons at home; then she attended the Belgrade Music School, where one of her teachers was Josip Slavenski. In 1938 she enrolled to study composition at the newly founded Belgrade Music Academy (nowadays Faculty of Music), with Miloje Milojeviƒá. Her studies were interrupted by the World War II. After the country was liberated, she resumed her study. However, her professor Milojeviƒá died in 1946, and therefore she graduated with Josip Slavenski as the first female graduate in composition. (Another prominent Serbian female composer, Ljubica Mariƒá, was educated in Prague). Aside from their professional relationship, Frajt and Slavenski also developed a close personal friendship, with Slavenski and his wife Milana Iliƒá serving as witnesses at Ludmila Frajt's wedding to Mile Franoviƒá. Unfortunately, Franoviƒá was killed at the Syrmian Front, only three years after they got married. After this tragedy, the young widow never remarried. From 1946 to 1952, Ludmila Frajt was Head of the Music Department at Avala Film; from 1952 to 1958 she was a Deputy Music Editor at Radio Belgrade; and then, from 1958 until retirement, she was the Secretary of the Music Committee of Yugoslav Radio-Television (–à–†–¢) in Belgrade. Aside from composing, she was also involved with ethnographic research, and she avidly collected archaic folk instruments. She died in Belgrade, aged 80. Personal style Initially, Frajt's style revolved around a combination of impressionistic sound world, inspired by French composers, and her desire to study and utilise the deepest layers of folklore. This desire was identified and cultivated during her studies with Milojeviƒá and Slavenski. After World War II, instead of succumbing to the official demand to write music in accordance with the doctrine of Socialist Realism, Frajt turned to studying Serbian folklore. However, her compositions from this period are not based on quotations of folk music. In 1960s and 1970s Frajt studied and assimilated the latest compositional techniques of the European musical avant-garde ‚Äì in particular, aleatorics, the idea of 'open-work' and various multimedia experiments. She mixed and merged these with her already established interest in folklore, rituals and antiquity. Her tendency to employ unusual, quasi- archaic instruments and naturalistic sound effects is notable; some of her works are scored for instruments such as folk pipes, silver spoons and children's toys. Ludmila Frajt is a pioneer of female writing in the domain of Serbian music. Her discourse is characterised by its chamber qualities, lyricism and subtlety, which can be seen both in the choice of genres and performing forces, and in her compositional procedures. Furthermore, she was fascinated with a female voice (both in solo and choral settings), and she often wrote 'female' vocal genres such as lullaby and threnody. She died of natural causes in Belgrade.

Houling was born in Wexford about 1539, and entered the Society of Jesus in 1571, being professed of the four vows. He seems to have been at Alcal√° de Henares in 1578, at Rome in 1580, and at Lisbon in 1583. At Lisbon he laboured successfully for many years in the conversion and edification of such of his countrymen as either commerce or persecution brought to that port. In 1593, with the aid of Father Peter Fonseca, he established in that city a college dedicated to St. Patrick and the education of young Irish Roman Catholics. In 1599 Lisbon was visited by the plague, and, while administering to the physical and spiritual wants of its inhabitants, he fell a victim to its ravages, and died on 31 December 1599. He was highly esteemed by Fitzsimon and Coppinger. Houling wrote 'Perbreve compendiium in quocontinentur nonnulli eorum qui Hybernia regnante impia Regina Elizabeth, vincula, exilium et martyrium perp?essi sunt,' printed from a manuscript at Salamanca by Cardinal Moran in 'Spicilegium Ossoriense,' i. 82-109.

The committee is headed by Ramiz Hasanov. History In 1906, when Azerbaijan was part of Russian Empire, the authorities established a test point No. 25 in Baku. The chamber of 4 people were in charge of checking and branding decimal scales and weights. In 1909, the first check point of electric meters in the empire was established in Baku. In 1926, the Soviet Azerbaijani authorities instituted mandatory checking of electric meters which were installed throughout the country. Due to developing petroleum industry in Azerbaijan, the need for precise data attracted more attention of authorities and usage of measuring gauges increased. In 1931, Standardization Bureau was established for checking and approving of length and weight measuring devices and new laboratories were opened throughout the country. In 1966, Standardization Committee was opened and functioned under the jurisdiction of the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR. A big lab in Ganja and 39 temporary check points were a part of the committee. In 1970, the committee was re-organized and became Azerbaijan SSR Body of Gosstandard of the USSR. After restoration of independence of Azerbaijan, standardization and metrology in the republic was being regulated by the Standardization and Metrology Center of the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan (AzGOST) established in 1992. On December 27, 2001 President Heydar Aliyev signed a decree No. 623 establishing State Agency on Standardization, Metrology and Patents (AZSTAND). On November 19, 2008 the agency was transformed into the State Committee on Standardization, Metrology and Patents according to Presidential Decree No. 53. Structure Main functions of the committee are carrying out state policies of standardization, metrology, certification and protection of objects of industrial property; preparing and implementing state programs; conducting research on metrology and standardization; organizing protection of objects of the industrial property; updating documents in the sphere of standardization, metrology, certification to increase the competitiveness and quality of goods and services produced in Azerbaijan; ensuring state control over the compliance of imported and exported goods and services to the requirements of standards, metrological rules and norms, rules of certification and protection of industrial property objects, accreditation of testing centers. Azerbaijani standards are registered by AZSTAND and bear the abbreviation AZS. The regional standards (GOST) adopted by the Interstate Council for Standardization and Certification of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) are also used.  Targets  The main goal of the committee is achieving national standardization sysytem which qualifies to the international requirements through improving safety, quality and comparativeness of the products and increasing export potential in the country. There are a number of targets in order of achieving this goal: * Providing free movement for the products and services. * Elimination of the unnecessary barriers in international trade. * Improving competitiveness of the products, services and human resources both in domestic and foreign markets. * Reducing production costs on goods through saving resources. * Improving quality of the products, service level and the competence of human resources. * Preparing qualified standards for the efficient use of innovations in the production of high-tech goods. State Committee on Standardization, Metrology and Patents cooperates with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), European Standardization Committee (CEN) in order to improve standardization in Azerbaijan.  International Relations  Following the declaration of independence of Azerbaijan, the Committee of Standardization and Metrology and Patents carries out cooperation with several international and regional organizations. Azerbaijan has been a member of Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) since 1992. During the year the committee carries out intergovernmental relations with member countries and exchanges experiences with organizations of the member countries which deal with standardization. Azerbaijan has joined to eight conventions, agreements and treaties of the World International Property Organization (WIPO). * The Convention on Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization * The Paris Convention on the Protection of Industrial Property * The Cooperation Treaty Patent * The Madrid Agreement relating to the International Registration of Marks * The Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedure * The Locarno Agreement on Establishing an International Classification for Industrial Design * The Strasburg Agreement on International Patent Classification * The Nice Agreement on International Classification of Goods and Services for Registration Marks Since July 1, 2003 the committee has been a member of International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Located in the southeastern part of Bulgaria, it is the furthest southern point of Burgas Bay. The cape projects about 4 km into the Black Sea and is the furthest eastern point of the Saddle Mountain Beach. It ends as a north-south peninsula about 3 km wide. The cape features a steep, rocky coast. Viewed from the river Ropotamo, Maslen Nos recalls the outline of a lion's head. A chapel called Sveti Nikola, is located on the cape. Two miles north from Maslen nos is Cape Karaultasch. File:Primorsko_location_in_Bulgaria.png|Map File:Strandscha_Balkan_topo_de.jpg|Map2 File:Maslen_nos_Bulgaria_1994_CIA_map.jpg|Map3 File:Maslen nos.jpeg|Aerial  History  Maslen Nos featured a settlement that existed during the Hellenistic period. Owing to the sharp rocks in the cape, Maslen Nos was notorious for ships that were wrecked there. The cargo of these ships consisted mainly of Amphorae, containing olive oil, confirmed by archaeological exploration, hence the name Maslen Nos (maslo = fat, oil; nos = nose, cape). During the Ottoman Empire over this region (present-day Bulgaria) the cape was called Zeytin Burnu (\\"olive-bay\\" in Turkish). It was also referred to as 'olive oil' and 'to oil'. This is not to be confused with the Zeytinburnu district in Istanbul. In some older atlases, it was incorrectly labeled Cape Maslen Nos, which translates into English as 'cape oily bay'. Lighthouse Because of its exposed location, the cape was recognised as a navigational menace from ancient times. A bulletin of the lighthouse authority found in Istanbul on 6 December 1863 requests the coordinates of a constant red lighthouse on the cape to be recorded. The height of the light above the sea level was said to be 10 metres and was visible at 6 nautical miles (NM). The Julius Pintsch Company built a new lighthouse in 1930 on the cape, which remains in service. The lens is illuminated by a gas flame. The lighthouse is located 7 km north of Primorsko. The light is positioned 37.5 m above sea level. It has a range of 17 NM. It sends three white Flashes (duration 0.4 seconds, ) with a break between them of four, four, and eight seconds. The lighthouse is a round stone tower with a gallery, painted white, 6 m high (with the pedestal for the light at 7.5 m). The optics have to be manually turned on and then are rotated by a motor (a small gas engine running on coal gas before 25 July 1932 and acetylene gas thereafter. The lighthouse is home (one room with kitchen) to a lighthouse keeper. In the small bay south of the cape, 500 m from the lighthouse is a small quay built of concrete. It was used to supply the lighthouse with fuel and food stocks as the lighthouse was often completely cut off, especially in winter.  Fog bell  South of the lighthouse, a 3m high square stone platform was built in 1937, on which a bronze fog bell was installed, to warn ships in foggy weather. The clockwork drive mechanism for the bell was housed in the stone. It had to be wound manually and the bell then rang for two hours. In 1961, the lighthouse was part of a Bulgarian and Romanian Black Sea coast modernization program in which a power line was fed to the lighthouse and it became one of six radio beacons in the area: Cape Kaliakra, Snake Island, Sveti Georgi, Constanta, Cape Emine and Cape Maslen Nos. Beginning in 1961 the beacons operated 24-hours per day, sending the identification letters \\"MN\\". In 1968, an electric Optics M-300 was installed. The old equipment was preserved and has been on display since 1977 in the Marine Museum at Warne (Bulgarian –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –º—É–∑–µ–π –í–∞—Ä–Ω–∞). In a small bay just southwest of the Cape, a Bulgarian underwater archeology expedition in 1960, led by Ivan Galabow (Bulgarian –ò–≤–∞–Ω –ì—ä–ª—ä–±–æ–≤), surveyed the bay. Their findings showed that dating from the 6th century BC, small ships sought refuge there. Relics from the Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages (5th to 14th century) were found there. Ropotamo River The mouth of the Ropotamo river is 5 km northwest of the cape. Roman remains believed to be the ancient city of Ranuli. The river cuts through the slopes of the mountains from its source and winds through the Ropotamo Nature Reserve. Maslen Nos and other parts of the peninsula have been inhabited since ancient times. In the area of the cape is the Thracian sanctuary Begliktasch (Bulgarian –¢–∞—à –ë–µ–≥–ª–∏–∫), first discovered in 2003, 200 m inland from the cape. Fauna Many snakes are found on the cape. Near the cape is a hard-to-reach cave whose entrance is accessible only by boat. It is inhabited by about 3,000 Long-eared and mouse eared bats). A rock called \\"Ostrak\\" (oyster), because it was once a thriving oyster colony has no more living oysters.

In particular, the two signals are considered as being random processes. For applications, the two original signals need have a limited frequency range, and these are used to modulate a third sinusoidal carrier signal whose frequency is above the range of frequencies contained in the original signals. Details The random modulation procedure starts with two stochastic baseband signals, x_c(t) and x_s(t), whose frequency spectrum is non-zero only for f \\\\in [-B/2,B/2].

The station is served by two Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) services, the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) light rail Orange Line, and VTA and AC Transit buses. The elevated Montague light rail station opened in June 2004. It was renamed Milpitas in December 2019 when the bus plaza and connecting footbridge were opened. The below-grade BART station, constructed as part of the Silicon Valley BART extension, opened in June 2020 along with a parking garage. History The BART station under construction in 2015 The VTA Light Rail station opened as Montague station on June 24, 2004, as part of the Tasman East expansion, originally without any parking spaces. The BART station is the northern of two stations constructed as part of the $2.3 billion phase I of the Silicon Valley BART extension, which broke ground in 2012. The complex was built by and is owned by the VTA. Opening was delayed repeatedly from its 2016 completion date. In December 2019, the VTA and AC Transit bus station opened, while the light rail station was officially renamed from Montague to Milpitas. An official ribbon cutting for the BART station was held on June 12, 2020, with service beginning the next day on June 13, 2020. A -long footbridge is under construction to cross Montague Expressway on the north side of the station. Construction of the $19.33 million bridge, which connects to the second level of the garage, began in 2019; it is expected to open in February 2021. Station layout alt=See caption The Milpitas station complex is located near the intersection of East Capitol Avenue and the Montague Expressway, near the south border of Milpitas. The BART tracks run roughly north-south in a trench below street level, with two -long side platforms. The station building is approximately , with an undulating roofline and three large circular skylights. Entrances are on the east and west sides of the station building, near its southern end, leading to a central corridor. Fare control areas are on opposite sides of the corridor; both have stairs and escalators to the platform, with elevators in the north fare control area. The BART station features stained glass windows by BJ Katz and Chris Klein, titled Ethos of Imagination, above the main entrance. Twenty support columns along the platforms are encased in ceramic tiles by Amy Trachtenberg, titled Ecstatic Voyaging, patterned after the ikat dyeing technique. The light rail tracks are elevated above East Capitol Avenue, running approximately northwest-southeast. A mezzanine is located under the single island platform, with stairs and an elevator to the median of East Capitol Avenue at South Milpitas Boulevard. A pedestrian bridge leads from the west side of the BART building (with escalators and an elevator) southwest to the light rail mezzanine. The bus plaza is located west of the BART station building. It is served by nine VTA bus routes (20, 44, 47, 60, 66, 70, 71, 77, and 104) and one AC Transit route (217); it serves as a transfer point between the two bus systems. It is the only BART station served by both VTA and AC Transit buses, and the only VTA light rail station served by AC Transit buses. The six-story, 1,631 space paid parking garage is located east of the BART building. A paid 185-space indoor bike parking structure is located underneath the footbridge; free bike racks are dispersed around the station.

The transit center opened for local bus service on December 28, 2019, and subsequently for BART service on June 13, 2020. The station was built and is owned by VTA, while BART operates train service to the station with funding from VTA. The bus bays and parking garages are operated by VTA. It is the first BART station ever built in San Jose, and service will terminate here until the completion of the downtown San Jose subway (the last phase of the Silicon Valley BART extension). Station layout VTA route 523 bus at Berryessa Berryessa/North San Jos√© station has a elevated island platform, with a fare lobby under the center of the platform. An adjacent seven-story garage and surface lot have a combined 1,527 parking spaces, while a bike station is located under the north end of the platform. The site is adjacent to the San Jose Flea Market. The Berryessa Transit Center, a two-lane bus transfer facility, is located adjacent to the north end of the station. It is served by VTA Bus routes 61, 70, 77, 500, and 523. The Rapid routes 500 and 523 provide limited-stop connections to Downtown San Jose; route 500 also serves Diridon station. The station features a cast bronze sculpture by Larry Kirkland, titled LIFE!, outside the main BART entrance. The sculpture depicts a wheel made of various items from daily life being rolled by a human figurine. History The station's ribbon-cutting ceremony on June 12, 2020 This station is the southern of the two stations built as part of an extension from Warm Springs/South Fremont. The extension, known as Phase I of the Silicon Valley BART extension, broke ground in 2012 with completion initially expected in 2016 but delayed several times. VTA received a $900 million grant for federal funding for the $2.3-billion Silicon Valley Extension in 2012. Additional funding was provided by Measure B, a half-cent sales tax passed by Santa Clara County voters in 2016; the Road Repair and Accountability Act, passed by the California Legislature in 2017; and $125 million from the Federal Transit Administration in 2019 under a fast- track funding program. In 2017, at the request of the San Jose City Council, the station was renamed from Berryessa to \\"Berryessa/North San Jos√©\\" to \\"alert riders ‚Äì commuters and tourists alike ‚Äì that they have arrived in the Capital of the Silicon Valley\\". On June 11, 2020, a group of Silicon Valley politicians proposed to have the station officially renamed as the \\"Ron Gonzales Berryessa Station\\" after Ron Gonzales, former mayor of San Jose, who began advocating for a Silicon Valley BART extension in 1989 while serving as a Santa Clara County Supervisor. BART station naming guidelines would likely discourage such a renaming. An official ribbon cutting for the BART station was held on June 12, 2020. Berryessa/North San Jos√© and Milpitas stations opened for revenue service on June 13, 2020.

It would be located north of East Santa Clara Street between North 28th Street and U.S. Route 101, behind Five Wounds Portuguese National Church. Preceded by the Berryessa/North San Jose BART station, it would be the first station of the Phase II portion of the Silicon Valley BART extension. The station would have direct service to Santa Clara, Richmond, and San Francisco/Daly City. In planning, the station was referred to as Alum Rock/28th Street, after the Alum Rock neighborhood to the northeast. History A separate extension was built from Fremont to Warm Springs station in the Warm Springs District (also in Fremont). This was followed by phase I of the Silicon Valley BART extension into eastern San Jose, built by VTA. The entire San Jose/Santa Clara extension, including Alum Rock station (as it was referred to at the time), was originally intended to be built in a single project, but funding could not be secured; therefore, the San Jose extension was split into two phases, and Alum Rock was placed in the second phase. On November 7, 2019, VTA renamed the station to 28th Street/Little Portugal in response to community feedback. If funding is secured, construction is slated to begin in 2020, and open to passenger service in 2029‚Äì2030.
