Part of the school is built on the site of a thirteenth-century Dominican Friary (Blackfriars, Thetford), which may have been built on, and incorporated parts of, a Norman cathedral.Channel 4, Time Team: Thetford, Norfolk, 17 January 1999, accessed 18 Aug 2009 This building, now known as \\"Old School\\", comprised the entire school for about 300 years, and is where the lawyer Roger North and the political activist Thomas Paine were educated. In 1998 archaeologists from the television programme Time Team excavated at the school for three days in search of the Norman cathedral of Herbert Losinga, which was only located at Thetford for twenty years or so, before relocating to Norwich. They did not find any Norman stone building, perhaps because the short-lived cathedral was a re-used Anglo-Saxon wooden church which has not survived. The school developed rapidly in the 1880s, and in 1888 Thetford Grammar School for Girls was built alongside the existing Grammar School. The school became a Voluntary controlled school in 1944, and remained in the state sector until 1981 when it regained its independent status. The original boys' school and the girls' grammar school merged in 1975 to form a new coeducational school.

Early life During his school and college years, Agarwal was the sports ambassador. He studied Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee before graduating in 1974. He moved to Mumbai, where he initially started work as an engineer but quit his job to begin his acting career. Career Due to his somewhat intimidating appearance, caused by a tumor near his pituitary gland, Agarwal starred in Hindi films and television as demonic/ghostly characters or villains in general. He most notably worked with the Ramsay brothers, first starring in their film Purana Mandir as Samri, then as the vampire Nevla in Bandh Darwaza and once again as Samri in Saamri. He also featured in two Hollywood films; playing a supporting antagonist in Stephen Sommers' 1994 live action adaptation of The Jungle Book and later briefly appearing in Such a Long Journey. And in 1994, when he was approached by Shekhar Kapur for the role of Babu Gujjar in Bandit Queen, it was a defining moment as he got the right opportunity to demonstrate his versatility as an artist.

The surname originated from Ansar tribe, The Medinan People who helped the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, in his migration from Mecca to Medina. They were the first tribe in Arabia to accept Islam. The literal meaning of Ansar is \\"supporter\\". In North India, the community are known as Ansari or sheikh, while in Maharashtra the community are known as Momin or saudagar The community are found throughout India, but Varanasi District, in Uttar Pradesh, is always regarded by most Momin as the centre of their community. In that city, the Ansari are said to make up a third of the city's population. Important Ansari neighbourhoods in the city include Madanpura, Adampura and Jaitpura.The Artisans of Benaras Popular Culture and Identity, 1880h-1986 Orient Longman  History  The Ansaris of North India are mainly a landlord community, but some are small- and medium- scale farmers. They have always been connected with the textile work. Many members of the community have entered private or government service. Their relationship with the Sadh community is of some importance, as they supply the Momins with the cotton cloth used for printing.K. S. Singh, People of India Uttar Pradesh, Volume XLII Part Two. Manohar Publications The Ansaris do not have any traditional social councils, but have an India-wide community organization, the All India Momin Conference. They are an endogamous community, only rarely marrying out of their group. There is no system of clans, and cross and parallel cousin marriages are common. The Ansaris are Muslims of the Sunni sect. Historically, the community produced the sage, scholars and philosopher. The Ansari are an Urdu-speaking community, although the Ansari clan of Gujarat have Gujarati as their mother tongue.  In Bihar  The Ansari community is found throughout Bihar and Jharkhand. In Bihar, they are found in all the districts. They are active in politics. Their socio- economic condition has constantly improved. They play active roles in all walks of life in Bihar. In Jharkhand, they are mainly found in Koderma, Hazaribagh, Gumla, Ranchi, Lohardaga and Singhbhum districts. They speak the Sadri dialect, which is distinctive to the community, although most have knowledge of Urdu. The community is endogamous, and marry within a close kin group. Like other Ansaris, they were historically into the textile work, although most of them are medium- and small-scale farmers. The Momin Conference was founded in Bihar, and the Bihar Ansaris have played a key role in the organization.People of India Bihar Volume XVI Part One edited by S Gopal & Hetukar Jha pages 70 to 74 Seagull Books  In Gujarat  In Gujarat, there are two distinct communities commonly known as Momin, the native Gujarati-speaking Garana Ansari, and the immigrant Ansari community, originally from North India. The Garana Ansari community in Gujarat are found mainly in the districts of Junagarh, Ahmedabad, Surat and Kutch. They speak Gujarati with substantial Urdu loanwords. In addition to membership in the Momin Conference, the Gujarat Ansaris also have their own clan association, Garana TitaFari Jamaat. The traditional occupation of the Ansari is still textile work. Many of them are engaged in zari work, which involves sari embroidery. This is especially the case in the towns of Jamnagar and Dhoraji, which each have traditional quarters inhabited by the Ansaris. Most Surat and Ahmadabad Ansari are now employed in the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited clerk post, and local textile mills.R.B. Lal, P.B.S.V. Padmanabham, G. Krishnan & M. Azeez Mohideen (eds), People of India Gujarat Volume XXI Part Two The Shaikh Ansari are an Urdu-speaking community, and are said to have immigrated from Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh some three hundred years ago. In Baroda, they were invited by the ruling dynasty to help in the construction of public buildings from Rajasthan. The Shaikh Ansari are divided into four endogamous groups, the Bijnor Ansari, originating from the city of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh; the Ganga Parvala, originating from the village of Gomtipur and its surroundings in Uttar Pradesh; the Delhiwala, originally from Delhi; and the Pratapgarh Ansari originating from the city of Pratapgarh and surrounding areas in eastern Uttar Pradesh. They are mainly distributed in the cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Bharuch, Baroda, and Rajpipla. Textile working was the traditional occupation of the Ansari, and at present those in Ahmadabad still engage in this activity. Many Ahmadabad Ansari are now power loom owners. But many Shaikh Ansari have also diversified, and now own hotels and bakeries. They are among the more successful Muslim communities in the state, having made the transition from their traditional occupation to becoming successful businessmen. The level of literacy is steadily increasing, and many Ansari are now graduates. The Ansari have no traditional clan association, but are members of the All India Momin Conference. Historically, each of the four sub- divisions would have had their own informal clan association, headed by a chaudhary. These have all but disappeared.  In Rajasthan  The Ansari of Rajasthan claim that they were once warriors, who, after a defeat, took to the occupation of weaving. They are also known as Deswali Shaikh, and speak the Madri dialect, which is a mixture of Urdu and Hindi. They are one of the larger Muslim communities in Rajasthan, and re found in the districts of Tonk, Jaipur and Sawai Madhopur. The Ansari are strictly endogamous and practice both parallel and cross cousin marriages. Their main occupation is weaving, and they use both hand-held and power looms. Quite a few are now involved in tailoring and the manufacture of bidis, a local cigarette. The Rajasthan Ansari are members of the Moin Conference, as well as having local informal clan councils, which deal with inter community disputes, while the Momin Conference acts as a pressure group dealing with the state government. The Ansari are Sunni, and have provided many of the Ulema in Rajasthan.B. K. Lavania, D. K. Samanta, S. K. Mandal & N. N. Vyas (eds.), People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part One, Popular Prakashan  Momin of Maharashtra  The Momin of Maharashtra are also known as Ansari or saudagar They are descended from immigrants from North India. They are split into two groupings, the giyara gaonwala and the bais goanwala. The former are found in Ahmadnagar, while the latter are found near Pune. The Momin were historically a community of weavers, found mainly in the towns and cities of western Maharashtra. They are found mainly in the districts of Pune, Nasik, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Jalna, Osmanabad, Dhule, Nagpur, Thane, Kolhapur, Raigarh, parbhani and Nanded. The community speak Urdu, but the Momin are bilingual, speaking Marathi as well. They are strictly endogamous, and tend to marry close kin. The Momin are Sunni, and are a fairly orthodox community. Their traditional occupation was textile work, and many Momin have set up handlooms. Those Momin who have set up powerlooms tend to be more successful. Many Momin are employed by other Momin in these powerlooms; this is especially the case in the towns of Bhiwandi, Malegaon and Nagpur. A significant number are also employed in the textile industries. The Momin are largely an urban community, with only small number found as agriculturists. Many Momin are now successful entrepreneurs and professionals such as teachers, engineers and doctors. Like other Ansari communities, the Momin are members of the All-India Momin Conference, one of the oldest Muslim organizations in India. This organization acts as a welfare organization, as well as lobbying on behalf of the community.B. V. Bhanu, B. R. Bhatnagar, D. K. Bose, V. S. Kulkarni and J. Sreenath (editors), People of India Maharshtra, Volume XXX Part Two  Pakistan  After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, many members of the Momin Ansari community migrated to Pakistan and settled mainly in the Sindh province. The Momin Ansari is mainly settled in Karachi and Hyderabad cities of the Sindh province. The Momin Ansari lost their distinct group identity as they assimilated and are now an integral part of the Urdu-speaking Muhajir community of Pakistan. In Wazirabad Toor is also a sub cast of Ansari.  Notable people  Governor *Wazir Khan (Lahore) also known as Nawab Wazir Khan was the governor of Lahore at the time of Mughal emperor Shah jahan.

It has concurrencies with SC 80 and SC 14\\\\. The truck route begins at an intersection with the SC 101 mainline at that highway's intersection with SC 80 (J. Verne Smith Parkway) in the southern part of Greer, which is in the southwestern part of Spartanburg County. This intersection is just north of the Greenville‚ÄìSpartanburg International Airport. SC 80 and SC 101 Truck travel to the southwest, skirting along the southern edges of the city. They travel through rural portions of the city, just to the west of the airport. Just past an intersection with the southern terminus of Poplar Street Extension, they enter the east-central part of Greenville County. Just before an intersection with the southern terminus of Old Highway 14 South (a former portion of SC 14), they curve to the west and leave the airport area.

Here, SC 80 reaches its western terminus, and SC 101 Truck turns right to follow SC 14 north to the north-northwest. Immediately, they temporarily leave the city limits of Greer. They curve to the northeast and begin a curve back to the north-northwest. At an intersection with the southern terminus of SC 14 Truck (South Buncombe Road), they re-enter the city. This intersection leads to Greenville Technical College's Benson Campus, North Greenville University, and Prisma Health Greer Memorial Hospital. They curve to the northeast and intersect the eastern terminus of West Road and the western terminus of Roscoe Road, where they leave the city limits again. A short distance later, they re-enter the city for the final time. At an intersection with Donaldson Avenue, they begin a curve to the north-northwest. After a slight bend to the north-northeast, they travel on a bridge over some railroad tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway. Then, they cross over some railroad tracks of CSX.

It is a member of the only active duty Special Operations Civil Affairs unit in the United States Department of Defense. The concept for a Civil Affairs brigade had been under consideration for years, but was finally approved as a result of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review. Tracing its lineage to a military government group that was active after World War II, the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) was not officially activated until 2006, and remained a provisional unit until 2007. Its creation was part of a US Army plan to increase Civil Affairs units, and Special Forces units overall. The brigade is a direct reporting unit of the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne), and as such, is airborne qualified. The 95th CA BDE (SO) (A) commands five geographically aligned civil affairs battalions: 91st, 92nd, 96th, 97th, and the 98th, geographically aligned to Global Combatant Commands (GCC) - AFRICOM, EUCOM, CENTCOM, INDOPACOM, and SOUTHCOM, respectively and under the operational control of the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) - SOCAFRICA, SOCEUR, SOCCENT, SOCPAC, and SOCSOUTH, respectively. Today, SOF Civil Affairs operators are versatile, innovative, and highly trained Soldiers who operate in small, autonomous teams among local populations, in hostile or denied territory. Specially assessed, selected, and trained in foreign languages, cultural expertise, and negotiation techniques, SOF CA Soldiers commonly operate in civilian clothes in over 80 different countries worldwide to build networks of formal and informal leaders and accomplish important missions in diplomatically and politically sensitive areas.  Organization  The 97th Civil Affairs Battalion is directly subordinate to the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade Command based at Fort Bragg. The battalion commands six subordinate companies all headquartered at Fort Bragg along with the battalion Headquarters and Headquarters Company: The 97th Civil Affairs Battalion (Special Operations) (Airborne) is the only active component Civil Affairs asset available to the United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM). Its lineage and structure extend back to the formation of those small groups of uniquely trained and qualified individuals who constituted the Allied Military Government of the Occupied Territory, or AMGOTs.  Training Pathway  The Civil Affairs Qualification Course (CAQC) is a 48 week course and is constantly improving to meet the needs of military commanders. Civil Affairs Assessment and Selection (CAAS) is a 10-day rigorous selection process and serves as a tool for cadre to only select the best for SOF CA. Currently, the CAQC consists of four phases: CA MOS Training (11 weeks), SOF Skills (10 weeks), CULEX - Operation Sluss-Tiller (3 weeks), and Language Training (24 weeks). For officers, 1LTs and CPTs must first complete the SOF Captain Career Course prior to starting MOS phase. All CA Soldiers are airborne qualified. Once Soldiers have graduated from the CAQC they receive orders to one of the battalions under the 95th CA BDE (SO) (A) or to the 83rd CA BN (conventional unit that falls under the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, NC). Civil Affairs personnel within the 83rd CA BN are all SOF trained professionals, and are the only conventional active duty CA unit in the Army. Common individual training pathways for new CA Soldiers will, at a minimum, include Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE-C), advanced negotiations training, advanced driving courses, and medical training (TCCC). Innumerable other training opportunities and courses are available for CA personnel.  Civil Affairs Team (CAT) and Civil Military Support Element (CMSE)  The CAT is a 4-person element who train for various mission sets under a specific training pathway. The typical CAT is composed of a Team Leader (CPT), Team Sergeant (SFC), Special Operations Combat Medic (SSG), and a Reconnaissance NCO (SSG). Civil Military Engagement (CME) is U.S. Special Operations Command‚Äôs (USSOCOM) contribution, and part of DOD‚Äôs strategy, to building partner nation capacity in a preventive, population-centric, and indirect approach to enhance the capability, capacity, and legitimacy of partnered governments. CME is implemented by Civil-Military Support Element‚Äôs (CMSE) planning and activities which seek to build indigenous capabilities in numerous fields across the civil and military sectors. Examples include medicine, public health, civil- military cooperation, education, human rights, humanitarian assistance/disaster response (HA/DR), disaster risk reduction, civic engagement, and post-conflict stabilization, or other training and events requested by partner governments and security forces. The CMSE is sourced by a Special Operations Force (SOF) Civil Affairs (CA) Team. CMSEs conduct planned and targeted civil reconnaissance and civil engagement within the operational environment in support of Geographic Combatant Command (GCC) campaign plans, the Theater Special Operations Command (TSOC) campaign support plan, and in conjunction with U.S. Embassy strategies and objectives.  History   Origins  Originally designated as the 97th Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, Military Government Group, the unit was activated on 25 August 1945 at the Presidio of Monterey, California to help capture Army Civil Affairs expertise gained during World War II. The unit served in various theaters until 25 January 1949, when, while located in Korea, it was inactivated. In November 1961, the unit was re-designated the 97th Civil Affairs Group and allocated to the Regular Army. The formal activation ceremony took place on Okinawa, on the 15 December 1961. The unit was stationed on Okinawa until it was inactivated in June 1969. The personnel and equipment from the old civil affairs group were used to form the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion. On 16 September 1992, 97th Civil Affairs Group was re- designated as the 97th Civil Affairs Battalion. Through the demonstrated need for specially trained, culturally aware soldiers, the 97th Civil Affairs Battalion was placed in a Provisional status on 1 September 2006 as a part of the growth of Active Army Civil Affairs from 96th Civil Affairs Battalion to the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade and four regionally-oriented battalions.  Activation  The 97th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) was activated on March 16, 2007. Called upon to support both conventional and special operations units, the battalion has a tradition of maintaining a high state of readiness and support to a wide range of contingencies. Today, 97th Civil Affairs Battalion personnel operate in countries across the globe.  Deployment  The 97th Civil Affairs Battalion (Special Operations) (Airborne) has been deployed worldwide in support of Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Philippines, Operation Pacific Eagle - Philippines, Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom and is the only persistently deployed active duty Civil Affairs element within the USINDOPACOM AOR. The battalion has suffered casualties which were rehabilitated through the Wounded Warrior program.

Lloyd Osborne was writing the script and Hubbard wanted Henry Hathaway do direct. Paramount were going to make the film as one of its two color movies for the season. By April Paramount had decided to revert to the story's original title and Ray Milland had joined the cast with Hathaway to direct. Then Oscar Homolka, at the time best known for playing a role in Rhodes of Africa, signed a four-year contract with Paramount and was given a lead role in Ebb Tide. Barry Fitzgerald and Lloyd Nolan rounded out the main cast. Henry Hathaway was delayed on shooting Souls at Sea so he was replaced as director by James Hogan. Filming started June 1937. Island scenes were shot at a specially- constructed village on Catalina Island. Over one hundred Polynesians were used. The film was shot in color at a time when that was rare.

They are either sacra privata or publica. The former were undertaken on behalf of the individual by himself, on behalf of the family by the pater familias, or on behalf of the gens by the whole body of the people. Sacra privata The centre of the domestic service of the gods is formed by the worship of the Penates and Lares. In particular cases recourse was also had to certain specified deities. Besides this, private sacra were attached to particular families; these passed to the heir with the succession and became a burden on him. Hence an inheritance without sacra [hereditas sine sacris] proverbially signified an unimpaired piece of good fortune. If a patrician wished to become a plebeian he had to renounce his familial sacra, his gens and his curia. As the family had sacra, so also had the gens, which had arisen out of the family by expansion. These were performed by a sacrificial priest flamen appointed from among the gentiles, the celebration taking place in his own house or in a special sacellum in the presence of the assembled gentiles. Sacra Privata typically takes place within the family. An individual might perform sacra at any time and whenever they thought it necessary; but if he vowed such sacra before the pontiffs and wished that they should be continued after his death, his heirs inherited with his property the obligation to perform them, and the pontiffs had to watch that they were performed duly and at their proper time. Even though Sacra could take place at any time, however, the devout Roman prayed and made a sacrifice typically during meal times. The usual time was between dinner and dessert. When possible, a pig was sacrificed. Proper ceremonies accompanied all family occasions from birth to death, even when the gods were no longer popular. The gens of families had special rites, sacra. It must be maintained for the welfare of the clan and State. If not, it was believed that gods will become displeased with the pater familias. In return, their supposed underworld relatives, the malicious and vagrant Lemures, might be placated with midnight offerings of black beans and spring water. For home sacrifices, citizens would usually use foods instead of animals because they were less messy. However, it was not unheard of. Many families would use small animals for their blood sacrifices. Some foods that they would use were wine, cheese, fruits, milk, honey cakes, honeycombs, and grapes. Families would also use incense, fire, or wreaths if they wanted a sacrifice that was more permanent. Romans would use sacrifices that represented life. If their ancestors became angry, they would placate them with an offering of black beans and spring water at midnight. Lares, a household protector, was housed in a shrine along with the penates and favorite gods or goddesses. In the homes of the lower class, the shrines were set in wall-niches with a basic painted background, whereas the upper class, built their shrines in the servants quarters. This kept the focus on religion instead of making it a public showing. Sacra publica The sacra publica were undertaken pro populo, i.e., collectively, (1) by the curia, pagi, or vici, into which the community was divided, whence such sacrifices were called sacra popularia; or (2) by the individual gentes and societies, i.e., the sodalitas, to which the superintendence of a particular cult had been committed by the State; or (3) by the magistrates and priests of the Roman State. The sacra of the gentes were with few exceptions performed in public, though the multitude present remained silent spectators; only in a few cases they took part in the procession to the place of worship or in the sacrificial feast. The public religious practices of Ancient Rome served multiple purposes due to the nature of its religion. In ancient Rome, religion and the affairs of the state were closely intertwined so that the state religion was a mode of political power.Gordon, Richard. \\"The Veil of Power.\\" Paul and Empire Religion and Power in Roman Imperial society. Ed. Richard A. Horsley. Harrisburg: Trinity Press International, 1997. 126. Print. Religious rituals and festivals were often held in order to calm and distract the people. This can be seen through the establishment of the Apollinares around the time of the Second Punic War.Scullard, H. H. Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1981. Print These public affairs were meant to honor the gods by either consisting of sporting competitions, such as the Apollinares, or religious rituals. When these rituals consisted of sacrifice, they were controlled by the Emperor and the ElitesAngus, S. The Religious Quests of the Graeco-Roman World. New York: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, 1929. Print. The correct practice of rituals, or orthopraxis was essential to currying favor of the gods.Schied, J. (2008) \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (ed J. R√ºpke), Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Oxford, UK. doi: 10.1002/9780470690970.ch19 Public ceremonies were presided over by some sort of authority from the higher social class over public affairs, and in some rare cases specifically women. The presider would begin the ceremony at the start of the day and bathe himself or herself thoroughly beforehand. Any civilians in attendance would wear togas with a hood over their heads while the presider was bareheaded, often with a laurel wreath on his head for distinction. In live sacrifices, only domestic animals were used. These animals were cleaned and often decorated with ribbons or garlands with colors dependent on the god or goddess for whom they were intended.Faraone, Christopher A., and F. S. Naiden. \\"Greek and Roman Animal Sacrifice: Ancient Victims, Modern Observers.\\" University of Iowa Libraries. Cambridge University Press, 2012. Web. 19 Nov. 2013 The Romans would also use fruit and grains in public ceremonies as well as libations or drinks. These inanimate sacrifices were not less significant than live animal sacrifices, but rather they all served different purposes and went to different deities.

Allotments can be purchased for a specific period of time such as a whole season, part of a season or for any single dates and then resold to travel partners and final customers around the globe. A couple of days prior to carrier departure/hotel check-in any unsold seats/rooms may be released back to the supplier if such an agreement exists between the two parties. An allotment release back period is also negotiated as part of the allotment contract (e.g. four days prior to check-in/departure). Negotiating allotments Allotments can be negotiated between a tour operator and a travel service supplier such as airline company/hotel chain, or between two travel organizers such as a tour operator and a retail travel agent. Either way the buyer needs to prove a consistent level of business, because allotments are hardly granted without any previous sales history. Rooms or seats that have not been contracted between the travel company and the product supplier are handled as ‚Äòon-request‚Äô, where each booking of an airline seat or hotel room needs to be confirmed with the supplier before being confirmed with the client. The allotment or allocation contract The amount of the contracted rooms/seats to be specified in the allotment contract is a result of the estimated, during the negotiation, volume of sales to be realized by the tour operator. Tour operators book a certain number of rooms in hotels or seats on carriers and have the right to use them by a given date, also known as a release date, that usually is some days prior to tourist's arrival (hotels)/departure (carriers). The allotment contract reduces the risk of any unsold products by the supplier and grants relative price advantage to the travel organizer helping him to stay competitive on the market by offering extra discounts. Tour operators obtain discounts, through allotment or commitment contracts, primarily depend on the firm size and the bargaining power exercised; they can vary from 10% to 50% according to the period of the year, the destination, the quantity and quality of services contracted upon. Some big tour operators are able to obtain up to 70% of discount.

As the residence of Barrington King who, along with his father Roswell King, was the founder of the town of Roswell, in northern Fulton County, Georgia. The house was designed by Willis Ball. It was held by the family until 1995 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ranked as one of the \\"50 Most Beautiful Homes in Metro Atlanta\\" by Atlanta magazine, the mansion has been fully restored and furnished with many period and family pieces. It is owned and operated as a house museum by the City of Roswell. A variety of events for families are held at the mansion and on the grounds throughout the year, as well as daily tours of the house. History Roswell King was born in Connecticut but settled in Darien, Georgia. He worked for the Bank of Darien and was asked to manage the bank's interests in the gold fields of north Georgia. He came across this area in the late 1820s and was impressed with its beauty, while realizing the water power potential of Vickery Creek to drive textile mills. In 1836 he returned to the area with his son Barrington and they began planning the mill and the town. Barrington moved his family to the area in 1838, and in 1839 the Roswell Manufacturing Company was incorporated. The Kings invited friends to move to the new town they called the ‚ÄúColony‚Äù and invest in the Roswell Manufacturing Company. Some of these families included the Smiths, the Bullochs, and the Dunwodys. The Colony was named Roswell, for Barrington King's father, in 1854. Barrington King selected the highest point in Roswell for his home, Barrington Hall. It was built by Willis Ball in the Greek revival style of architecture. When the house was finished in 1842, Barrington lived in it with his wife, Catherine, until his death in 1866. The Kings had nine children who survived to adulthood: eight sons and one daughter. In 1883 the Kings‚Äô only daughter, Eva and her husband, Rev. William Baker, moved back to Barrington Hall to care for the elderly Catherine King. The Baker family lived at Barrington Hall until Eva's death in 1923. William Baker had died several years before in 1906. After Eva's death, the house and property was left to Evelyn Simpson, Eva Baker's favorite granddaughter, and Eva's seven children. The other heirs wanted to sell the house, but Evelyn was determined to keep it in the family. With the help of her mother Kate Baker Simpson and other family members, Evelyn raised enough money to purchase the house from the other Baker siblings. With limited money and the help of her sister Katharine, Evelyn Simpson preserved Barrington Hall until her death in 1960. Upon Evelyn's death, her sister Katharine Simpson became the owner of Barrington Hall. She left her teaching job in Atlanta and moved to Barrington Hall to manage it on a full-time basis. In 1970 Katharine met a woman named Lois Carson; they became good friends and Katharine adopted her, so that she would inherit Barrington Hall after Katharine's death. Katharine died in 1995, just before her 100th birthday. Lois Carson continued to live at Barrington Hall until her death in 2003. Before Carson died, she entrusted Barrington Hall to her friend Sarah Winner. The new owner, Sarah Winner, spent two years restoring the property. She had all of the original furnishings and paintings restored. Craftsmen also painstakingly restored the horse-hair plaster walls, ceilings, heart-of-pine floors, and moldings. Her efforts won the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation's Outstanding Restoration Award. In 2005 she sold the property to the City of Roswell, with legal agreements designed to ensure the home would be permanently protected and open to the public for historic, educational, and cultural purposes. Present The historic home is now owned and operated as a house museum by the City of Roswell. Located in the Historic Roswell Square on Barrington Drive, it is open for tours. Monday through Saturday, the first tour is at 10 am and the last tour is at 3pm. On Sunday the first tour is at 1 pm and the last tour is at 3 pm. The home has been fully restored and furnished with many original family possessions. The surrounding seven acres of grounds feature the only antebellum public garden in the greater Atlanta area.

Known by its acronym NIMBioS (pronounced NIM-bus), the Institute is a National Science Foundation (NSF) Synthesis Center supported through NSF's Biological Sciences Directorate via a Cooperative Agreement with UT-Knoxville, totaling more than $35 million over ten years.  Background  The Institute opened in September 2008, with additional support from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=112167&org;=NSF&from;=news.htmlhttp://www.nature.com/news/2008/080903/full/455011a.html Since March 2009 when NIMBioS programs officially began, more than 5,000+ individuals from more than 50 countries and every U.S. state have participated in various research and educational activities.  Goals  Primary goals of NIMBios are: *to address key biological questions using cross-disciplinary approaches in mathematical biology *to foster the development of a cadre of researchers who are capable of conceiving and engaging in creative and collaborative connections across disciplines. To achieve its goals, NIMBioS advances a wide variety of research and outreach/education activities designed to facilitate interaction between mathematicians and biologists to arrive at innovative solutions to environmental problems. Two primary mechanisms for research are Working Groups and Investigative Workshops. Working Groups are composed of 10-15 invited participants focusing on specific questions related to mathematical biology. Each group typically meets at the Institute two to three times over the course of two years. Investigative workshops may include 30-40 participants with some invited by organizers and others accepted through an open application process. Workshops are more general in focus and may lead to working group formation. NIMBioS also provides support for post-doctoral and sabbatical fellows, short-term visitors, graduate research assistants, and faculty collaborators at UT.  Function  One area of particular emphasis at NIMBioS has been modeling animal infectious diseases, such as white-nose syndrome in bats, pseudo-rabies virus in feral swine, Toxoplasma gondii in cats, and malaria from mosquitoes. As a leading international center for animal infectious disease modeling, NIMBioS has contributed significantly to global needs in analyzing the potential spread, impact and control of diseases that can move from animals to humans, such as West Nile virus, anthrax, swine flu and mad cow disease. NIMBioS also collaborates with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to develop methods of particular interest for natural area management that are transferable to numerous U.S. locations. NIMBioS encourages multidisciplinary participation in all its activities. Participants at NIMBioS have included behavioral biologists, ecologists, evolutionary biologists, computational scientists, anthropologists, geneticists, psychologists, bioinformaticians, mathematicians, statisticians, veterinarians, epidemiologists, and wildlife biologists. NIMBioS has an active Education and Outreach program geared toward learners of all ages, from elementary school students through college and graduate school and the general public. NIMBioS organizes a Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates and Teachers program for eight weeks each summer. Participants live on campus and conduct research in teams with UT professors, NIMBioS researchers, and collaborators on projects at the interface of math and biology. NIMBioS also hosts the annual Undergraduate Research Conference at the Interface of Biology and Mathematics each fall, featuring student talks and posters as well as panel discussions. Programs for graduate students include the Visiting Graduate Student Fellowship offering training and research visits for up to several months by graduate students interested in pursuing research with NIMBioS senior personnel, postdoctoral fellows or working group participants. NIMBioS provides varying levels of tutorial workshops designed to enlighten biologists about key quantitative methods, such as optimal control and optimization or high performance computing methods for analyzing biological problems involving large data sets, spatial information, and dynamics.  Director  NIMBioS‚Äô director is Louis J. Gross, Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology and Mathematics at the UT. NIMBioS leadership team also includes associate directors and a deputy director. NIMBioS has an external Board of Advisors from academic institutions from around the world. In addition, NIMBioS has a group of senior personnel consisting of UT faculty and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) scientists, as well as a group of additional associated faculty and staff collaborators from UT and ORNL.  Research  The need for the Institute arose out of the significant growth of the field of mathematical biology over the last decade with research becoming more closely linked to observation and experiment. Rather than starting from mathematical abstractions, it is now common for researchers to: 1) Begin with observations; 2) Use those to suggest promising methods, tools and models; and 3) Proceed to analysis, simulation, evaluation and application. Across the spectrum of the life sciences in which mathematics has been contributing new insights, data are increasingly used to focus conceptual models as the first step in problem formulation.  Website description  The NIMBioS website includes descriptions of working groups, investigative workshops, post- doctoral fellowships, sabbaticals, short-term visits, graduate assistantships, and faculty positions and information on how to submit requests for support. The web site also describes education and outreach opportunities for undergraduates, teachers, and K-12 students. The web site also has an extensive video library including interviews with visiting scientists, full- length seminars tutorials, and workshops, and short narrative science features.  Sponsorship  From 2010 to 2012, NIMBioS, in conjunction with the UT's James R. Cox Endowment Fund, sponsored a Songwriter-in-Residence Program to encourage the creation and production of songs involving ideas of modern biology and the lives of scientists who pursue research in biology. A total of five songwriters were supported. Each songwriter created and produced a minimum of two songs as a result of his or her four-week residency.

Address format  The format in Malaysia generally follows this order: Name, street number, street name, region, postal code and town/city, state. The name of town or city is actually the name of the post office which is responsible for managing the incoming mail, not the municipal name (even though by writing the municipality, the address can still be understood, provided that the correct postcode is given). For example, addresses in Simpang Pulai in Perak should be written as \\"Kampung Kepayang\\", even though Kampung Kepayang is now a ghost town. This is simply because the incoming mails are handled by the Kampung Kepayang post office which has moved to Simpang Pulai. However, there are also some people who write \\"Simpang Pulai\\", \\"Ipoh\\" (which is the nearest city and also the municipality) or even \\"Kinta\\" (the district or daerah in Malay\\"). Another example is the writing of addresses in Chemor, which is under the Ipoh City Council, yet their addresses are written as \\"Chemor\\" instead of \\"Ipoh\\". This is because they have their own post office to handle their incoming mails, which also covers Kuala Kuang, Kanthan, and Klebang. One more example is the addresses of certain places e.g. Pandan Indah, Bukit Lanjan, Taman Melawati, etc. These belong to Selangor state, but their addresses are written as \\"Kuala Lumpur\\", because they fall under the Kuala Lumpur post office.

Ecology and Social System of the Japanese badger, Meles meles anakuma (Carnivora; Mustelidae) in Yamaguchi, Japan. Ph.D Thesis, Yamaguchi University. The torso is blunt and limbs are short. The front feet are equipped with powerful digging claws. The claws on hind feet are smaller. The upper coat has long gray-brown hair. Ventral hair is short and black. The face has characteristic black-white stripes that are not as distinct as in the European badger. The dark color is concentrated around the eyes. The skull is smaller than in the European badger. Origin The absence of badgers from Hokkaido, and the presence of related M. leucurus in Korea, suggest that the ancestral badgers reached Japan from the southwest via Korea. Genetic studies indicate that there are substantial differences between Japanese and Asian badgers, which were formerly considered conspecific, and that the Japanese badgers are genetically more homogenous. Habits Like other members of Meles, Japanese badgers are nocturnal and hibernate during the coldest months of the year. Beginning at 2 years of age, females mate and give birth to litters of two or three cubs in the spring (March‚ÄìApril). They mate again shortly afterwards, but delay implantation until the following February. Japanese badgers are more solitary than European badgers; they do not aggregate into social clans, and mates do not form pair bonds. During mating season, the range of a male badger overlaps with those of 2 to 3 females. Badgers with overlapping ranges may communicate by scent marking. Habitats These badgers are found in a variety of woodland and forest habitats. Folklore In Japanese mythology, badgers are shapeshifters known as mujina. In the Nihon Shoki, mujina were known to sing and shapeshift as other humans. Diet Similar to other badgers, the Japanese badger's diet is omnivorous; it includes earthworms, beetles, berries and persimmons. Threats Although it remains common, the range of M. anakuma has shrunk recently. Covering an estimated 29 per cent of the country in 2003, the area had decreased 7 per cent over the previous 25 years. Increased land development and agriculture, as well as competition from introduced raccoons are threats. Hunting is legal but has declined sharply since the 1970s. In 2017, concern was raised by an upsurge in badger culling in Kyushu. Apparently encouraged by local government bounties and increased popularity of badger meat in Japanese restaurants, it is feared the culling may have reached an unsustainable level.

The CFOA was the busiest railway in the Ottoman Empire and was one of the two railways operating into ƒ∞stanbul, along with the Chemins de fer Orientaux. The Baghdad Railway (ƒ∞stanbul-Aleppo-Baghdad) connected with the CFOA at Konya to allow rail transport from ƒ∞stanbul to the Middle East, although the Baghdad railway wasn't completed until 1940. The CFOA serviced major cities such as ƒ∞stanbul, ƒ∞zmit, Adapazarƒ±, Bilecik, Eski≈üehir, Ankara, K√ºtahya and Konya. The railway also operated the Port of Haydarpa≈üa and the Port of Derince. The railway was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Soci√©t√© du Chemin de fer Ottoman d'Anatolie, created on 8 October 1888 by the Deutsche Bank to operate the railway. History Ottoman Government Railways (1871-1888) The Ottoman Government, under the reign of Sultan Abdulaziz, started building a on the Asian side of ƒ∞stanbul, from Haydarpa≈üa to Pendik in 1871. The line was opened on September 22, 1872. The railway was extended to Gebze, which opened on January 1, 1873. In August 1873 the railway opened to ƒ∞zmit. The railway was built to serve a populated area along the Marmara Sea. The railway was then to be extended to Ankara and Mesopotamia. The line proved difficult to manage so in 1880, 60% ownership of the line was transferred to a British company. A narrow gauge extension of the railway was built to Adapazarƒ± the same year. The company could not finance the extension of the line to Ankara, so the company formed an Anglo-American syndicate under the leadership of Sir Vincent Caillard to complete the line. The syndicate still could not pull up the money needed to complete the line, so the company withdrew. Chemins de Fer Ottoman d'Anatolie (1888-1927) Bond of the Soc. du Chemin de Fer Ottoman d'Anatolie, issued 3. August 1893; the proceedings from this bond were used for building the Eski≈üehir-Konya extension. A steam locomotive made by J. A. Maffei, Germany for the Anatolian Railway. With the construction of the line to Ankara put on hold, the Ottoman government looked for a new company to build the line. Georg von Siemens, the managing director of the Deutsche Bank was informed on the project, as well as Alfred von Kaulla, who was in ƒ∞stanbul to handle the export of the Mauser rifle to the Ottoman Army. After some tension, the Deutsche Bank won the concession to build the line. The original concession was for 99 years, which later became 114 years to match the Baghdad Railway. The Deutsche Bank created a subsidiary company, Soci√©t√© du Chemin de fer Ottoman d'Anatolie that was incorporated on October 4, 1888 as the parent company of the railway. The CFOA subcontracted the building of the line to Philipp Holzmann. The CFOA started building the line to Ankara in May 1889. The CFOA completed the line to Arifye in 1890 and opened it on September 1, 1891. The line was opened to Ankara on December 31, 1892. In 1893 the Ottoman government granted the CFOA with a concession to build a line from Eski≈üehir to Konya. The line was to branch from the ƒ∞stanbul-Ankara main line at Eski≈üehir, to Alayunt, Afyon, Ak≈üehir and Konya. A branch line from Alayunt to K√ºtahya was also to be built. The line was opened to Alayunt and K√ºtahya on December 30, 1894. The CFOA opened the line to Afyon on August 4, 1895 and Konya on July 25, 1896. In 1899, the CFOA was granted another concession to build a line to Bolu and later ƒ∞smetpa≈üa. The CFOA started construction and on November 1, 1899 opened a branch line from Arifye to Adapazarƒ±. However, the tracks never reached Bolu. In 1904 the Baghdad Railway was incorporated to continue the line from Konya, through Adana and Aleppo to Baghdad. This would provide a direct rail link between ƒ∞stanbul and Baghdad. However World War I halted the construction of the line. The Ottoman Empire joined with the Central Powers against the Allied Powers. Non-German owned railways in the Empire were placed under Turkish military administration, but the CFOA, being mostly German owned, was unaffected except that civilian passenger traffic was suspended. It played a vital role carrying war materials to the fronts in Palestine and Mesopotamia, with Germany supplying a large number of locomotives and wagons. After the end of the war and the Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the CFOA came under British military control. On 22 February 1920 British authorities handed control of most of the railway to Atat√ºrk's Turkish nationalist government in Ankara, but in 1921 the majority of the line was lost by the nationalists to Greek forces. After the Greek defeat at Sakarya, they destroyed much of the railway's infrastructure as they retreated back to the coast. The CFOA was under full Turkish control by September 1923 and the war against Greece ended a month later. Despite being in control, the Turkish government was not the legal owner of the CFOA due to the company being headquartered in Switzerland, a neutral country in the war. On March 3, 1924 the Chemins de fer d'Anatolie Baghdad was created to operate CFOA lines until the Turkish government nationalized the line.E. Talbot, \\"Steam in Turkey\\", Oxford, 1981, page 17. The CFOA was absorbed completely by the CFAB, later TCDD on June 1, 1927. Operations Passenger Service The CFOA operated many passenger trains on their lines. Their main line was between ƒ∞stanbul and ƒ∞zmit. The CFOA also operated the first passenger train between ƒ∞stanbul and Ankara; this was a daily train that entered service in 1892. The most common steam locomotives for passenger trains were the class 33001.TCDD Steam Locomotives - Trains and Railways of Turkey Freight Service The CFOA's primary operation were freight trains. The CFOA mainly focused on transporting grain from central Anatolia to the ports in ƒ∞stanbul. The CFOA also played a big role in the construction of the Baghdad Railway, by transporting goods from ƒ∞stanbul to Konya to help built the tracks. The CFOA owned and operated 2 major ports; the Port of Haydarpa≈üa and the Port of Derince. Most freight trains would load or unload at these ports. Ports The CFOA operated ports along with railways. Their main port was the Port of Haydarpa≈üa in ƒ∞stanbul. This port exported most of the goods transported by the railway. With the heavy usage of the port, the equipment wasn't enough to support the traffic. The CFOA had difficulties to extend the port, so in 1897, the railway built a new port in Derince near ƒ∞zmit. This port had a grain elevator to export grain from central Anatolia. The port of Haydarpa≈üa was finally extended in 1899. The Turkish State Railways acquired the ports in 1927.

Beatrix Lehmann's portrayal of the housekeeper whose services she inherits comes from the Judith Anderson school of performing...and her creepy portrayal is one of the best things in the movie. There are also a couple of charming (and brief) musical sequences, one of them breaking the tension at just the right moment as the thriller's plot winds tighter.

Jef Labes has also arranged for string and woodwind instruments on numerous albums. Career Labes started his recording career with the Boston-based Apple Pie Motherhood Band, playing piano and organ on the albums Apple Pie & Motherhood (1968), composing four of the tracks himself and Apple Pie (1969), this time composing one track. The band split up later in 1969 and would not make another album. In the same year Labes moved to Woodstock to join Van Morrison as a live musician. At this time Labes had been shown the music for three songs off Morrison's \\"classic\\" album Astral Weeks in the studio, and was recording with the band Morrison had used for the album. All these musicians were replaced in the summer of 1969, leaving only Labes. The new musicians, along with Labes, were used for the recording of Morrison's third solo album Moondance. In an interview with Clinton Heylin, Labes points out the inconvenience of recording in New York for the album: \\"We lived in Woodstock. So any time we did a session, we'd drive down a hundred miles and then we'd drive back.\\"Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence?, p.237 Labes left Morrison's band shortly after the release of Moondance to move to Israel for a couple of years.Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence?, p.238 In 1971 Labes recorded with Jonathan Edwards and appeared on his self entitled debut album Jonathan Edwards. In Lindsay Planer's allmusic review of the album, Labes is praised for his \\"rural-flavored piano licks\\" and the \\"definite sense of drama\\" he brings to the album. In 1972 both Labes and Edwards joined Orphan on their album Everyone Lives to Sing. After this association with Jonathan Edwards, Labes returned to Van Morrison's band, playing piano and writing string arrangements for his seventh studio album Hard Nose the Highway, released in 1973. He is also credited on the album as assistant producer. Morrison had recently assembled an eleven-piece band for his concerts, The Caledonia Soul Orchestra, which Labes had joined to play piano and organ in early 1973, replacing the previous keyboard player James Trumbo. The band included the string section Labes had arranged for on Hard Nose the Highway, so he was asked to arrange string parts for some more of Morrison's songs for the live performances. The double live album It's Too Late to Stop Now was released the following year of highlights from three concerts in the summer of the tour. After the tour ended Morrison dismantled the band and Labes was, this time, replaced by Trumbo. Although he was not touring with Morrison, Labes was asked to play on two tracks on Morrison's next studio album, Veedon Fleece, whilst his string and woodwind arrangements were dubbed onto most of the other recordings on the album. In 1975 Labes was invited to play synthesizer and write arrangements for the former bassist of The Caledonia Soul Orchestra, David Hayes, on his album Logos Through a Sideman. Also in 1975 Labes played keyboards for Bonnie Raitt on her album Home Plate and for her next studio album Sweet Forgiveness released in 1977. A year later Labes joined the American singer‚Äìsongwriter Jesse Colin Young to play on his album American Dreams. In 1979 Labes returned to Bonnie Raitt's band for the No Nukes protest concert. Bonnie Raitt performs on two tracks that made it onto the album released of the concert. Also in 1979, Labes composed a triptych called Letters for the Northeastern University Choral Society, which received its world premiere in May of that year. The following year Labes made a return to Van Morrison's band, using his skills in arranging to produce string parts for Morrison's album Common One. He also contributed to the tour that succeeded the release of the album, and features on the 2006 DVD of a 1980 concert: Live at Montreux 1980/1974. After six years Labes performed on another Morrison album, No Guru, No Method, No Teacher and the tour that followed, featuring a recreation of The Caledonia Soul Orchestra. In 2010, Jef Labes became the keyboardist for the band Spike James and the Names, an original rock band from the San Francisco Bay Area. He has recorded one album with them and continues to perform as the keyboardist for all their performances while maintaining his personal musical projects. Jef Labes is still an active performer, director, teacher, arranger and composer of music. He currently performs throughout the Bay Area.

The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) silver-certified library was named \\"Library of the Year\\" in 2005 by Library Journal and an \\"American Landmark Library\\" by TravelSmart. History Fayetteville Public Library was first created in 1916 and was housed in the brand-new Washington County Courthouse. The library was contained in two rooms in the basement of the building. The building quickly became too small, and the Fayetteville Public Library moved to the City Administration Building in 1937 along with several other city offices. This building became too small following Fayetteville's rapid post-World War II growth. Residents began fundraising for a new building, and a site on East Dickson Street was tapped by the City of Fayetteville in 1959. A funding measure of $255,000 was approved for the site, with architect Warren Segraves in charge of the design. Built at the edge of the Washington-Willow Historic District, the site was dedicated on June 4, 1962 by Senator J. William Fulbright. The plot to the east was purchased in 1966 and the plot to the west in 1989. The building on the west plot was connected to the library, forming a large facility of . This large building held the FPL, the Ozark Regional Library System and the Talking Books service. The Ozark Regional Library System split into the Washington County Library System (WCLS) and the Benton County Library System in 1999, and the WCLS left the FPL building the following year. Also in 2000 Fayetteville citizens approved a sales tax increase to build a new library. A significant contribution of $3 million from Jim Blair in honor of his late wife, grandmother, and aunt was announced in 2002, and ground was broken two months later. The building was opened in September 2004 at a cost of $23 million. Building Fayetteville Public Library main entrance Fayetteville Public Library was designed by Meyer, Scherer and Rockcastle, Ltd. of Minneapolis and was opened in October 2004. The library was the first building in Arkansas to register with the U.S. Green Building Council, in June 2001, and achieved the silver LEED designation in 2006. To earn this designation the library employed many green-design techniques. The library was built a few blocks away from the Fayetteville Historic Square, making it a textbook smart growth project. During construction, any trees removed were harvested and used for furniture or donated to local parks. Throughout the project, almost 99% of the construction waste was recycled or reused. By incorporating a green roof and using alternative roofing materials, the design team reduced heat island effect by as much as 20 degrees. Water collected on the roof is reused for landscape irrigation through an underground cistern, saving about of water a year. The library's 10 waterless urinals served as a successful pilot project for the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services. In 2009, the library received a grant from the City / County Management Association to install 10 kW solar panels for energy generation.

The school opened in 1847 with two divisions: a rabbinical school and a teachers' seminary. The Rabbinical School was closed in 1873 and the Teachers' Seminary closed in 1914. The school taught secular studies, unlike the traditional cheders and yeshivas. This new curriculum, as well as the government control, made the school \\"unpopular.\\"  Curriculum  The school taught German language, Hebrew language, Hebrew Bible, Talmud, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, physics, astronomy, world history, Russian history, Russian language, geography, and handwriting and drawing.  History  Rabbi Yisroel Salanter, a major figure of the Mussar movement who then lived in Vilna, was pressured to lead the seminary. Rather than accept the position, Salanter fled to Kovno, even though Rabbi Yitzchok Volozhiner encouraged him to take the position. In 1872, a secret Narodnik study group was formed by Aaron Zundelevich. Vladimir Jochelson was a member of this group.  Faculty and students  Many prominent maskilim studied or taught in the school.

It was the first model in the \\"GF\\" line, which is primarily distinguished from the other Lumix G cameras by the lack of an integrated electronic viewfinder. Features The design of the DMC-GF1 is similar to that of the Olympus E-P1 which was introduced a few months earlier. The GF1 is 35% smaller than earlier G models. It has the same 12.1 megapixel sensor as the DMC-G1, 1280 √ó 720 HD recording in AVCHD Lite format, an optional hot-shoe mounted electronic viewfinder, and a 3-inch LCD with 460,000 dots. It was announced at the 2009 Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin consumer electronics exhibition. This model in the Lumix range was claimed by Panasonic as the world's smallest and lightest system digital camera with a built-in flash capability. Although the GF1 is small it still offers many advanced features such as its high definition video recording capability. It offers most of the features of the larger G1, including high speed contrast detect autofocus and an identical sensor.  Successor model  The GF1's successor, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF2 was announced in November 2010. The GF line has since been extended with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 (announced in June 2011), the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF5 (announced in April 2012) and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF6 (announced in April 2013). Many enthusiasts decried the move away from the GF1's button driven interface and the omission of the top control dial in the GF2 and subsequent models.

Background In Excess was a bay horse bred in Ireland by his owner Ahmed Fustok. He was sired by Siberian Express, a multiple Group One winner in France. In Excess was conditioned for racing in England by Bill O'Gorman. Racing career On his debut, In Excess won the October 5, 1989, EBF Sleeping Partner Maiden Stakes at Lingfield Park Racecourse. His next win came at age three in March 1990 in the Loddington Stakes at Leicester Racecourse, followed by a May 18 win in the 1990 King Charles II Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. Purchased by American Jack J. Munari, In Excess was brought to race in the United States during the second half of 1990. In September, the colt scored an eight-length win in the Hill Handicap on the turf at Louisiana Downs, then was shipped to California, where he won the Volante and San Gabriel Handicaps. On January 19, 1991, In Excess made his first start on dirt in the San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita Park. Not only did he win, he set a new stakes record of 1:46 3/5 for one and one-eighth miles. Sent to compete in dirt races at New York tracks, In Excess swept the Metropolitan Handicap in May, the Suburban Handicap in July in a track-record time of 1:58 1/5, the Whitney Handicap in August, and the Woodward Stakes in September in a very fast 1:46 1/5. His four wins in these major events was an accomplishment not seen since the great Kelso did it thirty years earlier in 1961. In Excess was a front-running horse and despite his win in the 1¬º mile Suburban Handicap, he raced best at distances of a mile to a mile and one eighth. Widely regarded as the best horse in America and the favorite for 1991 American Horse of the Year honors, In Excess was scheduled to compete in the November 2 1¬º mile Breeders' Cup Classic on dirt. However, the field had several horses such as Farma Way and Black Tie Affair who, like In Excess, were frontrunners, and trainer Bruce Jackson felt that the situation would make it very difficult for his horse to win, particularly at that distance. In addition, the race was to be held that year at Churchill Downs and In Excess put up slow times in pre-race training on that track. As a result, his trainer elected to run him in the Breeders' Cup Mile on grass, a surface he had won on in England and the United States. In Excess finished ninth in the Mile, his worst American finish ever, and it cost him the Horse of the Year title. In Excess raced in 1992 at age five, with his best Graded stakes results a second in the San Antonio Handicap, and a third in both the Metropolitan and Carter Handicaps. Stud record Retired to stud duty, going into 2009 In Excess has sired forty-nine Thoroughbred stakes winners and was the leading sire in California in 2002 and 2003. As of 2008, he was California's all-time sire of money-earners. Among his progeny were: * Indian Charlie - won the 1998 Santa Anita Derby (G1); sire of Champions, Indian Blessing and Uncle Mo * Musical Chimes - winner of the 2004 Oak Tree Mile Stakes (G1) * Romance Is Diane - won the 2006 Hollywood Starlet Stakes (G1) * Notional - won the 2007 San Rafael Stakes and Risen Star Stakes, 2008 Salvator Mile Handicap In 2009, In Excess stood at Vessels Stallion Farm in Bonsall, California. In Excess was pensioned from stud duty in 2011 and died in May 2013 at Vessels Stallion Farm.

The 1.1 million square foot shopping centre, owned by Shape Properties, sits on an 80-acre site., deerfootcity.com, Retrieved 18 August 2017 History Upon its opening, the mall's anchor tenants were Woolco, Canada Safeway, and The Bay. The original mall featured 80 retailers, including a mixture of chain and independent businesses, a bowling alley, and a food court. During the mall's early history, all three anchors closed or were rebranded: Woolco became Walmart; Safeway closed; and The Bay location was taken over by Sears Canada. Eventually, the former Safeway location was divided up into several smaller retailers, including Winners. By the 1990s, Deerfoot Mall was considered an \\"outlet mall,\\" billing itself as \\"Western Canada's only enclosed outlet mall.\\"Frommer's Alberta, p. 101 (2011) In the 2000s, both Walmart and Sears closed their locations within the mall, with Walmart opening a standalone store to the immediate southeast of the building, and Sears closing its store altogether. This left Winners and the bowling alley as the mall's last remaining anchors, though both the former Walmart and Sears locations were redeveloped for other retailers.

Turjan's adventures often bring him into conflict with other wizards. *T'sais is an artificial woman created by Pandelume. Unfortunately, something went wrong in the process of her creation. As a result, T'sais is literally incapable of being pleased with anything or anyone, and reacts with disgust to the sight, sound, etc. of everything she perceives. She is consumed with uncontrollable disgust and hatred for all living creatures, including herself, and spends her time attempting to hunt and kill everything in sight (except Pandelume). After an encounter with T'sain, she decides to attempt to control her instinctual hatred, and asks Pandelume to send her to Earth. There, she joins Etarr in an attempt to cure their respective ills. *Ulan Dhor is the nephew of Prince Kandive, and a budding swordsman and wizard. He sets out to the city of Ampridatvir to recover a pair of ancient tablets, supposed to provide access to ancient knowledge and magic. Other characters *Elai is a girl who shows kindness to Ulan Dhor when he journeys to Ampridatvir. She is a member of the grey-clad worshippers of Cazdal. Ulan informs her of the truth about the city, and she serves as his guide and companion. *Etarr is a normal man who was unfortunate enough to fall in love with an evil witch. She used her magic powers to exchange his face with that of a demon, cursing him with an unspeakably horrible face. However, Etarr is a kind man. After he offers help and hospitality to T'sais, she joins him on a journey to force his ex-lover to return his face. Although Etarr is not spoken of as a magician, he knows some spells which he uses to protect himself and T'sais. * Prince Kandive the Golden, as he is called, is a decadent and indolent monarch who rules the city of Kaiin. He is also a wizard of considerable power, from whom Mazirian stole the secrets of unnaturally long life. His age is unknown. Kandive finances the expeditions of his nephew, Ulan Dhor. *Pandelume is a mighty wizard who resides in the realm of Embelyon. Pandelume possesses knowledge of many things which are otherwise lost to mankind in Turjan's time, including the method of creating artificial life, of all the spells which have ever been invented, and of mundane sciences such as mathematics. However, he is not perfect or infallible; he created the flawed T'sais and needs Turjan to retrieve a magical relic for him in order to defeat an old foe. Although he has a physical presence, Pandelume is never seen by the other characters; apparently, the sight of him causes insanity or death. *Rogol Domedonfors: The last ruler of the city of Ampridatvir, unable to stop the endless rioting among the people of the city, caught up in a freak religious fervor, is mortally wounded and devises two tablets containing the key to his lore. The city, once a bastion of science, sinks into barbarism. Thousands of years later, Ulan Dhor and Etai seek to steal these tablets from the temples. In doing so, they find the surprising true purpose behind their creation. *Shierl is the daughter of the Castellan of the Saponids. When the Saponids force Guyal to choose the most beautiful young woman in Saponce, he chooses Shierl, and inadvertently condemns her to be sacrificed to the demon Blikdak. Guyal and Shierl develop a relationship as the Saponids force him to escort her to the Museum of Man. *T'sain is a beautiful artificial human woman created by Turjan. T'sain was created from the same \\"pattern\\" that Pandelume used to create T'sais, but T'sain does not share her mental flaws. T'sain returns with Turjan to the Dying Earth, and later attempts to rescue Turjan from Mazirian. Rhialto the Marvellous The most powerful wizards of the 21st Aeon of the Dying Earth are banded together in an association, and mostly reside in the territories of Ascolais and Almery. Unlike other wizards of the Dying Earth, such as Turjan and Mazirian, these wizards possess nearly godlike power. With little effort, they can travel to the distant past or the furthest reaches of the universe, freeze time (a popular dirty trick), prolong their lives for eons, change their shape and appearance, summon useful objects, and call forth numerous spells of protection, destruction, investigation, or simple amusement and experimentation. Much of their power comes from their ability to bind and control potent genie-like beings called sandestins, while they also derive power from their large stores of magical relics. The most highly prized are IOUN stones, mystical stones which they take as the spoils of their battles with the archveults. Their conduct toward one another is governed by a set of rules called the Blue Principles, because they are inscribed upon a blue stone which displays them through a sort of projector. This artifact is dislocated back to a remote aeon and the search for it is fraught with one setback after another. In Vance's Dying Earth cycle, most magic has been lost, there remaining but few more than a hundred spells to man's access. Each spell has to be memorized by stringent study, and, once used, is forgotten and has to be re-memorized. Even the strongest wizards can memorize but 4 of the greater and 6 of the lesser spells. Artifacts of great power from \\"antique days\\" occasionally turn up. These restrictions appear to be missing from the Cugel and Rhialto cycles. Because the wizards are so powerful, they have little to fear except from one another and from powerful external threats such as the archveults. Thus, while the Blue Principles acts as a nonaggression pact and a defensive alliance, most of the time it serves as a social circle and gentleman's club. The members spend most of their time enjoying fine food and drink, courting ladies of the nearby kingdoms, conversing, and squabbling with one another over magical relics and pranks played on one another. Rhialto the Marvellous, the titular wizard of the last book in the Dying Earth trilogy, and the primary focus of the stories involving the wizards of the 21st Aeon. Rhialto, like most of the others, is a wealthy and powerful wizard who rules an opulent estate, Falu. Also like most of his fellows, he enjoys epicurean pleasures and the company of beautiful women, but maintains no serious relationships. Normally appearing as a slim man with short black hair and austere features, he earned the title \\"the Marvellous\\" because of his reputation as a dandy who wears ostentatious, ornate clothing and is popular with women. Rhialto is ordinarily agreeable and carefree, but his fellow wizards regard him as somewhat supercilious. Ildefonse is the elected \\"Preceptor\\" of the compact; he is invested with broad powers and effectively acts as a chairman and mediator of the compact‚Äôs meetings and members. Although he is prone to hedonism and squabbling like his fellow wizards, he is generally much more temperate and level-headed than the others. His ordinary appearance is of a portly, bald middle-aged man with blue eyes and blond whiskers, which he habitually tugs at when vexed. Rhialto maintains a closer friendship with him than with any of the other wizards. His manse, a four- towered castle named Boumergarth, sits next to the River Scaum. Ao of the Opals, \\"saturnine, with a pointed black beard and a caustic manner.\\" Barbanikos, \\"short and squat with a great puff of white hair.\\" Byzant the Necrope. Darvilk the Miaanther, who wears a black domino mask for unknown reasons. Dulce-Lolo, a \\"portly epicure.\\" Eshmiel, who delightfully affects an appearance which is, from head to toe, half-white and half-black, split vertically down the center. His home and possessions are similarly colored. Gilgad, known for his clammy touch and his clothing, which is always rose-red. Hache-Moncour, a vindictive wizard who is jealous of Rhialto's manner, and sets out to destroy Rhialto's position due to a perceived slight on Rhialto's part. He wears the appearance of a nature-god with fine features and bronze curls. Haze of Wheary Water. Haze appears as a wisp, an aquatic humanoid with green skin and orange willow-leaves for hair. Whether this is his true appearance, or just a magical affectation, is unknown. Herark the Harbinger. Hurtiancz, \\"short and burly,\\" notorious for his short temper and irritability. He wears false teeth made from carved rubies. Morreion, an exceptionally powerful amnesiac wizard who spent Aeons trapped far from Earth. Unlike most wizards, he eschews spells for simple gestures powered by \\"personal force.\\" Mune the Mage, who speaks little; unlike the other wizards, he is married, having four spouses. Nahourezzin, a scholar from Old Romarth, a planet which appears in some of Vance's other works. Panderleou, whose passion is collecting rare and exotic artifacts from many dimensions. Perdustin, an especially secretive mage. He has no real friends, and refuses to reveal his place of residence. Shrue, a diabolist. Thin and pale, he is a scholar of the demon-realms, and his fellow wizards find him agreeable but his witticisms disturbing. Tchamast. In sharp contrast to the other wizards of the compact, Tchamast is a morose ascetic who is extremely mistrustful of women, so much that he only allows male insects into his home. Teutch, who rarely speaks with his mouth, but uses magic to flick words from his fingertips. He is an Elder of the Hub, a philosophical academy which Cugel encountered on his own journeys, which holds that reality is like a wheel with an uncertain number of infinities as its \\"spokes.\\" As an Elder, he is accorded control over a \\"private infinity.\\" Vermoulian the Dream-Walker, described as \\"peculiarly tall and thin, with a stately stride.\\" Vermoulian lives in a magnificent floating palace which can travel to the far corners of the known universe, and can also view, enter, and record the dreams of others. He has a collection of \\"recordings\\" of beautiful women from ages past, stored in bottles. The women can be brought to life for a time, but once dismissed and recalled, they reappear with no memory of their last manifestation. Zahoulik-Khuntze, known for his iron fingernails and toenails which are inscribed with strange runes. Zanzel Melancthones, who is friendly with Rhialto and Ildefonse. Zilifant, \\"robust of body, with long brown hair and a flowing beard.\\" Category:Lists of literary characters Category:Characters in fantasy literature ","title":"List of Dying Earth characters"},{"id":"24017937","text":"{+ |} The RV Polar Duke is a 219-foot ice-strengthened research vessel built in 1983.

The \\"Duke\\" transported supplies and personnel between Palmer Station, Antarctica and the port of Punta Arenas, Chile, on the Strait of Magellan, for 13 years, providing seagoing and shore-based research support in waters and islands in the Drake Passage and around the Antarctic Peninsula. In November 1997 Polar Duke was replaced in its role with USAP by the ice strengthened Lawrence M. Gould. In May 1998, the Polar Duke was rebuilt by its Norwegian owner, Rieber Shipping, as a seismic survey vessel, extending the aft superstructure and converting the helideck to a regular deck. It was assigned to a Rieber subsidiary, Exploration Vessel Resources, which was spun off in 2005 and acquired later that year by CGG, which is now part of CGGVeritas. It was renamed CGG Duke in 2006, and Duke in 2008.

The lands were acquired by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and are managed by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. The project's field office is located at West Hill Dam. Segment Map Index  History The Indian name for the Charles River was Quinobequin, meaning \\"meandering\\". Captain John Smith, however, named the Charles River for Charles I of England and, in doing so, interested the monarch in its potential for trade and settlement. The Charles River offered the opportunity for early settlers to acquire land, wealth and freedom from political and religious oppression by providing a water highway to the interior. The winding river rambles for from its headwaters, drains an area over and is the most densely populated river basin in New England. The Charles River is one of the most beautiful urban rivers in the country. In cooperation with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the US Army Corps of Engineers has implemented a program that not only protects the urbanized watershed from flooding, but also safeguards valuable wetlands and provides areas for wildlife and recreation. Torrential rains from hurricanes in 1938, 1955 and 1968 caused water levels to rise and rivers to overflow their banks in communities across New England. The floodwaters caused millions of dollars in damage and took hundreds of lives throughout New England. Along the Charles River, the residents and properties of the lower Charles are the most seriously affected when flooding occurs. As a result of these floods, the Corps of Engineers conducted a study that determined the best way to protect the populous lower basin of the Charles River was to construct a pumping station capable of rapidly discharging the floodwater into Boston Harbor. The study also determined that the best way to protect the middle and upper portions of the river system from future flooding would be to protect the natural storage capacities of the wetlands. Flood control The lower portion of the watershed known as the \\"Charles River Basin\\" was created in 1910 with the construction of a dam across the mouth of the river. There was no dependable means of discharging river flood flows into Boston Harbor, since the dam relied on gravity flow with the sluice gates operating only at low tide. In addition, the dam effectively eliminates salt water intrusion into the Charles. The congested cities of Boston and Cambridge, and the upstream communities of Watertown, Waltham, Brookline and Newton, were often exposed to the threat of serious flood damages. In 1968, Congress authorized the Corps to build the new Charles River Dam at the mouth of the Charles in Boston. The $61 million structure was completed in 1978. Six pumps at the dam maintain a safe basin level by discharging river flows into the harbor. Each 3,000-horsepower diesel engine pump is capable of discharging 630,000 gallons of water per minute. The structure includes navigation locks to handle ever-increasing boat traffic. The dam is now operated and maintained by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority of Massachusetts. Studies by the Corps of Engineers revealed that the communities above Newton had a history of only minimal flooding. Extensive marshes, swamps and wet meadows scattered around the upper watershed were holding floodwaters and then only slowly letting them go. In 1974, Congress authorized the \\"Charles River Natural Valley Storage Area\\", allowing for the acquisition and permanent protection of 17 scattered wetlands in the middle and upper watershed. Final acquisition totaled , with of land acquired in fee and in flood easement, at a project cost of $8,300,000. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife manages the fish and wildlife resources in some of the Corps' fee-owned land. Preservation The Corps of Engineers has acquired the natural valley storage areas of the Charles River to be maintained in a natural state in perpetuity. Charles River Natural Valley Storage Area, Millis, MA The Charles River Natural Valley Storage flood control project was authorized by Public Law 93-251 as a \\"multi-purpose\\" project for flood control, recreation and fish and wildlife management. As a result, all land was acquired to be preserved in its natural state and to prevent any alteration of natural drainage characteristics. The Corps is dedicated to safeguarding these natural areas as green space for flood protection, recreation, wildlife habitat and guaranteed protection of open areas. The Charles River must remain a legacy pass by this generation to all those that follow. Recreation The lands and waters of the Charles River Natural Valley Storage Area offer an important addition to public recreation in eastern Massachusetts. The lands provide needed open space for passive recreation activities such as birdwatching, hiking, canoeing, fishing and cross-country skiing. This is an exceptional setting for natural walking, especially during the fall foliage season when the abundant red maples show their crimson colors. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife provides annual stocking of trout in the Charles River and its tributary brooks and rivers. In a region of rapid suburban growth, the Charles River Natural Valley Storage Project offers a unique opportunity for continued enjoyment of natural and recreational resources for years to come.

He remained in the Army after the war, and received brevets as major and lieutenant colonel for his part in defending the U.S. border during the French occupation of Mexico and participation in Custer's campaigns during the Indian Wars. After leaving the Army in 1871, Crosby worked as an engineer, and designed and oversaw construction of lighthouses, breakwaters, and other marine projects. He was U.S. Consul in Florence, Italy from 1876 to 1881, and Governor of Montana Territory from 1883 to 1884. From 1886 to 1889, Crosby served as U.S. First Assistant Postmaster General, and from 1889 to 1891 he was New York City's school commissioner. Crosby died in Newport, Rhode Island on August 8, 1914 and was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery. Early life Crosby was born to Clarkson Floyd Crosby (1817‚Äì1858) and Angelica Schuyler (1820‚Äì1896) in Albany, New York on September 19, 1839. He was a lineal descendant of Pieter Schuyler and the great-grandson of William Floyd, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. He attended the University of the City of New York (now New York University), but left school before graduation to take a tour of South America, the Pacific Islands, the East Indies, and China. Career Civil War At the beginning to the American Civil War he joined the Union Army and, having previous experience with the New York State Militia, was commissioned a second lieutenant in the First Artillery. His initial service was with the Army of the Potomac and he earned promotion to first lieutenant in August 1861. In 1862, Crosby was transferred to the Department of the Gulf and following the battles of Fort Bisland, Irish Bend and Vermillion Bayou was brevetted a captain for gallantry. From 1863 until 1865, he served as assistant adjutant general under General Banks. During the Red River Campaign, Crosby earned a letter of thanks from President Abraham Lincoln for carrying dispatches through enemy territory to Admiral Farragut. Following the capture of Mobile, Alabama, Crosby transferred to become assistant inspector general under General Philip Sheridan. Post-war Following the war, Crosby remained on Sheridan's staff as aide-de-camp and adjutant general. In this capacity he served along the Rio Grande during the French occupation of Mexico and during Sheridan's and Custer's campaigns during the Indian Wars. During his military service he was brevetted four times for gallantry. Crosby resigned from the army on January 1, 1871 as a brevet lieutenant colonel. After leaving the military, Crosby went to work as a civil engineer building breakwaters and lighthouses. During this time he help found the Westchester Polo Club and, in 1875, won an international pigeon-shooting contest. On July 20, 1876, Crosby was with Vice-Commodore William T. Garner of the New York Yacht Club on the Mohawk when a sudden squall overturned the yacht. He was later presented a medal for his heroic efforts to save lives during the event. Consul in Italy Crosby was appointed Consul for the United States delegation in Florence, Italy by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1876. While at this posting, he assisted the local government in the capture and prosecution of a group of forgers. For his assistance, on June 29, 1881, Crosby was awarded the Order of the Crown of Italy. Governor of Montana Territory Crosby was nominated to become Governor of Montana Territory by President Chester A. Arthur. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 4, 1882 and took office on January 15, 1883. Upon his arrival, Crosby indicated his commitment to the territory by making over US$20,000 of investments within Montana. Despite this level of dedication, the Republican governor still managed to antagonize the territory's Democratic majority through liberal use of his veto power. The most important example of his veto use was through the blocking of a bill authorizing the establishment of a system of cattle inspections and a cattle commission. Despite the veto, Crosby did take steps to halt cattle with Texas fever from being imported into the territory. Other activities pursued by the governor were a strong anti-crime policy, opposition to polygamy, and an effort to reduce lands held by Native Americans. He also played an important role in blocking cattle interests from gaining control of Yellowstone. Crosby was an avid big game hunter. In this capacity, while governor, he organized one of the largest big game hunts in U.S. history, including dignitaries such as President Arthur, Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln, Senator George Graham Vest, and Daniel G. Rollins in the hunting party. Crosby submitted his resignation on November 11, 1884 in order to become First Assistant Postmaster General. Later life Crosby held the position of First Assistant Postmaster General until March 1885. After leaving that post he moved to New York City where, from 1889 to 1891 he was the city's school commissioner. After completing his school job, Crosby traveled extensively until 1897. He was also active in the Grand Army of the Republic, Loyal Legion, Sons of the Revolution, and a variety of Washington D.C. and New York City social clubs. Personal life On June 26, 1863, Crosby married Harriet Van Rensselaer (1838‚Äì1911), youngest daughter of General Stephen Van Rensselaer IV (1789‚Äì1868), who was the last patroon of Rensselaerwyck.COL.

On January 20, 1913, while he was in his sick bed, one of his servants suddenly became crazed and he was forced to fight off and subdue the knife wielding valet. Crosby died in Newport, Rhode Island on August 8, 1914. He is buried in Section 14, Lot 1 of Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.

The 1709 edition of Camden's Magna Britannia mentioned that Enys was noted for its fine gardens. The House and garden The Enys Trust was formed in 2002 as a charity in order to secure the long-term future of the garden at Enys, near Penryn in Cornwall, and to open the garden to the public. In 2013 the house was opened to the public for the first time. John Davies Enys greatly enriched Enys with seeds and plants he regularly sent home from New Zealand and Patagonia. The lakes in the lower valley have a water wheel which raised water to the house. The scenery created here has been much photographed over the years. In Spring the bluebells in the parkland, known as Parc Lye, are a sight to behold. This area is believed to be undisturbed since ancient times, and contains many trees of a great age. The formal gardens still contain plants shrubs and trees from the J D Enys Collection, and the Estate also has a fine collection of bamboos comprising a number of very rare varieties. Probably the most valuable asset to the garden is its microclimate. It is virtually frost free, and this, together with the mild and temperate influence of the Gulf Stream, enables many tender plants and trees to flourish. One of the most important of these is the \\"Peruvian Laurel\\", one of the few specimens growing in England today.

The plot follows the struggle of Ottawa lawyer Jules de Lanatagnac, an anglicized French-Canadian who becomes a nationalist and joins the fight against Ontario's Regulation 17 to save French language schools in the province. Plot summary The story begins when Jules de Lantagnac, an Ottawa lawyer of French Quebec origin, visits his Gatineau priest after a pilgrimage to his native childhood village of Saint-Michel. Lantagnac reveals to Father Fabien that his pilgrimage has transformed him: where he was once an anglicized French-Canadian, he has become a French Canadian patriot and has sworn to return his family to its French and Catholic roots. The activist priest, Father Fabien, pleased, persuades the lawyer to join the struggle of the Franco-Ontarians against Regulation 17, the Ontario law aimed at eliminating the teaching of French in schools. When Lantagnac returns to his Anglo-Saxon wife and his four children in Ottawa's Sandy Hill, he informs them of his rediscovery of French-Canadian culture. He takes his family on visits to Quebec and begins teaching them French, struggling with their adherence to the Parisian dialect, as well as the distaste of his wife Maud, his elder daughter Nellie, and youngest son William. His elder son, Wolfred-Andr√© responds more favourably to his father's wishes, pursuing education in French in Montreal, while his younger daughter, Virginia, fully embraces French Canadian nationalism, attending history and language classes at a convent on Rideau Street in Ottawa. In the meantime, Lantagnac struggles with developments in the Ontario schools conflict. Inspired by the resignation of a Senator Landry in protest of Regulation 17, and persuaded by Father Fabien, Lantagnac decides to run as an independent candidate in the by- election in the Franco-Ontarian federal elector district of Russell in Eastern Ontario. He reveals this decision to his family during the visit of brother- in-law William Duffin, an Irish-Canadian lawyer who, like Lantagnac, was born in Quebec and fluent in French. Duffin, portrayed by Groulx as thoroughly anglicized and assimilated, passionately defends Resolution 17 in a debate with Virginia, condemning the actions of protest by the Franco-Ontarian community. Lantagnac enters the debate and refutes Duffin's arguments. However, this and his announcement of his candidacy thoroughly distresses Maud and Nellie who continue to embrace Anglo-Saxon rule. Lantagnac wins the election and uses his victory to advance the Franco-Ontarian cause, defending French rights in Parliament passionately and serving his constituents with force. He earns the respect of the Francophone community. However, his advocacy of French rights and his part in the struggle worries his in-laws who see him as an agitator and a danger to Anglo-Saxon dominance. His father in law and his wife both confront him and argue against his activism. Soon after, Lantagnac faces a scandal when his son William, who has stayed at the English Loyola College, participates in a debate and argue in defence of Resolution 17, putting further strain on the Lantagnac family. Wolfred writes to his father a consolation condemning his brother's actions. Lantagnac faces further trouble and pressures at home, but does not relent from his cause. William Duffin, who has become an anti-French activist, devises a scheme with government politicians to stop Lantagnac. First, he attempts to persuade Lantagnac that the French struggle is too extreme, and that Lantagnac would do well to play the role of a peacemaker and to avoid speaking in a key debate on 11 May. Second, he arranges to trick Lantagnac into resigning from his employment at the Aitkens Brothers law firm, in the hope that the loss of income would push Lantagnac to accept an \\"honour\\" from the government for financial security in exchange for abstention from his activism. Lantagnac resigns and Duffin takes his place, outraging Virginia, who by this time is an ardent French-Canadian nationalist and devout Catholic. The tension at home begins to take its toll on Lantagnac, who considers abstaining from the debate in spite of its offense to his honour. To justify this he begins to believe Duffin's advice. This is worsened by his wife's veiled threats that his participation in the debate on behalf of the French cause would only lead to their separation. Moved by this, Lantagnac on the eve of the debate asks Father Fabien advice, who, while understanding the pain of his predicament, still urges Lantagnac to participate. Lantagnac, leaving Father Fabien, overhears his elder son's name mentioned by Montreal Francophone university students admiring the Parliament Hill statue of Baldwin and LaFontaine, the \\"architects of Canada's freedom\\". He resolves to take part in the debate until later that night he finds his wife faints. The morning of the debate day, Lantagnac attends a moving mass with Virginia attended also by thousands of children who pray and perform communion to save their schools. Lantagnac, who had decided against speaking the debate, goes to Parliament to take his seat, observe and applaud. Until the very last second he remains determined to not speak, but, hearing the words of French activists, (including Wilfrid Laurier), he is moved to deliver a stirring speech in defence of French schools and culture. The speech however, has its consequences. Maud and Nellie leave, with Maud promising to respect her children's freedom. Virginia tells Lantagnac that she will enter the convent to become a nun; she will spend a few weeks with her father in his home village before this but will spend a few final days with her mother. Lantagnac finds William's room empty as well, with only an unread copy of \\"L'avenir du peuple canadien-fran√ßais\\" (The Future of the French-Canadian People)defaced on the first page with \\"Rule Britannia for ever.\\" Lantagnac feels alone. Lantagnac's eldest son arrives as well however from Montreal. He asks his father to bless him and announces that like his father, he is French in soul and proud of his French-Canadian heritage.

The group was found guilty on 16 October 2009 and were sentenced on 15 February 2010 for terms up to 28 years.Woods, Ian (15 February 2010) Terror Plot Gang Jailed In Australia Sky News. Retrieved 15 February 2010  Charges  Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Mohamed Ali Elomar, Abdul Rakib Hasan, and Mohammed Omar Jamal were arrested in various neighbourhoods of Sydney and were tried in the New South Wales Supreme Court over a terror-related plot they planned between July 2004 and November 2005. Each pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to commit a terrorist act or acts. The final cost of the trial is expected to be more than A$10 million. The Crown Prosecutor claimed that the men were motivated by a belief that Islam was under attack. The five allegedly had links to Abdul Nacer Benbrika, who is under arrest in Melbourne. Police searches of their homes discovered instructions on bomb-making, 28,000 rounds of ammunition (including 11,000 7.62√ó39mm), 12 rifles, militant Islamist literature, and footage of beheadings carried out by Islamists, and also of aircraft crashing into the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001. According to the prosecution, the men purchased explosive chemicals and guns between July 2004 and November 2005.  Trial  The men were put on trial late in 2008. Closing arguments were heard on 28 July 2009. The trial took place in a specially- built high-security court building in Sydney. Prosecutor Richard Maidment claimed that the five men wanted \\"violent jihad which involved the application of extreme force and violence, including the killing of those who did not share the fundamentalist... extremist, beliefs\\". A mistrial was almost declared when the defence asked for the jury to be dismissed; it was discovered that a young woman, who was a relative of one of the accused, had been coming to court and reportedly writing down descriptions of the jurors. However, the jurors said it would not affect their deliberations and the judge allowed the trial to continue. Verdict and sentencing The five were found guilty on 16 October 2009. The trial was one of Australia's longest and involved approximately 300 witnesses and 3,000 exhibits, including 18 hours of telephone intercepts and 30 days of surveillance tapes, which has overtaken the record previously held by the liquidation of Bell Group.

He has specialized in studying what causes violence in children, how they cope with it and how to rehabilitate them. Garbarino has served as consultant or adviser to a wide range of organizations, including the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse, the National Institute for Mental Health, the American Medical Association, the National Black Child Development Institute, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, and the FBI. In addition, Garbarino's work is associated with the School of Human Ecology at Cornell University under the leadership of Urie Bronfenbrenner who began Head Start programs in the US. Academic work Garbarino has written on the causes of violent behavior in children and how they cope with stress. He has studied the impact of war on children, including children in Kuwait, Iraq, Bosnia, and Croatia. He has also conducted many interviews with children who have been convicted of violent crimes in the United States, concluding that abuse and neglect at an early age are contributing causes to the violent behavior of these children. He has served as an expert witness involving issues of trauma, violence, and abuse in both civil and criminal trials. Garbarino and his coauthors have also conducted many interviews with other high school students and teachers about bullying and social problems at school to help understand ways to improve the school environment. Garbarino recommends that violence prevention begin at an early age by recognizing underlying causes and addressing them before they expand. He advocates programs that provide assistance to young at-risk children and parents, including a home visiting program that provides home visitors to young mothers at risk to help with child care and provide advice about child rearing. Children who have benefited from this program have reduced drop out and delinquency rates.James Garbarino Lost Boys 1999 pp. 183-184. He has also advised intervention when there are problems in school at a young age with advice and counseling rather than punishment when possible. He believes this is often less expensive and more productive than waiting for problems to get worse.James Garbarino Lost Boys 1999 pp. 188, 206-238.

Life He graduated from Princeton University in 1923. Then he studied law privately and attended Albany Law School for one year. He was admitted to the bar in 1926, and practiced law in Hudson Falls, New York. He married Judith Angell, and they had two daughters. In 1935, he was elected District Attorney of Washington County, a position his father had held also. During World War II, he served as a captain in the United States Army. In 1952, he was elected to the New York Supreme Court (4th District), and re-elected in 1966. He sat on the Appellate Division (3rd Dept.) from 1956 to 1969. He was Presiding Justice from 1964 on. In 1964, the phrase \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance was challenged as a violation of the constitutional separation of church and state. On the appellate bench, Gibson ruled that the phrase was legal. His decision was upheld by the New York Court of Appeals. The United States Supreme Court declined to review the decision, effectively leaving Justice Gibson's ruling as the law of the land. On September 15, 1969, Gibson was appointed by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller to the Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Kenneth Keating. In November 1969, he was elected unopposed to succeed himself. He retired from the Court of Appeals at the end of 1972 when he reached the constitutional age limit of 70 years, and returned to the Supreme Court as a certificated trial justice until 1978. Afterwards he resumed the practice of law at Hudson Falls. He died at the Glens Falls Hospital. Sources *The History of the New York Court of Appeals, 1932-2003 by Bernard S. Meyer, Burton C.

Landowners interested in protecting their land either donate or sell property to INHF, who will work to conserve and/or restore its natural features. In most cases, INHF takes ownership of land temporarily, while public conservation agencies (local, county, state or federal) raise funds to purchase the property. During this time, INHF will lend technical and professional assistance to these agencies, as well as work to restore native ecosystems. INHF works directly with landowners to make sure that the transaction meets their wishes.\\"PhiLANDthropy,\\" Des Moines Business Record INHF staff will meet with landowners to negotiate the sale or donation of their land, as well as the transfer to whatever agency will retain permanent ownership. In most cases, project sites that INHF assists with will become public land, open for exploration, hunting, fishing, camping and other activities, depending on the site. INHF also works with landowners to protect their land through conservation easements, in which a landowner relinquishes certain rights to all or part of his or her property (e.g. farming or mining), while still retaining ownership. INHF and the private owners develop a legally binding agreement regarding which property uses will be allowed or restricted. This agreement applies to the current owner and all future owners.Donation of a conservation easement INHF has completed 139 conservation easements throughout Iowa. In very few cases, INHF will retain permanent ownership of a project site. These sites, like Snyder Farm in Polk County, are used to further INHF's goals. Snyder is used as a training ground and example of how a farm can be converted into tall grass prairie and oak savanna. Notable land projects INHF has done more than 700 land projects.

She is the Director of Research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) in Washington, D.C. She is also President and CEO of Mogahed Consulting, a Washington, D.C.-based executive coaching and consulting firm specializing in Muslim societies and the Middle East. Mogahed is former Executive Director of the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies, a non-partisan research center that provided data and analysis to reflect the views of Muslims all over the world. She was selected as an advisor by U.S. President Barack Obama on the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Early life and education Dalia was born in Cairo, Egypt, and immigrated to the United States at the age of four. She received her undergraduate degree in chemical engineering with a minor in Arabic from the University of Wisconsin. Upon graduation, Mogahed joined Procter & Gamble as a marketing products researcher. She subsequently received her MBA from the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh. Career and influence Dalia Mogahed is the Director of Research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), a Washington, DC and Dearborn, Michigan-based Muslim research organization. Prior to ISPU, Dalia Mogahed chaired the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies from 2006 to 2012, which conducted research and statistics on Muslims throughout the world. She was selected as an advisor by U.S. President Barack Obama on the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Mogahed was invited to testify before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations about U.S. engagement with Muslim communities, and was a significant contributor to the Homeland Security Advisory Council's Countering Violent Extremism Working Group. She worked with Madeleine Albright and Dennis Ross on the U.S.-Muslim Engagement Project to produce policy recommendations‚Äîmany of which were adopted by the administration of President Barack Obama. Dalia Mogahed is a board member and a leader in several organizations, including the World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Council on the Arab World. She is also a nonresident senior public policy scholar at Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut.Women In International Security Mogahed is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. Prior to joining Gallup, Mogahed was the founder and director of a cross- cultural consulting practice in the United States, which offered workshops, training programs, and one-to-one coaching on diversity and cultural understanding. Mogahed's clients included school districts, colleges and universities, law enforcement agencies, and community service organizations, as well as local and national media outlets. Recognition and publications Arabian Business magazine recognized Mogahed in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 as one of the most influential Arab women, and The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre included Mogahed in its 2009 and 2010 lists of the 500 most influential Muslims. Ashoka: Innovators for the Public named Mogahed the Arab World's Social Innovator of the Year in 2010, and the University of Wisconsin Alumni Association recognized her with its prestigious \\"Forward Under 40\\" award for outstanding contributions by a graduate of the University of Wisconsin. She and John Esposito co-authored the book Who Speaks For Islam?: What a Billion Muslims Really Think, based on six years of research and more than 50,000 interviews representing Muslims in more than 35 predominantly Muslim countries. Accounting for more than 90% of the world's Muslim community, this poll is the largest, most comprehensive study of its kind. Mogahed later appeared as a commentator in the award-winning, PBS-broadcast documentary Inside Islam: What a Billion Muslims Really Think (2010), which was based on her and Esposito's book and produced by Unity Productions Foundation. Mogahed's analysis has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Foreign Policy magazine, the Harvard International Review, the Middle East Policy Journal, and many other academic and popular journals. In 2019, Mogahed was recognized in a list of ‚Äú200 people who best embody the spirit and work of Frederick Douglass, one of the most influential figures in history‚Äù by the Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives and the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University in collaboration with The Guardian.  Controversy  In 2009, during a phone interview with a London-based TV show hosted by Ibtihal Bsis Ismail, a member of Hizb ut Tahrir, Mogahed responded to a question about the support for sharia among women in the Muslim world which she observed in her research by arguing that \\"the reason so many women support Sharia is because they have a very different understanding of sharia than the common perception in Western media. The majority of women around the world associate gender justice, or justice for women, with sharia compliance. The portrayal of Sharia has been oversimplified in many cases.\\" In response, Wendy Wright, the president of Concerned Women for America, said that Mogahed should not \\"downplay the serious nature of sharia law.\\" Mogahed later stated that she would not have agreed to the interview had she known about the program's affiliation and that she believed Ismail had misled her team \\"to score propaganda points for an ideological movement\\".  Views  Mogahed has rejected, as unjustified, calls for Muslims to condemn terrorism, arguing that there have been many such condemnations and that the demand unfairly implies that Muslims would support atrocities committed by other Muslims on account of their faith. Mogahed compares this with public attitudes to terrorist attacks committed by white Christians, which constitute the majority of terrorist attacks in the US according to the FBI, noting that in these cases, \\"we don't suspect other people who share their faith and ethnicity of condoning them\\".Don‚Äôt ask Muslims to condemn terror: Our outrage at atrocities ought to be a given, New York Daily News, Dalia Mogahed, 24 May 2017 References Further reading  LA Times: Muslim woman's appointment as Obama advisor draws cautious optimism * The Huffington Post: Cairo's Reaction to Obama's Speech * The Economist: The United States and Islam * The Atlantic: Anatomy of a Smear by Jeffrey Goldberg External links  An Interview With Dalia Mogahed: ‚ÄúCorny as it may sound, I am proof of the American dream‚Äù * Dalia Mogahed at ISPU Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:American women chief executives Category:American Muslims Category:Egyptian expatriates in the United States Category:Egyptian Muslims Category:Obama administration personnel Category:Joseph M.

Coleman maintained good relations between the CPR and its unionized workers. He felt that the company should \\"treat all employees with fairness, frankness and consideration\\". His experience in working up the ranks of CPR led him to believe that, \\"the great majority resent being patronized, want to be recognized as self-respecting citizens, and treated accordingly\\".

Route description The highway begins at a diamond interchange on I-15 heading east and quickly turns north into Main Street. It continues in a northerly direction through the center of the town of Beaver for about . In the main part of town, it intersects with SR-21 to the west and SR-153 to the east. After leaving town to the north, the route turns back to the west and ends at another diamond interchange with I-15. History The current incarnation of State Route 160 was created in 1961 while I-15 was under construction in the area. It consisted of just of road from the I-15 interchange about south of Beaver northwest to US-91 (SR-1), which ran through the center of town as Main Street. At the same time, State Route 161 was also created, serving a similar purpose, but on the interchange north of Beaver. When I-15 was completed north of town in 1964, SR-1 was rerouted as it left Beaver to connect with the new interstate, following the same route as SR-161. As a result, SR-161 was withdrawn to avoid the two state routes overlapping. In 1969, the rest of SR-1 through the town was realigned with I-15.

They can be used to model direct competition and trophic relationships between an arbitrary number of species. Their dynamics can be analysed analytically to some extent. This makes them useful as a theoretical tool for modeling food webs. However, they lack features of other ecological models such as predator preference and nonlinear functional responses, and they cannot be used to model mutualism without allowing indefinite population growth. The generalised Lotka-Volterra equations model the dynamics of the populations x_1, x_2, \\\\dots of n biological species. Together, these populations can be considered as a vector \\\\mathbf{x}. They are a set of ordinary differential equations given by : \\\\frac{dx_i}{dt} = x_i f_i(\\\\mathbf{x}), where the vector \\\\mathbf{f} is given by : \\\\mathbf{f} = \\\\mathbf{r} + A\\\\mathbf{x}, where \\\\mathbf{r} is a vector and A is a matrix known as the community matrix. Meaning of parameters The generalised Lotka-Volterra equations can represent competition and predation, depending on the values of the parameters, as described below. They are less suitable for describing mutualism. The values of \\\\mathbf{r} are the intrinsic birth or death rates of the species. A positive value for r_i means that species i is able to reproduce in the absence of any other species (for instance, because it is a plant), whereas a negative value means that its population will decline unless the appropriate other species are present (e.g. a herbivore that cannot survive without plants to eat, or a predator that cannot persist without its prey). The values of the matrix A represent the relationships between the species. The value of a_{ij} represents the effect that species j has upon species i. The effect is proportional to the populations of both species, as well as to the value of a_{ij}. Thus, if both a_{ij} and a_{ji} are negative then the two species are said to be in direct competition with one another, since they each have a direct negative effect on the other's population. If a_{ij} is positive but a_{ji} is negative then species i is considered to be a predator (or parasite) on species j, since i's population grows at j's expense. Positive values for both a_{ij} and a_{ji} would be considered mutualism. However, this is not often used in practice, because it can make it possible for both species' populations to grow indefinitely. Indirect negative and positive effects are also possible. For example, if two predators eat the same prey then they compete indirectly, even though they might not have a direct competition term in the community matrix. The diagonal terms a_{ii} are usually taken to be negative (i.e. species i's population has a negative effect on itself). This self-limitation prevents populations from growing indefinitely. Dynamics and solutions The generalised Lotka- Volterra equations are capable of a wide variety of dynamics, including limit cycles and chaos as well as point attractors (see Hofbauer and Sigmund). As with any set of ODEs, fixed points can be found by setting dx_i/dt to 0 for all i, which gives, if no species is extinct, i.e., if x_i eq 0 for all i, : \\\\mathbf{x} = -A^{-1}\\\\mathbf{r}. This may or may not have positive values for all the x_i; if it does not then there is no stable attractor for which the populations of all species are positive. If there is a fixed point with all positive populations it may or may not be stable; if it is unstable then there may or may not be a periodic or chaotic attractor for which all the populations remain positive. In either case there can also be attractors for which some of the populations are zero and others are positive. \\\\mathbf{x}=(0,0,\\\\dots 0) is always a fixed point, corresponding to the absence of all species. For n=2 species, a complete classification of this dynamics, for all sign patterns of above coefficients, is available,Bomze, I.M., Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equation and replicator dynamics: a two-dimensional classification. Biological Cybernetics 48, 201‚Äì211 (1983); Bomze, I.M., Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equation and replicator dynamics: new issues in classification. Biological Cybernetics 72, 447‚Äì453 (1995). which is based upon equivalence to the 3-type replicator equation. Alternative views A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator‚Äìprey model and their common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or Arditi-Ginzburg model.Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 1989. Coupling in predator‚Äìprey dynamics: ratio dependence. Journal of Theoretical Biology 139: 311‚Äì326. The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 2012.

Until 2008 the poem was studied at GCSE level in England and Wales as part of the AQA Anthology, a collection of poems by modern poets such as Duffy and Seamus Heaney. Description The poem begins with the lines \\"Today I am going to kill something. Anything. I have had enough of being ignored and today I am going to play God.\\" The individual in the poem feels undervalued and gradually progresses into insanity by experimenting progressively with violence beginning with killing a fly and a goldfish before terrifying a budgie and going outside armed with a bread knife; the last line of the poem is \\"I touch your arm\\" indicating the poet intends to take their first human life and at the same time creating an illusion to the reader they are under threat. The narrator's identity is never fully revealed however there are lines that allude to some facts on the character, one being the narrator is on the dole (\\"signing on\\" on a regular basis is mentioned) and it is also twice implied the narrator maybe craved recognition or even celebrity status after leaving school (the character mentions the dole office does not appreciate their autograph and towards the end of the poem tells someone over the phone in a radio station that they are \\"talking to a superstar\\"). Teachit.co.uk compares the subject of the poem to the incident where Brenda Ann Spencer carried out a shooting spree in an American school and explained her actions by stating \\"I don't like Mondays\\". The killings inspired the Boomtown Rats song I Don't Like Mondays. The poem is set against a backdrop of rising social problems in the United Kingdom during the 1980s and can be considered critical of Thatcherism. The poem references Gloucester's lines in Act 4 of King Lear, ‚ÄúAs flies to wanton boys are we to the Gods/ They kill us for their sport‚Äù, lines which show how humankind is at the whim of the gods. Censorship In 2008 concerns about the levels of teenage knife crime in the United Kingdom led to complaints about the inclusion of the poem in a GCSE textbook. Exam Board AQA were accused of censorship after it removed the poem from its AQA Anthology after three complaints about the poem. The most vocal complainant was Lutterworth Grammar School's exam invigilator Pat Schofield who described the poem as \\"absolutely horrendous\\". Duffy responded to the ban by citing the level of violence in the plays of Shakespeare and by stating that she considered the message of the poem to be pro-learning and anti-violence. Some teachers stated that they would continue to teach the poem. The BBC reported that schools had been told to destroy copies of the Anthology which contained the poem. In 2002 a school in Hull refused to teach the poem. Since the censorship, the new editions of the AQA Anthology contain a page where the poem was with the words \\"This page is left intentionally blank\\" as a placeholder.

The cinema opened on 16 April 1938 with the first film, The Awful Truth. History It was built on the site of the first Carlton Cinema (1915‚Äì1936) and was designed by architects Robinson & Keefe. It was built in Art Deco style. Inside, the decoration relied principally on the use of paint and lighting, but two large displays with a musical instrument motif were formed by twenty panels on either side of the screen. There was seating for 1,500 in the stalls and 500 in the circle. A stage and dressing room were also included in the design. In 1956, the cinema held the European premiere of Rock Around the Clock and it played to packed houses for three weeks. The cinema received the nickname \\"the House of Horror\\" due to the number of horror films shown there. In 1959, it was taken over by Associated British Cinemas (ABC) and in the late 1960s it was taken over by EMI. Many concerts were held on the stage in the 1970s, from performers such as Duke Ellington, Cleo Lane, Johnny Cash, James Last, Fats Domino, Nana Mouskouri, Marlene Dietrich, and Don McLean. The cinema was last taken over by MGM, and was subdivided into three screens, and later a fourth screen was added where the cinema restaurant was. It closed on 20 October 1994; two of the final films screened were Singin' in the Rain and Rock Around the Clock. Since then, it has been the subject of court battles to redevelop the site and in 2003 was compulsorily purchased by the city council to facilitate a new project on the site, and an adjoining area, which has been vacant since 1976. It is proposed the site be incorporated into the redevelopment of the O'Connell and Moore Street areas. The ground floor of the cinema is in use by the adjoining Dr Quirkey's Goodtime Emporium.

Writings by Delisle The Traitor and the Jew In her 1993 book, The Traitor and the Jew: Anti-Semitism and the Delirium of Extremist Right-Wing Nationalism in French Canada from 1929-1939, (Antis√©mitisme et nationalisme d'extr√™me-droite dans la province de Qu√©bec 1929‚Äì1939), French-Canadian historian and political theorist Esther Delisle documented Lionel Groulx's antisemitism as expressed in his writings from 1929 to 1939. Delisle exposed that Groulx's writings were rampant with various attacks against the Jewish people; blaming Jews for what Groulx viewed as his own society's social, and other ills. Myths, Memories and Lies In 1998, Esther Delisle published, Myths, Memories and Lies, an account of how some members of Quebec's elite, nationalist and federalist, supported Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe P√©tain and his Vichy government in Nazi-occupied France during World War II and helped bring French war criminals to safety in Quebec after the war ended. Criticisms of Delisle However, Delisle's work has also been criticized for allegedly altering or misquoting many of her actual citations of Groulx's work, criticisms with which Delisle has strongly disagreed. One such critic is G√©rard Bouchard, who agrees with the basic premise that Groulx expressed antisemitic opinions, but who strongly disagrees with Delisle over the importance of Groulx' antisemitism to his overall body of thought. Writings by Richler Oh Canada! Oh Quebec! Requiem for a Divided Country is a book by Canadian novelist Mordecai Richler. Published in 1992, it parodied the evolution of language policy in Quebec, and spoofed the Canadian province of Quebec's language laws that restrict the use of the English-language. The book, a best- seller, grew out of a long article published in a September 1991 issue of The New Yorker. Criticisms of Richler Following the publication of Oh Canada! Oh Quebec! Richler faced a great deal of criticism from Quebec nationalists in the French media and some in English-Canada. Smart, Pat. \\"Daring to Disagree with Mordecai\\" in Canadian Forum May 1992, p.8. Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe rose in the House of Commons to call Richler \\"a racist of the worst kind\\". Pierrette Venne, a Bloc Qu√©b√©cois MP, called for the book to be banned, and for Richler to be prosecuted for disseminating hate propaganda. Johnson, William. \\"Oh, Mordecai. Oh, Quebec.\\" The Globe and Mail July 7, 2001. https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/books/2015/03/13/mordecai- richler-would-have-enjoyed-montreal-memorial-controversy.html Allegations surrounding Groulx In his lifetime, Groulx made the following statement: \\"L'antis√©mitisme, non seulement n'est pas une solution chr√©tienne; c'est une solution n√©gative et niaise.\\" (\\"Not only is antisemitism not a christian solution; it is a negative and silly solution.\\")BRASSER, ¬´Lionel Groulx¬ª, L'Action nationale, april 1993,; quoted by Gary CALDWELL, op.cit., p. 242. Immigration by non-Catholics Groulx's alleged antisemitism has made him a controversial figure. Groulx's supporters have declared that his antisemitism has to be understood in the context of his conservative Catholic beliefs. Groulx perceived adherents of religions different from his own Catholic church as being opposed to his religion. While Groulx was opposed to all non-Catholics, Groulx had expressed a particular hatred of Jewish people and Judaism in particular. Groulx opposed immigration to Canada by Jews, Mennonites, Mormons, and other non-Catholics. Jewish arrivals to Canada Groulx was opposed to admitting, even temporarily, Jews fleeing the Holocaust in Europe; as outlined by historians Abella and Troper in their study None is Too Many. During the period he was studying in Europe, he wrote letters to his family in which he asserted that everything possible should be done to keep Jews out of Quebec. French Canadian race The writings of Lionel Groulx also espoused the idea of ethnic superiority. His pedagogical novel, L'Appel de la race (The Call of the Race) taught that \\"the children of ethnically mixed marriages suffer from a form of schizophrenia because they are inhabited by two different souls.\\" Groulx posited the existence of the French-Canadians as a heroic pure-blooded race that had been degraded by conquest, and lured away from their birth-right by foreign influences; the negative aspects of which he identified with Jews, as well as with the English and Americans. Supersessionism Groulx's conception of the French Canadians as race resembles his Roman Catholic conception of the Jews as a Holy Nation and God's Chosen People. As he explained in his diary, the French were \\"l'Isra√´l des temps nouveaux choisi par Dieu pour √™tre le supr√™me boulevard de la foi du Christ venu, l'√©p√©e et le bouclier de la justice catholique\\" ('Israel of the new times chosen by God to be the ultimate bulwark of the faith of Christ's coming, the sword and the shield of Catholic justice).Lionel Groulx, Journal 1895‚Äì1911, vol. 1, Huot and Bergeron, eds., 1984, pp. 393‚Äì94. In this context, Groulx could be seen as playing a role analogous to the biblical prophets, denouncing the worship of the false gods of secularism, modernity and urban culture while calling his people back to what he understood as their true heritage. The French-Canadian \\"nation\\" whose suffering, Groulx imagined, had been ordained by God, was part of a divine plan as he saw it, to bring the \\"true faith,\\" in his conception of Roman Catholicism, to the North American continent. Inter-war period In the inter-war period, Groulx was an avowed admirer of far-right dictators Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar and Benito Mussolini and hoped Quebec would find strong leadership. The occupation of that role by a politician like Maurice Duplessis was for him a bitter disappointment. The journal L'Action fran√ßaise took its title from a journal in France of the same name founded and edited by the far right writer Charles Maurras, but the Quebec journal later changed its name to L'action canadienne- fran√ßaise after Maurras' movement was condemned by the Vatican in 1926. European influences Some historians have claimed that, while studying in Europe between 1906 and 1909, Groulx fell under the influence of disciples of the prominent 19th century French racist Joseph de GobineauMason Wade, The French-Canadians 1760‚Äì1967, vol. 2, p. 867. (author of An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, 1853‚Äì55, the first systematic presentation of general racist theory, which had a strong influence on German and French anti- semitism), although later in his life Groulx denied any such influence. Influence on French Quebec Groulx's writings and views are virtually unknown outside of Quebec; however, he has been recognized as having a profound influence on French Quebec, its representatives, and its politicians. His anti-semitism had been noted by historians such as Mason Wade and heavily documented by archivist David Rome, but because of the controversy over his alleged expressed hatred of the Jewish people that Delisle's writing brought to the forefront, some individuals raised the issue of the appropriateness of having a prominent Montreal Metro station named after Groulx. Metro station naming dispute Consequently, in November 1996, a request was made to the Executive Committee of the Montreal Urban Community to remove Groulx's name from the Lionel Groulx Metro station. This prominent Metro station, a hub in the city's subway network, continues to bear Groulx's name, although a campaign has been launched to rename the station after the Montreal jazz pianist Oscar Peterson, who died recently.

Network support The SPARCstation IPX comes with an on-board AMD Lance Am7990 Ethernet chipset, which provides an AUI connection. External AUI transceivers are required for connection to 10Base5, 10Base2, 10baseT, or other Ethernet physical layer media. The OpenBoot ROM is able to boot from network, using RARP and TFTPhttps://www.netbsd.org/docs/network/netboot/intro.sun.html. Like all other SPARCstation systems, the IPX holds system information such as MAC address and serial number in NVRAM. If the battery on this chip dies, then the system will not be able to boot unaided. (The boot parameters can be entered manually, but will be lost on power off.)  Integrated Framebuffer  The SPARCstation IPX includes an integrated Sun Turbo GX cgsix color framebufferhttps://man-k.org/man/NetBSD-current/4/sparc/cgsix on the internal SBus. This frees one SBus slot from framebuffer duty, which makes the SPARCstation IPX as expandable as the larger form factor SPARCstation 2, with which it otherwise shares many architectural similarities.  NVRAM  The SPARCstation IPX uses an M48T02 battery-backed RTC with RAM chip which handles the real time clock and boot parameter storage. The only problem with this chip is that the battery is internal, which means the entire chip must be replaced when its battery runs out. As all sun4c machines are now older than the battery life of this chip, a substantial number of these systems now refuse to boot. Additionally, the sun4c design used the reserved bits in the M48T02's NVRAM in a non-standard way; since later revisions of the M48T02 chip exert stricter control over these bits, a current M48T02 will store the NVRAM data, but the RTC will not function correctly and the system may fail to auto- boot. Due to incompatibilities with modern M48T02s, it is common to modify failed NVRAMs by cutting into the encapsulation and patching in a new battery. http://www.menet.umn.edu/~bob/FAQ/sun-nvram-hostid.faq It is also possible to replace the entire encapsulation, which also contains a 32.768 KHz clock crystal. https://www.vintage-radio.net/forum/showthread.php?t=71241 Operating systems The following operating systems will run on a SPARCstation IPX: *SunOS 4.1.1 onwards *Solaris 2.0 to Solaris 7 (sun4c dropped in Solaris 8) *Linux - Some, but not all, distributions still support this sparc32 sub-architecture *NetBSD/sparc32 since 1.0 *OpenBSD/sparc32 - All versions up to 5.9 (OpenBSD 5.9 was the last release to support SPARC32https://www.openbsd.org/sparc.html)  Related computers  The SPARCstation IPC (Sun 4/40) is an earlier lunchbox form factor system The SPARCstation 2 (Sun 4/75) is architecturally very similar and can use the same CPU and SBus RAM upgrades.

Biography  A modest land and slave-ownerStewart County tax records, Stewart County Archives, Dover, TN, and 1860 Federal Slave Census (accessed at FamilySearch.org) of Scotch-Irish descent, Hinson opposed secession from the Union in both the February and June, 1861 elections Stewart County election returns, Stewart County Archives, Dover, TN. He had welcomed Union General Ulysses S. Grant to his home when Grant was in the area during the Union attack on Forts Henry and Donelson in February 1862. However, Hinson took up arms after his family was ill-treated and turned out of their home by Federal troops without any compensation, later in 1862. The house was later burned. On December 31, 1862, Hinson killed his neutral neighbor, Swiss immigrant Albert Rougemont, with whom he had had a long-running argument for years before the war, and whom he blamed for his house having been burned. The murder was investigated by the Union Provost Marshal, with many of Hinson's neighbors attesting to his decades of violence before the war and his well- known 'Secesh' position at the outset of the war. The verdict of the Provost Marshal was not recorded.File 04220, United States Union Provost Marshal Files of Two or More Civilians, 1861-1866.\\" Images. FamilySearch. http://FamilySearch.org : 14 June 2016. Citing NARA microfilm publication M416. Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d. A persistent but never documented aspect of the Hinson legend is that his career as a sniper was due to young sons being murdered. However, no documentation has ever been cited for this claim, and the only 3 contemporary accounts known of him give a different reason for his vengeance (his family being ill-treated and turned out of their home.) For the remainder of the war, Hinson used a 50 caliber Kentucky long rifle to conduct a personal war against the Union Army. He targeted Union soldiers at distances as great as half-mile on land and on military transports and gunboats on the Tennessee River and the Cumberland River. Hinson is credited with as many as one hundred kills, although his rifle had only 36 notches on it. (The notches were said to be for officers.) Hinson served as a guide for Nathan Bedford Forrest during his successful cavalry raid on the Union supply base at Johnsonville, Tennessee in November 1864. Hinson's son Robert led a guerrilla band in the area until he was killed in action on September 18, 1863. Hinson himself evaded capture, despite elements of four Union regiments being assigned at different times to pursue him. He lived the rest of his life peacefully, mostly in Stewart County, settling the estate of his son George, voting, paying his taxes, etc., but also getting into some legal trouble as he had often done before the war.Stewart Circuit Court Loose Records, Stewart County Archives, Dover, TN. In 1867, he sold 7 acres of timber off of his \\"Bubbling Springs\\" farm to the first Superintendent of the new National Cemetery.Stewart County Deed Book 23, page C; original at Stewart County Courthouse, Dover, TN, also accessible on FamilySearch.org Hinson died on April 28, 1874 at his residence in the White Oak/Magnolia area of Houston County, Tennessee. On the morning of his death, he complained of a severe pain between the shoulders. Remedies were applied, but no relief came and he died six hours after being taken. The attack was supposed to be meningitis. He is buried in the family plot in the Cane Creek Cemetery, off White Oak Road, near McKinnon, Tennessee. A monument to him is also located in the Boyd Cemetery in the Land-Between-the Lakes area. His 1874 obituary stated that he was interred at the Boyd Cemetery. Area newspapers in 1873 had been full of stories about the pursuit and capture of \\"Captain Jack\\", but those references are to Modoc chief Kintpuash, not to Hinson.

Titan Books also released British versions, the softcover in June 2009 () and the hardcover in August of the same year (). The author, Mat Johnson, is an African-American who, due to his light skin, was able to be perceived as a white person. As a child he played games where he pretended to be an undercover black person investigating white hate crimes against blacks. He learned that Walter White, who served as the chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), pretended to be a white person in order to investigate lynchings. In addition, he received inspiration from the 2005 birth of two twins, one of whom appears white and the other appears black.Gustines, George Gene. \\"Black and White and Graphic All Over: A 1930s Tale of Race, Passing and Pain.\\" The New York Times. March 3, 2008. Retrieved on April 30, 2013. Plot synopsis Zane Pinchback is a reporter for a black newspaper in the early 1930s New York City. He has built his career investigating lynchings while undercover as a white person, as he is light-skinned enough to pass for white. He is about to retire, but then fate intervenes as his brother is charged with the brutal murder of a white woman in Mississippi. Fearing that his brother will be lynched before given a chance to clear his name, Zane decides to go on one final investigation to free him, and brings along a friend who hopes to assume his job after he retires. Characters * Zane Pinchback - Zane is an undercover reporter for the fictional black-owned newspaper The New Holland Herald newspaper based out of New York City. He takes undercover missions into the Southern United States to investigate lynchings which are ignored by newspapers owned by White Americans. Zane decides to quit these missions in favor of doing work based on the Harlem Renaissance but his editor asks him to take one more mission into Tupelo, Mississippi. George Gene Gustines of The New York Times described Zane as a \\"confident charmer\\". * Carl - Zane's friend, who accompanies him in his mission to Mississippi. During his mission he pretends to be a baron from Europe. Gustines described Carl as \\"cocky and confrontational\\" and that \\"Though his style ultimately lands him in dire trouble, Carl‚Äôs method of jumping into the thick of things generates almost as much information as Zane‚Äôs restraint.\\" * Alonzo Pinchback - Zane's twin brother, who was accused of murdering Michaela Mathers, a local White woman. Alonzo, Michaela's boyfriend, had set up an illegal moonshine business with her. Gustines said that Alonzo \\"presumably has darker skin\\" than Zane. In the book, two characters see a resemblance between Alonzo and Zane only after being told that the two men are brothers. Reception The book has received positive reviews in The New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and Seattle Times.Caron, p. 144. George Gene Gustines of The New York Times wrote that Incognegro \\"proudly exemplifies the graphic novel.\\" Nisi Shawl of the Seattle Times wrote that \\"With its savvy comments on racial politics and privilege, \\"Incognegro\\" is a valiant and successful effort to redeem the past without rewriting it.\\"Shawl, Nisi. \\"\\"Incognegro\\" Black, white and injustice all over.\\" Seattle Times.

Al-Hamra receives its name from the al-Hamra clan, a branch of the al- Suqur (\\"the Falcons\\") tribe.

It is considered to be one of the most important bookbinding companies of the 20th century, famous for its luxurious jeweled bindings that used real gold and precious stones in their book covers. Sangorski & Sutcliffe was established by Francis Sangorski (1875‚Äì1912) and George Sutcliffe (1878‚Äì1943). They had met in 1896 at a bookbinding evening classes taught by Douglas Cockerell at the London County Council's Central School of Arts and Crafts. In 1898, Sangorski and Sutcliffe each won one of the ten annual craft scholarship awards, giving them ¬£20 a year for three years to continue their training as apprentice bookbinders. They were employed at Cockerell's own bindery, and began to teach bookbinding at Camberwell College of Art. They were laid off in 1901 after a coal strike caused an economic slump, and they decided to set up on their own in a rented attic in Bloomsbury, starting on 1 October 1901. They soon moved to Vernon Place, and then, in 1905, to Southampton Row. Sangorski's elder brother, Alberto Sangorski (1862‚Äì1932), worked for the firm. He became an accomplished calligrapher and illuminator, working for Rivi√®re from 1910. They quickly revived the art of jewelled bookbindings, decorating their sumptuous multi- colour leather book bindings with gold inlay and precious and semi-precious jewels. They were commissioned to create a most luxurious binding of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, the front cover of which was adorned with three golden peacocks with jewelled tails and surrounded by heavily tooled and gilded vines, that was sent on the ill-fated RMS Titanic in 1912. The book, known as the Great Omar, sank with the ship and has not been recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sangorski drowned. Sutcliffe continued the firm, which became recognised as one of the leading bookbinders in London. The bindery moved to Poland Street, and managed to survive through the First World War, the Great Depression, the Second World War, and post-war austerity. In this period, it undertook work for the Ashendene Press, Golden Cockerel Press and the J. & E. Bumpus bookshop. It also created miniature books for Queen Mary's Dolls' House. After Sutcliffe suffered a stroke in 1936, he entrusted the business to his nephew, Stanley Bray (1907‚Äì1995), who had worked for his uncle since 1926. The company merged with HT Woods in 1939, bringing Kenneth Hobson to the firm. He introduced a more modern style of binding. Bray inherited the company on Sutcliffe's death. The firm merged again in 1988, joining with Zaehnsdorf's bindery in Bermondsey (established by Joseph Zaehnsdorf in 1842). The combined business was bought by Asprey in 1985 and renamed SSZ Limited. Shepherds, a bookbinding company, bought the company from Asprey in 1998, and revived the Sangorski & Sutcliffe name. The bindery recently moved from its premises in Bermondsey to Rochester Row. A second copy of the Omar Khayyam was bound as World War II broke out and this was placed in a bank safe vault for safe keeping, but enemy bombing destroyed the vault and the second copy. Stanley Bray after his retirement made a Third version of the binding using the original design, this is now in the British Library.

The Nuyaka Mission is included on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma.

Initially the Creek principal chief proposed to name the mission Robertson Institute, in honor of William S. Robertson, but his daughter, Augusta, wrote a letter stating that the family preferred that the name should be from the Creek language. Therefore, Nuyaka Mission was named for the nearby Creek town of Nuyaka. According to one source, the name Nuyaka is from the Creek pronunciation for New York, which was the site of a meeting between President George Washington and 26 Creek chiefs. The meeting was to discuss a treaty and to obtain a cession of Creek land to the U, S. Government. Reportedly, the Creeks were so impressed with New York City that they named one of their towns for it. White men wrote the town name as Nuyaka.Federal Writers Project of the Works Progress Administration. Oklahoma: A Guide to the Sooner State. (1941) University of Oklahoma. Available on line from Google Books. Ironically, some of the official correspondence cited by Carolyn Thomas Foreman, gives the name as \\"New Yorker Mission\\" and \\"Nuyarker Mission.\\" The mission consisted of four buildings. One building contained a chapel/assembly room and some school class rooms. The second building held the superintendent's apartment and housed the boys. The other two buildings were cottages that housed the girls and the teachers who supervised them. Initially, the mission enrolled seventy boys and girls. It had seven female teachers and one man who supervised the boys after school hours. Rev. Thomas Ward Perryman, a Creek who had been educated at Tullahassee Mission, was the first pastor and taught religious classes. Per the granite marker at the site: \\"Established in 1882 by the Creek Council, Nuyaka Mission was a boarding school for Boys and Girls by the Presbyterians from 1884 to 1899. The Creek Tribe then operated the school for ten years. From 1909 until 1921 it was operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. From 1921 to 1933 it was operated by the Baptists.\\" \\"In 1936, the buildings were removed and E.E. Mount bought the site to prevent its destruction. In 1937, his daughter and son-in-law, Oakla and Bill Spears, bought the site and lived in the Dormitory Superintendent's home for 54 years. Interested in the site's history, they interviewed former students and children of former superintendents.

Norway is a case argued before the European Court of Human Rights during late 2008. The Court found that the specific prohibition (blanket ban) of political TV advertising in Norway constituted a breach against Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Context  During the spring of 2003, Rogaland Pensioners Party bought the rights to air three different political advertisements for their political party, as regional elections in Norway were due 15 September 2003, on the local TV channel TV Vest. Upon notifying the Norwegian Media Authority about the commercials, the Media Authority warned the broadcaster that broadcasting political advertising is illegal in Norway and considered fining TV Vest if the commercials were aired. The commercials were nevertheless broadcast during 11 days from 14 August to 13 September, which prompted the Media Authority to fine TV Vest 35,000 Norwegian kroner for violating the political advertising ban. TV Vest then appealed to the Oslo City Court, who found the airing constituted a violation of the ban. TV Vest then appealed to the Supreme Court, who granted leave to appeal. TV Vest meant that the ban violated Article 10, but the Supreme Court found by 4-1 that no such violation had occurred.  Judgment  The Court found that the ban on political advertising itself did not constitute a violation of Article 10, since its target were to avoid large parties with large funding from achieving more airtime than other parties who lacked funds. However, Rogaland Pensioners Party is a small party (receiving only 2,5% of the regional votes in the 2003 election) with minor media coverage, and who did not receive any other relevant airtime during the election coverage than the broadcast advertisements in question. Since the Court neither found the content of the advertisement to be offensive or capable of lowering the political debate, the interference was found to be unnecessary in a democratic society, therefore being a violation of European Convention on Human Rights.

In 1795 she was the cause of an international incident when she fired on . She was at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, and during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars took numerous prizes, mostly merchant vessels but also including some privateers. She was also at the second Battle of Copenhagen in 1807. She was sold in April 1813. She then became the whaler Recovery. She made 12 whaling voyages, the last one ending in 1843, at which time her owner had her broken up. French Revolutionary War Lynx was commissioned in April 1794 under Commander Charles Vinicombe Penrose on the Halifax Station.

Lloyd's List later reported that Amphitrite, Tardiff, master, had arrived at Antigua. The report credited the capture to Cleopatra.LL 31 March 1795, ‚Ññ2703. On 31 January 1795, Rear-Admiral George Murray, the commander-in-chief on the North America station, sent Lynx, under the command of John Poo Beresford, and the newly-captured former French warship on a cruise out of Halifax. On 1 March the two vessels captured Cocarde Nationale (or National Cockade), a privateer from Charleston, South Carolina, of 14 guns, six swivels and 80 men. Esperance and Lynx recaptured the ship Norfolk, of Belfast, and the brig George, of Workington. Lynx and Eagle The United States Coast Guard records that in 1795, Lynx, under the command of Beresford, fired a shot across the bow of the United States revenue cutter . Hendrick Fischer, Eagles acting captain, attempted to heave-to, but he had on board Senator Pierce Butler, from South Carolina, who ordered him to sail on. Lynx then began to fire continuously as Eagle sailed towards the shoal waters on the north point of Jekyll Island. As Lynx drew too much water to continue the chase, Beresford sent his pinnace and cutter in pursuit, under the command of Lieutenant Alexander Skene, who four years later would command Lynx. The British quickly overtook the schooner and came on board, demanding to know why it had not come about in response to the shots. After learning the schooner was in fact a revenue vessel of the U.S. government, Skene and his men returned to Lynx. In the ensuing international political furor, Beresford stated that Lynx had been beyond the limit and noted that the schooner was not flying any flag. Eagle had not in fact flown the national ensign; for unexplained reasons it was instead stored in the captain's cabin. Eagle did apparently display some sort of small pennant that was not visible to Lynx. Unfortunately, the United States Coast Guard history of Eagle represents the only record of the incident. Prize taking On 9 June 1795 Lynx captured Bedford, which had some bullion amongst her cargo. Rowley was apparently again her captain. On 3 July Commander Robert Hall was appointed to command Lynx, but apparently the Admiralty did not confirm the appointment until January 1796.Burke, Edmund, Annual Register, Vol. 84, p.269. In August 1795 Commander Thomas Tireman took command of Lynx. On 24 February 1796, Lynx captured the Hannah. Commander John Rennie replaced Tireman in February 1797. Then in October Hall replaced Rennie and finally took command. On 13 June 1798, Lynx captured the French privateer Isabelle, of two guns and 30 men. Two weeks later, she captured Mentor, also a French privateer, of 14 six pounders and 79 men. During the chase, Mentor threw six of her guns overboard to lighten her and thus, albeit insufficiently, improve her speed. Both privateers had set out from Puerto Rico to cruise the coast of the United States. Around this time Lynx captured the privateer Solide. The merchants of St. Johns sent Hall a letter of appreciation for the protection this capture gave to the colony.The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 172, p.207. On 6 July Lynx captured the American ship Pegasus. Four days later Lynx recaptured the American ship Liberty, from Philadelphia and bound for Liverpool, which a French privateer had captured on 4 July, a few hours after Liberty had left the Delaware River. On 8 August Lynx recaptured Friendship. On 17 September 1799 Lynx captured the brigantine Columbia. In October, Commander Alexander Skene took over command of Lynx. On 31 August 1800 Lynx captured Vernang. Then on 8 September she captured Vrow Neltje. The gun-vessel shared in the capture of Vrow Neltje. In June 1801 Lynx returned to Britain from Copenhagen carrying Captain John F. Devonshire and dispatches.The United service magazine, Part 1, p.97. She does not appear to have participated in the Battle of Copenhagen in April as her name does not appear in the list of vessels whose crews qualified to share in the prize money stemming from the battle, nor in the list of vessels whose crew qualified for the Naval General Service Medal for the battle. Shortly thereafter, on 15 April, Lynx captured the Dutch vessels Charlottenburg and Lucchesine. Then on 31 July Lynx and captured Brockmerlust, with the capture of Neptunus following on 1 August. The next day Jalouse and Lynx captured the Vrow Caterine. On 8 August Lynx and captured Vryheid. Eight days later, Lynx and captured Prosperitas. On 6 September Lynx, Jalouse, Squirrel and Driver shared in the capture of three vessels, Snelle, Jager, and Engestede. Six days later, Lynx, Driver and shared in the capture of Cygnet. The next day Lynx and Driver captured Jussrow Harmyna. On 17 September Lynx, , and recaptured Pursuit. On 11 November Lynx and Driver captured Norden. Commander John Willoughby Marshall took command of Lynx in June 1802. Napoleonic Wars In the months before the resumption of war with France, the Navy started preparations that included impressing seamen. The crews of outbound Indiamen were an attractive target. and were sitting in the Thames in March 1803, taking their crews on board just prior to sailing. At sunset, a press gang from HMS Immortalite rowed up to Woodford, while boats from and Lynx approached Ganges. As the press gangs approached they were noticed, and the crews of both Indiamen were piped to quarters. That is, they assembled on the decks armed with pikes and cutlasses, and anything they could throw. The officers in charge of the press gangs thought this mere bravado and pulled alongside the Indiamen, only to meet a severe resistance from the crewmen, who had absolutely no desire to serve in the Royal Navy. The men from Immortalite suffered several injuries from shot and pike that were thrown at them, and eventually the marines opened fire with muskets, killing two sailors on Woodford. Even so, the press gangs were not able to get on board either Indiaman, and eventually withdrew some distance. When Woodfords officers finally permitted the press gang from Immortalite to board, all they found on board were a few sickly sailors. On 23 May 1803, Lynx and Immortalite captured the French ship Paix. A year later, on 10 May 1804, Lynx and captured Union. In July 1804 Lynx took numerous prizes. She took Four Brothers and Nike (or Nilea) on 10 July, Jonge Pieter Casper Piersberg on 12 July, and the brigs Jonge Jan and Jacobus Zeeper on 30 July. Lloyd's List reported that Lynx was in company with the sloop and the gun-brig , and that together they captured 10 vessels that were sailing from Riga to Embden carrying masts. By this account the vessels they captured were: Vrow Hermina, Bowman, master; Juno, Gulzeet, master; Frau Margaretta, Roloff, master; General Van Bloucher, Ruyle, master; Jonge Oune & Brower, Ruyle, master; Four Brothers, Stemmings, master; Jonge Peter Caspar, Jobs, master; Gute Foffnung; and Piepersburg. The British sent their captives into Yarmouth.Lloyd's List, no.4474, ‚Äì accessed 16 October 2014. In April 1806 Lynx captured several Prussian vessels. These were Electrum, Romulus, Goode Intentie, and Vrow Mazka, on the 15th, 21st, and 26th. Earlier, in company with and , Lynx captured the Prussian ship Einigkeit on 6 April. They also captured Jonge Ebeling, Freundschaft, and Morgenstern off Lieth. Then on 20 April Lynx captured another Prussian vessel, Fortuna. On 21 April 1807, Lynx recaptured the brig Providence, Edward Fox, Master. Lynx, the hired armed cutter , and shared in the proceeds of the capture of the Danish merchant-vessel Adjutor, on 6 August. Eight days later Lynx, Resolution and shared in the capture of Aurora. Lynx shared with in the capture of Catharina Frederika on 3 June. That same day the two British ships also captured the Philip. On 13 July they captured Jussrouw Antje. The gun-brig shared with Lynx the capture, on 7 May, of Rebecca and Jonge Tobias. Lynx also shared in the prize money for captures at Heligoland on 5 September in connection with the surrender of the Danish fleet at the Battle of Copenhagen. On 22 March 1808, Lynx, , and were presentLogbook of HMS Falcon held at National Archives, Kew, London ‚Äì reference ADM51/4446. at the Battle of Zealand Point, though they did not actually take part in the battle. In the battle the ships of the line and Nassau succeeded in destroying the Danish ship of the line . In May, Lynx shared with in the capture of a schuyt. While sailing in company with the gun-brig , Lynx captured Jagten Sophia Cecilia on 12 July. On 16 November Lynx captured three vessels: Neptune, Resolution, and Elizabeth. In December, Lynx captured Achir, Kairn, Elizabeth, Haabert, Spimgeren, Venus, St. Andreas, Nicholay, and Ann, on the 11th, 13th, 14th, and 15 December. On 30 April 1809 , in company with Lynx and , captured Charlotte. On 12 August, Commander John Willoughby Marshall and Lynx, in the company of the gun-brig under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Fitzgerald, discovered three Danish luggers off the Danish coast. The water was too shallow for Lynx, so Marshall sent Monkey and boats from Lynx in to cut them out. The largest of the luggers, which had four guns and four howitzers, opened fire on Monkey before all three luggers ran ashore once Monkey and the launch's 18-pounder carronade returned fire. The British refloated the luggers and brought them out the next day, having taken no casualties. In their haste to quit the vessel, the Danes failed to fire the fuse on a cask of gunpowder they had left by the fireplace on the largest lugger. Marshall thought the Danes' behaviour in leaving the explosive device disgraceful. The largest lugger was Captain Japen (or Captain Jassen). She had had a crew of 45 men, who had fled, and during the engagement she had thrown two of her howitzers overboard. The second lugger, name unknown, had four guns and a crew of 20. The third lugger was Speculation, of three guns and 19 men. Her crew too had thrown two guns overboard. At the end of the month, on 27 August, Lynx captured a Danish sloop that also bore the name Speculation. On 28 October 1809 captured Destrigheiden, Rinaldine and a sloop, name unknown, while in the company of Tartar and Lynx. By agreement, Marshall and Commander Joseph Baker of Tartar pooled their share of the prize money with that due Lieutenant Daniel Carpenter, the commander of Cheerful. Vanguard and were in company with Lynx on 2 November when they captured Ornen and another vessel. Lynx was again in company with Vanguard on 4 November when they captured Frende Broder. Five days later Lynx captured the Danish sloops St. Ole and Sterkadder. On 29 and 30 April Lynx, the gun-brig and the frigate captured three privateers. On the 29th they captured Juliana off Wismar. Juliana had six guns but a crew of only 23 men. The next day they captured Ziska off Trindelen. She was armed with six guns and had a crew of 40 men. At the same time they captured Omen, of one gun. On 30 May 1810, Lynx and Flamer captured the Danish vessel Hercules. By agreement, the British vessels shared the proceeds with Fisgard. The three vessels also shared in Fisgards capture of the French privateer Furet, of two guns, off Warnem√ºnde. Lynx again shared by agreement with Fisgard in the proceeds of the recapture of Margaretha Catarina and James Cook on 10 June. Fisgard also shared by agreement her portion with Flamer, as well as the proceeds of the capture of Gopa on 22 June. On 9 July 1810, Lynx captured the Danish sloop Wanderingsmannen. Flamer shared in the prize. In October Commander Thomas Percival took command. Then on 20 December Lynx captured Fortuna. Two days later, Lynx came across the derelict Providence at sea. Lynx took possession and in 1811 received salvage money for the vessel. Disposal Lynx was laid up at Deptford in May 1811. The \\"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\\" first offered \\"Lynx, of 425 tons\\", lying at Deptford, for sale on 28 April 1813. She was sold there for ¬£1330 on 24 April 1813. Whaler Daniel Bennett purchased Lynx in 1813 and renamed her Recovery. She replaced a Recovery that Bennett had just had broken up. Over the course of his career as a shipowner, Bennett owned more that 50 vessels, all or almost all whalers that worked in the Southern Whale Fishery. Recovery entered Lloyd's Register in 1814 with Bacon, master, Bennet, owner, and trade London‚ÄìSouth Seas.Lloyd's Register (1814), Seq.‚ÑñR81. 1st whaling voyage (1813‚Äì1814): Captain William Beacon, who had been master of the previous Recovery, sailed Recovery from England on 9 August 1813.

It is located next to Highway 66, between the modern kibbutzim of HaZore'a and Mishmar HaEmek. The site includes tell called Tel Zariq () or Tell Abu Zureiq, a spring called Ein Zariq and other sites around it. The site was surveyed by Avner Raban expedition as part of the survey of the Mishmar HaEmek area between 1974 and 1976. Based on the pottery collected by his team, the site was inhabited continuously from the Neolithic to the Ottoman periods.Ayala Sussmann, Avner Raban, 2013, Tel Zariq In the 20th century, it was a Palestinian Turkmen village in the Haifa Subdistrict of Mandatory Palestine, situated near Wadi Abu Zurayq. It was depopulated on April 12‚Äì13 during and after the Battle of Mishmar HaEmek of the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. Geography Abu Zurayq was situated in the northern foothills of an area overlooking the Jezreel Valley called \\"Bilad al-Rawha\\" (The Fragrant Country). It depended on a number of water sources in its vicinity including an Ein Abu Zurayq spring, the Wadi Abu Zurayq stream and a well.Khalidi, 1992, p. 143  History  The prehistoric site of Abu Zurayq was found south of the mound, on the sloping terrace east of the foothills of the Menashe Heights. During the Neolithic period there was a large lake next to the site covering part of what is today the Jezreel Valley. The site was excavated by three different expeditions. The first was headed by Jean Perrot in 1962 and excavated south of the mound. The final report of the excavation was published by Yosef Garfinkel and Zinovi Matskevich in 2002. The second expedition included Italians from Centro Camuno di Studi Preistorici and Israelis from the Tel Aviv University and the Wilfrid Israel museum. They excavated the site from December 1970 to April 1971. The third expedition headed by Aviram Oshri on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, conducted a salvage excavation at the site after the construction of light posts for the Zariq junction near the site has damaged antiquities. Perrot's excavation has revealed a few Paleolithic flints in very bad shape. The Italian-Israeli expedition has dated similar finds to the Upper Paleolithic period. Neither found any artifacts from the preceding Epipalaeolithic periodGarfinkel and Matskevich (2002), p. 131 so it is understood the site was abandoned in that period and only resettled again during the Neolithic period. The Italian-Israeli expedition noticed two distinct cultures appearing in Abu Zurayq in the Neolithic, one named \\"Middle Neolithic\\", beginning in the late 7th or 6th millennium BC and the other called \\"Late Neolithic\\", beginning in the 5th millennium BCE. The \\"Late Neolithic\\" settlement is identified by Garfinkel and Matskevich as part of the Wadi Raba culture. This period is well documented by all three expeditions. This settlement was succeeded by a Chalcolithic settlement in the 4th millennium BC and later by the Early Bronze Age in the 3rd millennium BC, indicating a consecutive settlement sequence.  Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods   6th millennium BCE  The Italian-Israeli expedition has found well-preserved remains of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods. The expedition studied three areas and in one of them, 15 settlement phases of these periods were noticed. Emmanuel Anati has divided the findings into two main periods, the \\"Middle Neolithic\\" period from the 6th millennium BC and the \\"Late Neolithic\\" period of the 5th millennium. The earliest Neolithic farmers, belonging to the \\"Middle Neolithic\\" culture according to Anati, had an advanced culture. Their houses were made of pits dug up to 1.5 meters below the surface. They were roofed with hardened mud mixed with straw. Within these houses, they had campfires and stone installations that stored their various tools. The economy of this settlement was based on various practices such as hunting, fishing, animal husbandry, agriculture and trade. The tools recovered by the excavation were diverse. Flint tools included axes, saws, sickles and others. Among the flint tools were arrow and javelin heads used as weapons. The pottery of this culture was thick and hard, but well fired, a unique phenomenon in the eyes of the excavators. These included simple and large storage and cooking vessels, mostly burnished. The stone objects included millstone, mortar and pestles and weights, probably used for fishing nets. Since little was known about this period, Anati has described this culture as an independent culture.  5th millennium BCE (Wadi Rabah culture)  In the Italian-Israeli excavations at least eight settlement phases of the \\"Late Neolithic\\" culture of the 5th millennium were excavated. These settlers had a more complicated architecture that included well-built walls and plastered or stone-paved floors. Their dwellings were much more permanent than the pit-houses of the previous culture. A large amount of pottery, flint, stone and bone tools were discovered in these layers. The early pottery of this period was mostly painted red. As time progressed, the potters made impressions and incised decorations to their pots. In the later phases of this period, the pottery was lustrous, painted red and black and burnished. Interesting findings from this period are non-local pottery that was acquired by trade. These include pottery of the Yarmukian culture but also pottery that is originated in areas further to the north of the Mediterranean coast such as the Amuq Valley and Mersin, in Cilicia. In the 2002 final report of Perrot's excavation, Yosef Garfinkel and Zinovi Matskevich claim that this \\"Late Neolithic\\" culture is actually the Wadi Raba culture. In Perrot's excavation an area of 70 square meters was excavated and within it, remains of the 5th millennium BCE of the Wadi Raba culture culture were found. The site yielded the remains of stone walls, pebble pavements, pits and installations. Because of the small size of the excavation, these finds did not provide a clear architectural picture, but it is clear that these finds represent more than one settlement phase.Garfinkel and Matskevich (2002), p. 129‚Äì132 The findings indicate a wide variety of practices centered around a single entity, which may have been a single autonomous household that relied on domesticated animals and plants. Evidence for external relations are seen in imported raw materials such as basalt, seashells and obsidian, brought to the site from places close or very far from the site.Garfinkel and Matskevich (2002), p. 163 The analysis of the findings is based on pottery, stone objects and others. The pottery analysis is based only on complete vessels and definitive potsherds (such as rims, handles and bases). These were mostly found in a certain area of the excavation. They are divided into three different craft levels. A first group, composed of large vessels, is made of unrefined clay, fired at low heat. A second group includes medium-sized vessels that are made of finer clay and were well fired. The last group represents only a small fraction of the findings and was made of well- refined clay which is also rich in carbonates, appearing white.Garfinkel and Matskevich (2002), p. 132‚Äì133 Most of the pottery is decorated, mostly with slipping, painting and impressions.Garfinkel and Matskevich (2002), p. 146 Among the stone objects there were over a hundred tools for a variety of uses including agriculture, wood-making and animal products.Garfinkel and Matskevich (2002), p. 148, Other findings include Sling stones, two figurines, one looks like a dog and the other represents a female, a bone tool used for cutting and polishing, punched seashells and a sandstone painted with ochre.Garfinkel and Matskevich (2002), p. 161‚Äì163 The salvage 1996 salvage excavation yielded a Wadi Rabah silo, 1 meter deep and 1 meter in diameter, which at some point was used for waste. Next to the silo is a grave with a human skeleton. It seems that before the burial, the thigh bone was removed from the skeleton.  Bronze Age  Based on Raban's survey, during the Early Bronze Age II-III periods (3rd millennium BC), the first urban period in the land, a settlement with a size of used to exist in Abu Zurayq. In the Middle Bronze Age II period (2500-2000 BC), the second urban period in the land, the size of the settlement was approximately . South of the unexcavated mound is a burial cave, dug into a soft limestone exposure, with two chambers and a total length of 9 meters. At least ten people were buried in this cave, which is relatively a small number considering that the pottery found in the cave span a time frame of 300 years from the 17th to 14th centuries BCE (From the Middle Bronze Age II to the Late Bronze Age II). The initial analysis of the vessels, oil lamps and bronze objects found in the cave revealed that many of the vessels are of Cypriot origin and one is of Mycenaean origin. Late Bronze Age I pottery is absent from the cave and indicates a possible gap in the use of the cave during the LB I period. and the presence of a terracotta figurine of a bird-shaped woman with large pierced ears, a style common in LB II Cyprus. Since it is rare to find such figurine in the Levant, it is likely that it was imported from Cyprus. An isolated Late Bronze Age structure, described as a \\"farm-house\\" was also discovered.Gonen, 1992, p. 55  Ottman and British Mandatory periods  The village was named after Abu Zurayq al- Attili, a local Muslim saint from Attil who was buried in the village.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 74 In 1878, Abu Zurayq was listed as a spring instead of a populated place.\\"The spring of the Magpie\\"; Palmer, 1881, p. 142 Towards the start of WW I, the first house was built in Abu Zurayq by Samir al-Isa, followed by a second house built during the war by Abd al-Karem Abd al-Shitawi.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 75 Abu Zurayq's inhabitants were largely of nomadic Turkmen descent, although by the 20th century, they spoke only Arabic and considered themselves Arabs. They were part of the larger nomadic Turkmen community that lived in the Marj Ibn Amer plain and in their transition to a sedentary lifestyle also founded the nearby villages of Abu Shusha, al-Mansi, Ayn al-Mansi, Khirbat Lid, and al-Ghubayya at around the same time Abu Zurayq was founded.Yusuf and Anabisa, 2008, pp. 57-80 Nearly all of Abu Zurayq's residents hailed from the Turkmen Tawhashe clan, although one of the families claimed descent from the village's namesake Abu Zurayq and another claimed Jewish ancestry. There were also four families of African descent in the village, who had either come to the area with the Egyptian army of Ibrahim Pasha in the mid-19th century or were the descendants of African slaves. The Turkmen families also claimed kinship ties with the Beni Sakhr of Transjordan. All of the inhabitants were Sunni Muslims, although in general, they were not religious. The war brought an end to the Ottoman era and the beginning of British Mandatory rule. In the 1922 census, the population was 301 (142 males and 159 females).Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Haifa, p. 34 During the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, Abu Zurayq's residents did not participate in the fighting, and most were quietly opposed to the revolt, although there were some sympathizers of the rebels as well. The village mukhtar (headman) was a man named Dahmus in 1937, but he was replaced by Abd al-Khalaq al-Shabash, a pro-rebel mukhtar.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 77 A small, simply-constructed mosque was built in Abu Zurayq in 1938. The imam of the mosque was a resident from nearby Umm az-Zinat, but was eventually replaced by an imam from Haifa.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 76 In the 1945 statistics, it had a population of 550 Muslims. Abu Zurayq had a total land area of 6,493 Turkish dunams, most of which‚Äî4,401 dunams‚Äîwere privately owned by Arabs; the remainder was public property. Of the land, 4,092 was used for grains, the village's principal crop, 282 for plantations and irrigated land, and one dunam for citrus and bananas.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 89 while 2,118 dunams were classified as non-cultivable land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 139 In 1942‚Äì43, olive trees occupied roughly 100 dunams of Abu Zurayq's land. An unspecified area consisted of built-up space. Abu Zurayq contained a number of houses that were dispersed throughout the village and on a nearby hill near the highway between Jenin and Haifa, most of them built at a relative distance from each other. The homes were built of stone and with either concrete rooftops or roofs built of other material such as mud, straw or wood. 1948 War and aftermath Abu Zurayq's residents had traditionally maintained cordial relations with the nearby Jewish kibbutz of HaZorea, including low-level economic cooperation, particularly with regards to agriculture. Arabic language versions of a Jewish labor periodical were regularly distributed in the village. In the lead-up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as part of Jewish efforts to clear the area around Mishmar HaEmek of Palestinian Arabs, on 12 April 1948, Palmach units of the Haganah took over Abu Zurayq. There they took 15 men and 200 women and children into custody, after which they expelled all of the women and children. Demolitions of homes in the village began on the night of its capture and were completed by 15 April.Morris, 2004, pp. 241‚Äì242. The Filastin newspaper reported that of the 30 homes demolished by Palmach forces, five still contained residents.Filastin, 14.04.1948, cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 144 According to the account of a Middle East scholar and resident from HaZore'a, Eliezer Bauer, following its capture, Abu Zurayq's men, who were unaffiliated with any Palestinian militia and did not resist the Haganah, \\"tried to escape and save themselves by fleeing\\" to nearby fields but were intercepted by armed Jewish residents of nearby kibbutzim and moshavim. After a firefight in which many of the village's men were killed, several survivors surrendered themselves while other unarmed men were taken captive, and the majority of these men were killed. Other men found hiding in the village itself were executed, while houses were looted before being demolished. Bauer's account of events was discussed by the members of HaZorea's kibbutz council where the events surrounding Abu Zurayq's capture were condemned.Morris, 2004, pp. 242‚Äì243, 346 Most of the people who managed to escape or were expelled from Abu Zurayq ended up in makeshift camps around Jenin. Along with the expelled residents of other nearby villages they complained to the Arab Higher Committee of their situation, asked for help with humanitarian aid and demanded that Arab forces be sent to avenge their loss and return them to their lands. Following the 1948 war, the area was incorporated into the State of Israel, and as of 1992, the land had been left undeveloped and the closest populated place is HaZorea. Much of the village land is used for either agricultural or pastoral purposes. The agricultural land largely consists of cacti, olive and fig trees.Khalidi, 1992, p. 144 See also * Village files References Bibliography  (pp. 74‚Äì77) *Flapan, S. \\"The Palestinian Exodus of 1948\\" in 16, no. 4 (Sum. 87): 3‚Äì26.Simha Flapan records Eliezer Bauer of the HaShomer Hatiz kibbutz and a member of the Mapam Arab Department reporting during a discussion that the villagers of Abu Zrik and Abu Shusha were arrested or driven out and the villages were then destroyed.     *Tel Zariq **Tel Zariq (south) **‚ÄòEn Zariq **Tel Zariq (M)  External links * Welcome to Abu- Zurayq, Palestine Remembered * Abu Zurayq, from Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 8: IAA, Wikimedia Commons Category:Archaeological sites in Israel Category:Neolithic settlements Category:Neolithic Category:Prehistoric sites in the Near East Category:Bronze Age sites in Israel Category:Iron Age sites in Israel Category:Arab villages depopulated prior to the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:District of Haifa ","title":"Abu Zurayq"},{"id":"24018740","text":"Arab al-Fuqara (Arabic: ÿπÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ°) was a Palestinian Arab village in the Haifa Subdistrict.

The area was generally swampy and malarial, and this limited population growth until the mid-1920s. The gradual and legal expansion of the Jewish town Hadera reduced the free public land available to the Arab villagers, until only a thin strip of land between Hadera and Wadi al-Mafjar was retained (15 dunams), where the land was considered non-cultivable.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War as a result of an Israeli military assault during Operation Shoter, the village was then completely destroyed. Incorporated into the State of Israel, it is now mostly a forested area. The Israeli moshav of Ofer (\\"fawn\\") was established in 1950 on part of the former village's lands. Ein Ayala, a moshav established in 1949, lies just adjacent; its name being the Hebrew translation of Ayn Ghazal.Bronstein in Masalha, 2005, p. 233. History In 1799, it appeared as the village Ain Elgazal on the map that Pierre Jacotin compiled that year, though it was misplaced.Karmon, 1960, p. 163 In 1870, Victor Gu√©rin passed by, and noted that the village had 290 inhabitants. It was divided into two sections, and surrounded by tobacco plantations.Gu√©rin, 1875 p. 302 Under Ottoman rule like much of the rest of Palestine in the late 19th century, Ayn Ghazal was described as a small village built of stone and mud, with about 450 residents. The villagers cultivated 35 Faddans of land (1 faddan is equal to 100-250 dunams).Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 41. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.148 Much of the land in the Ayn Ghazal and the neighbouring villages of Jaba', Khubiza, Tira, and Sarafand was owned by the sons of Abdel al-Latif al-Salah, who himself owned the entire village of Ji'ara. All these villages became entirely dependent upon the Salah family because of loans they took from them or as a result of the family's commercial activities.Yazbak, 1998, p. 140 Ayn Ghazal had two schools: an elementary school for boys founded by the Ottomans in 1886, and an elementary school for girls. The village also had a cultural club and an athletic club.Khalidi, 1992, p.148. The villagers were Muslim, and they maintained a Maqam (shrine) for a local sage named Sheikh Shahada. A population list from about 1887 showed that Ain Ghuzal had about 910 inhabitants; all Muslims,Schumacher, 1888, p. 179 while in the early twentieth century the number of inhabitants was given as 883, and a mosque and a school in the village was noted by travellers.M√ºlinen, 1908, p. 284 British Mandate era In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, ‚ÄòAin Ghazal had a population of 1,046, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Haifa, p. 34 increasing in the 1931 census, when it was counted with Khirbat al-Sawamir, to 1,439, still all Muslims, in 247 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 90. In the 1945 statistics the population was 2,170, all Muslims, and it had a total of 18,079 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 1,486 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 8,472 for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Israeli intelligence estimated the village arsenal at a total of 87 weapons by mid-1947; including 23 obsolete rifles and 45 pistols.Morris, 2004, p. 30 The November 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine allocated Ayn Ghazal and other Arab villages in the Haifa district of Mandate Palestine to the proposed Jewish state, which alongside the Arab state, was to be established upon termination of the British Mandate, scheduled for May 15, 1948. Ayn Ghazal and the neighboring village of Ayn Hawd were attacked on the evening of April 11, 1948, according to the Palestinian newspaper Filastin, who reported that a group of 150 Jewish troops were unsuccessful in driving out the inhabitants.Filastin, 13.04.1948, cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 150, cited in Slyomovics, 1998, p. 100 Arab states responded to Israel's Declaration of Independence on May 15, 1948 by sending in Arab troops, kicking off the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. On May 20, the Associated Press reported that another attack on Ayn Ghazal and Ayn Hawd had been thwarted.Khalidi, 1992, p. 150, cited in Slyomovics, 1998, p. 100 In early June 1948, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) report shows that Ayn Ghazal, together with Ijzim and Ja'ba, were asking the IDF, \\"to open negotiation for surrender.\\" Nothing resulted from the request.Morris, 2004, p. 96, 146. Note 172, logbook entry, IDF, for 9. June. On 14 July, before the Second truce of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Israeli cabinet discussed the three villages in \\"The Little Triangle\\". Ben-Gurion said that there was no need to hurry: > \\"these villages are in our pocket [...] We can act against them also after > the [reinstitution of the] truce. This will be a police action... They are > not regarded as enemy forces as their area is ours [i.e., in Israel] and > they are inhabitants of the state...[and] these villages do not represent a > military danger.\\"Morris, 2004, p. 438, 439, Note 146 The second truce, beginning on the 18 July, was not violated by the villagers.Morris, 2004, p. 441, note 169; citing the investigating \\"Central Truce Supervision Board\\", chaired by US Brigadier General W.E. Riley. This board also found that the IDF assault on the villages had been a violation of the truce. According to Meron Benvenisti, IDF actions over course of the Second Truce were concentrated on \\"cleansing\\" small clusters of Arab villages located in \\"strategic\\" areas. 'Ayn Ghazal was depopulated along with two other villages (Ijzim and Ja'ba) located on the western slopes of the Carmel mountains between July 24 and 26. A week after the start of the truce, Israel undertook Operation Shoter (\\"Operation Policeman\\"), with the aim of conquering the \\"Little Triangle\\" villages.Morris, 2004, p. 439 The operation was executed by a combination of brigades from the Israel Defense Forces and the military police.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 152. On July 25, street fighting was reported from Ayn Ghazal and Ja'ba. On the morning of the next day, the villages were found deserted. 'Ayn Ghazal was one of dozens of Palestinian villages subjected to aerial bombardment after the IDF managed to procure B-17 bombers and fighter planes from the European and American black markets during the First Truce (June‚ÄìJuly 1948). Salah Abdel Jawad writes that in addition to loss of civilian life, the air raids spread, \\"widespread demoralisation due to its indiscriminate character, and because Palestinians who had never experienced aerial bombardment before, had no defences against it.\\"Salah Abdel Jawad in Benvenisti, 2007, p. 97 (Later, the then Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok lied to a United Nations mediator and said that \\"no planes were used\\".)Morris, 2004, p. 439, note 152 Azzam Pasha, the Secretary General of the Arab League issued a statement alleging that atrocities were committed during and after the attacks. In particular it was stated that 28 people from al-Tira were burnt alive. The IDF rejected these allegations but admitted that their soldiers had found 25‚Äì30 bodies at 'Ayn Ghazal in \\"an advanced state of decomposition,\\" and that the soldiers made prisoners bury the remains. The IDF also buried about 200 bodies found in the three villages after the battle.Morris, 2004, p. 440, note 163 & 164 On July 28, a United Nations observer visited the area, and found, according to Folke Bernadotte, \\"no evidence to support claims of massacre.\\"Morris, 2004, p. 440, note 167. However, according to this note, \\"something amiss had indeed occurred\\", as it refers to an ongoing IDF \\"trial\\" concerning the \\"28\\". The relevant IDF files are still closed, according to Morris, 2004, p. 458. In early August, 1948, neighbouring Jewish settlers arrived in carts and looted Ayn Ghazal and Ja'ba.Morris, 2004, p. 441, note 173. In mid-September 1948, UN investigators placed the number of killed or missing in the three villages (Ayn Ghazal, Ijzim and Ja'ba) at 130. Bernadotte condemned Israel's \\"systematic\\" destruction of Ayn Ghazal and Ja'ba, and asked that the Israeli government restore at its own expense all houses damaged or destroyed during and after the attack. Bernadotte said that a total of 8,000 people had been driven out of the three villages, and demanded that they be allowed to return; however, Israel rejected these demands. One of a number of Palestinian villages that was completely obliterated and then reforested by Israeli authorities, Ayn Ghazal, like Mujeidel, Ma'alul, and Mi'ar, was planted with pine or cypress trees.Slyomovics, 1998, p. 30 After the area was incorporated into the State of Israel, the moshav of Ein Ayala was established in 1949 southeast of the village site. Benny Morris writes that it is close to village land; however, Walid Khalidi writes that it is not on village land. The moshav of Ofer was established the following year southeast of the built up portion of the village, and according to Khalidi, was built on village land. Describing the village remains in 1992, Khalidi writes: > \\"The dilapidated shrine of Sheikh Shahada is the only standing structure on > the village site. Ruins of walls and piles of stones can be seen all over > the site, as well as stands of pine, cactus, and fig and pomegranate trees. > The site has recently been fenced in for use as a grazing area. The flat > lands around it are also used for growing vegetables, bananas, and other > types of fruit. Parts of the slopes are planted with almond trees.\\" Zochrot, an Israeli-Jewish organization that aims to raise awareness of the Nakba has produced a booklet on Ayn Ghazal and organized tours to the site of the destroyed village. The booklet was produced in collaboration with Ali Hamude, an Internally displaced Palestinian refugee from Ayn Ghazal, who currently lives in Furaydis. Hundreds of copies of the booklet were distributed by Hamude, and a village school in Furaydis uses the booklet during class trips to Ayn Ghazal to educate students on its history.Bronstein in Masalha, 2005, p. 220 References Bibliography       *M√ºlinen, Egbert Friedrich von 1908, Beitr√§ge zur Kenntnis des Karmels \\"Separateabdruck aus der Zeitschrift des Deutschen Pal√´stina-Vereins Band XXX (1907) Seite 117-207 und Band XXXI (1908) Seite 1-258.\\"   External links *Welcome To 'Ayn Ghazal *'Ayn Ghazal, Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 8: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Ayn Ghazal from the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center *3ein Ghazal, from Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh * Ali Hamoudi, Ayn Ghazzal, testimony, 1 March 2003, from Zochrot *Tour and signposting at Ayn Ghazzal, 6.6.03, Zochrot *Remembering Ayn Ghazal, Booklet from Zochrot, 07/2003 * \\"Memoirs\\" \\"Refugee Interviews\\" in Journal of Palestine Studies: ** \\"Refugee Interviews\\" special feature in 18, no. 1 (Aut. 88): 158-71.

History Classic era The village features prominently in the writings of the Jewish historian, Josephus.Josephus, Wars of the Jews (ii.xviii.¬ß1); Life of Josephus, p. 77. In the late 1st century BCE, Herod the Great had built the village for his veteran cavalry, and, according to Sch√ºrer, called this town the city of horsemen.Sch√ºrer (1891), ¬ß23 (The Hellenistic Towns), pp. 127‚Äì128.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews (xv.viii.¬ß5); Wars of the Jews (iii.iii.¬ß1); called Geba by Pliny, Natural History (v.19.75). see: . Archaeologist Benjamin Mazar, disputing Sch√ºrer, thought that Gaba of the Horsemen (Geba) (mentioned by Josephus in The Jewish War 3.3.1) ought to be identified with the ruin ·∏™irbet el-·∏§√¢rith√Æye (now Sha'ar HaAmakim), since in relation to Simonias, it better fits Josephus' description of Gaba / Gibea () in Vita ¬ß 24 being distant from Simonias 60 stadia (about 11 km.), in addition to the fact that in relation to Besara (Beit Shearim), Gaba / Gibea (·∏™irbet el-·∏§√¢rith√Æye) stood at a distance of only 20 stadia (about 4 km.) from Besara, also in agreement with Josephus.Mazar (1957), p. 19; HUCA xxiv (1952/3), pp. 75‚Äì81; Avi-Yonah (1940), p. 38Cf.

In 1873, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) visited and found: ‚ÄúThere are two closed rock tombs in the ledge south of the village, and a third with a courtyard 14 feet square, sunk 2 feet ; two doors lead into chambers. One has three loculi, one on each wall ; the other has two loculi and a recess 5 feet 6 inches, with two parallel graves under one arcosolium placed like kokim with the feet to the chamber. This is therefore a transitional example. (Compare Sheikh Ibreik.) There are several caves north of the village, and another tomb at the head of the valley forming the recess in which the village stands.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 54 In 1882, the SWP described it: \\"A small village in a recess on the hill-slope close to the plain ; the houses principally of stone.

During the war the militia from the village fired on Jewish vehicles along the essential coast road.Morris, 2004, pp. 438 In early June 1948, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) report shows that Ja'ba, together with Ijzim and Ayn Ghazal, were asking the IDF, \\"to open negotiation for surrender.\\" Nothing resulted from the request.Morris, 2004, p. 96, note #172, logbook entry, IDF, for 9. June.p. 146 On 14 July, before the Second truce of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Israeli cabinet discussed the three villages in \\"The Little Triangle\\". Ben-Gurion said that there was no need to hurry: > \\"these villages are in our pocket [...] We can act against them also after > the [reinstitution of the] truce. This will be a police action... They are > not regarded as enemy forces as their area is ours [i.e., in Israel] and > they are inhabitants of the state...[and] these villages do not represent a > military danger.\\"Morris, 2004, pp. 438- 439, note #146, p. 457 The second truce, beginning on the 18 July, was not violated by the villagers.Morris, 2004, p. 441, note #169, pp. 458- 459 citing the investigating \\"Central Truce Supervision Board\\", chaired by US Brigadier General W.E. Riley. This board also found that the IDF assault on the villages had been a violation of the truce. According to Meron Benvenisti, IDF actions over course of the Second Truce were concentrated on \\"cleansing\\" small clusters of Arab villages located in \\"strategic\\" areas. Ja'ba was depopulated along with two other villages (Ijzim and 'Ayn Ghazal) located on the western slopes of the Carmel mountains between July 24 and 26. A week after the start of the truce, Israel undertook Operation Shoter (\\"Operation Policeman\\"), with the aim of conquering the \\"Little Triangle\\" villages.Morris, 2004, p. 439 The operation was executed by a combination of brigades from the Israel Defense Forces and the military police.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 152. On July 25, street fighting was reported from Ayn Ghazal and Ja'ba. On the morning of the next day, the villages were found deserted. In September, 1948, when the UN demanded the right of the villagers to return, the Israelis said that the village had fired on Jewish vehicles along a coast road, and therefore denied their return.Morris, 2004, p. 441 notes #170, 171, p. 459 Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. The moshav of Geva Carmel was established around one kilometer northwest of the old village site, on village land. In 1992 the village site was described: \\"Piles of stone rubble can be seen on the site. A shrine still standing on an elevated part of it.

Boynton, is co-director of The George J. Kostas Institute for Homeland Security at Northeastern University in Boston. Boynton most recently served as Commissioner of the Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security for the state of Connecticut. Retired United States Coast Guard as well as former Federal Security Director for the Transportation Security Administration at Bradley International Airport, Boynton has been described by former Governor M. Jodi Rell as one of the leaders of America's domestic security effort. Background Peter J. Boynton is a 1979 graduate of the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in ocean engineering, and a 1994 graduate of John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he received a master's degree in public administration. Career Serving more than 28 years in the United States Coast Guard, Boynton commanded the Coast Guard cutters (Cape class cutter), , and and managed the Aviation Drug Interdiction Program at Coast Guard Headquarters. He served as Director for Global Affairs on the United States National Security Council from 1995 to 1997, where he coordinated policy for the prevention of drug and migrant smuggling. He was Chief of Operational Planning from July 1999 to July 2001, then Chief of Governmental Affairs for the Boston-based First Coast Guard District from August 2001 to May 2004. Boynton served as Captain of the Port and Sector Commander in New Haven from June 2004 to June 2007, followed by a two-year term as the Federal Security Director for the Transportation Security Administration at Bradley International Airport August 2007-August 2009. During his tenure, Bradley became one of the top 10 rated TSA operations in the eastern United States. In 2009, Boynton was nominated by former Governor M. Jodi Rell to be the state of Connecticut's next Commissioner of the Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS). Of the nomination, Governor Rell said: \\"Peter's decades of dedicated service to our nation, the many roles he has played in the Coast Guard and his experience at Bradley combine to make him an ideal candidate for the many tasks that befall the Commissioner of the Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security. From planning and drilling for natural disasters and potential terrorist attacks to working with me to respond to major storms to collaborating with our Congressional delegation and local leaders on issues of homeland security funding, DEMHS is essential to what I have often described as government's foremost responsibility: ensuring the safety of its citizens. Ever since the dark days of September 2001, the Coast Guard has been on the front line of America's domestic security effort‚Äìand Peter Boynton has been one of the leaders of that effort. I am tremendously pleased he is willing to take on this new role and I am confident the Legislature will agree.\\" Boynton was re-appointed by Governor Dan Malloy in early 2011, following a record- breaking winter storm season. As Commissioner of DEMHS, Boynton was responsible for disaster response, and for coordinating planning, communications, training and counter-terrorism efforts in the state. During his tenure, Boynton testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs regarding ongoing planning to prepare for a possible Fall 2009 H1N1 outbreak in the State of Connecticut. He regularly released safety bulletins during severe weather conditions, and is featured in two public service announcements about emergency preparedness. On September 7, 2011, Boynton announced he would leave his post as Commissioner to take a position leading the new institute on homeland security at Northeastern University. Following the announcement, Gov. Malloy said of Boynton, \\"I have been continually impressed with his ability to coordinate the state's efforts before, during and after an emergency, his insight and experience, and his ability to stay calm under pressure. Peter will be sorely missed at the EOC, but I have no doubt he will be an invaluable resource for students at Northeastern University.\\" Awards and decorations Boynton is licensed in the Merchant Marines. His military awards include the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal and Presidential Service Badge. He serves on the Board of Directors for the Military Officers Association of America and is Chair of the Connecticut Maritime Pilot Commission.

Blueback herring form schools and are believed to migrate offshore to overwinter near the bottom. These fish are silvery in color, have a series of scutes (modified, spiny and keeled scales) along their bellies, and are characterized by deep bluish-green backs. They reach a maximum size of approximately and are believed to live up to 8 years. The most distinguishing characteristic of this species is the black to dusky in color of its peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity). It is one of the \\"typical\\" North American shads. They are often confused with alewifes because blueback shad and alewives are difficult to distinguish from one another, and together these two species are often regarded collectively as \\"river herring\\". Alewives have larger eyes, greater body depth, and pearly to white peritoneal linings. This fish has, in the past, been used as a baitfish for the lobster fishing industry. It is also used for human consumption, usually smoked. It is caught (during its migration up stream) using large dip nets to scoop the fish out of shallow, constricted areas on its migratory streams and rivers. Range The native range of this fish is found along the Atlantic Coast from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, to the St. Johns River, Florida. During spawning season, it migrates into coastal rivers. Non-indigenous occurrences Blueback shad were first collected in Lake Ontario in 1995, and have been collected from the Tennessee River in Georgia and Tennessee; Oneida Lake, the Oswego River, and Lake Champlain in New York. In North Carolina, blueback shad were introduced into the Savannah, Broad, and Yadkin River basins, and into non-native areas of the Cape Fear and Roanoke River basins. It has been introduced to an unspecified location in the Chesapeake Bay basin in Pennsylvania. They have been collected in Lake Jocassee, Lake Keowee, Picalet River, Broad River, and Lake Murray in South Carolina. Stock obtained from the Cooper River, South Carolina, was released in Texas by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in Lake Theo, Briscoe County, and at an unidentified research site in North Texas in 1982 (and in the upper Red River drainage). Bluebacks have been collected from Lake Champlain, Vermont, and have been stocked in several inland reservoirs in Virginia, including Smith Mountain Lake, Occoquan Reservoir, Kerr Reservoir, and Lakes Anna, Brittle, and Chesdin. It is established as a species in Texas, New York, North Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia. Ecology This fish is anadromous, living in marine systems and spawning in deep, swift freshwater rivers with hard substrates. It migrates to spawning grounds in the spring. In Connecticut, blueback shad spawn in water, usually later in the spring than the alewife. During spawning, many eggs are deposited over the stream bottom, where they stick to gravel, stones, logs, or other objects. Juveniles spend three to seven months in fresh water, then migrate to the ocean. The blueback shad is a planktivorous forage species. Reproduction Blueback herring spawn from late March through mid- May, depending on latitude. Females usually mature by age five and produce between 60,000 and 103,000 eggs. Males generally mature earlier at between 3 and 4 years of age and at a smaller size than the females. For both species, adults migrate quickly downstream after spawning and little is known about their life history while in the marine environment; however, they are believed to be capable of migrating long distances (over ). Conservation Blueback populations have exhibited drastic declines throughout much of their range. There are several threats that have most likely contributed to their decline. These threats include: loss of habitat due to decreased access to spawning areas from the construction of dams and other impediments to migration; habitat degradation; fishing; and increased predation due to recovering striped bass populations. In response to the declining trend for river herring, the states of Alabama, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Virginia, Delaware and North Carolina have instituted moratoriums on taking and possession. The blueback herring is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern. Species of Concern are those species about which the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).

Publication history Amber and Blood was written by Margaret Weis and published in May 2008. Other books in the series include Amber and Ashes (Volume 1) and Amber and Iron (Volume 2). Plot introduction The story resumes where it ended in Amber and Iron. The monk Rhys and the kender Nightshade, along with Rhys's dog Atta, find themselves in a cave on the coast of the Blood Sea while a ferocious storm rages outside. Thinking their adventure finally over, the two companions discuss what to do next when they hear yelling from outside the cave. Rhys runs outside and sees a young girl struggling in the water. He rescues her and brings her ashore, only to realize that the six-year-old girl has the same red hair and amber eyes as Mina. Plot summary Mina, who had last appeared to Rhys as an adult woman, seems to retain no knowledge of her prior actions or that she is a god. She tells the monk that she has run away from home and needs his help to go back. When asked where she lived, the young Mina replies that she came from Godshome, the holy valley of the gods first introduced in Dragons of Spring Dawning. After Mina fully recovers from near drowning, she insists that she needs a gift for her mother Goldmoon who will be waiting at Godshome and whose forgiveness Mina seeks. A small sailboat appears on the beach, although Mina seems unaware she willed it into existence. Rhys, Nightshade, Atta and Mina sail to the newly raised Tower of High Sorcery, which sits on its own island in the sea. As the group sail closer, they realize the island is swarming with undead creatures known as the Beloved. They all swarm around Mina and her escorts, eager for her touch and her blessings. However, the six-year-old Mina is terrified of the Beloved. The group makes its way inside the tower where the Beloved cannot follow. Also in the tower are two black-robed wizards who are trapped by the Beloved. Mina is still intent on finding a gift for her mother and travels to the chamber where holy artifacts of the gods were stored before the Cataclysm, the so-called Hall of Sacrilege. She chooses two items from within: a necklace from the altar of Takhisis and a crystal pyramid from the altar of Paladine. When Mina and her friends try to leave the tower, she is beset by the Beloved again. Faced with the evil she has created, Mina transforms into a vengeful, fire-breathing giant and destroys the Beloved in a rage, only to transform into a child again with seemingly no memory of what happened. Meanwhile, the evil gods Nuitari and Chemosh try to claim the artifacts in the Hall of Sacrilege for themselves, but the High God, creator of all the gods of Krynn, intervenes and sweeps away the Hall so none of the artifacts can be used in the fight between the lower gods. Rhys and his companions sail to the port city of Flotsam, from where they will continue to try to find Godshome on foot. On the road, both the god of death Chemosh and goddess of the sea Zeboim try to sway Mina to their cause, but she does not remember or trust either of them. Frustrated, they depart. Mina asks to see the map Nightshade has made for their journey and is upset by how far they still have to go before reaching Solace, where Rhys hopes to speak with monks of Majere. Using her godly powers, she speeds up the pace of their walking and the group reaches the city of Solace, far across the continent, in under a day. In Solace, Rhys and the others stay at the Inn of the Last Home where the owner Laura dotes on the young Mina, bathing her and brushing her hair just as Goldmoon used to do. Rhys finds the temple to his god Majere among the other temples in town and seeks out the Abbott of Majere. Temple Row, where the holy places are all located, is in an uproar as rival followers fought in the streets and attempted to set fire to one another's temples. Rhys speaks to the Abbott about finding Godshome. The Abbott counsels him that legend has it that Godshome is located near Neraka, formerly the seat of Takhisis's armies. However, it isn't clear whether mortals can find Godshome without the guidance of a god. Rhys thinks Valthonis, the mortal form of the former god Paladine, could help locate Godshome but the Abbott reminds him that after the War of Souls, Mina had vowed to kill Valthonis. Rhys leaves unsure about whether to seek out the fallen god. The next day, Rhys meets Mina, Nightshade and Atta at the temple of Majere, from where they will journey to Neraka. However, another riot breaks out among the religious temples, carefully orchestrated by the followers of Chemosh. Ausric Krell, the former death knight who has been restored to human form, uses the confusion to try to kill Rhys and Nightshade and to abduct Mina for his god. He almost succeeds but Rhys, along with the help of the red-robed archmage Jenna, manages to kill him. Mina, meanwhile, has fled, with Nightshade and Atta in pursuit. Nightshade and Atta catch up with Mina and head north, continuing toward Neraka. Rhys helps deal with the wounded and explains to the sheriff Gerard what has happened with Mina. Gerard's leg is wounded and as he is treated in the Inn of the Last Home, Rhys waits for word about Mina. Soon enough, he hears they travelled north and follows. Nightshade and Mina travel until it gets dark, at which point the dark forest seems frightening to them both. However, a light in the distance leads them to a lone house in the woods. A kind woman welcomes them inside and feeds them gingerbread, after which they both fall asleep. Rhys comes upon the same house and finds the woman gently rocking Mina, looking very sad. She invites Rhys in as well and he recognizes her as the goddess of healing Mishakal, Mina's godly mother. She again counsels Rhys to seek out Valthonis, for Paladine was Mina's father, and that he alone can reveal Godshome to her. Mishakal tells Rhys that Mina will have to choose whether to side with the gods of Good or the gods of Evil. The next day, Rhys, Nightshade, Atta and Mina awake to find themselves in Neraka, surrounded by remnants of the destroyed temple of Takhisis. Meanwhile, Galdar, Mina's former minotaur lieutenant, escorts Valthonis into the valley of Neraka. When Mina sees Galdar, she changes into the 17-year-old woman who had led armies during the War of Souls and embraces her minotaur friend. However, she seems to believe the two of them are still fighting in that war. She then remembers the death of Takhisis and tries to kill Valthonis with Galdar's sword. He and Rhys explain that if she commits this murder, she will tip the balance in favour of the Evil gods and destroy Krynn. She is enraged and shifts her form again, this time to the person who had led Chemosh's followers. She beats Galdar and Rhys with godly force and kills Nightshade. At the kender's death, she becomes the little girl with pigtails again and feels remorse for his death. Finally, she accepts who she is and agrees to travel with Valthonis to Godshome. Mina and Valthonis find Godshome after following a steep trail through the mountains. Mina's feet hurt and she doesn't understand why she feels pain despite being a god. She accepts that though the gods \\"play at being mortal\\" none truly know what mortality is like except for her. The two finally enter the bowl-shaped valley that houses pillars to all the gods of Good, Evil and Balance. She holds the two artifacts she retrieved from the Hall of Sacrilege in each hand as the gods wait for her to decide. She drops both items and proclaims that she is \\"equal parts of darkness and of light\\" and refuses to join any side, that she will side with any one side as she sees fit. Her decision maintains the balance of power and she leaves the world to join the gods as the Goddess of Tears, coming to the aid of the hopeless and the grieving.

In Roman times the town was known as Bethletepha, and commonly known by its Greek equivalent, Bethletephon.Emil Sch√ºrer and Fergus Millar, The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ: 175 B.C.-A.D. 135, Volume III Part 2, Bloomsbury 2000, p. 910Tsafrir, Di Segni and Green, 1994, p. 84 The original Arabic version of the name was Bayt Lettif.In an interview with Muhammad Abu Halawa (born 1929), he disclosed unto his interviewer, Rakan Mahmoud, in 2009, that the original name of the village was Bayt Lettif, but since it was phonetically easier for the tongue to say Bayt Nattif, so did the name change. See Palestine Oral History: Interview with Muhammad Halawa #1, Bayt Nattif-Hebron, Arabic (In video: 2:48 ‚Äì 2:56) The village lay nestled on a hilltop, surrounded by olive groves and almonds, with woodlands of oak and carobs overlooking Wadi es-Sunt (the Elah Valley) to its south. It contained several shrines, including a notable one dedicated to al-Shaykh Ibrahim. Roughly a dozen khirbas lay in the vicinity.Figurine discovered in Bayt Nattif During the British Mandate it was part of the Hebron Subdistrict. Bayt Nattif was depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War on October 21, 1948 under Operation Ha-Har.Khalidi, 1992, pp. 211-212. History Roman and Byzantine periods (63 BCE - 6th century CE) Bayt Nattif stood on the much-traveled ancient road connecting Eleutheropolis (Beit Guvrin) with Jerusalem, about midway between the two towns. The city had been assigned the status of toparchy, one of eleven toparchies or prefectures in Judaea given certain administrative responsibilities, known in classical sources by the name Betholetepha.Petersen, 2001, pp. 125‚Äì126The 11 were: 1) The toparchy of Gophna; 2) The toparchy of Acrabatta; 3) The toparchy of Thamna; 4) The toparchy of Lydda; 5) The toparchy of Emmaus; 6) The toparchy of Pella; 7) The toparchy of Idumea, one of whose principal cities being Bethletephon; 8) The toparchy of En Gedi; 9) The toparchy of Herodium; 10) The toparchy of Jericho, and 11) The toparchy of Jamnia and Joppa. These all answered to Jerusalem.Josephus, De Bello Judaico (The Jewish War), 3.3.5 (3.51) According to Josephus, the city was sacked under Vespasian and Titus, during the first Jewish uprising against Rome.Josephus, De Bello Judaico (The Jewish War) 4.8.1. During the 12th year of the reign of Nero, when the Roman army had suffered a great defeat under Cestius Gallus, with more than five-thousand foot soldiers killed, the people of the surrounding countryside feared reprisals from the Roman army and made haste to appoint generals and to fortify their cities. Generals were at that time appointed for Idumea, namely, over the entire region immediately south and south-west of Jerusalem, and which incorporated within it the towns of Bethletephon, Betaris, Kefar Tobah, Adurim, and Maresha. This region was called Idumea by the Romans on account of it being inhabited largely by the descendants of Esau (Edom) who became proselytes to Judaism during the time of John Hyrcanus.Josephus, De Bello Judaico (The Jewish War), 2.20.3-4 Ottoman period (1517 ‚Äì 1917) In 1596, Bayt Nattif was listed among villages belonging to the nahiya Quds, in the administrative district LiwƒÅ\` of Jerusalem, in a tax ledger of the \\"countries of Syria\\" (wilƒÅyat a≈°-≈†ƒÅm) and which lands were then under Ottoman rule. During that year, Bayt Nattif was inhabited by 94 households and 10 bachelors, all Muslim. The Ottoman authority levied a 33.3% taxation on agricultural products produced by the villagers (primarily on wheat, barley, olives, sesame seeds and grapes, among other fruits), besides a marriage tax and supplement tax on goats and beehives. Total revenues accruing from the village of Bayt Nattif for that year amounted to 12,000 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 114Toledano, 1984, p. 290, gives the position of 34¬∞59‚Ä≤20‚Ä≥E 31¬∞41‚Ä≤45‚Ä≥N In 1838 Edward Robinson visited, and remarks that their party was very well received by the villagers. He further noted that the villagers belonged to the \\"Keis\\" faction.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, pp. 341-347Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 16 By the mid-19th century, a rift had divided families in the region over control of the district Bani Hasan, until at length it broke out into actual fighting between the Keis (Qays) faction, on the one side, and the Yaman faction, on the other.Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 229 Meron Benvenisti, writing of this period, says that Sheikh 'Utham al-Lahham waged \\"a bloody war against Sheikh Mustafa Abu Ghosh, whose capital and fortified seat was in the village of Suba.\\"Benvenisti, 2002, in a chapter named \\"The Convenience of the Crusades\\", p. 301Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 231 In 1855, Mohammad Atallah in Bayt Nattif, a cousin of 'Utham al-Lahham, contested his rule over the region. In order to win support from Abu Ghosh, Mohammad Atallah gave his allegiance to the Yaman faction. This is said to have enraged 'Utham al-Lahham. He raised a fighting force and fell on Bayt Nattif on 3 January 1855. The village lost 21 dead. According to an eyewitness description by the horrified British consul, James Finn, their corpses were terribly mutilated.Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 232Finn, 1878, vol 2, pp. 194-210 In 1863 Victor Gu√©rin visited twice. The first time he visited he estimated that the village contained about one thousand inhabitants. He further noted that the houses were crudely built, one of them, which was assigned to the reception of foreigners, the al-Medhafeh, was a square tower. Above the entrance of the al-Medhafeh was a large block for lintel, featuring elegant mouldings, Gu√©rin assumed it came from an ancient destroyed monument. Many other ancient stones were embedded here and there in private homes. Two wells, several cisterns and a number of silos and stores carved in the rock, and in continued use, were also ancient.Gu√©rin, 1869, pt. 2, pp. 374-377Gu√©rin, 1869, pt. 3, pp. 329-330 Socin, citing an official Ottoman village list compiled around 1870, noted that Bayt Nattif had 66 houses and a population of 231, though the population count included men only.Socin, 1879, p. 147 Hartmann found that Bayt Nattif had 120 houses.Hartmann, 1883, p. 145 In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Bayt Nattif as being \\"a village of fair size, standing high on a flat-topped ridge between two broad valleys. On the south, about 400 feet below, is a spring (\`Ain el Kezbeh), and on the north a rock-cut tomb was found. There are fine olive-groves round the place, and the open valleys are very fertile in corn.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 24 Around 1896 the population of Bayt Nattif was estimated to be about 672 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 123 British Mandate (1917 ‚Äì 1948) For all practical purposes, the British inherited from their Turkish counterparts the existing laws in regard to land tenures as defined in the Ottoman Land Code, to which laws there was later added subsidiary legislation.A Survey of Palestine (Prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry), chapter 8, section 5, British Mandate Government of Palestine: Jerusalem 1946, p. 255 At the time of the British occupation the land tax was collected at the rate of 12.5% of the gross yield of the land. Crops were assessed on the threshing floor or in the field and the tithe was collected from the cultivators.A Survey of Palestine (Prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry), chapter 8, section 4, British Mandate Government of Palestine: Jerusalem 1946, p. 246 In 1925, additional legislation provided that taxation on crops and other produce not exceed 10%. In 1928, as a measure of reform, the Mandate Government of Palestine began to apply an Ordinance for the \\"Commutation of Tithes,\\" this tax in effect being a fixed aggregate amount paid annually. It was related to the average amount of tithe (tax) that had been paid by the village during the four years immediately preceding the application of the Ordinance to it.A Survey of Palestine (Prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry), chapter 8, section 4, British Mandate Government of Palestine: Jerusalem 1946, pp. 246 ‚Äì 247 In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt Nattif had a population of 1,112, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub-district of Hebron, p. 10 increasing in the 1931 census to 1,649, still all Muslim, in a total of 329 houses (which figure includes houses built in the nearby ruin, Khirbet Umm al-Ra‚Äôus).Mills, 1932, p. 28 In 1926, some 259 dunums (61.77 acres) of land near Beit Nattif were designated as \\"Jabal es-Sira Forest Reserve no. 73,\\" held by the State.May 1939, Office of the Commissioner for Lands and Surveys, Jerusalem, Conservator of Forest, Government of Palestine (Department of Forests) In 1934, Dimitri Baramki of the Mandate Department of Antiquities directed the excavation of two cisterns in the village of Bayt Nattif which produced mostly ceramic ware dating from between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE.

As hostilities broke out in the wake of the publication of the plan, Yohanan Reiner and Fritz Eisenstadt, military advisors of David Ben-Gurion proposed, on December 18, 1947, that any Arab attack be met with a decisive blow, consisting of the \\"destruction of the place or chasing out the inhabitants and taking their place.\\" Such proposals were mulled and shelved - one participant likening such proposals to the destruction of Lidice - but in January 1948, a Jerusalem District HQ document entitled \\"Lines of Planning for Area Campaigns for the Month of February 1948,\\" foresaw taking steps to secure the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv route. In this document one measure consisted of \\"the destruction of villages or objects dominating our settlements or threatening our lines of transportation,\\" and among the objectives of the plan the destruction of the southern bloc of Beit Nattif was envisaged.Benny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee problem Recvisited, Cambridge University Press 2004 pp.73-74.Gerard Michaud,'A matter of choice:Palestinians say they wouldn't necessarily exercise the 'right of return,' The Jerusalem Post 7 February 2008 The official Jewish account (The \\"History of Haganah\\") alleges that the village of Bayt Nattif took part in the killing of thirty-five Jewish fighters (see the Convoy of 35, the \\"Lamed-Heh\\") who were en route with supplies to the besieged block of kibbutzim of Gush Etzion, on January 16, 1948. However, reports from The New York Times correspondent indicate that the convoy took a wrong turn, and ended up in Surif. The Arab version is that the convoy had attacked Surif deliberately, and had held it for an hour before being driven out. After this, the Haganah mounted a \\"punitive\\" attack on Bayt Nattif, Dayr Aban and Az- Zakariyya.

Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 227 During the 1834 Arab revolt in Palestine, Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian leader, personally led his troops to suppress the uprising, and upon encountering a group of rebelling peasants at Zayta, his forces killed 90 men there, and gave chase to the remainder.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 135 James Finn, the British Consul to the Ottoman Empire in the 1850s, recounts passing by Zayta while travelling between Gaza and Hebron in the spring of 1853. Finn relates that the peasants there had erected a breastwork into which armed men rushed, who had to be, \\"parleyed before they would allow us to pass on.\\"Finn, 1877, p. 182. A description of Zeita from the mid-19th century travels of James Turner Barclay notes that it is, \\"[...] a picturesque Arab village, situated on a conical hill.\\" Writing at length of the well at the foot of the hill where he and his travel companions were directed after inquiring for water, he relates: > \\"[...] arriving there, we found several persons drawing water for > themselves, donkeys, horses, and cattle. And notwithstanding the water was > rather warm and considerably muddied by a Fellah who was wading about in the > deep fountain, or more correctly speaking, shallow well, yet so thirsty were > we that we drank it with decided gusto. It was eight or ten feet deep, and > four or five yards in diameter, with the usual stone troughs for watering > animals ...\\" Camping between the well and the millet fields of the village, Barclay describes the expanse of the cultivated fields, as well as the construction and operation of the well in more detail: > \\"This Sakieh or well, supplied with machinery for raising water, is plied > day and night by camels. A beautiful marble Corinthian capital supports the > shaft of the main wheel. There are eighty-five stone jars, each containing > two or three gallons, fastened at intervals of four feet on the two endless > grass ropes going over the large rough pulley wrapped with grass cords. The > water, which is incessantly poured out of the jars, is received into a > channel cut into a marble pillar laid horizontally, and thus delivered into > a reservoir twenty-four feet square, and thence let off into a trough of > masonry thirty-six feet long and two and half broad, the outer border of > which is made up of marble pillars worked in horizontally, as in other > instances. But copious and unremitting as is this supply of water, it would > seem totally inadequate to the demand. Herd after herd, and flock after > flock, came crowding in about sunset, and the cry was, \\"still they come\\", > until it was too dark to count them ...\\"Barclay, 1857, p. 575. In 1863, Victor Gu√©rin noted it as a: \\"hamlet, whose houses are staggered on the slopes of a hill. At the top of the mound, is a half destroyed tower. The dwellings themselves are mostly falling into ruin. Some contain ancient remains built from other materials: in one, among others, I notice a white marble column. At the bottom of the village is a well, wide and deep, consisting of a simple circular hole measuring three meters in diameter, and surrounded by a large stone belt, roughly hewn and uncemented.\\"Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 306 An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Zeita had 32 houses and a population of 97, though the population count included men, only.Socin, 1879, p. 163 also noted it in the Beit Jibrin districtHartmann, 1883, p. 143 also noted 32 houses In the 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Zayta as a small hamlet built of adobe brick, on the edge of the wadi, flanked on two sides by low hills.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 258 Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.227 British Mandate era In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Zaita had a population of 139 inhabitants, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub-district of Hebron, p. 10 increasing in the 1931 census to 234, still all Muslim, in a total of 44 inhabited houses.Mills, 1932, p. 34 According to a 1930 report, the water supply system at Zayta was improved, as it had been \\"insanitary and malarious.\\"Great Britain, Colonial Office, League of Nations, Council, 1930, p. 115. The villagers moved 1.5 km north during this period, to a new village which was laid out in a northeast-southeast direction. The houses were built of mud, wood, and cane. Artesian wells dug between the wadi and the village served as the main source of drinking water, while another well lay to the north. The villagers worked mainly in rainfed agriculture and stock raising, specializing in goats and sheep. They cultivated grain on large part of their land, and utilized the rest as grazing land for their animals. In the 1940s, an Arab landowner who owned in Zeita, part of which was mortgaged to the bank, contacted Jewish purchasers to sell, as he was fearful of losing his holdings in other areas.Tuten, 2004, pp. 43-4. By the 1945 statistics, of the that made up the village of Zayta, were owned by Jews, were owned by Arabs, and the remaining were public lands held by the village in common. At this time, the village population was estimated at 330 Muslims. In 1944/45 a total of 10,105 dunums of village land was allocated to cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

It appears that a minor village was re-established in the 16th century in the vicinity of the Sidna Ali Mosque. The mosque is mentioned by Mujir al-Din (writing c. 1496) as having been dedicated at the tomb of a Muslim saint,  øAli Ibn  øAleim (d. 1081), and that Sultan Baybars had prayed at the tomb for victory prior to retaking Arsuf in 1265.Taragan, Hana (2004): The Tomb of Sayyidna Ali in Arsuf: the Story of a Holy Place In JRAS (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society), Series 4, 14, 2 (2004), pp. 83‚Äì102.Essaid, 2014, p. 175 writes: 'The village of Al-Haram was also known as Sayyiduna 'Ali (generally spelt as Sidna 'Ali), meaning 'our lord 'Ali,' because it was built round the shrine of a descendant of 'Umar ibn al-Khatab named al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, who died in AD 1081.

The company is located on the Ortega River in Jacksonville, Florida, and is run by its third-generation owners, Cindy and Buddy Purcell. Huckins manufactures custom yachts ranging from 40 to 90 feet that combine classic design and traditional workmanship with modern technology and amenities. It has built a total of 457 yachts during its 80 years of operation, crafting vessels one at a time. Huckins Yacht Corporation hosts an annual Rendezvous which provides an opportunity for Huckins owners to gather together and share their boating experiences.  History  Maiden voyage of the Fairform Flyer. Frank Huckins, founder of Huckins Yacht Corporation, is seated on the right with a pipe. Frank Pembroke Huckins came from a family that had been in the lumber business in Maine ever since his grandfather Pembroke Somerset Huckins, and his great-grandfather John Huckins, of Bangor, founded the P. S. Huckins Company in 1854. The Boston concern dealt in ship timbers and planking during the years prior to the rise of iron- and then steel-hulled ships. After the Civil War, wooden shipbuilding waned and a new demand arose for factory timbers. The Huckins company adapted itself to the new field with a stock of suitable southern yellow pine timber and plank. Frank Pembroke Huckins, the fourth generation scion, left Harvard college in his junior year and went to work in the \\"Marine Gasolene (sic) Engine Business\\". In December, 1908, he went to work for P.S. Huckins Company, where he became the tally-man and surveyor in the company's lumber yard. All of the yellow pine timber sold by the Huckins family business was shipped in schooners from Jacksonville and Fernandina to East Boston. Huckins was made assistant treasurer of the company in 1911, and president in 1912. Huckins sold the P.S. Huckins Company in 1923 and moved to Jacksonville in 1924. In 1926 he became a partner in the Drayer‚ÄìWarren Company, an architectural millwork firm supplying materials for the construction boom in Florida, and the name was changed to the Warren‚ÄìHuckins Company. In 1928, Warren‚ÄìHuckins was reincorporated as the Huckins Yacht Corporation by Huckins, Harold l. Perrin of Boston, and Henry Skinner Baldwin of Springfield. A slogan used by the former company, \\"Florida Fairform Finish\\", inspired the new firm's yacht brand name, \\"Fairform Flyer\\". Huckins hired Florida boat builder Herschel B. Ward as foreman, and construction of the Fairform Flyer Hull No. 1 began in April, 1928. Around this time, his partner Ling Warren decided that he wanted out of the yacht building business, and Huckins bought him out. The Fairform Flyer 42‚Äô Express Cruiser was launched in July 1928, captained by Huckins himself on its maiden voyage from Fernandina, Florida to New York City. It was sold in the autumn for $15,000 to David M. Goodrich of the B.F. Goodrich Rubber Company, who became a repeat customer. A company booth at the 1929 New York Boat Show took six orders for yachts, and to expedite the work Huckins used modular construction. The onset of the Great Depression motivated Huckins to build smaller boat designs and to seek more efficient construction methods for larger vessels, such as mounting engines on I-beams supported by the engine room bulkheads, and using belt driven V-drive propulsion systems. In 1943 the U.S. Navy commissioned Huckins Yacht Corporation to build two squadrons of PT boats, a total of 18 boats for service during World War II. John F. Kennedy was in command of a Huckins-built vessel, PT-101, when he served as an instructor at the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island,. He also delivered PT boats from Melville, Rhode Island to Jacksonville and then to the breaking-in center in Miami. In 1969, Huckins built the largest sportfishing yacht in the United States, measuring 80 feet in length. In 1976, Huckins Yacht Corporation constructed the largest motor yacht in the United States, built with an Airex-cored fiberglass hull. In 1986, Huckins built a specialty 78-foot Sport Cruising yacht, which included wide doors and an elevator, designed for an owner confined to a wheel chair. The oldest existing boat built by Huckins Yacht Corporation, the 1931 Offshore 48‚Äô Avocette III, was honored in July 2008 by the Museum of Yachting. Original boat designs are still available at Huckins Yacht Corporation as it continues to build fine custom yachts. The complete history of the company can be found in the book, Huckins: The Living Legacy, by Andre√© Conrad and Anders Jonsson.  PT Boats  USS PT-96, built by Huckins at Jacksonville, Florida, underway at high speed, circa 1942 Huckins Yacht Corporation built PT boats for two squadrons during World War II. In 1940, three governing bodies ‚Äì the Bureau of Ships, the Board of Inspection and Survey, and the Navy Personnel Command ‚Äì had agreed that all PT boats developed up to that time were defective. Confident he had a solution, Frank Pembroke Huckins utilized his company's own \\"Quadraconic\\" Hull to build a boat that met the Navy‚Äôs PT boat guidelines. The Quadraconic design, supported by 15 years of in-house research and experimentation, was developed using a conic method worked out by Lindsay Lord, and resulted in slightly concave bottom sections and a sharp bow entry. The Huckins PT 69 was compared to those being constructed by Elco, Higgins and the Philadelphia Navy Yard in a series of comparative performance tests conducted by the Board of Inspection and SurveyBoard of Inspection and Survey,Report of Comparative Services Tests of Motor Torpedo Boats Held July 21‚Äì24, 1941 and August 11‚Äì12, 1941 at New London, Connecticut (Navy Department, August 14, 1941) off New London, Connecticut in July 1941, known as the \\"Plywood Derby\\". The tests allowed boats of various classes from the three manufacturers to demonstrate their seakeeping qualities and hull strength by making a run at maximum sustained speed in the open ocean. Accelerometers were installed in the pilot house of each design to record \\"pounding\\" of the hull against the water in like sea conditions. The seaway course of the open-water trial, at full throttle, started from the mouth of New London Harbor and finished at Montauk Point Whistling Buoy. The Elco and Huckins boats made the best showing; although the Huckins edged the Elco 77-footer in speed (41.5 versus 40.2 knots), turning circle (305 yards in diameter compared to 407 yards) and pounding factor (the Elco pounded 60% more than the Huckins), Elco took first place, and was awarded a contract to build 385 boats. Huckins won its design contract in 1941, just when the Navy was ready to scrap the PT program, and licensed the use of the Quadraconic hull in PT boat construction. They also granted permission for Elco, Higgins and the Philadelphia Navy Yard to use their patented laminated keel, which increased hull strength. A total of 18 78-foot (24 m) boats for squadrons 14 and 26 were commissioned in early 1943. They were assigned to specific outposts in the Panama Canal, Miami, Florida, the Hawaiian Sea Frontier at Pearl Harbor, in the Central Pacific, and a training center in Melville, Rhode Island. The Huckins patrol torpedo boat platform was designed to handle four torpedoes, two 50-caliber gun turrets and depth charges on the stern. The Huckins boats were generally well-regarded by the sailors who manned them. They had relatively high freeboard, with good headroom below the decks. A man could stand in the engine room, so engineers had plenty of space to work. Sleeping quarters on the Huckins PT vessels were considered to be comfortable by their captains and crews, who called them \\"the yachts\\". Technical Specifications Lindsay Lord, a commander in the United States Navy who was stationed in Hawaii during the war, examines wartime PT boat design in his \\"Naval Architecture of Planing Hulls\\" and records the Navy's planing hull research and findings. This is the most complete source of information on PT boat hull design and construction, and provides hull test data as well as detailed analysis and comparisons of the various PT boat designs.

The name was shared by the twin village of Allar al-Sifla (\\"Lower Allar\\") or Khirbat al-Tannur, with official imperial ledgers often listing them both under the single entry of Allar.Petersen, 2001, p. 92 Habitation in the village spanned centuries and is attested in architectural remains and documents from the Crusader, Mamluk, Ottoman and Mandate Palestine periods. Allar was depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and the area was incorporated into the State of Israel, with the moshavs of Mata and Bar Giora established on its former lands. History The older of the two villages appears to have been Lower Allar. Remains of a Crusader-era church and cloister made up of five other vaulted buildings attest to habitation there in the 12th century. One of these buildings is thought to be a Cistercian house, a sister house of Belmont built in 1161, known as Saluatio.Pringle, 1993, pp. 47-51 From the 13th to 16th centuries, the villages were ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate based in Cairo and appear together in a document dating to circa 1264 that lists land grants made in Palestine by the sultan Baybars to his emirs. Ottoman era Toward the beginning of four centuries of rule over the area by the Ottoman Empire, in August 1553, two leaders of Allar were held accountable for the village failure to pay taxes and were arrested by the imperial authorities.Singer, 1993, p. 44 The imperial tax register of 1596 lists Allar as part of the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Jerusalem with 37 households, an estimated 204 inhabitants, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed 33,3% tax‚àírate on various agricultural products, such as wheat, barley, olive trees, molasses, goats, and beehives; a total of 11,400 ak√ße. All of the revenue went to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p.113, cited in Khalidi, 1992, p.266Khalidi, 1992, pp. 266-267 The waqf custodian of the mosque in Allar (and that of Bayt Nuba) in 1810 was appointed by the Ottoman authorities, and hailed from the Jerusalem family of notables, the Dajanis.Kushner, 1986, p.111 Also in the village was a shrine dedicated to al-Shaykh Ibrahim (\\"Abraham the Sheikh\\"). Western travellers who wrote of the village include Edward Robinson, who travelled throughout Palestine and Syria in 1838 and Victor Gu√©rin, whose travels spanned many years in the latter half of the 19th century. Both describe Lower and Upper Allar as two distinct villages located in a valley. Robinson calls it er-Rumany wadi (\\"Pomegranate Valley\\"), while Gu√©rin calls it Oued el-Limoun (\\"Valley of the Lemons/Limes\\"), so named because of the abundant presence of a variety of citrus tree there known to the Arabs as limoun. Both note the presence of a large, ancient, ruined church in Lower Allar. Robinson describes a fine fountain further up the valley that irrigated fruit trees and gardens below, noting the abundance of olive trees. Gu√©rin describes A'llar es-Sifla ou et-Tahta as an oasis covered in grape vines, citrus, pomengranate and fig trees, irrigated by an ancient canal and a second inexhaustible water source.Robinson and Smith, 1841, p. 340Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. 379-380 In 1856 the village was named Allar el Foka on the map of Southern Palestine that Heinrich Kiepert published that year,Kiepert, 1856, Map of Southern Palestine while an Ottoman village list from about 1870 counted 56 houses and a population of 176, though the population count included men only.Socin, 1879, p. 143Hartmann, 1883, p. 145 also noted 56 houses In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Ellar as \\"A small village on the slope of a ridge, with a well to the south.

It has since been destroyed.Pringle, 1997, p. 28Petersen, 2002, p. 124 Ottoman era In 1838 Beit Mahsir was noted as a Muslim village, located in the District of Beni Malik, west of Jerusalem.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 123 An Ottoman village list from about 1870 found 50 houses and a population of 130, though that population count included men only.Socin, 1879, p. 146Hartmann, 1883, p. 140 also noted 50 houses In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Beit Mahsir as \\"a village of moderate size, standing on a hill at the end of the higher spurs overlooking the lower hills on the west. It has olives to the north and a spring to the north-east.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 16 In 1892, P. Baldensperger recounted a story about the 'Ajami of Beit Mahsir, \\"whose lands were mixed with the village lands, [he] killed several animals which were on his lands. The people thought it was enemies who did it, and one evening they hid themselves, and saw the rider, [..] He asked them what they wanted, and they told him: 'If thou art the 'Ajami, show us thy lands.' The next morning he had shown them by a boundary line all around his lands, and since then, nobody interferes with his grounds. A camel which was feeding on an olive tree was found hanged between its branches; and at another time a jackal was found standing dead with a candle in its mouth at the door of the Makam. Thus the 'Ajami punishes man and beast for going on, or taking anything from his grounds.\\"Baldensperger, 1893, p. 219 Baldensperger later recounted the meeting with a Dervish who had stayed \\"with 'Ajami\\" (apparently a mythical creature) at the 'Ajami shrine above Bayt Mahsir.Baldensperger, 1913, pp. 76-96 In 1896 the population of Bet Mahsir was estimated to be about 258 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 125 British Mandate era In the 1922 census of Palestine, during the early British Mandate of Palestine period, there were 1,367 villagers, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, p. 15 increasing in the 1931 census to 1,920 Muslims, in 445 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 38 In the 1944‚Äì45 statistics, the village had a population of 2,400 Muslims, and the total land area was 16,268 dunams. Of this, 1,348 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, 6,225 dunams were for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 101 while 77 dunams were built-up (urban) Arab land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 151 Bayt Mahsir had three schools; two schools for boys and an elementary school for girls. Bayt Mahsir contains a number of khirbat, including al-Huwaytiyya, al-Masi, Khatula and al- Sallam.Khalidi, 1992, p. 276 The villagers took pride in the fact that the last imam of its mosque, Shaykh Khalil As'ad, was a graduate of Al-Azhar University in Cairo.

He also noted that \\"The remains of a flour mill, a metal machine with flywheels fitted over a stone structure, can still be seen.

It was based on the 1942 short story The Old Gang by Paul Ernst and features additional dialogue by comedian Morey Amsterdam. The working title of this film was Little Mobsters.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80183/Kid-Dynamite/notes.html Plot Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey) practices for his boxing match the next night. In order to raise money, Muggs and the gang go to Nick (Charles Judels)'s pool hall and challenge hall regular Harry Wycoff (Gabriel Dell) to a game of pool. Muggs has pre-arranged with gang member Danny to use special trick chalk for the pool cue so that Wycoff will lose, but Danny (Bobby Jordan) is so convinced of Muggs's talent that he does not use the chalk, and Muggs loses the match. When Wycoff insists that Muggs pay off his wager, Muggs hits him in the stomach and leaves without paying. Seeking revenge, Wycoff plots with bookie Tony (Wheeler Oakman) to eliminate Muggs from the boxing match. The night of the match, Muggs is abducted by a man pretending to be a reporter (Ray Miller), who holds him hostage in the back of a car for the duration of the fight. When Muggs does not show up for the match, Danny goes into the ring so that the East Side Kids will not be disqualified. Although Danny is out of shape, he surprises everyone by winning the match. After Muggs is released, he takes the championship belt from Danny and accuses him of arranging the kidnapping. Muggs continues to harass Danny after he learns that Danny has gotten a job at a garage where he had hoped to work, and that Danny has been dating his sister Ivy (Pamela Blake). When Danny learns about Wycoff's involvement in Muggs' kidnapping, he tries to tell Muggs, but Muggs ostracizes him from the club. Muggs learns from Scruno (Sunshine Sammy)'s father Jackson (Dudley Dickerson) that Wycoff works for Tony, who is also Jackson's boss, and the East Side Kids start a brawl with Tony and his thugs. The Kids are arrested for disturbing the peace, but the judge (Minerva Urecal) releases them without a sentence, and gives Tony and his pals six-months jail time for bookmaking. Later, Danny and Ivy compete in a jitterbug contest, but Muggs and his date (Kay Marvis) are declared the winners until the judge (Jack Chefe) discovers that Muggs' partner is a professional dancer. Muggs is disqualified, and the fifty-dollar prize is awarded to Danny and Ivy. Danny reluctantly turns the money over to Muggs after he threatens him. Danny's boss, Louis Gendick (Henry Hall), a father figure, advises Danny that he has outgrown boys like Muggs, and that he should enlist in the Army. Danny's mother (Marguerita Padula) consents to his enlistment, and he leaves for training camp. Muggs, meanwhile, is moved to enlist when he sees headlines announcing the Nazis' destruction of the entire Czechoslovakian town of Lidice. Muggs' mother (Daphne Pollard) refuses to consent because he appears to be enlisting out of competition with Danny. When Danny returns on leave from training, he proposes to Ivy. Muggs tells Danny that he can still be a member of the gang if he helps them steal tires from Gendick, but Danny now refuses to take orders from Muggs. Danny bests Muggs in a fistfight, which alleviates the tensions between the two old friends. Muggs, who always vowed that the man who married his sister would have to beat him first, now renews his friendship with Danny, and he and Glimpy (Huntz Hall) join the service.

According to the same source, Badr-al Din was a man of great virtue, with a reputation of being close to God. He died 1253 (650 AH), and was buried at his zawiya at Dayr al-Shaykh. Because of him, Dayr al- Shaykh attracted many disciples and other people who came for ziyara.Ephrat, 2008, pp. 158 -159, based on Mujƒ´r al-Dƒ´n Badr-al Din had eight sons; the oldest, al-Sayyid Muhammed (died 1264-65 (663 AH)), is also described as a guide and leader.Ephrat, 2008, p. 159 Abd al-Afiz (died 1296-97 (696 AH), another of his sons to attain leadership status, returned to Jerusalem to a village that was subsequently renamed Sharafat for this family of Ashraf (\\"nobles\\").

However, according to P.J. Baldensperger, writing in 1894, Sheikh Ethman, a direct descendant of Shaykh Badr, was partly a resident of Artas, partly of Dayr al-Shaykh, from 1874-1882. Sheikh Ethman, described in 1894 as a man about 50, with \\"fine features, tall, and very sober in speech\\", wore a green turban as a symbol of his descent from Husayn.

The mosque of Shaykh Sultan Badr remains and is currently a tourist attraction. The Israeli town of Nes Harim is located southwest of the village site, on land formerly belonging to Bayt 'Itab. Andrew Petersen, an archaeologist specializing in Islamic architecture, surveyed the shrine in 1994. The shrine consists of four main structures: a courtyard, a prayer hall, a maqam and a crypt. His conclusion was that the complex evolved over several hundred years, but that the oldest part is the vaulted crypt. This crypt, with the entrance in the south-east corner of the courtyard, has pointed arches which indicate a medieval, possibly Crusader date. The maquam belongs to a second phase of constructions, probably built shortly after the death of Sheik Badr in the 13th century. The prayer hall, which is located in the south-west corner of the complex, is the largest building and was probably constructed during late Mamluk, possibly early Ottoman times.Petersen, 2001, pp. 136-138 Notes References    (p. 264)        * External links *Welcome To Dayr al-Shaykh * Dayr al-Shaykh, Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Dayr Al-Shaykh from the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center *Dary al- Shaykh, Palestine Family.net *Maqam Sheikh Badr el-Din el-Jimali Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:District of Jerusalem Category:Islamic shrines in Israel ","title":"Dayr al-Shaykh"},{"id":"24018939","text":"Khirbat Ism Allah was a Palestinian Arab hamlet in the Jerusalem Subdistrict, located 26 km west of Jerusalem.

Balmy Alley (formally Balmy Street) is a one-block-long alley that is home to the most concentrated collection of murals in the city of San Francisco. It is located in the south central portion of the Inner Mission District between 24th Street and Garfield Square. Since 1973, most buildings on the street have been decorated with a mural.  History  \\"Tributo a Mujeres Muralistas and Future Generations\\" by Precita Eyes Muralists, 1995. The earliest murals in the alley date to 1972, painted by Maria Galivez and children in a local child care center. Artists Patricia Rodriquez and Graciela Carillo had rented an apartment on Balmy Alley and painted their first mural in the Alley, a jungle-underwater scene, in 1973. Their two-woman team soon expanded and became known as Las Mujeres Muralistas. Fellow member Irene Perez painted her own mural on the alley in 1973, depicting two back-to-back figures painting flutes. In 1984, in a second significant wave of murals in the alley, Ray Patlan spearheaded the PLACA project to install murals throughout the alley featuring the common theme of a celebration of indigenous Central American cultures and a protest of US intervention in Central America. Topics of the murals included the Nicaraguan revolution, √ìscar Romero, and the Guatemalan civil war. This culminated in the addition of twenty-seven murals during the summer of 1985, funded in part by a grant of $2,500 from the Zellerbach Foundation. This art project proved influential, inspiring the La Lucha Continua Art Park/La Lucha Mural Park in New York City the following year. Painting continues regularly in the alley, including new murals about gentrification and police harassment in 2012 and a restoration of one the PLACA murals in 2014. Besides those listed above, artists who have produced murals in the alley include Juana Alicia, Susan Kelk Cervantes, Marta Ayala, Brooke Francher, Miranda Bergman, Osha Neuman, Carlos Loarca, Xochitl Nevel-Guerrero, and Sirron Norris.  Influence  thumbBalmy Alley looking south from 24th Street towards Bernal Heights. The Balmy Alley murals have been described, along with San Diego's Chicano Park and Los Angeles' Estrada Courts, as a leading example of mural environments that reclaim spaces for Chicanos and give expression to a history of Chicano displacement and marginalization. The mural grouping in the alley is internationally recognized, both as an exemplar of activist art and as a tourist destination.  Context  The Mission District has San Francisco's densest concentration of murals, often along political themes, sometimes described jointly as the \\"Mission School\\" of muralism. Balmy Alley is often cited as the leading concentration within the Mission. Nearby Clarion Alley, another mural grouping by local artists, was inspired by Balmy Alley.

The Israeli kibbutz of Mishmar David was established that same year on land belonging to the village. History Khulda lay close to a highway connecting Gaza to the Ramla- Jerusalem highway. During the Crusades, the village was known as Huldre. Situated west-south-west of Imwas, prior to the 12th century CE, it lay on the border between the Greek archbishopric of Lydda and the ecclesiastical division of Emmaus, the latter of which was governed directly by archpriest of the Patriarch of Jerusalem.Pringle, 1993, p. 53 During the period of Mamluk rule over Palestine, Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi narrates how the under-Governor of Ramleh in 1495 had to take refuge against marauding Bedouin in a small fort which then existed at Khulda.Mujir al-Din, 1866, p.702 (Arabic text, published by Bulak, Cairo), cited in Clermont-Ganneau, 1896, II, p.251 -252Moudjir ed- dyn, 1876, (French text) p.294 Ottoman era Khulda, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 and in 1596, it formed part of the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Ramla, in the liwa of Gaza. It had a population of 12 households, an estimated sixty-six persons, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, beehives, and goats, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 4,500 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 153. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 389 When Edward Robinson passed by in 1838, he described Khulda as \\"a large village\\" on a hill.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 21 It was also noted as a Muslim village in the southern area in the District of Er-Ramleh.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 120 In 1863 Victor Gu√©rin noted a village with two hundred and fifty inhabitants, situated on a plateau.Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 32 An official village list of about 1870 showed that the village had 28 houses and a population of 76, though the population count included only men.Socin, 1879, p. 151Hartmann, 1883, p. 140 also noted 28 houses Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau visited Khulda in 1871, and was told by the inhabitants that the village used to be surrounded by a fortified wall, two gates of which were still supposed to be in situ. Clermont-Ganneau noted that this agreed well with what Mujir al-Din had written about the place.Clermont-Ganneau, 1896, II, p.467 In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Khulda as a large village, built of stone and mud, situated on a hill. The village had a masonry well to the east.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p.408. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 389 British Mandate era During British rule over Mandate Palestine, ten labourers from Khulda worked gratis for the Jewish National Fund on the Khulde drainage project, most of which took place on the Arab village's lands.Sufian, 2007, p.324. N.B. In this text, Khulda is referred to as Khuldeh el-Islam, presumably to distinguish it from the newly created nearby Jewish settlement which was also named Khulde. The project, like others of its kind was essential to Jewish settlement in Palestine, as malaria had impeded permanent settlement at Jewish Khulde in 1921.Sufian, 2007, p. 103 In the 1922 census of Palestine, Khulda had a population of 53 inhabitants, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub- district of Ramleh, p. 21 increasing in the 1931 census to 178, still all Muslims, in 29 inhabited houses.Mills, 1932, p. 21 The villagers maintained a mosque and there were two water wells for domestic use. Villagers in Khulda were engaged in the rearing of animal livestock. The Lydda District had one of the largest animal markets in Palestine, alongside that of the Nazareth District; however, starvation was a common affliction among the herds in the former in the 20th century, and the herd at Khulda was described as 'a typical specimen of extreme debility'.El-Eini, 2006, p. 398. In the 1945 statistics, the population had grown to 280 Muslims, with a total of 9,461 dunams of land. Of this, a total of 8,994 dunums were used for cereals, 9 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945.

Kibbutz Mishmar David was established in 1948, about west of the village site, on village land. Tal Shachar is nearby, about south of the village site, but it is not on village land.Khalidi, 1992, p. 389 Andrew Petersen, an archaeologist specializing in Islamic architecture visited Khulda in 1993, and notes that the remains of at least four stone buildings can be seen, although only two of them are standing. The first of these is a rectangular structure ( x ) with two separate rooms, each with its own entrance. Each door is flanked with two large windows. Both doors and windows are covered with lintels, above which is a relieving arch. An inscription above one of the doors have been removed. The roof is made with iron girders, with reinforced concrete, while the walls are dressed limestone. According to Petersen, the building must have served some public purpose, and it probably dates from the final years of the Ottoman rule, or the early British Mandate of Palestine period.Petersen, 2001, p. 200 The second building stands north of first one, and is about half in size (6 m x 6 m). The roof is made in the same manner as the first house. The walls are made of boulders and rubble stone, joined together with mud mortar. A shallow niche in the south wall might be a mihrab. The walls are decorated with stencilled friezes of palm tree and palmettes in blue-green. A barely legible inscription above the door gives a 14th-century AH (late 19th-century CE) date.

Plot The film opens with two young British cavalry officers, Captain William Morris and Captain Louis Nolan, leaving home and bidding farewell to their wives in the parlor of the Nolans' residence. After the men leave the room, the film cuts to scenes much later in a British encampment in the Crimea, near the small harbor town of Balaklava, where Morris and Nolan are writing letters as fellow troopers assemble the evening before the battle. Scenes then depict cavalry units preparing for action the next day. Lord Raglan, the one-armed commander-in-chief of Britain‚Äôs Crimean forces, is portrayed on horseback issuing orders of engagement as he surveys the terrain and Russian troop positions. The film then depicts Captain Nolan taking Raglan's orders and riding to relay them to George Bingham, the Earl of Lucan, who commands the army‚Äôs cavalry division. Lucan, also on horseback, is forward in the field and is scanning the enemy as well. When he delivers the orders, Nolan appears to gesture in the general direction of Russian batteries guarding the end of the valley instead of toward Raglan's intended objective, captured British guns positioned elsewhere. Despite the mix-up in Raglan's orders, Lucan commands his subordinate Lord Cardigan, to lead a full charge of his light brigade into the valley, which is heavily fortified on three sides by lines of Russian cannons. Cardigan and his 673 men dutifully obey the order even though their mission appears to be a near-suicidal task, offering little chance of success.\\"Charge of the Light Brigade\\", The National Archives, Kew, Richmond, Greater London, United Kingdom.

It was located 20. km south of Ramla. The hill on which the village was built stands today next to the Kiryat Mal'akhi ‚Äì Yoav railway station and next to Highway 6. Archeological excavations at the site revealed the remains of a Byzantine settlement. History Based on the archaeological excavation in the eastern foot of the hill on which the village used to stand, a settlement was established in the site as early as the Byzantine era. Pottery, glassware and coins allowed the researchers to date this settlement to a short period between roughly 375 to 425 CE. The excavation has revealed remains of what may be a storehouse, with many broken wine jars. The structure included a drainage system that collected water from its roof to somewhere beyond the excavation limits. The region is abundant with water and thus the hill serves as a good place for settlement. Elie Haddad who headed the excavation suggested that this abundance of water is hinted in the name of the village, \\"the fig tree\\", as it requires a large supply of water to grow. The identity of the Byzantine inhabitants remains unknown and based on the study, the site remained unsettled until the Ottoman period. Al-Tina was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the tax registers under the name of Safiriyya, as being in the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Gaza, which was part of Gaza Sanjak. It had a population of 10 households; an estimated 55 persons, who were all Muslims.

It stood on the Korazim Plateau in the Galilee on a hill above the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, two and a half miles from Capernaum. Khirbat Karraza (also Karraza, Kh. Karazeh, Kerazeh) was an Arab village established at the site of the ancient village and depopulated during the 1947‚Äì1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine on May 4, 1948 by the Palmach's First Battalion during Operation Yiftach. It was located 8.5 km southeast of Safad. The nearby Israeli town of Korazim is named for this location. History Roman and Byzantine periods Gospels, apocrypha, exegesis Chorazin, along with Bethsaida and Capernaum, was named in the gospels of Matthew and Luke as \\"cities\\" (more likely just villages) in which Jesus performed mighty works. However, because these towns rejected his work (\\"they had not changed their ways\\"), they were subsequently cursed (; ). The gospels make no other mention of Chorazin or what works had occurred there. Due to the condemnation of Jesus, the influential Apocalypse of Pseudo- Methodius predicted that the Antichrist would be conceived in Chorazin. Theologian John Lightfoot (1602‚Äì1675) suggested that Chorazin might have been an area around Cana in Galilee, rather than a single city/village: :What if, under this name, Cana be concluded, and some small country adjacent, which, from its situation in a wood, might be named \\"Chorazin\\", that is, 'the woody country'? Cana is famous for the frequent presence and miracles of Christ. But away with conjecture, when it grows too bold.Lightfoot, J., A Commentary on the New Testament From the Talmud and Hebraica: Matthew, accessed 6 January 2017 Babylonian Talmud The Babylonian Talmud (redacted until c. 475) mentions that Chorazin was a town known for its grain (Menahot, 85a). Scientific research Two settlement phases have been proposed based on coin and pottery findings.Jews and Christians in the Holy Land: Palestine in the Fourth Century The town was partially destroyed in the 4th century, possibly as a result of an earthquake.Stemberger, 2000, pp.141-142 Ottoman period Khirbat Karraza in the PEF Survey of Palestine Khirbat Karraza was populated by the Zanghariyya Bedouin tribe and the village contained a shrine for a local Muslim saint, al-Shaykh Ramadan. The villagers used to store grain close to the shrine, certain that nobody would steal it and thereby violate the sanctity of the shrine. Israel The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the place in 1992: \\"The site serves as an archaeological and tourist area. Some village houses still stand, together with the remains of other houses. One of the old houses has been renovated. Also remaining is the tomb of Shaykh Ramadan, around which the village shrine had been built. The tomb is collapsing and the building in which it was housed no longer exists. It is surrounded by large carob trees.\\"Khalidi, 1992, p. 462 Archaeology Olive oil press \\"Seat of Moses\\" made of basalt from the synagogue House ruin with \\"Chorazin windows\\" 19th-century explorers In his Biblical Researches in Palestine in the mid-nineteenth century, Edward Robinson visited Khirbat Karraza, but concluded it was not the Biblical Chorazin, because the ruins were not significant enough and the site was not near the shore of the Sea of Galilee, as stated by Jerome (Lacum Genesareth, in cujus litore Capernaum et Tiberias et Bethsaida et Chorozaim sit√¶ sint): > The ruins we had been told of lie on the west side of this same valley, a > quarter of a mile southwest, near its entrance into the main Wady.

In this we felt ourselves disappointed. The remains are > too trivial to have ever belonged to a place of any importance. Chorazin, > too, according to Jerome, lay upon the shore of the lake; but this site is > an hour distant. shut in among the hills, without any view of the lake, and > remote from any public road whether ancient or modern. Excavations and general outline Extensive excavations and a survey were carried out in 1962-1964. Excavations at the site were resumed in 1980-1987. In May‚ÄìJune 2004, a small-scale salvage excavation was conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority along the route of an ancient road north of Moshav Amnun. In the literature, the road is referred to as \\"the way through Korazim.\\" It crossed the Chorazin plateau from west to east, branching off from the main Cairo‚ÄìDamascus road that ran northeast toward Daughters of Jacob Bridge.Kh. Umm el-Kalkha The majority of the structures are made from basalt, a black volcanic rock found locally.Hachlili, Rachel. Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Land of Israel The main settlement dates to the 3rd and 4th centuries. The town's ruins are spread over an area of , subdivided into five separate quarters, with a synagogue in the centre. Close by is a ritual bath (mikvah), surrounded by public and residential buildings. Synagogue Decorated stone from the synagogue The only synagogue visible today was built in the late 3rd century, destroyed in the 4th century, and rebuilt in the 6th century. The large, impressive synagogue which was built of basalt stones and decorated with Jewish motifs is the most striking of the surviving structures. An unusual feature in an ancient synagogue is the presence of three- dimensional sculpture, a pair of stone lions. A similar pair of three- dimensional lions was found in the synagogue at Kfar Bar'am. p.190 Other carvings, which are thought to have originally been brightly painted, feature images of wine-making, animals, a Medusa, an armed soldier, and an eagle. p.92 In 1926, archaeologists discovered the \\"Seat of Moses,\\" carved from a basalt block. According to the New Testament, this is where the reader of the Torah sat (). Second synagogue (?) Jacob Ory, who excavated the site in 1926 on behalf of the British Mandate Department of Antiquities, wrote about a second synagogue ca. 200 m west of the first one, and he described it in detail. Later excavations, however, have not been able to find the remains noted by him. Other findings The handful of olive millstones used in olive oil extraction found suggest a reliance on the olive for economic purposes, like a number of other villages in ancient Galilee.

History British Mandate era  In the British Mandate period, in the 1931 census Arab al-Baqqara had a population of 245 Muslims, in 34 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 105 By the 1945 statistics the population was 360 Muslims, with a total of 2,262 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 1,961 dunums were used for cereals; 60 dunums were irrigated or used for plantations, while a 120 dunams were non-cultivable area.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 169 1948, aftermath  In April, 1948, large part of the population left the village after full-scale hostilities broke out.Morris, 2004, p. 249 After the 1948 Palestine war, according to the armistice agreements of 1949 Between Israel and Syria, it was determined that a string of villages, including Al-Nuqayb Al-Hamma, Al-Samra in the Tiberias Subdistrict and Kirad al-Baqqara and Kirad al-Ghannama further north in Safad Subdistrict, would be included the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between Israel and Syria. The villagers and their property were formally protected by Article V of the Israeli-Syrian agreement of 20 July that year. UN Doc S/1353 Syria Israel Armistice Agreement of 20 July 1949 However, Israel thought the villagers could pose a security threat, and Israeli settlers and settlement agencies coveted the land. Israel therefore wanted the Palestinian inhabitants, a total of 2,200 villagers, moved to Syria.Morris, 2004, p.512 In the spring of 1951, Israel decided to assert its sovereignty over the DMZ, including \\"the transfer of Arab civilians from the area..\\" On the night of the 30 March they forcibly transferred all the 800 inhabitants of Kirad al- Ghannama and Kirad al-Baqqara to Sha'ab.Morris, 1993, p.362Morris, 2004, p. 513 A United Nations decision allowed the villagers to return, however, Israel pressured them to remain in Sha'ab. In spite of this, many of the villagers returned to their homes in the DMZ. In 1956 Israel expelled the two Khirad- villages again, and this time the sites were physically destroyed and ploughed over. Most of the villagers went to Syria, a few went back to Sha'ab.Morris, 1993, p.362, citing Burns, E.L.M., pp.115-118, and Summary of meeting with Prime Minister (of Israel) 4 July 1951.

Al- Mansura () was a Palestinian Arab village in the Safad Subdistrict. It was located northeast of Safad on the Banyas River, to the south of what is now Dafna. History Ottoman period The Christian missionary W.M. Thomson, traveling during the Ottoman Empire period, in 1852, mentions a corn mill at Mansura and comments that the wider region depended on the area around Mansura for Indian corn, rice and sesamum. He saw hundreds of bee hives in Mansura. They were made from cylindrical baskets covered in mud and dung which were piled into a pyramid and covered with a thatched roof. As well as honey production the residents also exported buffalo butter from their large herds of water buffalo. He comments that the area had a large permanent population, the Ghawaraneh tribe, living in tents. He writes that he knows the names of over thirty permanent Arab encampments in the Huleh plain.Thomson, 1859, vol 1, pp. 388-389 In January 1869 canoeing pioneer John MacGregor spent the night beside the village corn-mill. It was the only stone building in the area and had a flat roof. Other buildings he saw had mud walls with a reed roof or were completely made of reeds. There were also bedouin in tents. The miller was Christian and had arrived the year before following the killing of four of his children during the massacres further north. Besides milling corn he also sold gunpowder.MacGregor, 1869, pp. 241-245, 247. As the MacGregor party, with his canoe on the back of a mule, approached Al-Mansura they met a procession celebrating the end of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr. They were greeted with excitement because it was assumed they were entertainers travelling to the village to join in the celebrations. MacGregor commented that most of the men had tattoos or scars on their faces as well as ear and nose rings. The women's face were stained with blue patterns. \\"Their dress was the most various possible, long and short, coloured and plain, scanty and ample, of camel¬¥s hair from Damascus, silk from Lebanon and Manchester cotton.\\"MacGregor, 1869, p. 241, cited in Rajab, 1989, pp. 129, 131 In 1881 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described the village as consisting \\"of stone and mud hovels on the plain, surrounded by arable land; river near; the village contains about seventy Moslems.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 89 British Mandate of Palestine period In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Mansura had an all-Muslim population of 41.Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Safad, p. 41 This had increased in the 1931 census when El Mansura had an all-Muslim population of 89, in 18 houses.Mills , 1932, p. 108 In the 1945 statistics the population was 360, all Muslims, owning 1,254 dunams of land, while Jews owned 175 dunams, and 115 was publicly owned, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

The village was on a descent at the southwestern part of Safad, a town east of the village. Possibly named after the Mamluk sultan al-Zahir Baybars (), the village was incorporated into the Safad Sanjak of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and its entirely Muslim population paid fixed taxes, as well as taxes on winter pastures, an olive oil or grape syrup press and beehives during the 16th century. By the late 19th century, the population grew to 335 inhabitants, all Muslims. The population remained about the same in the last years of British Mandatory rule. The village lands spanned 6,773 dunums, nearly half of which were used to grow grains, the residents living on 28 dunums.

Name According to Edward Henry Palmer the name Edh Dhaheriyeh et Tahta means \\"The lower village on the ridge\\", while according to Walid Khalidi, the name Zahiriyya might be a tribute to the Mamluk Sultan al- Zahir Baybars.

Their dialect was close to Egyptian Arabic. The village's main industry was harvesting the papyrus groves of Lake Huleh and the manufacture of papyrus matting.

The newspaper stated that on 18 February a British Army patrol approaching Taytaba was attacked by Arab fighters prompting the dispatch of British reinforcements. British forces eventually withdrew and no casualties were reported. On 15 February a unit from the Haganah (precursor to the Israeli Army) attacked Taytaba following a mass killing they committed at the nearby Palestinian-Arab village of Sa'sa'. No details of the attack on Taytaba were mentioned the Associated Press report. It is not known exactly when Taytaba was captured by Israel or emptied of its residents, but most likely fell in May during the later stages of the Israeli offensive Operation Yiftach. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, as such its residents probably evacuated or were expelled between the capture of Safad on 11 May or the end of the operation on 25 May. The Palestinian historian Nafez Nazzal contends that most of Taytaba's inhabitants left the village in early May as a result of the massacre at Ein al-Zeitun.Morris, 2004, p. 226, note #459, p. 290 Following the news of the massacre, many families fled to temporarily camp in the fields between the village and nearby Ras al-Ahmar. However, armed men remained in Taytaba until retreating after Jewish forces attacked in October.Esber, 2008, p. 337. In 1992 Khalidi noted about Taytaba: \\"The village site contains the stone rubble of razed houses. A few olive trees still stand, growing among the thorny plants and grass.

According to tradition, Hadatha was one of the \\"Al-Hija\\" villages named after Emir Hussam al-Din Abu al-Hija. Abu al-Hija (\\"the Daring\\") was an Iraqi-born commander of the Kurdish forces that took part in Sultan Saladin's conquest (1187‚Äì93) of the Crusader Kingdom. He was renowned for his bravery, and commanded the garrison of Acre at the time of the Siege of Acre (1189‚Äì1192). Abu al-Hija apparently returned to Iraq, but several members of his family remained in the country under orders from Saladin, and these family members settled on large tracts of land that they were given in the Carmel region, in the Lower, Eastern and Western Galilee, and in the Hebron Highlands. Self-proclaimed kinsmen of al-Hija settled in the villages of Hadatha and Sirin in the Lower Galilee, and Ruweis and Kawkab in the Western Galilee. By tradition the descendants today still claim to be blood relations of al-Hija.

However, in the spring of that year, Israel decided to assert its sovereignty over the village.Morris, 1993, p. 362 On 4 April that year, the IDF General Staff (ignoring protests from the Northern Command) sent two patrol vehicles towards the village.Morris, 1993, p. 363 Since Israel was not allowed to have soldiers in the DMZ, the patrol was disguised as policemen.Morris, 1993, p. 363, citing Shalev: Shituf-Peula, 168-73 In what became known as the Al-Hamma Incident, seven Israeli soldiers were killed by the Syrians. The following day, four Israeli planes bombed the police station at Al-Hamma and a Syrian position at Al Hadid. Two women were killed, and six people reported injured. According to Walid Khalidi, Israel then decided to \\"drive the villagers out\\", and proceeded to do so during 1949‚Äì1956. He described the village site in 1992: > The site has been converted into an Israeli tourist park (Hamat Gader), with > parking facilities, swimming pools, and a small fishing pond. The deserted > mosque still stands, and its minaret and marble columns are intact. Five > buildings east of the village site are built of black basalt.

He married, moved to Havana, and later emigrated with his family to Miami around 1920, eventually moving to Brooklyn and finally to Philadelphia, where he is believed to have died sometime in the 1950s or 1960s. Consalvos worked for much of his life as a factory cigar roller. (Greaves 2008). Art A large body of Consalvos' art work was discovered in 1983 at a Philadelphia garage sale. The body of work consists of over 800 collages on paper, found photographs, musical instruments, furniture, and other objects. Consalvos' playful and often subversively political work‚Äîon which he is thought to have collaborated with his son, Jose Felipe Consalvos -- appropriated cigar bands and cigar-box paper, along with magazine images, family photographs, postage stamps, and cut-up money. Following extensive conservation work, Consalvos' work was first exhibited in a solo show in 2004 at Fleisher/Ollman Gallery in Philadelphia. Subsequently, his work has appeared in a number of public exhibitions and collections, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the American Folk Art Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago. (Greaves 2008). Consalvos has been described by art critic Roberta Smith as a \\"self-starting modernist\\" who is \\"nearly on a par with folk-art greats like Henry Darger, Martin Ramirez and James Castle.\\" According to Smith, Consalvos' work \\"belongs to the collage continuum from Hannah H√∂ch to Barbara Kruger.\\" (Smith 2006).

In 1265, after the Mamluks had defeated the Crusaders, sultan Baybars made a grant of the village land to three of his amirs: Fakhr al-Din 'Uthman b. al-Malik al-Mughith, Shams al-Din Salar al-Baghdadi, and Sarim al-Din Siraghan.Ibn al-Furat, 1971, pp. 81, 210, 249 (map) Ottoman era Al-Jalama was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in the 1596 tax records it was named Jalama dir Qaqun, part of nahiya (subdistrict) of Sara under the liwa' (district) of Lajjun. It had an all-Muslim population of 7 households, who paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, summer crops, occasional revenues, beehives and/or goats; a total of 12,000 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 160 Pierre Jacotin named the village Tour de Zeitah on his map from Napoleon's invasion in 1799. The French fought a battle here, which is known as the \\"Battle of Zeita\\".Karmon, 1960, p. 170 In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described the village as a small adobe hamlet, situated on the side of a knoll.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 152 British Mandate era The modern village originated from farmland, belonging to the inhabitants of Attil. The farmers settled on the land nearby, and in the 1922 census there were 29 villagers, all Muslim.Barron, 1923, Table IX, Sub-district of Tulkarem, p. 27 In the 1931 census of Palestine it was counted under Attil (together with Al-Manshiyya and Zalafa),Mills, 1932, p. 53 while by the 1945 statistics al-Jalama had grown to a population of 70, mainly belonging to two extended families, the Nadaf and the Daqqa. As the village was constructed on an old site, some archaeological remains were used for constructing houses. The houses were mainly constructed of stone or adobe. In the 1930s and 1940s, some houses were constructed of cement. The villagers, who were Muslim, grew watermelons, oranges and other crops. A well, east of the village, provided water for domestic needs. 1948, and aftermath On the 3 April 1949, al- Jalama came under Israeli control with the signing of the Jordan‚ÄìIsrael Mixed Armistice Commission.Benvenisti, 2002, p. 157UN Doc S/1302/Rev.1 of 3 April 1949 According to Article VI, section 6 in this Armistice Agreement, the villagers were \\"protected in, their full rights of residence, property and freedom.\\" However, the Israeli annexation of the villages made them subject to laws that had the purpose of stripping them of their land so that the land could then be given to Jewish settlements, and to eliminate the possibility of return.Benvenisti, 2002, p. 158 During the period of clearing the borders of Palestinians, Israel emptied al-Jalama (now consisting of 225 people) on 1 March 1950. They were expelled by the military to the neighbouring village of Jatt, a move that Meron Benvenisti called \\"unquestionably illegal\\".Benvenisti, 2002, p. 160 The villagers petitioned the Supreme Court of Israel for permission to return, which was granted in June 1952. However, members from the kibbutz Lehavot Haviva had settled on their land. On 11 August 1953, they blew up the remaining houses in al-Jalama, thereby making sure that the Palestinian landowners could not return. The kibbutzniks claimed that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had ordered them to do this and had given them funds for that purpose. The IDF denied this.Morris, 2004, pp. 533-4 Israel then passed several retroactive laws that legalised the expropriation of the al-Jalama land.Benvenisti, 2002, p. 161 References Bibliography   Hofnung, Menachem, (1991).

Those who remained leased a block of land for a period of six years with the opportunity to purchase when the lease expired. They paid rental at 6% of the published sale offer on the land, but later, at the request of the farmers in Nuris, this was changed to one-fifth of the total yield in agricultural output of the land. After the original six-year lease was up, reports in 1928 showed that no villagers had bought the land leased to them. The leases were extended for three years while the ownership was transferred to the Jewish National Fund. In 1921 the average farmer cultivated 24 dunums, by 1929 this had drastically reduced to 4.4, although the population grew significantly.Stein, 1987, p. 57 In the 1931 census, Nuris had a population of 429 people and a recorded 106 houses were located in the village.Mills, 1932, p. 70 In the 1945 statistics, Nuris had 570 Muslim inhabitants with 163 houses, although the area was much smaller than it had been before 1920, with an area of 6256 dunums.

Panhorst Bridge, more commonly known as the Russian Gulch Bridge, is a reinforced concrete open-spandrel deck arch bridge on California State Highway 1, spanning Russian Gulch Creek in Russian Gulch State Park, Mendocino County, California, United States. It is named after Frederick W. Panhorst, who served as the Chief of the Bridge Section of the California Division of Highways from 1931 to 1960. Design The bridge was designed by Henry E. Kuphal. It is similar in design to the more famous Bixby Creek Bridge several hundred miles south on the same highway, but in contrast to the Bixby Creek Bridge, its arch is supported only by the two rocky headlands on either side without need for buttresses.. Its main span is long, and its total length is ;. it carries an average of 10,500 vehicles per day. History Prior to the bridge's opening, traffic across the gulch was carried on a wooden trestle bridge, built in 1911, that was designed to support the weight of a 6-horse team but was inadequate for later motorized vehicle traffic.. The present bridge was constructed at the expense of US$109,000 from 1939 to 1940, and it was dedicated by governor Culbert Olson on June 9, 1940... In 1996‚Äì1998, the Russian Gulch Bridge and eleven other Mendocino County bridges underwent seismic retrofitting, at a total cost of US$9.7 million...

Panhorst was Chief of the Bridge Section of the California Division of Highways from 1931 to 1960, and served as a director for the American Society of Civil Engineers.. Evaluation View of the bridge from the south headland in Russian Gulch State Park Retired California bridge engineer Arthur Elliott considered the Russian Gulch Bridge to be the most beautiful of California's concrete arch bridges,. and it is the frequent subject of photographs.. The columns of the bridge are spaced more widely as they become longer, adding to its aesthetics.. It is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places as the embodiment of a typical mid-20th-century open-spandrel concrete arch bridge, and as an example of the late-career work of Kuphal..

The route will travel in Hungary through Cegl√©d, Szolnok, Karcag, P√ºsp√∂klad√°ny, Beretty√≥√∫jfalu, and Nagykereki before reaching the Romanian border. History, plans and ongoing construction The road's origins can be traced much further back in time - as far back as 1974, when the first section of the future motorway was opened. This section, from Albertirsa to Cegl√©d, served to bypass the older, congested Route 40, that passed through these towns. This was extended in 2005 to bypass Abony and Szolnok. The same year, the T√∂r√∂kszentmikl√≥s bypass opened. On 6 July 2011, a bypass also opened at Kis√∫jsz√°ll√°s. Most of these sections are only 1 lane per direction. This route soon became congested, and the section going south of Szolnok was found to be unsuitable to upgrade to motorway status, so on 16 September 2013, a contract was signed regarding the new route of the motorway. This route would go northwards of Szolnok, crossing the Tisza rivers, and shortening the route of the motorway. Work will be done by Strabag, and the contract cost 10 billion Hungarian Forints. Since the motorway passes through an environmental area, protective fencing is to be installed on the new sections from √úll≈ë towards T√∂r√∂kszentmikl√≥s. Whilst this section was supposed to open by 2016, construction work was stopped on 30 June 2015, to investigate the companies who were building the road. Apparently, the project was submitted to the EU to be supported in 2013, but it never received approval. There was also the huge cost of the route - 4 Billion HUF per kilometer. The work on this section has restarted with a planned completion date of early 2022. M0-M4 interchange seen from the air, 20 June 2006. Notice the then-under construction section of the M0. Preparatory work has started for the T√∂r√∂kszentmikl√≥s-Kis√∫jsz√°ll√°s-Karcag-P√ºsp√∂klad√°ny-Beretty√≥√∫jfalu section. This section envisaged an interchange with the M8 motorway, but the procurement procedure was abolished on 26 February 2014, leaving work halted on this section. Sections finished or to be completed in 2020 The 10 km long Vecs√©s-√úll≈ë bypass opened in 2004, completed up to motorway standards. This also helped to ease access into the Liszt Ferenc International Airport. However, this has left a gap between Albertirsa and √úll≈ë, and the old road going through Monor soon became a bottleneck. This 29 kilometer long section of M4 was completed on February 7, 2020. In 2019, a section near Cegl√©d section was upgraded to a dual carriageway but so far it lacks the motorway status. An upgrade to that status is planned when the section between Cegl√©d and Abony is completed in the summer of 2020. A 4-kilometer stretch of M4, near Beretty√≥√∫jfalu, was inaugurated on December 20, 2018. This section serves to link the M35 motorway to Route 47.https://civishir.hu/helyben- jaro/2018/12/kesz-az-m35-os-vege-es-az-m4-es-eleje The M4 as seen heading towards the Romanian border, near Derecske, 27 December 2018 Works also started in 2016 on the Beretty√≥√∫jfalu-Nagykereki section, which will connect to the Romanian A3 motorway, towards Oradea, Cluj, T√¢rgu Mure»ô and Bucharest. However, just like the work on the A3 motorway in Romania, they were stopped due to funding issues. In 2018, Hungary received up to 265 million Euros from the EU Cohesion Funds specifically to complete this section of the M4 expressway. It was opened on September 4, 2020.

In August 2020, the wiki received scrutiny from social media and news media for the poor quality of the Scots writing in many of its articles; it is currently undergoing review by both the larger Wikipedia community and speakers of Scots.  Reception  By February 2008, the site contained 2,200 articles and had outpaced Maori Wikipedia and Kashmiri Wikipedia. Reported reception, however, was mixed, with Scotland on Sunday's literary editor describing it as \\"convoluted at best, and an absolute parody at worst,\\" while Ted Brocklebank, culture spokesman for the Scottish Tories, described it as a \\"cheap attempt at creating a language.\\" However, Chris Robinson, director of the Dictionary of the Scots Language, spoke more positively of the site, noting: \\"The fact it is doing well gives a lie to all those people who decry Scots and try to do it down.\\" In 2014, Jane C. Hu of Slate.com described the site as reading \\"like a transcription of a person with a Scottish accent\\", and said one Wikipedia editor had proposed that the project be closed, in the mistaken belief that it was a practical joke. In 2020, the site attracted attention after a Reddit post noted that the project contained an unusually high number of articles written by a single prolific contributor who is not fluent in the Scots language, writing without using genuine Scots idioms or grammatical structure and assumed to be using an online English-Scots dictionary to crudely translate English Wikipedia article segments. At least 20,000 articles were created by this American teenager. Robert McColl Millar, the chair in linguistics and Scottish language at the University of Aberdeen, said that the affected articles displayed \\"a very limited knowledge both of Modern Scots and its earlier manifestations\\".

The mosque is run by the (co-located) Islamic Society of Victoria Inc (ISV) and, between 2007 and 2011, was the seat of the late Muslim cleric, Sheik Fehmi Naji El-Imam, who was appointed as Grand Mufti of Australia. History Before the mosque was built, Muslims would gather at a house that used to be on the property. In 1975 the building began and was completed the following year in 1976. The dome and minaret were added later. Most of it was funded by Bosnian Muslims and Arabs. Background About 800 people pass through the mosque per day over the course of the five daily prayers. For the Friday Congregational Prayer, at least 1000 worshipers will attend, and if the Friday falls on a public holiday that number can easily climb to 1500 worshipers. Memorandum of Understanding In 2009, the Darebin City Council signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Islamic Society of Victoria (ISV). This was the first of its kind in Australia between a mosque and council, and has resulted in a strong and robust relationship between Council and mosque. The focus of the memorandum is that the council and mosque will work together on projects that have benefit to the community.

It was reported that this proposal outraged the local Muslim women. In early 2017, police were called to the mosque following a serious altercation between factions. It was reported the conflict was over financial irregularities at the mosque. Sheikh Mohamad Mahmoud Abou Eid was suspended.

Synthetic musks have a clean, smooth and sweet scent lacking the fecal notes of animal musks. They are used as flavorings and fixatives in cosmetics, detergents, perfumes and foods, supplying the base note of many perfume formulas. Most musk fragrance used in perfumery today is synthetic. Synthetic musks in a narrower sense are chemicals modeled after the main odorants in animal musk: muscone in deer musk, and civetone in civet. Muscone and civetone are macrocyclic ketones. Other structurally different but functionally similar compounds also came to be known as musks.  Nitro musks  Musk xylene An artificial musk was obtained by Albert Baur in 1888 by condensing toluene with isobutyl bromide in the presence of aluminium chloride, and nitrating the product. It was discovered accidentally as a result of Baur's attempts at producing a more effective form of trinitrotoluene (TNT). It appears that the odour depends upon the symmetry of the three nitro groups. * Musk xylene * Musk ketone  (Hydrated) indanes  Cashmeran * 6-Acetyl-1,1,2,3,3,5-hexamethylindane ** Phantolide (Haarmann & Reimer) * 4-Acetyl-1,1-dimethyl-6-tert-butylindane ** Celestolide (IFF) ** Crysolide (Givaudan Roure) * 5-Acetyl-1,1,2,6-tetramethyl-3-isopropylindane ** Traseolide (Quest) * 1,2,3,5,6,7-Hexahydro-1,1,2,3,3-pentamethyl-4H-inden-4-one ** Cashmeran, not a true musk but with musk odor (IFF)  Cyclic ethers  Ambroxide Galaxolide The creation of this class of musks was largely prompted through the need for eliminating the nitro functional group from nitro-musks due to their photochemical reactivity and their instability in alkaline media. This was shown to be possible through the discovery of ambral [evidence needed, appears clear error as ambral is not a musk], a non-nitro aromatic musk, which promoted research in the development of nitro-free musks. This led to the eventual discovery of phantolide, so named due to its commercialization by Givaudan without initial knowledge of its chemical structure (elucidated 4 years later). While poorer in smell strength, the performance and stability of this compound class in harsh detergents led to its common use, which spurred further development of other polycyclic musks including Galaxolide. * 3a,6,6,9a-Tetramethyldodecahydronaphtho-[2,1-b]furan ** Ambrox, not a musk (Firmenich) ** Ambroxan, not a musk (Cognis) * 4,6,6,7,8,8-Hexamethyl-1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydrocyclopenta[g]benzopyrane ** Galaxolide (IFF)  Macrocyclic ketones  Muscone A class of artificial musk consisting of a single ring composed of more than 6 carbons (often 10-15). Of all artificial musks, these most resemble the primary odoriferous compound from Tonkin musk in its \\"large ringed\\" structure. While the macrocyclic musks extracted from plants consists of large ringed lactones, all animal derived macrocyclic musks are ketones. Although muscone, the primary macrocyclic compound of musk was long known, it was only in 1926 that Leopold Ruzicka was able to synthesize this compound in very small quantities. Despite this discovery and the discovery of other pathways for synthesis of macrocyclic musks, compound of this class were not commercially produced and commonly utilized until the late 1990s due to difficulties in their synthesis and consequently higher price. * (R)-3-Methylcyclopentadecanone ** Muscone * (Z)-9-Cycloheptadecen-1-one ** Civetone * Cyclopentadecanone ** Exaltone (Firmenich) * 3-Methylcyclopentadec-4/5-en-1-one ** Muscenone (Firmenich) * 5-Cyclohexadecen-1-one ** TM II SP (Soda Aromatic) ** Ambretone (Takasago)  Aliphatic lactones  * Œ≥-Decalactone, not a musk * Œ≥-Dodecalactone, not a musk  Polycyclic lactones  Sclareolide * Decahydrotetramethylnaphthofuranone ** Sclareolide, not a musk (found in clary sage)  Macrocyclic lactones  Cyclopentadecanolide * 15-Pentadecanolide ** Cyclopentadecanolide (Haarmann & Reimer) ** Exaltolide (Firmenich) ** Pentalide (Soda Aromatic) * Oxacyclohexadec-12/13-en-2-one ** Habanolide (Firmenich) ** Globalide (Haarmann & Reimer) * 12-Oxa-16-hexadecanolide ** Musk R 1 (Quest) * Œ±,œâ-Dodecanedioic acid ethylene ester ** Arova 16 (Degussa) * Œ±,œâ-Tridecanedioic acid ethylene ester ** Musk T (Takasago) ** Ethylene Brassylate (Degussa) * (10Z)-13-methyl-1-oxacyclopentadec-10-en-2-one ** Nirvanolide (Givaudan Roure) * œâ-6-Hexadecenlactone ** Ambrettolide (found in Ambrette seed oil) * 14-Methylpentadecano-15-lactone ** Muscolide (found in Angelica seed oil)  Hydronaphthalenes  Iso E Super * 1-(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-2,3,8,8,-tetramethyl-2-naphthyl)ethan-1-one ** Iso E Super, not a musk (IFF) * (-)-(6S,7S)-3,5,5,6,7,8,8-heptamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalene-2-carbaldehyde ** Vulcanolide (Firmenich) * 6-Acetyl-1,1,2,4,4,7-hexamethyltetraline (AHTN) ** Fixolide (Givaudan Roure) ** Tonalide (Haarmann & Reimer) ** Tetralide (Bush Boake Allen)  Alicyclic musks  Helvetolide Alicyclic musks, otherwise known as cycloalkyl ester or linear musks, are a relatively novel class of musk compounds. The first compound of this class was introduced 1975 with Cyclomusk, though similar structures were noted earlier in citronellyl oxalate and Rosamusk. Alicyclic musks are dramatically different in structure than previous musks (aromatic, polycyclic, macrocyclic) in that they are modified alkyl esters. Although they were discovered prior to 1980, it was only in 1990 with the discovery and introduction of Helvetolide at Firmenich that a compound of this class was produced at a commercial scale. Romandolide, a more ambrette and less fruity alicyclic musk compared to Helvetolide, was introduced ten years later.  Environmental and health issues  Synthetic musks are lipophilic compounds and tend to deposit and persist in fat tissues. Nitromusks and polycyclic musks ‚Äì having been used for 100 years ‚Äì have low biodegradability and accumulate in the environment. Chemicals such as musk ketone and diethyl phthalate, which are found in perfume formulas, can lead to allergic reactions, hormone disruption and it has been suggested that exposure to perfumes and/or synthetic fragrances may be linked to the development of autism spectrum disorder.

He was educated at Eton College (1788‚Äì92), served in the 1st Foot Guards, and entered Lincoln's Inn in 1798, and Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1799. He was called to the bar in 1803, practising on the Western Circuit. Bennet's first election as MP for Shrewsbury in 1806 was invalidated. His advocacy of Catholic emancipation led to defeat in 1807 but he regained his seat in 1811. In the Commons his maiden speech was directed at the Prince Regent. From 1813 to 1815 he was the second president of the Geological Society of London; the Lyell Collection contains his account of the Island of Tenerife. After the Peterloo massacre in 1819 he called for an inquiry into the manufacturing districts' plight. His defence of Queen Caroline in 1820‚Äì21 led to his portrayal in an engraving by Francis Holl. The sudden ending of Bennet's career in 1824 (apparently due to the death from consumption of his only son six months after that of a daughter) was followed by a continental trip in 1825. His reputation was ruined by the threat of prosecution for importuning a young male servant at Spa in August 1825. Bennet represented himself as the victim of a conspiracy to extort money, but the facts of the case worked against him.

He gained just a single cap for the Wales national team in 1904. Jones came from a sporting family, and his son, Howie Jones, also represented Wales in the rugby union. Rugby career Jones first played rugby for his local school before joining Glynneath. Like many successful players from the area, once Jones had been noticed as a rugby talent, he progressed to Neath RFC, the most notable club in the region. In the 1903-04 season, Neath made Jones the captain of the Neath senior XV. As captain of Neath, Jones was selected for his one and only international appearance, playing for Wales in the country's final game of the 1904 Home Nations Championship. Wales had already played England and Scotland, registering a draw and a win, meaning a win over Ireland would give Wales the possibility of winning the Championship. The Welsh selectors had brought in new capped players throughout the campaign and the final game was no exception. Jones was one of three players who were representing Wales for the first time during the Irish game and the tenth of the tournament. All three new caps were in the forward positions, and Jones was joined by Newport's Charlie Pritchard and Sid Bevan from Swansea. The game ended controversially, with the match referee blames for allowing Ireland a try from an illegal forward pass, and then denying Welsh wing Dick Jones a winning try. Wales finished the 1904 Championship in second and Jones was never selected to play for Wales again. Jones came from a sporting family, and his brothers William (Bill) and Idris both played for the Neath first XV.

Price calls The Quest of Kadji \\"a passable Carter effort typical of the period,\\" likening it to such other works of the 1970s as Amalric, The Black Star and the Gondwane Epic. He notes the presence of the hero's usual \\"entourage\\" of a \\"droll magician\\" and a \\"warrior-maid\\" ‚Äî \\"[f]riendly magicians and fair maidens, of course, are staples of Carter's fiction.\\"Price, p. 67. He also identifies it as a surprising precursor to Carter's later pornographic fantasy Tara of the Twilight (1979), with the heroine Thyra serving as the prototype for Tara, that novel's protagonist.Price, pp. 74-75.

Adult Essex skipper (Thymelicus lineola) Pupa of a sphingid moth Arctiinae Eggs of the buff-tip (Phalera bucephala), a notodontid moth The external morphology of Lepidoptera is the physiological structure of the bodies of insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera, also known as butterflies and moths. Lepidoptera are distinguished from other orders by the presence of scales on the external parts of the body and appendages, especially the wings. Butterflies and moths vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimetres long, to a wingspan of many inches such as the Atlas moth. Comprising over 160,000 described species, the Lepidoptera possess variations of the basic body structure which has evolved to gain advantages in adaptation and distribution. Lepidopterans undergo complete metamorphosis, going through a four-stage life cycle: egg, larva or caterpillar, pupa or chrysalis, and imago (plural: imagines) / adult. The larvae ‚Äì caterpillars ‚Äì have a toughened (sclerotised) head capsule, chewing mouthparts, and a soft body, that may have hair-like or other projections, three pairs of true legs, and up to five pairs of prolegs. Most caterpillars are herbivores, but a few are carnivores (some eat ants, aphids, or other caterpillars) or detritivores. Larvae are the feeding and growing stages and periodically undergo hormone-induced ecdysis, developing further with each instar, until they undergo the final larval‚Äìpupal moult. The larvae of many lepidopteran species will either make a spun casing of silk called a cocoon and pupate inside it, or will pupate in a cell under the ground. In many butterflies, the pupa is suspended from a cremaster and is called a chrysalis. The adult body has a hardened exoskeleton, except for the abdomen which is less sclerotised. The head is shaped like a capsule with appendages arising from it. Adult mouthparts include a prominent proboscis formed from maxillary galeae, and are adapted for sucking nectar. Some species do not feed as adults, and may have reduced mouthparts, while others have them modified for piercing and suck blood or fruit juices. Mandibles are absent in all except the Micropterigidae which have chewing mouthparts. (No preview.) Adult Lepidoptera have two immobile, multi-faceted compound eyes, and only two simple eyes or ocelli, which may be reduced.Scoble (1995). Section \\"Sensation\\", (pp. 26‚Äì38). The three segments of the thorax are fused together. Antennae are prominent and besides the faculty of smell, also aid navigation, orientation, and balance during flight. In moths, males frequently have more feathery antennae than females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance. There are two pairs of membranous wings which arise from the mesothoracic (middle) and metathoracic (third) segments; they are usually completely covered by minute scales. The two wings on each side act as one by virtue of wing-locking mechanisms. In some groups, the females are flightless and have reduced wings. The abdomen has ten segments connected with movable inter-segmental membranes. The last segments of the abdomen form the external genitalia. The genitalia are complex and provide the basis for family identification and species discrimination. The wings, head parts of thorax, and abdomen of Lepidoptera are covered with minute scales, from which feature the order Lepidoptera derives its names, the word lepidos in Ancient Greek meaning \\"scale\\". Most scales are lamellar (blade like) and attached with a pedicel, while other forms may be hair like or specialised as secondary sexual characteristics. The lumen, or surface of the lamella, has a complex structure. It gives colour either due to the pigments contained within it or through its three-dimensional structure.Scoble (1995). Section \\"Scales\\", (pp. 63‚Äì66). Scales provide a number of functions, which include insulation, thermoregulation, and aiding flight, amongst others, the most important of which is the large diversity of vivid or indistinct patterns they provide which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry, and to seek mates.  External morphology  thumb|alt=Photograph of a butterfly perched and sipping from a flower with the parts of the body labelled|Parts of an adult butterfly: In common with other members of the superorder Holometabola, Lepidoptera undergo complete metamorphosis, going through a four-stage life cycle: egg, larva / caterpillar, pupa / chrysalis, and imago (plural: imagines) / adult. Lepidopterans range in size from a few millimetres in length, such as in the case of microlepidoptera, to a wingspan of many inches, such as the Atlas moth and the world's largest butterfly Queen Alexandra's birdwing.  General body plan  The body of an adult butterfly or moth (the imago) has three distinct divisions, called tagmata, connected at constrictions; these tagmata are the head, thorax, and abdomen. Adult lepidopterans have four wings ‚Äî a forewing and a hindwing on both the left and the right side of the thorax ‚Äî and, like all insects, three pairs of legs. The morphological characteristics which distinguish the order Lepidoptera from other insect orders are: * Head: The head has large compound eyes and, if mouthparts are present, they are almost always a drinking straw-like proboscis. * Scales: Scales cover the external surface of the body and appendages. * Thorax: The prothorax is usually reduced. * Wings: Two pairs of wings are present in almost all taxa. The wings have very few cross veins. * Abdomen: The posterior abdominal segments are extensively modified for reproduction. Cerci are absent. * Larva: Lepidoptera larvae are known as caterpillars, and have a well-developed head and mandibles. They can have from zero to five pairs of prolegs, usually four. * Pupa: The pupae in most species are adecticous (with no functional mandibles in the pupal state) and obtect (with appendages fused or glued to the body), while others are decticous (with functional mandibles present in the pupal state) and exarate (having the antennae, legs, and wings free).  Distinguishing taxonomic features  The chief characteristics used to classify lepidopteran species, genera, and families are: * the mouthparts * the shape and venation of the wings ** whether the wings are homoneurous (the venation of the forewings and hindwings alike) or heteroneurous (forewings and hindwings different) ** whether the wings are aculeate (more or less covered with specialized bristles called microsetae) or nonaculeate ** the type of wing coupling (jugate or frenate) * the anatomy of the reproductive organs * the structure of larva and position of primary setae * whether the pupa is exarate or obtect The morphological characteristics of caterpillars and pupae used for classification are completely different from that of adults; different classification schemes are sometimes provided separately for classifying adults, larvae, and pupae. The characteristics of immature stages are increasingly used for taxonomic purposes as they provide insights into systematics and phylogenies of Lepidoptera that are not apparent from examination of adults.  Head  Lepidoptera head illustration from G. F. Hampson's Moths of British India Vol. 1 (1892) Like all animal heads, the head of a butterfly or moth contains the feeding organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi, and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli which may or may not be visible. They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump, and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.Scoble (1995). Section \\"The Adult Head ‚Äì Feeding and Sensation\\", (pp. 4‚Äì22). The head capsule is well sclerotised and has a number of sclerites or plates, separated by sutures. The sclerites are difficult to distinguish from sulci (singular ‚Äì sulcus) which are secondary thickenings. The regions of the head have been divided into a number of areas which act as a topographical guide for description by lepidopterists but cannot be discriminated in terms of their development. The head is covered by hair-like or lamellar scales and found either as tufts on the frons or vertex (referred to as rough-scaled) or pressed close to the head (referred to as smooth-scaled). The sensory organs and structures on the head show great variety, and the shape and form of these structures, as also their presence or absence, are important taxonomic indicators for classifying taxa into families.

In the case of butterflies, their length varies from half the length of the forewing to three-quarters of the length of the forewing. The antennae of butterflies are either slender and knobbed at the tip and, in the case of the Hesperiidae, are hooked at the tip. In some butterfly genera such as Libythea and Taractrothera the knob is hollowed underneath. Moth antennae are either filiform (thread like), unipectinate (comb like), bipectinate (feather like), hooked, clubbed, or thickened. Bombyx mandarina is an example with bipectinate antennae. Some moths have knobbed antennae akin to those of butterflies, including the families Castniidae, Neocastniidae, and Euschemonidae. Antennae are the primary organs of olfaction (smell) in Lepidoptera. The antenna surface is covered with large numbers of olfactory scales, hairs, or pits; as many as 1,370,000 are found on the antennae of a monarch. Antennae are extremely sensitive; the feathered antennae of male moths from the Saturniidae, Lasiocampidae, and many other families are so sensitive that they can detect the pheromones of female moths from distances of up to away. Lepidoptera antennae can be angled in many positions. They help the insect in locating the scent and can be considered to act as a kind of \\"olfactory radar\\". In moths, males frequently have antennae which are more feathery than those of the females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance. Since females do not need to detect the males, they have simpler antennae. Antennae have also been found to play a role in the time-compensated sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies.

Eyes  Front view of the compound eyes of Aglais io. Ocellus of Mythimna unipuncta seen to the right of base of antenna, in close contact with the compound eye. Lepidoptera have two large, immovable compound eyes which consist of a large number of facets or lenses, each connected to a lens- like cylinder which is attached to a nerve leading to the brain. Each eye may have up to 17,000 individual light receptors (ommatidia) which in combination provide a broad mosaic view of the surrounding area. One tropical Asian family, the Amphitheridae, has compound eyes divided into two distinct segments.. \\"...in many Amphitheridae (s.l.) the compound eye of males is partially or completely divided horizontally. \\" The eyes are usually smooth but may be covered by minute hairs. The eyes of butterflies are usually brown, golden brown, or even red as in the case of some species of skippers. While most insects have three simple eyes, or ocelli, only two ocelli are present in all species of Lepidoptera, except a few moths, one on each side of the head near the edge of the compound eye. On some species, sense organs called chaetosemata are found near the ocelli. The ocelli are not homologous to the simple eyes of caterpillars which are differently named as stemmata. The ocelli of Lepidoptera are reduced externally in some families; where present, they are unfocussed, unlike stemmata of larvae which are fully focussed. The utility of ocelli is not understood at present. Butterflies and moths are able to see ultraviolet (UV) light, and wing colours and patterns are principally observed by Lepidoptera in these wavelengths of light. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light. The UV patterns act as visual cues which help differentiate between species for the purpose of mating. Studies have been carried out on Lepidoptera (mostly butterflies) wing patterns illuminated by UV light.  Palpi  Gastropacha populifolia (family Lasiocampidae) with modified mouthparts Typically, the labial palpi are prominent, three-segmented, springing from under the head and curving up in front of the face. There is great variation in morphology of labial palpi in different families of Lepidoptera; sometimes the palpi are separate and sometimes they are connivent and form a beak, but they are always independently movable. In other cases, the labial palpi may not be erect but porrect (projecting forward horizontally). Palpi consist of a short basal segment, a comparatively long central segment, and a narrow terminal portion. The first two segments are densely scaled and may be hirsute; the terminal segment is bare. The terminal segment may be blunt or pointed; it may project straight or at an angle from the second segment inside which it may be concealed.  Mouthparts  Butterfly proboscis, showing the structure of the two galeae that comprise it. Legend: Section of mouthparts of Lepidoptera. a: pilifer (labrum); b: epipharynx (labrum); c: galea (maxilla); d: trachea; e: nerve; f: muscles; g: food canal; h: labium; i: labial palp While mandibles or jaws (chewing mouthparts) are only present in the caterpillar stage, the mouthparts of most adult Lepidoptera mainly consist of the sucking kind; this part is known as the proboscis or haustellum. A few Lepidoptera species have reduced mouthparts and do not feed in the adult state. Others, such as the basal family Micropterigidae, have chewing mouthparts. The proboscis (plural ‚Äì proboscises) is formed from maxillary galeae and is adapted for sucking nectar. It consists of two tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest and extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced and even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five segmented in some of the more basal families and are often folded. The shape and dimensions of the proboscis have evolved to give different species a wider and therefore more advantageous diet. There is an allometric scaling relationship between body mass of Lepidoptera and length of proboscis from which an interesting adaptive departure is the unusually long- tongued sphinx moth Xanthopan morganii praedicta. Charles Darwin predicted the existence and proboscis length of this moth before its discovery based on his knowledge of the long-spurred Madagascan star orchid Angraecum sesquipedale. There are primarily two feeding guilds in Lepidoptera ‚Äì the nectarivorous who obtain the majority of their nutritional requirements from floral nectar and those of the frugivorous guild who feed primarily on juices of rotting fruit or fermenting tree sap. There are substantial differences between the morphology of the proboscises of both feeding guilds. Hawkmoths (family Sphingidae) have elongated proboscises which enable them to feed on and pollinate flowers with long tubular corollas. Besides this, a number of taxa (especially noctuid moths) have evolved different proboscis morphologies. Certain noctuid species have developed piercing mouthparts; the proboscis has sclerotised scales on the tip with which to pierce and suck blood or fruit juices. Proboscises in some Heliconius species have evolved to consume solids such as pollen. Some other moths, mostly noctuids, have modified proboscises to suit their mode of nutrition ‚Äì lachrymophagy (feeding on tears of sleeping birds). The proboscises often have sharp apices as well as a host of barbs and spurs on the stem.

The organs of insect locomotion ‚Äì the legs and wings ‚Äì are borne on the thorax. The forelegs spring from the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax. In some cases, the wings are vestigial.Scoble (1995) Chapter 3: \\"The adult thorax ‚Äì a study in function & effect\\" (pp. 39‚Äì40). The upper and lower parts of the thorax (terga and sterna respectively) are composed of segmental and intrasegmental sclerites which display secondary sclerotisation and considerable modification in the Lepidoptera. The prothorax is the simplest and smallest of the three segments while the mesothorax is the most developed. Between the head and thorax is the membranous neck or cervix. It comprises a pair of lateral cervical sclerites and is composed of both cephalic and thoracic elements. Between the head and the thorax is a tufted scale called the pronotum. On either side is a shield- like scale called a scapula. In the Noctuoidea, the metathorax is modified with a pair of tympanal organs.  Leg  Forelegs in the Papilionoidea exhibit reduction of various forms: the butterfly family Nymphalidae, or brush-footed butterflies as they are commonly known, have only the rear two pairs of legs fully functional with the forward pair strongly reduced and not capable of walking or perching. In the Lycaenidae, the tarsus is unsegmented, as the tarsomeres are fused, and, tarsal claws are absent. The aroliar pad (a pad projecting between the tarsal claws of some insects) and pulvilli (singular: pulvillus, a pad or lobe beneath each tarsal claw) are reduced or absent in the Papilionidae. The tarsal claws are also absent in the Riodinidae. In Lepidoptera, the three pairs of legs are covered with scales. Lepidoptera also have olfactory organs on their feet which aid in \\"tasting\\" or \\"smelling\\" food plants.  Wings  Adult Lepidoptera have two pairs of membranous wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as \\"veins\\", as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres, and blood vessels.. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax. The wings arise from the meso- and meta-thoracic segments and are similar in size in the basal groups. In more derived groups, the meso-thoracic wings are larger with more powerful musculature at their bases and more rigid vein structures on the costal edge. Besides providing the primary function of flight, wings also have secondary functions of self-defence, camouflage and thermoregulation. In some Lepidoptera families such as the Psychidae and Lymantriidae, the wings are reduced or even absent (often in the female but not the male).  Shape  The shape of wings exhibits great variety in Lepidoptera. In the case of the Papilionoidea, the costa may be straight or highly arched. It is sometimes concave on the hindwing. It is occasionally serrate or minutely saw toothed on the forewing. The apex may be rounded, pointed, or falcate (produced and concave below). The termen tends to be straight or concave on the forewing while it is usually more or less convex on the hindwing. The termen is often crenulate or dentate, i.e. produced at each vein and concave in between them. The dorsum is normally straight but may be concave. The hindwing is frequently caudate, i.e. the veins near the end of the tornus have one or more tails. The tornus itself being often produced and frequently lobed. Along the hindwing termen there are tightly-packed scales in a double row. The underside of the scales project and form a regular narrow fringe referred to as cilia.

For detailed explanation, refer Glossary of entomology terms. An adult male pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). Notice the bristle springing from the underside of the hindwing (frenulum) and running forward to be held in a small catch of the forewing, the function of which is to link the wings together. Tubular veins run through the two-layered membranous wing. Veins are connected to the haemocoel and in theory allow haemolymph to flow through them. In addition, a nerve and trachea may pass through the veins. Lepidopteran venation is simple in that there are few crossbars. The wing venation in Lepidoptera is a diagnostic for distinguishing between the taxa as also the genera and families. The terminology is based on the Comstock-Needham system which gives the morphological description of insect wing venation.Scoble (1995). Section \\"Wings\\". Pg 55. In the basal Lepidoptera, the venation of the forewing is similar to that of the hindwing; a condition referred to as \\"homoneurous\\". The Micropterigidae (Zeugloptera) have venation that resembles the most primitive caddisflies (Trichoptera). All other Lepidoptera, the vast majority (around 98%), are \\"heteroneurous\\", the venation of the hindwing differing from that from the forewing and being sometimes reduced. Moths of the families Nepticulidae, Opostegidae, Gracillariidae, Tischeriidae, and Bucculatricidae, amongst others, often have greatly reduced venation in both wings. Homoneurous moths tend to have the \\"jugum\\" form of wing coupling as opposed to the \\"frenulum‚Äìretinaculum\\" arrangement in the case of more advanced families. File:Comstock-needham.svg|Insect wing venation, showing the names after the Comstock‚ÄìNeedham system File:Sabatinca_lucilia.jpg|Homoneurous venation in Sabatinca lucilia (Micropterigidae) File:Gonepteryx.rhamni.mounted.jpg|Heteroneurous venation in Gonepteryx rhamni (Pieridae) File:Synanthedon_tipuliformis_%28ento-csiro-au%29.jpg|Reduced venation in Synanthedon tipuliformis (Sesiidae)  Wing coupling  Oiketicus spp. (family Psychidae). The frenulum can be seen at the top of the rear wing, which hooks onto the retinaculum so that the wings travel together during flight. Magnification: 10x The Lepidoptera have developed a wide variety of morphological wing-coupling mechanisms in the imago which render these taxa \\"functionally dipterous\\" (two winged). All but the most basal forms exhibit this wing coupling. There are three different types of mechanisms ‚Äì jugal, frenulo‚Äìretinacular, and amplexiform.Scoble (1995). Section \\"Wing coupling\\", (pp. 56‚Äì60). The more primitive groups have an enlarged lobe-like area near the basal posterior margin (i.e. at the base of the forewing) called a jugum, that folds under the hindwing during flight. Other groups have a frenulum on the hindwing that hooks under a retinaculum on the forewing. In all butterflies (with the exception of male Euschemoninae) and in Bombycoidea moths (with the exception of the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of frenulum and retinaculum to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence of a specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and retinaculum are completely lost.  Scales  Wing scales form the colour and pattern on wings. The scales shown here are lamellar. The pedicel can be seen attached to a few loose scales. The wings of Lepidoptera are minutely scaled, which gives the name to this order; the name Lepidoptera was coined in 1735 by Carl Linnaeus for the group of \\"insects with four scaly wings\\". It is derived from Ancient Greek lepis (ŒªŒµœÄŒØœÇ) meaning \\"(fish) scale\\" (and related to lepein \\"to peel\\") and pteron (œÄœÑŒµœÅœåŒΩ) meaning \\"wing\\". from \\"Lepidoptera\\" on Dictionary.com website. Scales also cover the head, parts of the thorax and abdomen as well as parts of the genitalia. The morphology of scales has been studied by J. C. Downey and A. C. Allyn (1975) and scales have been classified into three groups, namely hair-like, or piliform, blade-like, or lamellar and other variable forms. Primitive moths (non-Glossata and Eriocranidae) have \\"solid\\" scales which are imperforate, i.e., they lack a lumen. A few taxa of the Trichoptera (caddisflies), which are the sister group to the Lepidoptera, have hair-like scales, but always on the wings and never on the body or other parts of the insect. Caddisflies also possess caudal cerci on the abdomen, a feature absent in the Lepidoptera. According to Scoble (2005), \\"morphologically, scales are macrotrichia, and thus homologous with the large hairs (and scales) that cover the wings of Trichoptera (caddisflies)\\".  Structure  Although there is great diversity in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special \\"tormogen\\" cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or pedicel by which scales are attached to the substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or \\"blade\\" of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior lamella. The upper surface, or superior lamella, has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held apart by struts called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.Chapman (1988). Section \\"Wings and flight\\" (p. 190).  Colour  The scales on butterfly wings are pigmented with melanins that can produce the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds, and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but through the microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration is the result of coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultraviolet patterns which are discernible in that part of the ultraviolet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black. The iridescent structural coloration on the wings of many lycaenid and papilionid species, such as Parides sesostris and Teinopalpus imperialis, and lycaenids such as Callophrys rubi, Cyanophrys remus, and Mitoura gryneus, has been studied. They manifest the most complex photonic scale architectures known ‚Äì regular three- dimensional periodic lattices, that occur within the lumen of some scales. In the case of the Kaiser-i-Hind (Teinopalpus imperialis), the three-dimensional photonic structure has been examined by transmission electron tomography and computer modelling to reveal naturally occurring \\"chiral tetrahedral repeating units packed in a triclinic lattice\\", the cause of the iridescence.

Scales enable the development of vivid or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry, and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings allow sunlight to be absorbed and are probably involved in thermoregulation. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour patterns help edible lepidopterans mimic inedible models, while in M√ºllerian mimicry, inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators. Scales may have evolved initially for providing insulation. Scales on the thorax and other parts of the body may contribute to maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight. The \\"solid\\" scales of basal moths are however not as efficient as those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the insulation value. Scales also help increase the lift to drag ratio in flight. For newly emerged adults of most myrmecophilous Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales provide some protection from predators as they emerge from the nest. In the case of the moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make their way out of the nest after hatching. Male Danaus chrysippus showing the pheromone pouch and brush-like organ in Kerala, India  Androconia  Male Lepidoptera possess special scales, called androconia (singular ‚Äì androconium), which have evolved as a result of sexual selection for the purposes of disseminating pheromones for attracting suitable mates. Androconia may be dispersed on the wings, body, or legs or occur in patches, referred to as \\"brands\\", \\"sex brands\\" or \\"stigmata\\" on the wings, usually in invaginations of the upper surface of the forewings, sometimes concealed by other scales. Androconia are also known to occur in the folds of wings. These brands sometimes consist of hairlike tufts which facilitate the diffusion of the pheromone. The role of androconia in the courtship of pierid and nymphalid butterflies, such as Pyronia tithonus and Dryas iulia, has been proven experimentally. Successive close-ups of the scales of a peacock wing  Abdomen  The abdomen or body is composed of nine segments. In the larva it ranges from segments 5 to 13. The eleventh segment of the larva holds a pair of anal claspers, which protrude in some taxa and represent the genitalia. Many families of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs are known as tympana (singular ‚Äì typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located on the underside of the metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.Scoble (2005). Chapter \\"Higher Ditrysia\\", pg 328. The females of some moths have a scent-emitting organ located at the tip of the abdomen.  Genitalia  Male genitalia of Lepidoptera Female genitalia of Lepidoptera The genitalia are complex and provide the basis for species discrimination in most families and also in family identification. The genitalia arise from the tenth or most distal segment of the abdomen. Lepidoptera have some of the most complex genital structures of all insects, with a wide variety of complex spines, setae, scales and tufts in males, claspers of different shapes and modifications of the ductus bursae in females, through which stored sperm is transferred within the female directly, or indirectly, to the vagina for fertilisation.Scoble (1995). Section \\"Adult abdomen\\", (pp. 98‚Äì102). The arrangement of genitalia is important in courtship and mating as they prevent cross-specific mating and hybridisation. The uniqueness of a species' genitalia led to the use of the morphological study of genitalia as one of the most important keys in taxonomic identification of taxa below family level. With the advent of DNA analysis, the study of genitalia has now become just one of the techniques used in taxonomy. There are three basic configurations of genitalia in the majority of the Lepidoptera based on how the arrangement in females of openings for copulation, fertilisation and egg laying has evolved: * Exoporian: Hepialidae and related families have an external groove that carries sperm from the copulatory opening (gonopore) to the (ovipore) and are termed Exoporian. * Monotrysian: Primitive groups have a single genital aperture near the end of the abdomen through which both copulation and egg laying occur. This character is used to designate the Monotrysia. * Ditrysian: The remaining groups have an internal duct that carry sperm and form the Ditrysia, with separate openings for copulation and egg laying. The genitalia of the male and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal \\"tegumen\\" and ventral \\"viniculum\\". They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or \\"harpe\\"). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or \\"vesica\\") to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms. While the layout of internal genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported, and stored. The oviducts of the female join together to form a common duct (called the \\"oviductus communis\\") which leads to the vagina. When copulation takes place, the male butterfly or moth places a capsule of sperm (spermatophore) in a receptacle of the female (called the corpus bursae). The sperm, when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube into a special seminal receptacle (spermatheca), where the sperm is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during egg laying, which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the ovipore. The ovipore may be at the end of a modified ovipositor or surrounded by a pair of broad setose anal papillae. Butterflies of the Parnassinae (family Papilionidae) and some Acraeini (family Nymphalidae) add a post-copulatory plug, called the sphragis, to the abdomen of the female after copulation preventing her from mating again. The males of many species of Papilionoidea are furnished with secondary sexual characteristics. These consist of scent- producing organs, brushes, and brands or pouches of specialised scales. These presumably meet the function of convincing the female that she is mating with a male of the correct species. Three species of hawkmoth have been recorded to emit ultrasound clicks by rubbing their genitalia; males produce by rubbing rigid scales on the exterior of the claspers while females produce sound by contracting their genitalia which causes rubbing of scales against the abdomen. The function of this noise making is not clear and suggestions put forward include the jamming of bat echolocation, and, advertising that the bat's prey are prickly and excellent fliers.

This may be complete, incorporating the anus, the ovipore and the copulatory pore, as in the case of the Dacnonypha, Zeugloptera and the majority of the Monotrysia; or incomplete, incorporating the anus and ovipore only, as found in some of the Monotrysia, the Psychidae, and in some Choreutidae and Cossidae.  Development  Three stages of a sphingid moth ‚Äì larva (or caterpillar), chrysalis (or pupa), and adult (or imago) The fertilised egg matures and hatches to give a caterpillar. The caterpillar is the feeding stage of the lepidopteran life cycle. The caterpillar needs to be able to feed and to avoid being eaten and much of its morphology has evolved to facilitate these two functions.Scoble (1995). Chapter \\"Immature stages\\", (pp. 104‚Äì133). After growth and ecdysis, the caterpillar enters into a sessile developmental stage called a pupa (or chrysalis) around which it may form a casing. The insect develops into the adult in the pupa stage; when ready the pupa hatches and the adult stage or imago of a butterfly or moth arises.  Egg  The butterfly can be seen laying eggs underneath the leaf. Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or \\"egg layers\\". Lepidopteran eggs, like those of other insects, are centrolecithal in that the eggs have a central yolk surrounded by cytoplasm. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The cytoplasm is enclosed by the vitteline envelope and a proteinaceous membrane called the chorion protects the egg externally.Chapman (1998). Section \\"The egg and embryology\\" (pp. 325‚Äì362). The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly. In some species of Lepidoptera, a waxy layer is present inside the chorion adjacent to the vitelline layer which is thought to have evolved to prevent desiccation. In insects, the chorion has a layer of air pores in the otherwise solid material which provides very limited capability for respiratory function. In Lepidoptera, the chorion layer above this air pore layer is lamellar with successive sheets of protein arranged in a particular direction and stepped so as to form a helical arrangement. The top of the egg is depressed and forms a small central cavity called micropyle through which the egg is fertilised. The micropyle is situated on top in eggs which are globular, conical, or cylindrical; in those eggs which are flattened or lenticular, the micropyle is located on the outer margin or rim. The eggs of Lepidoptera are usually rounded and small (1 mm) though they may be as large as 4 mm in the case of Sphingidae and Saturniidae. They are generally quite plain in colour, white, pale green, bluish green, or brown. Butterfly and moth eggs come in various shapes; some are spherical, others hemispherical, conical, cylindrical, or lenticular (lens shaped). Some are barrel shaped or pancake shaped, while others are turban or cheese shaped. They may be angled or depressed at both ends, ridged or ornamented, spotted or blemished. The eggs are deposited singly, in small clusters, or in a mass, and invariably on or near the food source. Captive moths have been known to lay eggs in the cages they have been sequestered in. Egg size in the Lepidoptera is affected by a number of factors. Lepidoptera species which overwinter in the egg stage usually have larger eggs than the species that do not. Similarly, species feeding on woody plants in the larval stage have larger eggs than those species feeding on herbaceous plants. Eggs laid by older females of a few butterfly species have been noted to be smaller in size than their younger counterparts. In the absence of adequate nutrition, the females of the corn-borer moth ( Ostrinia spp.) have been recorded to lay clutches with egg sizes below normal. While escaping, the newly hatched larvae of many species sometimes eat the chorion to emerge. Alternatively, the egg shell may have a line of weakness around the cap which gives way allowing the larva to emerge. The egg shell and a small amount of yolk trapped in the amniotic membranes forms the first food for most lepidopteran larvae.

Caterpillars, are \\"characteristic polypod larvae with cylindrical bodies, short thoracic legs and abdominal prolegs (pseudopods)\\". They have a toughened (sclerotised) head capsule, mandibles (mouthparts) for chewing, and a soft tubular, segmented body, that may have hair-like or other projections, three pairs of true legs, and additional prolegs (up to five pairs). The body consists of thirteen segments, of which three are thoracic (T1, T2, and T3) and ten are abdominal (A1 to A10). Caterpillar head morphology (click to enlarge) Spiracles on caterpillar of Actias selene Old World swallowtail caterpillar everting its osmeterium in defence Crochets on a caterpillar's prolegs All true caterpillars have an upside-down Y-shaped line that runs from the top of the head downward. In between the Y-shaped line lies the frontal triangle or frons. The clypeus, located below the frons, lies between the two antennae. The labrum is found below the clypeus. There is a small notch in the centre of the labrum with which the leaf edge engages when the caterpillar eats. The larvae have silk glands which are located on the labium. These glands are modified salivary glands. They use these silk glands to make silk for cocoons and shelters. Located below the labrum are the mandibles. On each side of the head there are usually six stemmata just above the mandibles. These stemmata are arranged in a semicircle. Below the stemmata there is a small pair of antennae, one on each side. The thorax bears three pairs of legs, one pair on each segment. The prothorax (T1) has a functional spiracle which is actually derived from the mesothorax (T2) while the metathorax has a reduced spiracle which is not externally open and lies beneath the cuticle. The thoracic legs consist of coxa, trochanter, femur, tarsus, and claw and are constant in form throughout the order. However they are reduced in the case of certain leaf-miners and elongated in certain Notodontidae. In Micropterigidae, the legs are three- segmented, as the coxa, trochanter, and femur are fused. Abdominal segments three through six and ten may each bear a pair of legs that are more fleshy. The thoracic legs are known as true legs and the abdominal legs are called prolegs. The true legs vary little in the Lepidoptera except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The prolegs contain a number of small hooks on the tip, which are known as crochets. The families of Lepidoptera differ in the number and positioning of their prolegs. Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of prolegs or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack prolegs altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are crochets present on the abdominal wall which are reduced prolegs, while other leaf-mining species lack the crochets entirely. The abdominal spiracles are located on each side of the body on the first eight abdominal segments. Caterpillars have different types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump like or long and filament like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment. A large number of species of families Saturniidae, Limacodidae, and Megalopygidae have stinging caterpillars which have poisonous setae, called urticating hairs, and in the case of Lonomia ‚Äì a Brazilian saturniid genus ‚Äì can kill a human due to its potent anticoagulant poison. Caterpillars of many taxa that have sequestered toxic chemicals from host plants or have sharp urticating hair or spines, display aposematic colouration and markings. Caterpillars undergo ecdysis and have a number of larval instars, usually five but varying between species. The new cuticle is soft and allows the increase in size and development of the caterpillar before becoming hard and inelastic. In the last ecdysis, the old cuticle splits and curls up into a small ball at the posterior end of the pupa and is known as the larval exuvia.

Most Lepidoptera larvae will either make a cocoon and pupate inside them or will pupate in a cell under the ground, with the exception of butterflies and advanced moths such as noctuids, whose pupae are exposed. The pupae of moths are usually brown and smooth whereas butterfly pupae are often colourful and their shape varies greatly. In butterflies, the exposed pupa is often referred to as a chrysalis, derived from the Greek term \\"chrysalis\\": (') for gold, referring to the golden colour of some pupae. The caterpillars of many butterflies attach themselves by a button of silk to the underside of a branch, stone, or other projecting surface. They remain attached to the silk pad by a hook-like process called a cremaster. Most chrysalids hang head downward, but in the families Papilionidae, Pieridae, and Lycaenidae, the chrysalis is held in a more upright position by a silk girdle around the middle of the chrysalis. The pupae of most Lepidoptera are obtect, with appendages fused or glued to the body, while the rest have exarate pupae, having the antennae, legs, and wings free and not glued to the body. During the pupal stage, the morphology of the adult is developed through elaboration from larval structures. The general aspect of the adult is visible before the outer surface hardens ‚Äì the head, resting on the thorax, the eyes, antennae (brought forward over the head), the wings brought over the thorax, and the six legs between the wings and the abdomen. Among the features discernible in the head region of a pupa are sclerites, sutures, pilifers, mandibles, eye- pieces, antennae, palpi, and the maxillae. The pupal thorax displays the three thoracic segments, legs, wings, tegulae, alar furrows, and axillary tubercles. The pupal abdomen exhibits the ten segments, spines, setae, scars of larval prolegs and tubercles, anal, and genital openings, as well as spiracles. The pupa of borers display the flange-plates while those of specialised Lepidoptera exhibit the cremaster. While the pupa is generally stationary and immobile, those of the primitive moth families Micropterigidae, Agathiphagidae, and Heterobathmiidae have fully functional mandibles. These serve principally to allow the adult to escape from the cocoon. Besides this, all appendages and the body are separate from the pupal skin and enjoy a degree of independent motion. All other superfamilies of the Lepidoptera are more specialised, have non-functional mandibles, appendages and body attached to the pupal skin, and lose a degree of independent movement. The pupae of some moths are able to wriggle their abdomen. The three caudal segments of the pupal abdomen (segments 8‚Äì10) are fixed; the other segments are movable to some degree. While the more evolved Lepidoptera can wriggle only the last two or three segments at the end of the abdomen, more basal taxa such as the Micropterigidae can wriggle the remaining seven segments of the abdomen; this presumably helps them to protrude the anterior end from the pupal case before eclosion. The pupae of Hepialidae are able to move back and forth in the larval tunnel by wriggling, aided by projections on the back in addition to spines. Abdominal wriggling is considered to be of startle value and discouraging to predators. In the case of a few hawk moths, such as Theretra latreillii, the wriggling of the abdomens is accompanied by a rattling or clicking sound which adds to the startle effect. In some species, such as Heliconius charithonia, mating can occur inside the pupa of females by males.

Defense and predation  The orange oakleaf (Kallima inachus) resembles a dried leaf perfectly. Filamentous tails of a lycaenid butterfly, the common cerulean (Jamides celeno). These tails are thought to confuse a predator as to the location of the head thereby increasing the butterfly's chances of survival. Queen Alexandra's birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae family Papilionidae), the largest butterfly in the world, has bright colours and distinctive markings which advertise its inedibility. Lepidopterans are soft bodied, fragile, and almost defenseless while the immature stages move slowly or are immobile, hence all stages are exposed to predation by birds, small mammals, lizards, amphibians, invertebrate predators (notably parasitoid and parasitic wasps and flies) as well as fungi and bacteria. To combat this, Lepidoptera have developed a number of strategies for defense and protection which include camouflage, aposematism, mimicry, and the development of threat patterns and displays. Camouflage is an important defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour, and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be seen by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings. Some species of Lepidoptera sequester or manufacture toxins which are stored in their body tissue, rendering them poisonous to predators; examples include the monarch butterfly in the Americas and Atrophaneura species in Asia. Predators that eat poisonous lepidopterans may become sick and vomit violently, and so learn to avoid those species. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Toxic butterflies and larvae tend to develop bright colours and striking patterns as an indicator to predators about their toxicity. This phenomenon is known as aposematism. Aposematism has also led to the development of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and M√ºllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry. Eyespots are a type of automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, the spots are composed of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them a better chance of escaping alive and relatively unscathed. Some caterpillars, especially members of Papilionidae, contain an osmeterium, a Y-shaped protrusible gland found in the prothoracic segment of the larvae. When threatened, the caterpillar emits unpleasant smells from the organ to ward off the predators.

Construction RawFaith was built in Addison, Maine, by George McKay and his three sons. Construction took 28 months, spread over four years. The construction was performed using old methods and new technology. This was exemplified in the use of a half hull model ship, steam box, 16th-century lines, and other old shipbuilding techniques, but using power tools and laminates to aid in construction and bring strength to modern standards. She was constructed out of white oak. Rawfaith was not built using shipwrights or naval architects. She was controversial in all aspects and was regarded by most professionals as being poorly built and designed. Design RawFaith was designed with 16th-century race-built galleons such as the in mind. Raw faith was intended to be wheel chair accessible. The ship was designed by the owner with no previous knowledge of naval architecture. Accordingly, the vessel did not actually resemble any galleon or traditional vessel, and was rigged as a schooner. However, the mast and sail configuration was also atypical. Purpose RawFaith was wheelchair accessible, and the intent was to provide free sailing adventures to groups which would normally be deterred from sailing by a member in a wheelchair. Many accessibility features had not yet been installed, though the captain's daughter, a wheelchair user, lived aboard for many months. Controversy RawFaith had been the target of criticism for her lack of seaworthiness.

In both film and literature he is known for his work in the thriller and action genres. For stage, the majority of his productions fall under drama. He continually collaborates with best-selling novelist James Patterson, with whom he's co-authored The Women's War (2016), an action thriller about three female special ops; Come And Get Us (2017), a thriller about a young mother stranded in the desert; and Revenge (2017), a thriller about a hitman avenging his wife. Serafin is known for fiction narratives featuring strong female characters often entangled in violent predicaments. His first novel Seventeen (Serafin novel) is the story of a seventeen-year old adolescent who gives herself seven days to live. His second solo-effort is Conquest, a fiction narrative of the toils of modern dating. His film-directing career began with The Forest (2011), which was the first of three feature films he would write and direct. The Forest is a supernatural thriller shot on-location in the infamous Aokigahara Jukai suicide forest, which stars Aidan Bristow and Michael Madsen. His second film, Misfire (2013), starring Jaina Lee Ortiz, is a stylized action-thriller depicting rival female assassins converging on the same target. His most-recent film, The Believer (2017), is a psychological thriller involving demonology within the context of marital strife. The Believer represents his second collaboration with actor Aidan Bristow, who also produced, and co-stars Sophie Kargman along with Lindsey Ginter and Susan Wilder. Serafin's directorial work in theater began with a stage play he also co-wrote entitled The Essential Bond, a biographical narrative about the true story of two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling. The Essential Bond starred John Astin and Matt Ashford and ran for three months. Thereafter, Serafin directed several stage productions in Los Angeles, including Adam Rapp's Red Light Winter, Patrick Marber's Closer, and Theresa Rebeck's Spike Heels. Serafin trained in stage performance and filmmaking at UCLA and served as a member of the Aresis Ensemble Theater Troupe in Santa Monica where he engaged in the North American debut of several avant-garde French and other European works. He is a practicing Buddhist, belonging to the Soka Gakkai International organization of Nichiren Buddhism practitioners, wherein he has previously undertaken responsibility as a national youth leader and served for a term as the editor-in-chief of its national youth gazette Seize the Day.

Originally founded in Brisbane, Australia by Mike O'Sullivan and his business partner John McCarron, the company manufactures the Supermarine Aircraft Spitfire homebuilt kit aircraft which, although slightly smaller than the original Supermarine Spitfire, is the only all-aluminium replica in production. Personnel The company CEO is founder Mike O'Sullivan, who is also manager of Cisco Municipal Airport. The Workshop Manager is Chad Faykus and Office Manager Kathy Redford- Walton. In 2012 the company employed eight people. History A Spitfire Mk26 built from one of the company's kits Australian pilot and aviation engineer Mike O'Sullivan, who grew up on a cattle station in Queensland, had always wanted a Spitfire and in 1991 he built a replica for his own use. This was followed by an all-metal production prototype in 1994.Pilotfriend.com - Supermarine Spitfire Mk 26 Retrieved: 18 August 2009]Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 121.

In 1995 O'Sullivan joined with business partner John McCarron to form the Supermarine Aircraft company in Brisbane, Australia, with the idea of producing all-Australian homebuild aircraft kits. In the event, the constant- speed, four-blade propeller would be obtained from a specialist firm in New Zealand. The company has no direct connection with the original British Supermarine company which built the original Spitfire fighter, however it has been granted permission to use the name. Journalist Charles Laurence of The Telegraph explains: \\"So how did the hallowed name of Supermarine, the old Southampton-based aviation company (half of all Spitfires were built in West Bromwich after the Southampton factories were flattened by the Luftwaffe), end up on a tin hangar in Texas? O'Sullivan did not buy the name Supermarine: he was granted it by the descendants of the owners of the old West Midlands aircraft works, out of business since the early 1950s, in a kind of blessing.\\" Around 2010 the company moved to Cisco Airport, Texas in the US and is now an American limited liability company. Aircraft are now approved and flying in many countries and over 92 have been sold. Aircraft The Supermarine Aircraft Spitfire is the only all-aluminium replica Spitfire in production. Three models have been produced, all sub-scale: * Spitfire MK25, a 75% scale single-seater. * Spitfire Mk26, with MK25 wings mated to an 80% scale fuselage to make room for a passenger. * Spitfire Mk26B, with the fuselage increased to 90% scale.

Club career Born in Madrid, Amaya started his professional career at hometown's Rayo Vallecano, playing a combined 31 games with the first team in his first two seasons, the first of which was spent in the second division with promotion. After that, he returned to the second level but stayed in the city, joining Atl√©tico Madrid for another couple of years and being rarely utilised. After another unassuming La Liga spell with RCD Espanyol, Amaya appeared in 40 matches for Getafe CF in the 2003‚Äì04 campaign, promoting to the top flight for the third time (a first-ever for Getafe). However, he featured very rarely in the following season, returning to division two in January 2005 as he joined Ciudad de Murcia and being an everpresent defensive fixture. Amaya then played two seasons in the second tier, with Elche CF. In July 2009 he was bought by Udinese Calcio, being immediately loaned back to Spain with lowly Granada CF; compatriot √ìscar P√©rez, who was also purchased by the Italians, made the same season-long move as seven other players, after the two sides' partnership agreement.Diego Mainz e Iv√°n Amaya jugar√°n en Segunda B con el Granada (Diego Mainz and Iv√°n Amaya will play in Segunda B with Granada); Rayo Herald, 11 July 2009 (in Spanish) After helping the Andalusians promote to the second division, Amaya's loan was renewed for 2010‚Äì11, but his contract with Granada was terminated on 26 August 2010. The next day, he was signed by Real Murcia of the third level. International career Amaya was selected by Spain for their 2000 Summer Olympics squad. He helped the national team win silver in Sydney but, in the decisive match against Cameroon, scored an own goal to make it 2‚Äì1 for the Europeans (eventually 2‚Äì2) and also missed his penalty shootout attempt, in an eventual loss.

From 1973 until 1988 on Western Canada's largest radio station, CKNW, he hosted the dominant public affairs radio program in British Columbia, a three-hour network forum each weekday consisting of news, investigative reporting, celebrity interviews and open-line audience participation. His books focused on history, passenger shipping and, most recently, wasteful spending in the health care industry. In 1989 he and his wife Patricia, through their holding company Bannerline Enterprises Ltd., established Bannerline Corporate Communications, a consulting firm, advising what would become a long list of corporations both small and large. Although he continued to broadcast part-time for CKNW and other radio stations through most of the 1990s, the consulting and writing endeavours had become so time-consuming that media work was restricted to rare guest appearances. Bannerman died July 11, 2011, from liver complications. Biography and personal life Bannerman was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, the eldest child of William MacDonald Bannerman and Norma Agnes (Scobie) Bannerman. His father's ancestry dated back to the first Scots settlers of Nova Scotia, immigrants from northernmost Sutherland who landed in Pictou County in 1773 aboard The Hector. His maternal Scobie grandparents emigrated to Canada from Paisley, Scotland, settling in Sydney in 1923. His father \\"Bill\\" was a salesman who spent most of his career with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, for many years the company's regional manager for Atlantic Canada, based in Moncton, NB. Bannerman was followed in the family by brother Ross and sisters Wendy and Karen. As his father's career evolved, promotions moved the family from Sydney to Moncton; then to Halifax, NS, and finally back to Moncton to stay. Education and early career Bannerman graduated with honours from Moncton High School in 1965. He was accepted into the Canadian Army's Regular Officer Training Plan (ROTP) and attended Le College Militaire Royale du Saint-Jean, near Montreal (now defunct), the only bilingual college of Canada's three military universities, transferring the next year with ROTP to the University of New Brunswick. A serious car accident in the State of Maine early in 1967 led to weeks of hospitalization, making it impossible-to- complete his university year. During the summer of 1966, between the two universities, he had obtained a job in Wabush, Newfoundland and Labrador through family connections, and ended up as an engineer's assistant monitoring asphalt paving contracts. After full recovery from the car accident injuries a year later, this qualified him for a similar position with the New Brunswick Department of Highways, assigned to inspect and monitor the work of contractors on a major project in southwestern NB. It was during this period that he contemplated the future. He became certain that engineering would not be his career although university was still in the plans. One morning, at a cafe in St. George, New Brunswick, he was reading the Saint John Telegraph- Journal and spotted an advertisement that the newspaper was seeking to hire a junior reporter, with or without experience. Bannerman had always been a prolific writer: letters, essays, school newspapers, club newsletters and wherever a need presented itself; and he had always had a keen interest in government, politics and news of any description. Spontaneously, he wrote an application for the job and, after a subsequent interview, he began work at the paper. Newspapering became a passion so great that the prospect of doing anything else would soon seem absurd. Patricia and marriage Bannerman's newspaper work moved him to Vancouver in September 1970. Also that month, arriving from England to reside just a few blocks away from Bannerman's apartment was Patricia Walrond, an artist, photographer, professional secretary and world traveller. Her previous adventures had led to lengthy stays and employment in Germany, Sicily, Greece, Israel and Australia. This time she had traveled to join friends who had painted an exciting portrait of the west coast of Canada. She gained employment in Vancouver as secretary of a respected arts organization Jeunesses Musicales, which organized concert tours of performers across Canada and Patricia would subsequently become secretary to the Director of the Vancouver Art Gallery. Bannerman and Patricia met early in 1971. They were married in September of that year and considered Patricia's family base in London (Wimbledon) as important in their lives as Canada. The daughter of William Eric Walrond, a Lloyd's of London underwriter and broker, and Rosemary (Larcom), Patricia would soon add a creative dimension to a succession of Bannerman's writing and business pursuits. They continued to build the business together and travel the world whenever opportunities presented themselves. They did not have any children. The newspaper years Under the mentorship of Telegraph-Journal managing editor Fred Hazel, Bannerman's development as a reporter was meteoric. Within months he had traversed the usual apprenticeship through obituaries, menial rewrites, the cop shop, the courts, City Hall and canvassing the provincial hinterlands nightly by telephone for any useful items scavenged by contacts and stringers. A fortuitous vacancy emerged in the provincial capital, Fredericton, and Bannerman was posted there as a one-man bureau responsible for coverage of government and all happenings in the capital city. Only when the Legislature was in session or when major stories erupted would he get more senior help from the Saint John newsroom. Within a year of his posting he was not only writing for the Telegraph-Journal, he became an Atlantic Provinces stringer for Time Canada, the Globe & Mail (Toronto), the Toronto Star, the Star Weekly, Maclean's magazine, The Montreal Star and, through a Toronto agency, hundreds of trade and business publications. His output of stories was so prolific that he would, on occasion, overwhelm the CN-CP Telecommunications office in Fredericton. The solution was the installation by CN-CP of his own teletype machine in the bedroom/office of his apartment. After that, Bannerman would type his stories directly on the teletype keyboard creating tape that would later be fed through the machine over the phone lines to his editors in Saint John and across Canada. This NB chapter was remarkable in other ways. He leveraged his support for the military into outstanding stories from the army at CFB Gagetown and flights with the air force to the Canadian Arctic, the Caribbean and the Mediterranean; usually rough no-frills passage, brief stops (if any) - the RCAF CP-107 Argus could remain aloft over the Arctic for up to 30 hours per flight - and down time almost exclusively in military messes, but great adventures for a young reporter. It was during this Fredericton period that Bannerman became schooled in political strategy, developing friendships with a notable Liberal backroom strategist Wendell Fulton and Conservative thinkers such as the national guru Dalton K. Camp and Richard B. Hatfield. Hatfield, who became a close personal friend for the rest of his life, became the longest serving Premier in NB history (1970‚Äì1987). In addition to the Telegraph-Journal's Hazel, Bannerman worked for and learned from some of the most remarkable people in Canadian journalism: John Scott of Time Canada, Richard L. Duncan of Time International (eventually to become managing editor of Time Inc.); Clark Davey, then managing editor of the Globe & Mail; Courtenay Tower of Maclean's; and, Charles Lynch, chief of Southam News, then in charge of bureaus around the world. By 1970, Bannerman was receiving offers to work at major urban dailies outside of the Maritime provinces, but the decision to leave was difficult. In major markets with scores of talented and established reporters available, the freelance sideline would be nowhere near so lucrative, nor would his work be exclusively the best of the prime assignments. Eventually, however, it became apparent that career development required that big step. He first approached Lynch and the Southam News boss - by then a national icon - told Bannerman to take his pick of any Southam newspaper coast to coast and he would endeavour to get him placed. When he advised Lynch that the Vancouver Province would be preferred (an opportunity to learn about the west coast) Bannerman insisted upon just one prerequisite from any new employer: the role must be full-time political reporting, a beat position. The Province recruited him to cover Vancouver City Hall and also the provincial legislature, as the junior of two reporters when the Legislature was in session in the BC capital of Victoria. Both assignments were fortuitous. In 1970, reclaiming the cities was \\"in\\" and Bannerman soon evolved the City Hall beat into a column on Urban Affairs, also writing about developments nationally and internationally. The newspaper gave him a budget to travel and he visited the mayors of Toronto, Montreal (the charismatic Jean Drapeau) and the urban affairs minister in Ottawa. In Victoria, he would soon become close to perhaps the greatest figure in BC history, Premier W.A.C. Bennett. When Bannerman privately introduced himself to the legendary Bennett, a NB native himself, and advised that his brother Russell Bennett had been one of his teachers in Moncton High School, Bennett somewhat adopted the new arrival. Another mentorship began and intensified after Bennett was defeated in the 1972 election. Bannerman would later work with W.A.C. Bennett and write his last formal paper on any topic, a brief to a Royal Commission studying BC Rail, which was published in full in The Vancouver Sun, spanning two full pages. Another aspect of the work at The Province, nurtured and supported by his editors, was investigative reporting, which had become somewhat of a specialty. Several expos√©s of frauds and misbehaviour had attracted widespread attention. This is the work that piqued the interest of CKNW Radio and led to another intriguing job offer. Broadcasting Radio icon Jack Webster pulled the plug on CKNW Radio in 1972, departing amid an acrimonious contract dispute and signing with a rival radio station. An enigmatic talk radio host and accomplished reporter, who spoke with a distinctive Glaswegian Scots brogue, he was not merely a dominant media force on the west coast, he was a national Canadian celebrity. His departure was a crisis for the CKNW broadcasting battleship, creating a serious challenge to the station's preeminence. Program director Hal Davis, who had likely developed more genuine stars than anyone in the national industry, faced a real challenge. A decision was made to replace Webster - temporarily - with a team of people to be known as \\"The Investigators\\". The hope of some at the station was that if a team could succeed, no one personality would be able to hold the station to ransom but Davis, privately, knew that the odds would be better if, within the team, they also developed a personality for the future. The bigger problem was the title \\"Investigators\\", with promotions implying a daily menu of non-stop expos√©s. Davis knew that major investigations can each take months and also a more disturbing fact: the skill set of a radio news reporter requires quick thinking, speed, the ability to grasp the essence of a story from complicated information and to then move on. Investigations require plodding deliberation, study, frustration, the patient development of sources, legal counselling and frequent dead end streets. Davis had hired Jack Webster from The Vancouver Sun many years before, and attributed much of Jack's success to his newspaper training. He looked in that direction again and discovered Bannerman at The Province, who had quickly become prominent in Vancouver and who had established a track record for investigative reporting. Bannerman had always been intrigued by news talk radio and welcomed the challenge. He began in 1972 as a reporter for \\"The Investigators\\" and by 1973 he was the principal host. The program became \\"Gary Bannerman and the Investigators\\" and, eventually, just the \\"Gary Bannerman Show\\". For 16 years, the program offered a steady parade of Prime Ministers, Premiers and newsmakers of all descriptions, including Arab Princes, show business celebrities, best selling authors and business leaders. Prominent guests and associates included two former heads of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (William Colby and Adm. Stansfield Turner), Bob Hope, Henry Mancini, Nana Mouskouri, Cleo Laine, Yehudi Menuhin, Muhammad Ali, Melvin Belli, Moshe Dayan, Prince Sultan bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, Victor Borge, Dizzy Gillespie and Norman Vincent Peale. An inveterate traveller, Bannerman has done interviews and documentaries from around the world, including coverage of the 1973 Middle East war. His work as a reporter exposed numerous fraudulent business practices, assisting police in obtaining criminal convictions. The aggressive programming generated 150 libel suits, most of which did not progress beyond threats and an exchange of letters, but several became high-profile media and/or courtroom events. An expos√© of activities of the Church of Scientology led to a lawsuit and evidentiary challenges that twice went all the way up to the Supreme Court of Canada. Another celebrated jury trial faced off against a lawyer who made a practice of defending Canadian Nazi sympathizers. Bannerman and CKNW never lost a case, owing principally to courageous station management who budgeted for these events, stood behind the program and who retained outstanding barristers: Charles R. Maclean, QC; Douglas A. Hogarth, QC and Thomas R. Braidwood, QC. Maclean and Hogarth are deceased. Hogarth and Braidwood became distinguished Supreme Court Judges, Braidwood to BC's highest court, the Court of Appeal. Despite the undefeated score in libel, there were mistakes and misadventures addressed by the justice system. Two of the libel actions required nominal out-of-court settlements ($5,000 each) and twice he was fined: in one instance Bannerman was held in contempt for violating a ban of publication of evidence in a major underworld drug case; and, in another he was fined under the Broadcast Act for conducting an on-air political poll on an election day. However, he is ashamed of only one incident in the long broadcast career. This was an editorial in 1985 which intended to question Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's statement, \\"I believe in native self-government,\\" discussing both self-government and self-sufficiency. In the course of the argument he pointed out the serious social problems on many of the country's reserves, suggesting that native leaders have to take more responsibility for both creating and dealing with these matters. None of this would have been out of line. Bannerman had consistently been on the side of responsible native leaders throughout both his newspaper and broadcasting career. The problem with this event is that the editorial - which escalated into what could only be described as a tirade - seemed to forget that Mulroney's ingenuous politics were the issue, and repeatedly cited a long list of problems on Indian reserves. The tone was venomous. Bannerman was quick to apologize, but the Nisga'a people of the BC north and the Musqueam Band (Coast Salish) filed a formal complaint with the national broadcasting regulator. The native bands were both eloquent and patient in their appeal. Others clamoured for punitive action against CKNW and Bannerman. Eventually, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunication Commission issued a written reprimand for a broadcast which might have had the consequence of engendering racism. Critics persisted to complain until it reached the desk of the Justice Minister of Canada, John Crosbie, who publicly said that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) ruling was the final word, and chastized those who continued to politicize the matter. Among Bannerman's areas of special interest both in newspaper and radio days was crime, corrections and penal reform. He conducted precedent-setting remote broadcasts from behind the walls of prisons, and, on three separate occasions in 1975, he negotiated violent hostage taking incidents. One of these was perpetrated by three of the most dangerous killers in Canadian prisons who locked 15 hostages in a large walk-in office safe. The event lasted 41 hours spanning three days, a period during which Bannerman and lawyer Bryan Williams (later Chief Justice of the BC Supreme Court) regularly visited the hostage area in attempts to keep matters calm and to free the hostages. The incident ended in violence after hostages tried to break free of the dozing criminals, noise that sprung the SWAT team into action with considerable gunfire. When calm returned, one of the inmates, Andy Bruce, had suffered multiple wounds, including a bullet to the head (he survived) and one hostage, Mary Steinhauser, was dead. The story was reported in newspapers all around the world. It eventually became the subject of a formal Commission of Inquiry, a stage play and a motion picture, Walls. Among the awards Bannerman cherishes most is an Official Commendation from the Canadian Penitentiary Service (now Corrections Canada). The Bannerman program was consistently at the centre of British Columbia activity: among the highlights were the redevelopment of Vancouver's historic neighbourhood, Gastown; a central role in winning final approval for a convention centre on the waterfront, what is now the national icon Canada Place; support for and coverage of the World's Fair Expo '86; major power developments and the extraordinary achievements of BC Ferries, BC Hydro and BC Rail. Winding down Following Expo '86 and a change of BC government later that year, with close friend Bill Vander Zalm emerging as premier, Bannerman said the radio life seemed to become anti-climactic, repetitive and even - on occasion - irrelevant. During the next two years he started to frequently display symptoms of what could only be described as burnout: overly temperamental, too much drinking and on-again off-again disputes with the new manager of CKNW about program content. Despite record ratings, constant pressure was brought by the station upon Bannerman to do commercial advertising endorsements, something he uniquely refused to do throughout his entire career at great financial cost. His view was always that it is impossible to do expos√©s of fraud involving one business while accepting cash from a competitor to publicly endorse their product. Even more grating were instructions to make the program more like American daytime TV talk, the freak-a-minute variety allegedly of appeal to a larger, lower mentality audience. Bannerman also refused to do this, standing behind contract provisions that gave him the power over program content. He warned that the station's attempt to \\"dumb- down\\" programming would ultimately have disastrous impact on both the integrity of the product and its place in the market. By his own admission, his behaviour became defiant and unprofessional and his health seemed to suffer. For 20 years he had never missed a day of work, but suddenly, in June 1988 he was rushed to hospital with a life-threatening liver condition. It would be two years before doctors reported a 100 percent return to good health, but coincidental with his release from hospital in late June 1988, it was time for contract negotiations. Determined not to continue in radio unless new understandings were in place about program management and content, he says he delivered a contract proposal to CKNW that had a \\"take it or leave it\\" tone, a complete departure from the collegial approach to programming that had built CKNW. Unsurprisingly, the management chose not to renew the agreement, but subsequently was courteous, generous and professional in every aspect of the separation. (After a change of management at CKNW, Bannerman would return to the station on a part-time basis through most of the 1990s). Books * Gastown: The 107 Years (Lagoon Estates, 1972) A byproduct of Bannerman's newspaper support for the redevelopment of Vancouver's historic precinct from a disgusting skid road to a major tourist attraction, was this 40,000-word magazine format book chronicling history and the redevelopment project, including a historic walking tour of the neighbourhood. * Cruise Ships: The Inside Story (Saltaire, 1976) Charles R. White of Victoria BC, a significant investor in and developer of BC broadcast media, was a personal friend of Stan McDonald of Seattle, the founder of Princess Cruises. McDonald complained to White that libraries were full of books about passenger ships and the glory days of the North Atlantic, but that there was nothing available as a guidebook to the modern development of ships as a vacation destination, the new cruise industry. White convinced Bannerman that his former newspaper prominence still had some brand value left and that he should take on this guide book project as a hobby. Bannerman and Patricia worked on it together and what emerged was the first ever guidebook to the modern cruise industry, with Patricia's photograph of McDonald's Island Princess at anchor off Puerto Vallarta on the cover. * Cruise Ships: The Inside Story (Collins, 1982) White's Saltaire Publishing edition was so successful it attracted the attention of the Canadian division of the British publisher Collins and a completely new book was the result, with only about 25 percent of the original content surviving. *Bon Voyage: The Cruise Travellers' Handbook (Passport, 1984 and 1986) - Library of Congress # 84-60594 Passport Books, an imprint of Chicago-based National Textbook Company bought the American rights to the cruise book and, with appropriate updating by the author on each occasion, had two printings of the book. * The Ships of British Columbia (Hancock House, 1985) This coffee table book was the official history of the BC Ferry Corporation, by far Canada's largest passenger shipping company and one of the largest ferry systems in the world. Patricia, who contributed original photography and sorted through thousands of historical pictures to choose the 280 ultimately published, received title credit as co-author. * Collingwood School: The First Ten Years (Hancock House, 1994) This was a coffee table book to honour the 10th anniversary of a prestigious West Vancouver private school, authored by Bannerman and featuring outstanding photography by Lloyd Sutton and Patricia Bannerman, and major art contributions from the eminent British illustrator John Batchelor. * Squandering Billions (Hancock House, 2005) This book is a brutally frank indictment of health spending, demonstrating that the absolute power of medical doctors, pharmaceutical companies, health bureaucrats and hospital administrators, enshrines mediocrity at the expense of patients. It was coauthored Dr. Don Nixdorf, executive director of the BC Chiropractic Association, with substantial input from one of the architects of Canada's Medicare, Dr. Pran Manga, an economist at the University of Ottawa. This book is illustrated by internationally syndicated caricaturist Kerry Waghorn. Bannerline Enterprises Ltd. - the business Bannerline was incorporated in 1974 by Gary and Patricia Bannerman as an umbrella company for all activities: radio contracts, freelance writing, investments, books, art and photography. The name for the company was suggested by CKNW's programming genius, the late Hal Davis, who used that title for a daily editorial Bannerman delivered during his first years at the station. Davis' idea was to connect the newspaper background with the surname. Over the years, the company has owned and managed real estate investments, a major share of a two-office travel agency, shares in the Canadian subsidiary of a British television production company and a vast range of smaller ventures. Bannerman has served on several Boards of Directors over the years, both publicly traded and private companies. Principal among these was the Board of the BC Ferry Corporation from 1989 until 1992. After leaving CKNW, Bannerman and B.C. Premier Bill Vander Zalm seriously discussed a full-time Principal Secretary position in the Premier's Office. Instead, he began accepting consulting assignments in 1989 from associates who operated large corporate enterprises. The business was fundamentally engaged with communications strategy and long term planning. Associates provided expert services for graphic design, publishing, the Internet, video production, advertising, media relations, market research, art and photography. Two internationally renowned artists were part of the team: John Batchelor of Wimborne, Dorset, England, likely the most renowned technical illustrator in the world; and, Kerry Waghorn of North Vancouver, BC, whose Faces in the News caricatures have been in world syndication since 1977. Now represented by Universal Press Syndicate, Kerry's work has appeared in more than 400 publications in about 60 countries. Awards Among the honours received by Gary Bannerman were: * Junior Chamber of Commerce (1974). Nominated: Outstanding Young Canadian * B'nai B'rith of Canada (1975), national award for humanitarian broadcasting * Official Commendation: Canadian Penitentiary Service (1975) * Freeman of Gastown (1978) * Royal Canadian Legion (1981), National Media Award * Vancouver Rotary (1982), annual award for service above self * British Columbia Association of Broadcasters (1983), Annual Community Service Award * Honorary Member: Vancouver Police Pipe Band (since 1984) * Honorary Member: Penticton Detachment, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (since 1987) * TV Week Viewers Choice Award (1988).

Weapon mounts can be broken down into two categories: static mounts and non-static mounts. Static mount An M1 Abrams with a turret-mounted gun, coaxial machine gun, pintle-mounted loader's machine gun and commander's remote weapon station. A static mount is a non-portable weapon support component either mounted directly to the ground, on a fortification, or as part of a vehicle. Turret A gun turret protects the crew or mechanism of a weapon and at the same time lets the weapon be aimed and fired in many directions. A turret is a rotating weapon platform, strictly one that crosses the armour of whatever it is mounted on with a structure called a barbette (on ships) or basket (on tanks) and has a protective structure on top (gunhouse). If it has no gunhouse it is a barbette, if it has no barbette (ie, it is mounted to the outside of the vehicle's armour) it is an installation. Turrets are typically used to mount machine guns, autocannons or large-calibre guns. They may be manned or remotely controlled. A small turret, or sub-turret on a larger one, is called a cupola. The term cupola also describes rotating turrets that carry no weapons but instead are sighting devices, as in the case of tank commanders. A finial is an extremely small sub-turret or sub-sub-turret mounted on a cupola turret. Typically the gun is fixed on its horizontal axis and rotated by turning the turret, with trunnions on the gun used to allow it to elevate. Alternatively, in an oscillating turret the entire upper section of the turret moves to elevate and depress the gun. Casemate USS North Dakota (BB-29) A casemate is an armoured structure consisting of a static primary surface incorporating a limited-traverse gun mount: typically, this takes the form of either a gun mounted through a fixed armour plate (typically seen on tank destroyers and assault guns) or a mount consisting of a partial cylinder of armour \\"sandwiched\\" between plates at the top and bottom (as with the sponson guns of early tanks and the secondary armament of Dreadnought-era battleships). Coaxial A coaxial mount is mounted beside or above the primary weapon and thus points in the same general direction as the main armament, relying on the host weapon's ability to traverse in order to change arc. The term coaxial is something of a misnomer as the arrangement is strictly speaking paraxial (i.e., parallel axes, as opposed to the same axis), though for ballistic purposes the axis is effectively the same in practical terms. Nearly all main battle tanks and most infantry fighting vehicles have a coaxial machine gun mounted to fire along a parallel axis to the main gun. Coaxial weapons are usually aimed by use of the main gun control. It is usually used to engage infantry or other \\"soft\\" targets where use of shots from the main gun would be dangerous, ineffective or wasteful. Some weapons such as the M40 recoilless rifle and the Mk 153 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon have a smaller caliber spotting rifle mounted in coaxial fashion to the barrel or launch tube. These weapons fire special cartridges designed to mimic the ballistic arc of the host weapon's ammunition, using tracer or point-detonating rounds so that a gunner can easily determine where a shot will land in order to place fire accurately. Due to the adoption of more advanced systems such as laser rangefinders, they are rarely used on modern weapons. Fixed A fixed mount is incapable of horizontal movement (traverse), though not necessarily vertical movement (elevation). The entire mounting must be moved in order to change direction of fire. Fully fixed mounts (no traverse or elevation) are most commonly found on aircraft, and most commonly direct the weapon forward, along the aircraft's vector of movement, so that a pilot can aim by pointing the nose of the aircraft at the target. Some aircraft designs used different concept of fixed mounts, as found in Schr√§ge Musik or AC-47 Spooky. The Stridsvagn 103 is an unusual turretless main battle tank with a fixed main gun that is aimed using the tank's tracks and suspension. Military aircraft also often used fixed mounts called hardpoints or weapon stations to attach disposable stores such as missiles, bombs and external fuel tanks: these devices mount a standardised set of locking lugs to which many different types of armament can be affixed. Fixed traverse mounts capable of only elevation are common on larger self-propelled guns, as well being the mounting method used by virtually all railroad guns. Pintle/pedestal/turntable Lynx. A pintle mount is a fixed mount that allows the gun to be freely traversed and/or elevated while keeping the gun in one fixed position: typically the mounting is either a rod on the underside of the gun (a pintle rod) that mates with a socket, or an intermediary gun cradle that mounts to the sides of the weapon's barrel or receiver. Due to the stability offered by the mount, the gun typically does not use a shoulder stock, with many modern examples using spade grips. It is most commonly found on armoured vehicles, technicals, side gun stations on WW2 and earlier bomber aircraft, and the door guns of transport helicopters. Early single-shot examples referred to as swivel guns were commonly mounted on the deck rails of naval vessels in the age of sail to deter boarders at close range. Larger guns require a heavier mounting referred to as a pedestal, and even larger guns a turntable platform: a pedestal mount may be directly manipulated, but larger guns typically require power assistance or the use of mechanical handwheels for traverse and elevation. Very large mounts might also include seats for the crew fixed to the gun cradle or the floor of the turntable. Unlike a turret, this type of mount has little or no armour protection, usually at most a gunshield or splinter shield. Remote weapon station/installation This is a power-assisted mounting on the outside of whatever it is mounted on, usually bolted down to the surface and with only the control wires crossing the armour. Such mountings are typically used on armoured fighting vehicles for anti-personnel weapons to avoid exposing a crewmen to return fire, and on naval vessels for self-contained CIWS systems. Swing arm A swing mount is a fixed mount that allows a far greater and more flexible arc of fire than the simple pintle mount system. Utilising a system of one or two articulated arms the gunner can swing the weapon through a wide arc even though the gunner's position is fixed relative to the mount. These systems vary in complexity from a simple arm, to a double arm with the ability to lock the weapon in any firing position. Ground mount M198 Howitzer, an example of a wheeled split-trail carriage mount. A ground mount is a sub-class of weapon mount that is portable. Carriage Large weapons that cannot easily be lifted by infantry require a mounting platform that can be moved around when mobility is needed. Wheels are typically used, although skids are sometimes preferred in cold climates where icy/snowy surfaces become problematic for wheels, and some particularly heavy guns have historically used unpowered tracks. Small carriages can be pushed/pulled by hands in the manner of a small cart or wheelbarrow, while larger ones require traction by animals or vehicles. Large weapons often use a deployable base to make them easier to transport and more stable in their firing position: split-trail mounts (where two long \\"trails\\" can be brought together to make a towing bar) and cruciform bases with two folding legs are examples. \\"Pack howitzers\\" are a special case where the carriage can be completely dismantled and split into a series of loads for transport over rough terrain, typically by mules. Baseplate Typically used by infantry mortars, this is a flat plate mounted to the weapon directly or using a ball-and-socket joint. The plate is usually square, rectangular or circular, and designed to spread out the weapon's recoil force and prevent it from being piledriven into the ground: it is often, though not always, used with a two-legged stand to elevate the barrel at a desired angle. Monopod A monopod has one leg and does not provide stability along the coordinate axis of motion. Monopods have the advantage of being light and compact although when used in firing mode it does not have enough stability to be used with large firearms. Monopods are typically used on short-barreled, precision-fire firearms. Many sniper rifles feature a monopod integrated into their stock, providing the effect of a tripod when it is combined with a frontal bipod. Bipod A bipod has two legs and provides stability along the left-to-right coordinate axis of motion. The bipod permits the operator to rest the weapon on the ground, a low wall, or other object, reducing operator fatigue and permitting increased accuracy. Bipods can be of fixed or adjustable length, and can either be an accessory mounted to the weapon or integral to it. Those of higher quality can be tilted and also have their tilting point close to the bore central axis, allowing the weapon to tilt left and right a small amount, allowing a quick horizontal sight picture on uneven ground and keeping the operator close to the ground. Tripod A tripod has three legs and provides stability along the left-to-right and fore-and-aft coordinate axis of motion. Tripods have the disadvantage of being heavy and bulky, but provide far superior stability and do not require the user to exert any force in order to keep the mount balanced. Tripods are typically used on support weapons such as heavy machine guns, repeating grenade launchers, recoilless rifles and large infantry anti-tank missiles systems such as BGM-71 TOW. These tripods are often much larger than the weapon itself and may have mechanical elevation and traverse controls for indirect fire. The tripod permits the operator to rest the weapon on the ground and thus the gun feels lighter to the shooter and accuracy is increased. Fork rest/shooting sticks US Soldier using an M14 rifle equipped with a Sage M14ALCS chassis stock resting on two legged shooting sticks. Shooting sticks are portable weapon mounts used by field shooters, like hunters, snipers and metallic silhouette black-powder rifle shooters. They can be anything from purpose- built rests to constructions made from actual sticks, and have between one and three legs. They have existed since the days of early Arquebusiers, when they would typically be a long thin stake with a U-shaped rest at the top, referred to as a fork rest. On firearms, shooting sticks are commonly used on rifles to provide a forward rest and reduce motion. Shooting sticks permit the operator to rest the weapon on the ground, a low wall, or other object, reducing operator fatigue and permitting increased accuracy. Underbarrel This type of infantry weapon mount is where a weapon is attached underneath the barrel of a larger one, using either special mounting equipment or an accessory rail. This allows the user to have two weapons ready in hand with a simple change of grip all that is needed to fire the accessory weapon. It is most commonly used to mount a single-shot grenade launcher to a rifle, and the use of a cut-down shotgun is also fairly common as it means the soldier does not have to carry a separate weapon to breach doors.

The park was established in 1960 and covers an area of 482 km¬≤. Nearly 350 km¬≤ of the protection is forested and the park's wooded hills rise up to . The nature park, which consists of the Arnsberg Forest in the west and the Warstein Forest in the east, is important for the regional economy both in terms of forestry and tourism. The two forests form a densely wooded part of the S√ºder Uplands within the Rhine Massif.  Geography   Location  The Arnsberg Forest Nature Park lies between the river M√∂hne in the north, on which the M√∂hne Reservoir is located, and the deep valley of the Ruhr in the south. Between these two valleys the park is situated between M√∂hnesee in the northwest, R√ºthen in the northeast, Brilon in the east, Olsberg in the southeast, Meschede in the south and Arnsberg in the southwest; Warstein lies within the nature reserve. To the north is the heavily forested region of the Haarstrang, to the east are the Brilon Heights, to the south is the Rothaargebirge, to the southwest is the Lennegebirge and to the west the terrain gradually descends towards Dortmund into the Ruhr.  Rivers and lakes  The best-known water feature in the Arnsberg Forest Nature Park is the M√∂hnesee, set in the M√∂hne valley between the Haarstrang in the north and the Arnsberg Forest in the south. Numerous rivers run through the wooded valleys. These include the Ruhr and M√∂hne, which border the forests, as well as other water courses that feed the M√∂hne and Ruhr: * Biber (M√∂hne tributary near R√ºthen) * Glenne (M√∂hne tributary northwest of R√ºthen-Kallenhardt) ** L√∂rmecke (Glenne tributary between Suttrop and Kallenhardt) ** M√∂hne (Ruhr tributary near Neheim-H√ºsten) * Wester (M√∂hne tributary near Belecke) ** Langer Bach (Wester tributary near Warstein) ** Wideybach (Wester tributary near Warstein) * Heve (M√∂hne tributary, mouth at the southern end of the M√∂hnesee) * Ruhr (Rhine tributary near Duisburg-Ruhrort) * Wanne (Ruhr tributary near Niedereimer)  Hills  The hills and hilltops of the Arnsberg Forest Nature Park include: the Warsteiner Kopf (556.9 m; fourth- highest hill), the Gemeinheitskopf (551.9 m; fifth-highest hill) the Niekopf (550.4 m; sixth-highest hill) and the Nuttlarer H√∂he (542.2 m). These are the best known hills in the nature park because, unlike the other local heights they are shown on most of the maps and the specialised reference books. There are also, as the following list shows, a number of unnamed hilltops. * Highest hill (unnamed Kuppe; ) * Second highest hill (unnamed Kuppe; ) * Third highest hill (unnamed Kuppe; ) * Fourth highest hill (Warsteiner Kopf; ) * Fifth highest hill (Gemeinheitskopf; ) * Sixth highest hill (Niekopf; )  Villages  In or on the edge of the Arnsberg Forest Nature Park are numerous villages belonging to these municipalities and towns: { width = \\"250\\" valign=top * R√ºthen in the northeast * Brilon in the east * Olsberg in the southeast, width = \\"250\\" valign=top * Bestwig in the south-southeast * Meschede in the south * Arnsberg in the southwest valign=top * Ense in the northwest * M√∂hnesee in the north-northwest * Warstein in the centre |}  Tourism   Sights  L√∂rmecke Tower The Bilstein Cave southwest of Warstein in the Arnsberg Forest Nature Park attracts many tourists.

The event currently offers a purse of $150,000. History The event was named for the Argentine bred filly Miss Grillo, a record breaking stakes winner in the 1940s who won the Diana Handicap twice. The event was inaugurated on 29 October 1980 at Aqueduct Racetrack and was run over the mile distance with Robert Kluener's Smilin' Sera winning the event by one length over De La Rose in a time of 1:51. De La Rose the following year would be crowned the US Champion Female Turf Horse. In 1982 the event was classified as Grade III, upgraded to Grade II in 1988 and was downgraded to Grade III the following year. From 2001-2007 the race was not graded as in 2009 when the event was moved off the turf track due to the inclement weather and held over a shorter one mile distance. In 2018 the event was upgraded back to Grade II. The event was run in two divisions in 1988. The distance of the event has been changed several times but since 2010 the event has been run over the current distance of miles.

History During the early 17th century, the city of Hyderabad was ruled by King Tana Shah. He was the Emperor at Golkonda fort. The royal king had many ministers at his court of which Madanna and Akkanna both were brothers served as the Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister, respectively. These two brothers were one of the favorite ministers of the king and stayed in a house near his own, where the temple of Mahankali existed. Being the true disciples of Goddess Mahankali, Akkanna and Madanna performed pooja every day at the holy temple before they left for the court of Golconda for their day's work. Soon after the killing of these two brothers, the temple was closed. It has been more than sixty-seven years since the temple has been revived from the debris of Hari bowli at Shalibanda. Before the temple was rejuvenated, very few people in the Old City had knowledge of the existence of this temple.

In ASBA, an IPO applicant's account doesn't get debited until shares are allotted to them. Earlier Qualified Institutional Buyers were only allowed to participate in IPOs through ASBA facility. Currently as per SEBI guidelines, all three categories of investors, i.e., Retail Investors, Qualified Institutional Buyers, Non-Institutional Investors, making application in public/rights issue shall mandatorily make use of ASBA facility. ASBA process facilitates retail individual investors bidding at a cut-off, with a single option, to apply through Self Certified Syndicate Banks (SCSBs), in which the investors have bank accounts. SCSBs are those banks which satisfy the conditions laid by SEBI. SCSBs would accept the applications, verify the application, block the fund to the extent of bid payment amount, upload the details in the web based bidding system of NSE, unblock once basis of allotment is finalized and transfer the amount for allotted shares to the issuer. ASBA means ‚ÄúApplications Supported by Blocked Amount‚Äù. ASBA is an application containing an authorization to block the application money in the bank account, for subscribing to an issue. If an investor is applying through ASBA, his application money shall be debited from the bank account only if his/her application is selected for allotment after the basis of allotment is finalized, or the issue is withdrawn/failed. It is a supplementary process of applying in Initial Public Offers (IPO) and Follow-On Public Offers (FPO) made through Book Building route and co-exists with the current process of using cheque as a mode of payment and submitting applications. ASBA is stipulated by SEBI, and available from most of the banks operating in India. This allows the investors money to remain with the bank till the shares are allotted after the IPO. Only then does the money transfer out of the investors account to the company. This eliminates the need for refunds on shares not being allotted. As of December 3, 2012, 52 Banks are acting as SCSBs. Investors may submit their ASBA Applications to these SCSBs in order to apply for Public Issues. The list of SCSBs include the likes of The Jammu & Kashmir Bank Limited, Bank of India, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Karnataka Bank Limited, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, UCO Bank, IDBI Bank among others.  Benefits of ASBA  # The investor need not pay the application money by cheque rather block his / her bank account to the extent of the application money, thus continue to earn interest on application money. # The investor does not have to bother about refunds, as in ASBA only an amount proportionate to the securities allotted is taken from the bank account when his / her application is selected for allotment after the basis of allotment is finalised. #Customer can revise / withdraw the bid before the end of the Issue in the prescribed format with the Bank.

He intrigued with Fitzgerald in 1569, and fled to France; returned to Ireland and received pardon, 1571, with the restoration of his lands, 1573.Lee, Sidney (1903), Dictionary of National Biography Index and Epitome, p. 960 (main entry XLI 309) Life O'Brien, was, called Groibleach, or the \\"long-nailed\\", was the eldest son of Donough O'Brien, 2nd Earl of Thomond, and Helen Butler, youngest daughter of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond. He succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father in April 1553. His right was challenged by his uncle Donnell, who was formally inaugurated O'Brien and chief of the Dal Cais. Obliged to surrender Clonroad, the usual residence of the O'Briens, Conor retired to the castle of Doonmulvihill, on the borders of Galway, where he was besieged by Donnell, but relieved by his kinsman Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond.Dunlop, p. 309 Subsequently, Donnell petitioned for official recognition as chief of Thomond, and St. Leger, though unable to grant his request, promised to write to Queen Mary in his favour. Matters continued in this uncertain state till the summer of 1558, when the Earl of Sussex, having marched to Limerick with a large army, caused Donnell and Teige and Donough, sons of Murrough, 1st Earl of Thomond, to be proclaimed traitors, and Conor to be reinstated in his possessions.R.D. 309. Cites Cal. Carew MSS. i. 276 Donnell took refuge with Maguire in Fermanagh, and Teige and Donough found a powerful protector in Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond. Peace prevailed for a brief season, and Conor won Sussex's approbation for his good execution of justice. But in 1559 Teige and Donough returned to Inchiquin, and not merely defied Conor's efforts to oust them, but, with the assistance of the Earl of Desmond, actually inflicted a sharp defeat on him and his ally, the Earl of Clanricarde, at the Battle of Spancel Hill. Teige was shortly afterwards arrested by Lord-justice William FitzWilliam, and confined in Dublin Castle ; but early in 1562 he managed to escape, and, being joined by Donnell, they opposed a formidable army to the Earl of Thomond. With the help of some ordnance lent him by Sussex, Thomond succeeded in wresting Ballyally and Ballycarhy from them; and eventually, in April 1565, after reducing the country to a wilderness, Donnell consented to surrender his claim to the lordship of Thomond on condition of receiving Corcomroe. War broke out again in the following year ; but the resources of the combatants were exhausted, and Sidney, when he visited Limerick in April 1567, described it as utterly impoverished owing to the Earl of Thomond's \\"insufficiency to govern\\". The suspicion with which he was regarded made him discontented, and on 8 July 1569 he entered into league with the \\"arch-rebel\\" James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald (d. 1579). In February 1570 he attacked the President of Connaught, Sir Edward Fitton, at Ennis, and compelled him to seek refuge in Galway. A strong force under the Earl of Ormond was immediately despatched against him, and a few weeks later he submitted unconditionally. But being \\"seized with sorrow and regret for having surrendered his towns and prisoners\\", and determined never to \\"submit himself to the law, or to the mercy of the council of Ireland\\", he fled in the beginning of June to France. There he introduced himself on 18 July to Sir Henry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys, the English ambassador, and, after protesting his loyalty, begged him to intercede with the Queen Elizabeth for his pardon. Norris, who thought him a \\"barbarous man\\", wanting \\"neither vainglory or deceitfulness, and yet in his talk very simple\\", soon became aware that he was intriguing with the French court, and urged Elizabeth to coax him home at any price. Elizabeth, though she spoke of him as a \\"person of small value\\" and declined to pardon him beforehand, was sufficiently alive to his power to do mischief, and promised if he returned to give his grievances a favourable hearing. But Thomond showed no disposition to leave Paris, and Norris was forced to lend him a hundred crowns and make endless promises before he would consent to take his departure. He returned to Ireland in December, and, having made public confession of his treason to Sir Henry Sidney, he was pardoned. Subsequently, in April 1571, he made surrender of all his lands to the queen. He obtained permission to go to England to solicit their restoration, but, owing to the rebellion of the Earl of Clanricarde's sons, his presence was required in Ireland. He won the approval of the lord- deputy and council, and warrant was apparently given in June 1573 for the restoration of his lands. In December 1575 he went to Cork to show his respect to the lord-deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, whom he attended to Limerick and Galway, whither the principal men of Thomond repaired to him. \\"And finding that the mutuall Hurtes and Revenges donne betwixt the Earle and Teige MacMurrough Avas one great Cawse of the Ruyne of the Country\\", Sidney \\"bounde theim by Bondes, in great sommes\\", to surrender their lands, and to submit to the appointment of Donnell, created Sir Donnell O'Brien, as sheriff of the newly constituted county of Clare. This arrangement, though acquiesced in, was naturally displeasing to Thomond, and he was reputed to have said that he repented ever \\"condescending to the queen's mercy\\".Dunlop, pp. 309‚Äì310 The arrangement did not put an end to the disputes between him and Teige, and in 1577 Sir William Drury was compelled to place the county under martial government. Thomond thereupon repaired to England, and on 7 October warrant was issued for a new patent containing the full effect of his former patent, with remainder to his son Donough, baron of Ibrickan. He returned to Ireland about Christmas; but before his arrival, according to the \\"Four Masters\\", \\"the marshal had imposed a severe burden on his people, so that they were obliged to become tributary to the sovereign, and pay a sum of ten pounds for every barony, and this was the first tribute ever paid by the Dal Cais.\\" Thomond, however, seems to have lived on good terms with the new president of Connaught, Sir Nicholas Malby. He died, apparently, in January 1581, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Donough, baron of Ibrickan and 4th earl of Thomond.Dunlop, p. 310 Family Conor O'Brien first married Ellen, daughter of Donald MacCormac MacCarthy Mor and widow of James FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond; she died in 1560, and was buried in Muckross Abbey. He then married Una, daughter of Turlough Mac-i- Brien-Ara, with whom he had three sons: Teige (restorer of Dromore Castle, near Ruan), Daniel, created 1st Viscount Clare and Donogh O'Brien, 4th Earl of Thomond O Brien, Baron of Ibrickan, also spelt Donough O'Brien. Also had three daughters. Honora, first wife of Thomas Fitzmaurice, 18th Lord Kerry; Margaret, second wife of James Butler, 2nd Lord Dunboyne; and Mary, wife of Turlough Roe MacMahon of Corcovaskin.
