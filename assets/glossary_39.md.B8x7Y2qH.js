The episode was written by Caroline Dries and Brian Young and directed by Paul Wesley. The episode is Wesley's debut as director in the series. Plot The episode starts with Elena (Nina Dobrev) having a dream/vision about her and Stefan (Paul Wesley) meeting for the first time. She wakes up and feels that what she saw was weird. Elena goes to a cafe with Caroline (Candice Accola) where Elena has another vision. She talks to Caroline about it, and Caroline explains that now that Elena has broken up with Damon (Ian Somerhalder), the universe is trying to get her and Stefan back together. Stefan calls Caroline to tell her that he has visions as well, and they realize that something is not right. Liv (Penelope Mitchell) agrees to work with Tyler (Michael Trevino) and Matt (Zach Roerig), but she cannot trust them not being possessed by travelers. So, she tells them that they have to stab themselves with the traveler's knife to prove it. Matt does not like the idea, but he does it since he does not have a choice. After it is proven that none of them are possessed, Liv explains that the travelers are probably taking over Mystic Falls by getting into people's bodies, and their job is to find them and stab them with the traveler's knife to kill them. Bonnie (Kat Graham) tries to call Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen), but he is not answering. When she hangs up the phone, her Grams (Jasmine Guy) appears to warn her that something is not right on the other side. Grams thinks that the travelers tried to overwhelm Bonnie so that someone can pass through her. Grams leaves, and Bonnie heads to Jeremy's where she finds him there with Liv. She wants to know what is going on, but Jeremy says he cannot tell her and that she has to trust him. Caroline cannot reach her mom and asks Matt to help her find her while she calls Enzo (Michael Malarkey) to inform him and Damon that there is something going on with Elena and Stefan. She tells them about the visions and that the travelers must have something to do with it since now there is only one pair of doppelgangers because of them. Damon does not really feel comfortable hearing about the visions, and he suggests finding a witch to stop them. Matt goes to sheriff Forbes's (Marguerite MacIntyre) office to find her, but when he gets there, he realizes that something is wrong. He calls tyler, asking him to bring the traveler's knife. Sheriff Forbes comes in and hears the end of the conversation. She does not like it, and she stabs Matt in the neck killing him (she is possessed by a traveler) and sending him to the other side. Before he passes through Bonnie to get there, Matt tells her that the Sheriff has been taken over and to inform Jeremy about it. At the other side, Matt sees Kol (Nathaniel Buzolic), the Original that Jeremy killed. Matt wonders why he can see him, and Kol tells him that the other side is messed up because someone got out. Matt, then, starts looking for Vicki (Kayla Ewell). He finds her, and Vicki tells him that he has to go back to his body before she disappears again. Kol approaches Matt and tells him exactly the same thing, that he has to return to his body and tell the others what is going on to the other side so they can stop it, otherwise everything will fall apart. Elena and Caroline go to Damon's to discuss the visions \\"problem\\". Elena and Damon have a talk alone, where she asks him to be friends, but Damon changes the subject to her visions with Stefan. Elena says that it is like those visions happen in an alternate universe, and they are happy together. Damon gets the opportunity to remind her about the prophecy that the doppelgangers should be together. The conversation is interrupted by Luke (Chris Brochu), who is there to help them since his sister is busy. Tyler runs into sheriff. Realizing that she is possessed, he stabs her to kill the traveler inside her. Caroline takes sheriff home and gives her some of her blood to heal her from the stabbing, and she waits for her to wake up. Luke explains that he cannot stop Elena and Stefan's visions because Marcos (Raffi Barsoumian), the leader of the travelers, is back, and he is the one who causes them. Marcos tries to draw Elena and Stefan together, and Elena says that the travelers need their blood. Elena has another vision where she and Stefan celebrate their anniversary, but she can also see the address of \\"their\\" home. Elena's vision stops, and she says that she knows where Marcos is. Damon and Enzo go to the address and find Marcos. Damon asks him what he wants and what is going on, and Marcos explains that the doppelganger legend is not real. He was the one who cast a spell 1500 years ago, promising true love. This is so the doppelgangers would get together, and the travelers could have their blood. Marcos explains to Damon that the witches put a curse on the travelers, so they will not be able to gather together. The only way to do it is by possessing other bodies. They need the doppelgangers' blood, but they do not intend to harm them. In a matter of good faith, he says he will stop the visions, and he does. There is one more vision where Stefan and Elena are happy with 2 children. But Marcos ends the visions in the middle of this one as Elena gets back to reality. Elena and Stefan are free from the visions, and they talk about them, feeling a little sad that it ended since they were so happy in them. They know that those were not real but what they felt for each other was, and it was not the result of the doppelganger curse since that curse was fake. They both agree that they will always love each other. She later meets Damon to thank him for stopping the visions, but Damon tells her that he cannot be friends with her and does not want to see her again because it is hard for him. Elena walks away. In the meantime, Jeremy and Bonnie are at the Sheriff's office waiting for Matt to come back to life. When Matt comes back, he remembers what happened on the other side, though that had never happened before. He tells them about Vicki and asks Bonnie to tell him what is going on, but Bonnie does not know. The episode ends with Caroline talking to Tyler, saying she is worried about her mom not waking up yet. Tyler tells her to give her some time. They hang up the phone, and it is revealed that Tyler is with Marcos and tells him that \\"they are in\\". He also gives him the only travelers' knife that was left, and Marcos destroys it.

Stephanie Flasher from TV After Dark gave the episode a B rating saying that it was a good one with a very nostalgic feeling to it. \\"This week‚Äôs cliffhanger was very predictable with Tyler possessed. However, Paul did a wonderful job directing the episode. And it was a pleasant surprise seeing Kol and Vicki pop up on the ‚Äòother side.‚Äô\\" Carrie Raisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- rating and she compares the true love curse to the Sun and Moon curse, both of them turning out to be fake. \\"Both involve an evil mastermind perpetrating false information to bring together the supernatural forces necessary to complete a long-simmering, nefarious plan. But while the Sun and Moon curse reveal was electrifying and downright brave, the doppelganger prophecy twist just seems limp and sad in comparison.\\" Raisler also comments on Wesley's directorial debut saying: \\"[Wesley is] doing a fine job with a tricky episode that had not only regular action, but also visions and a significant look at the Other Side as well. His transitions from the regular action to the visions were especially impressive.\\" Stephanie Hall from K Site TV gave a good review to the episode saying: \\"It was an interesting episode that held my attention better than some others this season despite its seemingly fragmented storylines and the fact that the Travelers are simultaneously making more and less sense. In addition, it‚Äôs always a nice surprise when a few familiar faces pop up.\\" Hall also praised Wesley's work as director of the episode: \\"This marked an impeccable directorial debut for Paul Wesley, hopefully his first time directing of many. [...] If you didn‚Äôt know beforehand that this episode was directed by a first-timer, you certainly would not have guessed it afterwards. Paul Wesley did an amazing job capturing this episode, to say the least. Not only was it one of the most visually beautiful episodes of the series, but it‚Äôs also impressive to see the way he distinguished reality from the visions and from the Other Side with their color schemes and the level of enthusiasm that permeated the different performances.\\" Lindsay Sperling of We Got This Covered gave a good review to the episode saying that the fans reunited with some familiar faces from the past such as Grams and that Marcos seem to be a good villain: \\"Markos seems like a sane enough addition to the cast, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he won‚Äôt try to kill everyone like previous villains. With Katherine (also Dobrev) gone for good, The Vampire Diaries is lacking an antagonist and Markos is a prime candidate for that position.\\" Jen of TV Over Mind also gave a good review to the episode and praised Wesley for his directional debut: \\"Paul Wesley deserves a round of applause for this incredible episode that served as his directorial debut on The Vampire Diaries. Seriously, it was very impressive for numerous reasons including how it dealt with the mythical doppelganger prophecy and the mythology of the Travelers.\\" Ashley Dominique of Geeked Out Nation gave a C+ rating to the episode saying: \\"No one seemed to be looking for the truth or working together to piece all the information they had on a clear picture about the travelers and Marcos' intentions.\\" Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with only 1.1/5 saying that the episode was boring and a horrid hour of television. \\"Overall, very little happened. We discovered that Markos does want the Travelers to take over Mystic Falls; that Jeremy has to be better at communicating with his girlfriend; that Paul Wesley is a strong director; that Ezno is BY FAR the best part of TVD at this point; and that Tyler has been taken over by a Passenger. But around and around we go with the Elena/Damon/Stefan nonsense. When the characters themselves are bored, doesn't that pretty much say it all?\\" References External links  2014 American television episodes The Vampire Diaries (season 5) episodes ","title":"Resident Evil (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"42526721","text":"Hardie Avenue is a Christian alternative rock band from Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S. History Hardie Avenue began in Seattle, Washington, in 2005.

It consists of ten volumes and twenty books in total. Moving through time from antiquity through the Nanboku-ch≈ç period, it contains portraits and rough biographies in kanbun of 585 Imperial family members, loyal retainers, and historical heroines. It was groundbreaking for its visualizations of Japanese historical figures and has been treasured as a bible for historical art since the rise in national consciousness of the middle Meiji period.  Creation  According to a postscript by Y≈çsai's grandson Kikuchi Takeku, Y≈çsai began writing the series in 1818 and finished in 1868. Meanwhile, a foreword by the Confucian scholar Matsuda Nobuyuki noted that the manuscript had been completed, so it may be assumed that an initial draft was complete by that time. Additionally, the first edition of Volume 2, Book 4 was released in 1843, but after that publication stalled, perhaps for business reasons. The series was likely not released in complete form until the beginning of the Meiji Era in 1868. According to the introduction of the series, it seems that Y≈çsai had intended to create an additional volume of historical investigations. In 1903, Takeku and the editor Yamashita Shigetani released a version called the , which contained an additional volume of investigations into the systems and customs of old Japan for a total of 11 volumes. The style of the work is based on the biographical portraits of Chinese artists such as Shangguan Zhou (‰∏äÂÆòÂë®). In the creation of the sketches, Y≈çsai also borrowed from the patterns of the and emulated respected artists of the past, such as Ariwara no Narihira and Ono no Michikaze. However, some of his sketches held by the Tokyo National Museum show that he also used models to capture poses. In addition, a bibliography at the end of Volume 10 lists 264 different texts used for background research, including history books including the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki and literature including the Kokin Wakash≈´ and The Tale of Genji. Additionally, the Tokyo National Museum possesses a version of the Zenken KojitsuThis copy is the original draft of the K≈çsh≈ç Zenken Kojitsu. that includes sketches of the references used on each page, providing the sources for the costumes and possessions of the illustrated figures. In 1850, a special copy of one book of the Zenken Kojitsu made its way, through the regent Takatsukasa Masamichi, to the eyes of Emperor K≈çmei. Additionally, in 1868, a woodblock print copy of the complete series was presented to Emperor Meiji by Sanj≈ç Sanetomi and Higashikuze Michitomi. For his achievement, Y≈çsai was in 1875 granted the title of . However, it is important to note that this achievement is recorded only in documents associated with Y≈çsai himself, and has not been confirmable based on official documents.  Influence  The Zenken Kojitsu had an immense impact on the art, especially historical art, of the Meiji period, in which it was used as an iconic reference and textbook on the systems and customs of old Japan. The historical researcher and painter later recalled that \\"it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that in those days, there wasn't even a single historical artist who didn't study the Zenken Kojitsu.\\" Those who borrowed from his style included not only his students, including , Watanabe Sh≈çtei, and , but also other Japanese painters like Hashimoto Gah≈ç and . , who adored Y≈çsai's work, taught his students by making them copy the Zenken Kojitsu, producing excellent historical painters such as Seison Maeda and . The ukiyo-e woodblock prints of the Meiji era also frequently borrowed from the Zenken Kojitsu. Tsukioka Yoshitoshi adopted some of its techniques as early as 1867 in his , and his later works continued to show its influence. Yoshitoshi, who once aspired to be Y≈çsai's disciple, transformed Y≈çsai's scrupulous style into more intense scenes through dynamic compositions and strong colors. Yoshitoshi's pupils Toshihide Migita and , along with other artists of the period such as Kobayashi Kiyochika and Ogata Gekk≈ç, also reflected its influence, making the Zenken Kojitsu a basis for the ukiyo-e art of the period. The influence of the Zenken Kojitsu even reached into the fields of sculpture and Western-style paintings. The historical paintings of the Western-style artists of the Meiji Bijutsu-kai, such as and , likewise reflect its influence. also diligently copied the Zenken Kojitsu in his youth, and according to his friend , his comrades at art school did likewise. The sculptor , who studied under Vincenzo Ragusa, made a sculpture of , the ancestor god of the Mononobe clan, which also shows the effect of the Zenken Kojitsu, and is now in the Hamarikyu Gardens. The Zenken Kojitsu even made its mark on public education. Various educational materials, including the 1881 book of ethics , edited by and illustrated by Matsumoto F≈´ko, and the 1891 elementary-school history textbook , illustrated by the Western-style artist , show its influence in their depictions of historical heroes. In the early 20th century, though, even this popular work became old-fashioned. Shik≈ç Imamura, Yasuda Yukihiko, Maeda Seison, Kokei Kobayashi, and the other members of the next generation of Japanese historical art, the disciples of Y≈çsai's disciples, continued to produce works based on the Zenken Kojitsu while they studied. However, as their focus shifted away from historical accuracy and the investigation of customs and towards expressions of artistic individuality and beauty, they ceased to look back on the Zenken Kojitsu.

Henry Holt and Company, October 10, 2017. , 9781627796361. p. 130. in association with the Counter-Intelligence Unit of the FBI and released online in April 2014. One of the film's goals was to warn students of dangers in China. It featured the actor Joshua Murray as Shriver. Its runtime is 28 minutes. It changes some elements of the story from the real-life scenario, as Shriver is portrayed as a student even though he had already graduated in real life by the time he began the espionage scheme, since the FBI wanted this as a video to warn American tertiary students studying abroad. Daniel Golden, author of Spy Schools: How the CIA, FBI, and Foreign Intelligence Secretly Exploit America's Universities, described it as \\"partly propaganda\\". The FBI wanted U.S. universities to show the film to students about to study abroad, but they largely chose not to do so. Production and release The film was released in January 2013. Sean Paul Murphy, the screenwriter, stated that he wished to make the portrayal of Shriver \\"better and more sympathetic\\". Golden stated that the film made Shriver seem \\"more na√Øve and less cocky\\". The film depicts Shriver as discovering the true intentions of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) at a later point than in real life and as being a student when he first gets involved with the MSS even though, in real life, he had already graduated at that point. Within the film the Washington, D.C. Chinatown is used as a stand-in for Shanghai.Stein, Perry. \\"Chinatown Passes for Shanghai in the FBI's Eyes.\\" Washington City Paper. April 15, 2014.

Reception In Game of Pawns Shriver is portrayed by actor Joshua Murray, depicted as being in front of the main entrance to the East China Normal University in Shanghai; ECNU's administration complained about the use of the university in the film. Adam Taylor of The Washington Post described it as \\"strikingly cheesy, obviously low-budget\\".Taylor, Adam. \\"A cheesy FBI video hopes to stop U.S. students from becoming Chinese spies.\\" Washington Post.

April 16, 2014. Retrieved on August 6, 2016. Rauhala concluded that since the film had a \\"stereotypical view of China\\" it meant that \\"the people behind it, like Shriver, seem well-intentioned but unforgivably naive.\\" The administration of East China Normal University, where Shriver studied abroad, criticized the inclusion of the institution in the film due to potential negative publicity; the film does not mention the institution Shriver matriculated from, Grand Valley State University.Golden, Daniel.

Adults have been recorded on wing from May to July. The larvae feed on Aster species, including Aster shortii. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a long contorted and sometimes spiral mine. The species overwinters within the mine in a flat circular yellow cocoon. After hibernation, the larva bores into a growing shoot just below the tip, hollowing out the stem. Full-grown larvae leave the stem and pupate in a white or pale yellowish cocoon. The cocoon is spun on dead stems and twigs near the host plant.The genus Bucculatrix in America north of Mexico (Microlepidoptera) References *Natural History Museum Lepidoptera generic names catalog Bucculatricidae Moths described in 1919 Taxa named by Edward Meyrick Moths of North America ","title":"Bucculatrix cuneigera"},{"id":"42526904","text":"Bucculatrix ochristrigella is a species of moth in the family Bucculatricidae.

On 27 April 1994 it was integrated with six other independent forces into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF).South African Medal Website - SA Defence Force : 1952-1975 (Accessed 30 April 2015)Suid-Afrikaanse milit√™re dekorasies: 1952-1975Suid-Afrikaanse milit√™re dekorasies: 1975-2003Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 457, no. 25213, Pretoria, 25 July 2003 Motivation In 1952, when South Africa instituted its own military decorations and medals to replace the British honours which could, until then, be awarded to members of the UDF, equivalents of, amongst others, the British Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) and Air Force Cross (AFC) were omitted. This omission was only belatedly addressed near the end of the 1966-1989 Border War, in 1987, when the institution of the South African Air Force Cross was proposed.Air Force Cross (CA) (as approved) - Summary As proposed, the Air Force Cross (CA) was intended for award only to aircrew who displayed exceptional courage and leadership during dangerous or critical situations while airborne, where an award for bravery would not be suitable, based on the premise that bravery involves knowingly entering mortal danger from a position of relative safety, as opposed to skillfully reacting to an unforeseen situation of mortal danger. The proposed criteria were described in the draft warrant as excellent airmanship or outstanding ingenuity or skill during emergencies or unusual situations in the air. When the other three Arms of the Service subsequently proposed that an Army Cross (CM), a Navy Cross (CN) and a Medical Service Cross (CC) should be instituted simultaneously, the proposed award criteria of all four crosses were amended to outstanding ingenuity or skill in the utilisation and control of personnel, weaponry or other equipment in dangerous situations and, in the case of the proposed Air Force Cross, not necessarily restricted to flying. The Ad Astra Decoration Since the requirement for a decoration similar to the British Distinguished Flying Cross still existed, the institution of the Ad Astra Decoration, post-nominal letters AAD, was proposed in 1991. As was originally intended with the Air Force Cross, the criteria were again described in the draft warrant as excellent airmanship or outstanding ingenuity or skill during emergencies or critically unusual situations in the air. Two of the examples which served as motivation, would without doubt have qualified the respective pilots for the award of the equivalent of a Distinguished Flying Cross, had such a decoration existed in South Africa at the time.Ad Astra Decoration, First draft design - Summary First proposed design * One such incident was an in-flight malfunction in a Canberra B(1) Mk. 12, which disabled the aircraft's control column. In spite of advice from the ground to ditch the aircraft, since the pilot would be unlikely to be able to land it safely, he managed to land it at Air Force Base Waterkloof with minimal damage, while having only trim, rudder and engine power adjustments as controls. * Another example was a Dakota C-47, which lost its rudder and elevators when struck by a surface-to-air missile, whose commander managed to land safely at Air Force Base Grootfontein by having his passengers, most of them serving General- and Flag Officers, move forward and backward in the cabin as required, to alter the aircraft's centre of gravity. Institution The Ad Astra Decoration was instituted by the State President in 1991.South African Medal Website - Legal aspects - Fount of Honour (Accessed 1 May 2015) Award criteria The decoration could be awarded for excellent airmanship or outstanding ingenuity or skill during emergencies or unusual situations on board aircraft in flight. A bar, instituted in 1993, could be awarded in recognition of further similar displays of excellent airmanship. The decoration was first awarded in 1995, to Major L.R. Heemstra. Order of wear The position of the Ad Astra Decoration in the official order of precedence was revised twice to accommodate the inclusion or institution of new decorations and medals, first with the integration into the South African National Defence Force in 1994 and again with the institution of a new set of awards in 2003. ;South African Defence Force until 26 April 1994: Pro Virtute Medal (PVM) Ad Astra Decoration (AAD) Army Cross (CM) *Official SADF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Pro Virtute Medal (PVM). ** Succeeded by the Army Cross (CM). *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Pro Virtute Medal (PVM). ** Succeeded by the Army Cross (CM).Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 15093, Pretoria, 3 September 1993 ;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 1994: Distinguished Gallantry Medal Ad Astra Decoration (AAD) Army Cross (CM) *Official SANDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Distinguished Gallantry Medal of the Republic of Bophuthatswana. ** Succeeded by the Army Cross (CM) of the Republic of South Africa. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Medal for Valour in the Prisons Service of the Republic of Bophuthatswana. ** Succeeded by the Army Cross (CM) of the Republic of South Africa.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, ;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 2003: Nkwe ya Boronse (NB) Ad Astra Decoration (AAD) Army Cross (CM) *Official SANDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Nkwe ya Boronse (NB) of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Army Cross (CM) of the Republic of South Africa. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Mendi Decoration for Bravery, Bronze (MDB) of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Army Cross (CM) of the Republic of South Africa.

The suspender is an eagle in flight. ;Reverse The reverse has the pre-1994 South African Coat of Arms, with the words \\"AD ASTRA\\" underneath, with an impressed or engraved decoration number. ;Ribbon The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide, with diagonal 4 millimetres wide light blue and white lines, slanted upwards from left to right toward the left shoulder of the recipient. The direction of the slant of the lines was purposely the opposite of that of the British DFC and AFC, at the specific request of the Chief of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Jan van Loggerenberg. Ad Astra Decoration and Bar ;Bar The bar is silver-gilt and has a Protea emblem embossed in the centre.

Life and work  He showed an aptitude for artistic crafts at an early age and was apprenticed to the Ott Brothers glass-making workshop. At the same time, he attended evening classes in drawing at an arts and crafts school where he impressed his teachers and received a scholarship, beginning his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich in 1883.Amis du Cercle Saint-L√©onard: Biography and appreciation of Hornecker He made several study trips to Holland, where he was influenced by the Old Masters, and graduated in 1888, after which he returned to Strasbourg. In 1890, the City of Strasbourg hired (of the Munich Academy) to be Director of the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs. As a former alumnus from Munich, Hornecker soon found employment there. He taught drawing and anatomy, but derived little pleasure from teaching and was eventually dismissed. From that point on, he turned his attention to France, rather than Germany and became a member of the \\"Cercle de Saint-L√©onard\\", a group devoted to the promotion of Alsatian culture, founded by Charles Spindler and . By 1894, his commissions had increased to the point where he required a larger workshop and, in 1899, was able to marry. One of his sons, Adrien, became a sculptor of some note. =In Paris= The increasing political tensions in Alsace eventually led him to leave his home in 1906. At first he stayed with friends then, in 1908, moved to Paris. Unfortunately, his work was considered to be a bit old-fashioned there and he attracted few customers. His longing for Alsace was strong. He decorated his studio to resemble an Alsatian inn and frequented taverns where Alsatians congregated. During the First World War, he maintained contact with many notable Alsatian refugees. After the war, he returned to Strasbourg, but a new generation of artists had appeared and he was unable to fit back in. He died at home in 1924. A street in the Elsau district of Strasbourg was named after him in 1969.

SB 535 is largely based on the actions introduced by Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, commonly known as AB 32. AB 32 was passed in 2006 and its goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California. The process outlined by AB 32 resulted in the creation of a cap- and-trade system in California. Companies must purchase extra credits when they exceed their allotted amount for the cap and trade. Each year, the money generated from companies purchasing extra credits is expected to generate about $1 billion of state revenue. SB 535 requires that 25% of the fund is spent on projects that benefit disadvantaged communities, while at least 10% of the 25% is spent on projects located in disadvantaged communities. Cal Enviroscreen is a screening methodology that identifies disadvantaged communities that the funds will be directed into. The money will be spent on projects that have been approved by the Legislature. History De Leon introduced AB 1405, a bill that it very similar to SB 535. It was vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2010, because the Governor stated that ‚Äúfunds have yet to be realized by AB 32.‚Äù SB 535 was introduced by Senator De Leon on February 17, 2011. After the bill's introduction, an analysis that addressed some concerns was posted on April 29, 2011. Initially, opponents of the bill were concerned with the fact that ‚Äúa regulatory fee must have a nexus between fee payers, the fee amount and the revenue use.‚Äù SB 535 does not meet this standard ‚Äúbecause the amount of fee revenue is arbitrary (10% of the total amount raised), the purposes in SB 535 are unrelated to harm caused by the payers, and there is no demonstrated connection between the proposed recipients and harm caused by the payers of the revenues.‚Äù Other opponents noted that it was impossible to know how much money was necessary to meet the requirements of AB 32 of reducing emissions to the 1990 level by the year 2020. If SB 535 was passed, it might be detracting from the original goals of AB 32. After three Committee readings, the bill was passed on to the Assembly on June 2, 2011. After three Assembly readings and amendments, it was passed on to the California Senate. The Senate floor voted on the bill on August 31, 2012. The bill passed with 25 people voting ‚Äúyes,‚Äù 14 voting ‚Äúno,‚Äù and 1 person abstaining. On September 30, 2012 Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill and passed it into law. Implications of environmental justice on SB 535 People who live in communities of color, low-income, and disadvantaged communities face health disparities due to poor air quality. Many of these communities are located near industries and means of transportation that cause a large amount of pollution to affect these areas. There is a greater abundance of harmful particulate matter in air pollution around these non- white and poorer communities than in white and wealthier communities. People who live near refineries are more likely to breathe in nickel and vanadium, and those living near coal power plants are more likely to breathe in contents of high sulfate. Also, those who live near means of transportation such as busy highways are exposed to nitrates from vehicle exhaust. SB 535 is an example of environmental justice because it creates a solution to help these communities that have been affected by health disparities from the high exposures of ‚Äúnot only carbon dioxide, but also soot, methane, carbon monoxide and ozone. Many of these pollutants are associated with cancer, low birth weights, heart attacks, as well as respiratory problems like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.‚Äù In addition, SB 535 guarantees that 10% of the 25% of money collected from the revenue can be directed towards reducing pollution and lessening the harmful health impacts from greenhouse gas emissions. Supporters of the SB 535 bill such as the American Lung Association and Regional Asthma Management and Prevention (RAMP) are making efforts to fight the health disparities that are a result from the polluting air.  Reinvestment of cap-and-trade revenue  = Process = SB 535 falls under the three year reinvestment plan to use the cap and trade auction proceeds to meet the goals of The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, more commonly known as AB 32. The process for redirecting cap and trade auction proceeds follows two steps, which is mainly facilitated by the California Department of Finance. First, a three-year investment plan requires the Department of Finance, California Air Resources Board (ARB) and other state agencies to identify which proceeds from cap and trade programs will be directed towards current greenhouse gas reduction goals, investments for future reductions and allocation of funds to projects located in disadvantaged communities. Second, before the investment plan is submitted to Legislature and Governor, the Department of Finance and the ARB must hold two workshops and a hearing with the Finance and Climate Action Team. In addition, the members of SB 535 Coalition's main committee, Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN), Coalition for Clean Air, the Greenlining Institute, and public advocates which helped co-sign Senator Kevin de Le√≥n's SB 535, have also provided input to which programs can be included in the state's three-year plan for cap-and-trade revenues. The main goals of using the proceeds from the Greenhouse Reduction Fund through the process of this the three-year investment plan is to help disadvantaged communities with projects that will improve their transportation, housing situations, jobs, while moving forward in the reduction of greenhouse gases and energy efficiency. Cap-and-trade SB 535 uses profits from the cap-and-trade policy, which went into effect in California in 2013, to fund projects that are beneficial for disadvantaged communities. The cap-and-trade came about as a way to lessen the environmental impact of companies on the community. The system is relatively simple and easy to put into action. A regulatory agency sets up a cap on the amount of pollutants any one company can put into the environment. Once the amount of allowed pollution is determined, companies can sell these allowances to other companies. The funds collected from the cap-and-trade go into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Studies have indicated that ‚Äúcap and trade has been a principal part of the US Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs efforts to reduce US emissions of sulfur dioxide under the Clean Air Act.‚Äù By placing a cap on the amount of pollutants a company can produce, the system encourages companies to be innovative a look for cleaner production habits. The goal of this system is to reduce a company's harmful impact on the environment and community. Similarly, the goal of SB 535 is to take 25% of the funds from the sale of the allowance credits and invest them into projects aimed at helping disadvantaged communities with a minimum of 10% of the profits being funneled directly into Environmental Justice communities. Some qualities that have contributed to the success of the cap-and-trade are the ease and accuracy of measuring pollutants and the fact that allowances are much less expensive to pay for than the fee for going over the allotted amount of pollution. Additionally, the cap-and-trade is significantly cheaper than other regulatory approaches. On the other hand, some challenges arise when it comes to fulfilling the cap-and-trade's main goal of reducing environmental pollutants. Since there is no nationwide system, some states with less strict regulations will end up emitting more pollutants than states with stricter regulation and some people claim that in the end, the pollution will just be spread differently across the country. Some groups claim that this system isn't very effective in reducing emissions, but it is supported because of the amount of revenue it generates for the state. = Reinvestment options of SB 535= Possible reinvestments options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: *Low carbon transportation and infrastructure *Strategic planning for sustainable infrastructure *Energy efficiency and clean energy *Natural resources and solid waste diversion Possible triple bottom line investments: *Energy efficiency for schools *Urban forestry/green space *Sustainable agricultural practices *Mass transit Example of actual reinvestment plans: *On January 9, 2014, Governor Brown announced that he will direct $50 million from the revenue of cap-and-trade revenue in the 2014-2015 state budget towards \\"urban forestry projects that help meet the state‚Äôs goal of reducing greenhouse gases.\\" SB 535 states that 25% of cap-and-trade proceeds must go towards projects that help disadvantaged communities, and Governor Brown's proposal to fund urban forestry projects is a great example of reinvestment.  Identifying disadvantaged communities  =CalEnviroScreen= The California Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA) is in charge of the identifying disadvantaged communities. In order to facilitate the identification of low- income and highly polluted areas, the state's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) and CEPA have adopted the California Communities Environmental Health Screening Tool, more commonly known as the ‚ÄúCal EnviroScreen.‚Äù The use of Cal EnviroScreen will mainly be for SB 535. The main goal is to accurately locate areas/neighborhoods using pollution ‚Äúscores‚Äù. It is a scientific-based tool on the California Environmental Protection Agency study of 1,769 distinct ZIP code areas that measures environmental, socioeconomic and health indicators such as *Ozone concentrations in air *PM2.5 concentrations in air * Diesel particulate matter emissions * Use of certain high-hazard, high-volatility pesticides *Toxic releases from facilities *Traffic density * Drinking water quality *Toxic cleanup sites * Groundwater threats from leaking underground storage sites and cleanups *Hazardous waste facilities and generators *Impaired water bodies *Solid waste sites and facilities *Children and elderly *Asthma emergency department visits *Low birth-weight infants *Educational attainment *Linguistic isolation *Poverty *Unemployment =Changes to the Cal EnviroScreen= In the past year, with the addition of water quality data, now it is possible to take into consideration the communities that have been affected by groundwater pollution. Also, this new factor can address the issue of the lack of clean drinking water within disadvantaged communities. In addition, now the OEHHA is moving towards identifying areas based on the census tract rather than zipcodes. The problem with recording pollution under the current use of zip codes in such large areas is that it's very difficult to be accurate. A major goal of SB 535 is to make sure that a minimum of 25% of the cap and trade revenue will be distributed to highly impacted communities that face burdens from different types of pollution. As of September 16, 2013 OEHHA has decided that CalEnviroScreen will no longer use race and ethnicity as a factor when identifying disadvantaged communities. Using such factors make it difficult for the government not to be faced with lawsuits, the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the California Civil Rights Initiative, known as proposition 209, when choosing where to invest the funds under sb 535. However, OEHHA's scientists say that Cal EnviroScreen will still be able to identify disadvantaged communities without concerning race or ethnicity because there will be continual research towards connecting population's scores and their racial and ethnic makeup. Advocacy SB 535 was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on September 30, 2012. The co-sponsoring organizations are the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, Coalition for Clean Air, Greenlining Institute, and Public Advocates, and the bill has gained support from a number of groups, including: *Breathe California *California League of Conservation Voters *California Pan-Ethnic Health Network *Catholic Charities *Stockton Diocese *Coalition for Clean Air *Environment California *Environmental Defense Fund *Greenlining Institute *Los Angeles Bicycle Coalition *Natural Resources Defense Council *Sierra Club California *TransForm *The Trust for Public Lands Groups opposing the bill include: *American Council of Engineering Companies *California Building Industry Association *California Chamber of Commerce *California Farm Bureau Federation *California Manufacturers & Technology Association *The California Retailers Association The Coalition for Clean Air has been the main supporter of SB 535. The group has offices in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Fresno, and they have ‚Äúworked to restore clean air to California since 1971.‚Äù The Clean Air Coalition, along with many other groups, wrote a letter to Mary Nichols, the Chairman of the California Air Resources Board on March 8, 2013. In the letter, the coalition wished to ‚Äúexpress support for the CalEnviroScreen as a tool to inform the identification of disadvantaged communities, provide more detail on the use of the overarching and ‚ÄúSB 535 Principles‚Äù that our coalition has developed and previously shared with the Administration, identify the priority AB 32 programs that will effectively serve these communities and legal mandates, and provide additional comments on the implementation considerations.‚Äù The coalition has worked closely with the state to ensure that disadvantaged communities are properly identified and funds are being appropriately used to help these communities have better air quality and less environmental pollutants. Many individual organizations have held workshops and meetings to discuss SB 535 and its implications within California communities such as the Luskin Center at UCLA and the Public Health Alliance of Southern California. Discussion topics range from identifying disadvantages communities to helping the state develop new reinvestment options. Controversy In May 2013, CA Governor Jerry Brown borrowed $500 million of the year‚Äôs cap and trade revenue. The governor intended to use the $500 million, coming from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, to fund the state‚Äôs general expenses. Opponents of Brown‚Äôs decision, such as The Greenlining institute, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups argue that this money should solely go towards programs that were intended to help low-income and disadvantaged communities. Brown said that he would pay back the borrowed money with interest. In early January, Brown proposed to return $100 million of the $500 million borrowed, and added an additional $600 million to his budget of $154.9 billion, that would go towards ‚Äúefficiency retrofits and solar installations for low-income communities, low-carbon transportation, transit-friendly planning and other programs.‚Äù Governor Brown also proposed a plan for a high-speed rail project with a budget of $68.4 billion, a third of the proceeds from the cap and trade revenue, that would provide transportation from San Francisco to Los Angeles by 2028. This project is raising concerns from both environmentalists and lawmakers because they have criticized whether the project would help meet the goal of AB 32 intending to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. Instead, Sierra Club California Director Kathryn Phillips states \\"The best use of the cap-and-trade funds is to invest them in projects that are out there now\\" ‚Äî such as improving energy efficiency ‚Äî \\"that can get us near-term emission reductions.\\" References SB 535 SB 535 Environmental law in the United States ","title":"California Senate Bill 535 (2012)"},{"id":"42527125","text":"Blipta is a genus of moths in the Carposinidae family.

Early life Kate Cocks was born Fanny Kate Boadicea Cocks in Moonta, South Australia. Her father was a miner and her mother was a school teacher. Cocks was home tutored after the family moved to a farm near Quorn further north in the state. Professional life In 1900, Cocks returned to the Yorke Peninsula area to teach at a school in Thomas Plains for a year. After this, Cocks moved to the suburbs of Adelaide to teach at the Edwardstown Industrial School (1898-1949) of Edwardstown, which had opened on the site of the former Girls Reformatory on Naldera Street, Edwardstown. Cocks served as schoolmistress and sub-matron there. In 1903, Cocks joined the State Children's Council, which had been formed in 1886 as part of the Destitute Persons Amendment Act, 1886 as a clerk and in 1906 was appointed the state's first probation officer for juvenile first offenders.Marie Mune, 'Cocks, Fanny Kate Boadicea (1875‚Äì1954)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, , published in hardcopy 1981, accessed online 18 April 2014.

High Definition Earth Viewing (HDEV) cameras were a payload package delivered to the International Space Station on the SpaceX CRS-3 Mission, launched on April 18, 2014. The High-Definition Earth Viewing camera suite was carried aboard the Dragon spacecraft and is configured on a platform on the exterior of the European Space Agency's Columbus laboratory module. It was the first large unpressurized NASA experiment to be assigned for delivery to the International Space Station by SpaceX. The system is composed of four commercial high definition video cameras which were built to record video of the Earth from multiple angles by having them mounted on the International Space Station. The cameras streamed live video of Earth to be viewed online and on NASA TV on the show Earth Views. Previously-recorded video now plays in a continuous loop on public streaming sites. The HDEV system was developed by engineers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. High school students also helped design some of the cameras' components, through the High Schools United with NASA to Create Hardware program, and teams of students were expected to remotely operate the experiment. The system is configured on the Columbus ‚Äì External Payload Facility, which is a platform on the exterior of the European Space Agency's Columbus laboratory module where it was used to perform experiments to help NASA determine which cameras work best in outer space. The cameras are enclosed in a temperature-specific housing and exposed to the harsh radiation of space. The German educational project ‚ÄúColumbus Eye - Live Imagery from the ISS in Schools‚Äù, which is executed by the University of Bonn and is funded by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), aims at the implementation of the ISS live imagery and videos in a web portal. It primarily acts as a learning portal for pupils, but also serves as a free access archive for the footage of the ISS HDEV cameras. Columbus Eye accompanied the ISS mission of the German ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst (May to November 2014). On August 22, 2019, the experiment reached its end of life. Originally expected to operate 1 to 3 years, it continued for over 5 years, attaining over 318 million views. The HDEV system was removed from the Columbus module on May 7, 2020, and transferred into the Cygnus NG-13 resupply spacecraft for disposal via destructive re-entry at the end of its mission.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. It was released theatrically on February 29, 1964. This was the second of three cartoons to use the \\"modern\\" abstract Warner Bros. opening and closing sequences created by Chuck Jones; this sequence was previously used on Now Hear This and would be used once more in Se√±orella and the Glass Huarache. The visual style of the cartoon was done in the art of cartoonist and book illustrator James Grover Thurber, who died in 1961 three years before the cartoon's release. It was also the second of two Looney Tunes cartoons that were released on the leap day of February 29th, the first one being Boom Boom from 1936.  Plot synopsis  The cartoon opens on a picture of a boy, whose offscreen voice reveals himself as the narrator and introduces the audience to his family's puppy, Bartholomew. Because of the way Bartholomew can bark, the boy's father states that Bartholomew might grow up to be a good watchdog (in which Bartholomew demonstrates his barking to a Wild West outlaw on TV). Despite his barking, Bartholomew doesn't bark at cats, especially the family's cat whose bigger size than Bartholomew's allows him to bully Bartholomew by eating up his dog food. Bartholomew is also capable of doing tricks, which impresses the boy and his friends, until the cat steals away Bartholomew's audience by performing tricks of his own. One day, Bartholomew is in the park, sitting and minding his own business by watching a butterfly flying around, when a toddler rides by on a scooter and, without looking where he's going, runs over Bartholomew's tail by accident, making him yelp in pain. After Bartholomew blows on his sore tail, he spies the scooter's wheels and, seeing that the wheels did this to his tail, gets mad enough to shake all over. With that, Bartholomew catches up to the toddler and punishes him for running over his tail by biting and ripping off his scooter's wheels, which makes the toddler start crying, as he doesn't know what he did wrong to deserve it. Bartholomew then digs a hole to bury the wheels, but as he takes the scooter wheels over to the hole, another child's toy train races harmlessly past. Even though its wheels are too small to do any harm to him, Bartholomew now views all wheels as being dangerous to his safety and well being, so he chases after the toy train and rips off its wheels too. Straight after, he buries the wheels in the hole. As the months pass, whenever Bartholomew sees a form of transportation or a child's toy that has wheels, he chases after it and rips off the wheels. While he's still a little puppy, he rips off little wheels from tricycles (as shown from one belonging to a blonde haired girl in a white blue polka dot dress) and bicycles (as shown from one belonging to the newspaper delivery boy), but as he grows up into a big dog, he switches to bigger wheels from cars (one man's car is so small that Bartholomew just takes the whole car without biting off the wheels) and trucks (though when he tries to bite off the wheel from an ACME moving van, he ends up bursting the tire and gets blown back). The only wheels he doesn't dare bite off are the ones from the truck belonging to Mr. Wembley, the town's dog catcher, proving that while Bartholomew doesn't know the true purpose of wheels, he's smart enough to know his boundaries and make exceptions. Out of all the wheels Bartholomew has chased and caught, the only wheels that remain elusive to him are the ones on the landing gears of airplanes. One day, Bartholomew goes down to the airport and catches sight of an airplane about to take off. As the plane taxis to the runway, Bartholomew digs his way in under the fence and chases after the plane's wheel, but just as he gets close enough to try to bite it, the wheel leaves the ground as the plane takes off. Not one to give up, Bartholomew spies another plane getting ready to take off on another runway and chases after its wheels too. This time, Bartholomew succeeds in catching up to the plane's wheels, but just as he bites down on it, the wheel leaves the ground as its too big to rip off and it pulls Bartholomew into the plane's undercarriage as the plane takes off and flies away. Back home, the boy grows worried when Bartholomew doesn't come home for dinner. He calls out Bartholomew's name several times, but Bartholomew doesn't come running back. Despite being upset at Bartholomew for ripping off their wheels, all the town's children and even the grownups join in the search, looking for Bartholomew in his favorite places to go (some children even look in through an old wheelchair bound man's beard). The people even go so far as to attack Mr. Wembley, but Mr. Wembley vouches that, just like everybody else, even he's in the dark as to where Bartholomew could be. Meanwhile, its revealed that the plane that took Bartholomew away was delivering aid packages (possibly Peace Corps ones) to a fictional and unnamed African nation set in the Sahara Desert and has just landed there. As Bartholomew looks at his new surroundings, wondering where he is, one man who is described by the boy as not wearing any clothes (except a turban and short pants) comes up to him and says something in his own language (possibly his way of saying \\"Oooh. Bad dog!\\"). Bartholomew then spies three attractive looking dogs and a dog his size (also wearing a turban) go by and instantly becomes smitten with love to the three dogs, but the turban wearing dog barks fiercely at him, as if to say \\"Back off, commoner. They're mine\\". As Bartholomew wanders around, none of the African nation's people look at him or pet him. Worst of all, because everybody uses elephants and camels for transportation, there aren't any wheels for Bartholomew to chase and bite off (though they use modern traffic lights to control the elephant and camel traffic). One day, after spending several days of wandering, Bartholomew comes back to the airport and looks at a poster advertising trips to the United States of America for some time. As he begins crying and wishing he could go back home, he spies another poster that advertises flights. Remembering the airplane wheel that took him to his predicament, Bartholomew gets the clever idea that if the plane wheel got him into this mess, it could very well get him out of it again, so he excitedly rushes into the airport, knocks over the man he'd met before at the gate, and bites onto the wheel of the next plane going back to America. The man curses at Bartholomew, but softens up when he spies the plane taking off (in his own language, he is probably saying \\"You stupid mongrel! How dare you knock me down! I oughta turn you into bone soup for this! Oooh! Big tin bird.\\"). The next day, Bartholomew arrives back in America and catches a train back to his hometown, where, as it turns out, all the townspeople are waiting for him with open arms, having heard about his homecoming from a soldier returning home from military service (as one man in the crowd is holding up a sign reading \\"Tippecanoe and Bartholomew\\"). With everybody glad to have Bartholomew home again, they pardon him for biting off all their wheels, the mayor gives him a ride in his open topped limousine, and the toddler who started Bartholomew's hatred of wheels apologizes to Bartholomew for accidentally running over his tail. To everybody's surprise, the unexpected trip to Africa has taught Bartholomew that wheels are only good or bad depending on the people who use them and, to show everybody how he's changed his own opinion about wheels, he licks them as proof that he likes them and does it to the limousine's wheels, the toddler's scooter wheels, and the blonde girl's roller-skates' wheels. As it also turns out, Bartholomew also stops hating everything else, except cats, which dogs are supposed to hate. When Bartholomew comes home to have his first meal in days, he sneaks up behind the cat, who's sneaking Bartholomew's dog food as usual, and gives a sharp bark, which makes the cat suddenly jump and, literally, fall to pieces. Bartholomew then gives a cheeky grin as his way of showing that he's the one in charge now. The cartoon's final scene focuses back to the boy's picture and as the boy bids the audience goodbye, his picture smiles as his way of knowing that things will be different with Bartholomew from now on.

This ancient walking or dancing technique typically involves dragging one foot after another, and is explained in reference to the legendary Yu the Great, who became lame on one side of his body from exerting himself while establishing order in the world after the Great Flood. Daoist religions, especially during the Six Dynasties period (220‚Äì589), incorporated Yubu into rituals, such as the Bugang \\"pace the Big Dipper\\", in which a Taoist priest would symbolically walk the nine stars of the Beidou \\"Big Dipper\\" in order to acquire that constellation's supernatural energy. Terminology The term Yubu , defined as boxing \\"limp; walk lame\\" (Hanyu Da Cidian 1993 1.664), compounds two Chinese words. Yu was the legendary founder of the Xia dynasty (c. 2070 BCE-c. 1600 BCE), and worked so long and hard fighting the mythical Great Flood that he became partially paralyzed. Yu was also called Dayu (with \\"big; great\\") or Xiayu (with \\"Xia dynasty\\"). The (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi gives the earliest Chinese dictionary definition of yu : \\"a \\"bug; reptile\\", from the \\"animal trampling tracks\\" radical, a \\"pictograph\\" (). The bronzeware script for depicts a head, legs, and tail. Shuowen commentators interpret this as meaning qu (clarified with the \\"teeth\\" radical) \\"decayed and missing teeth; bad teeth\\". Axel Schuessler (2007:588) reconstructs Old Chinese *wa î \\"insect; reptile\\", and gives an etymology from Proto-Tibeto-Burman *was \\"bee; honey\\" or Mon-Khmer *wak \\"insect\\". Bu means \\" walk; step; stride; tread; pace (off)\\". In this Chinese character , the top element is \\"foot\\" and the bottom was originally Ê≠¢ backwards. Early bronzeware and oracle script characters depicted bu as a \\"left foot\\" and \\"right foot\\". Schuessler (2007:173) reconstructs Old Chinese *b√¢h , which has Sino-Tibetan cognates of Mru pak \\"go; walk\\" and Lushai vaakF / va îL \\"go; walk\\". Thus, two millennia ago, the ancient Chinese pronounced Yubu something like *wa îb√¢h. Yubu \\"Yu steps\\" is related to the words Yuxing \\"Yu walk\\" and Wubu \\"shaman steps\\" (see the Fayan below). The (3rd century BCE) Confucian classic Xunzi (6, tr. Knoblock 1998:229) uses the phrase Yuxing er Shunqu \\"Yu walk and Shun run\\" to mock the Confucian disciples of Zizhang : \\"Their caps bent and twisted, their robes billowing and flowing, they move to and fro as thought they were a Yu or a Shun‚Äîsuch are the base Ru of Zizhang's school.\\" The Korean Buddhist monk and scholar Honggi (1822‚Äì1881) was also known as Yuxing . Yu myths Traditional Luoshu magic square attributed to Yu. Modern numerical Luoshu magic square. Yu the Great is the subject of many mythological stories. Anne Birrell (1993:81) says, \\"The myth of Y√º and the flood is the greatest in the Chinese tradition. This is not just because the narratives tell how he managed to control the flood, but also because numerous myths, legends, and folk tales became attached to his name. In every case, Y√º is depicted as a hero, selflessly working on behalf of humankind, and succeeding in his task.\\" According to early Chinese mythological and historical texts, a Great Flood inundated China during the reign of Emperor Yao (c. 2356 ‚Äì c. 2255 BCE). Yao appointed Yu's father Gun to control the flooding, and he spent nine years constructing dikes and dams, which collapsed and killed many people. After reigning for one century, Yao abdicated the throne to Shun, the last of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, who fired or killed (according to version) Gun and appointed Yu to replace his father. Yu the Great devised a successful flood control system through undamming rivers, dredging riverbeds, and constructing irrigation canals. In fighting the floods for thirteen years, Yu sacrificed his body, resulting in thick calluses on his hands and feet, and partial paralysis. Shun abdicated the throne to Yu, who founded the Xia dynasty. The (c. 3rd century BCE) Daoist classic Zhuangzi quotes philosophical rival Mozi, founder of Mohism, to tell the myth of Yu controlling the flood. > Master Mo declared, \\"Long ago, when Y√º was trying to stem the flood waters, > he cut channels from the Yangtze and the Yellow rivers and opened > communications with the four uncivilized tribes and the nine regions. There > were three hundred famous rivers, three thousand branch rivers, and > countless smaller ones. Y√º personally handled the basket and the shovel, > interconnecting the rivers of all under heaven, till there was no down on > his calves and no hair on his shins. He was bathed by the pouring rains and > combed by the gusting winds as he laid out the myriad states. Y√º was a great > sage, and he wearied his physical form on behalf of all under heaven like > this.\\" (tr. Mair 1994:337) Chinese origin myths have stories about two primordial sage-rulers being divinely inspired by patterns on turtle shells. Fu Xi devised the bagua \\"eight trigrams\\" of the Yijing from seeing the Hotu \\"Yellow River Map\\" on a turtle (or a dragon-horse), and Yu devised the basic magic square from seeing the Luoshu \\"Luo River writing\\" on a giant turtle shell (Pas 1998:294). \\"The Great Treatise\\" commentary to the Yijing has an early reference to the Luoshu. > Heaven creates divine things; the holy sage takes them as models. Heaven and > earth change and transform; the holy sage imitates them. In the heavens hang > images that reveal good fortune and misfortune; the holy sage reproduces > these. The Yellow River brought forth a map and the Lo River brought forth a > writing; the holy men took these as models. (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes > 1967:320) The Yijing sub-commentary (tr. Visser 1913:57) explains, \\"The water of the Ho sent forth a dragon horse; on its back there was curly hair, like a map of starry dots. The water of the Lo sent forth a divine tortoise; on its back there were riven veins, like writing of character pictures.\\" The Luoshu is a 3x3 grid of dots representing the numbers 1-9, with the sum in each of the rows, columns, and diagonals equal to 15 (which is the number of days in each of the 24 solar terms in the traditional Chinese calendar). The Luoshu, also known as the Jiugongtu \\"Nine Halls Diagram\\", is central to Chinese fortune telling and Fengshui. Yu supposedly used the Luoshu to divide ancient China into Nine Provinces; Michael Saso (1972: 59) says the \\"Steps of Yu\\" dance is thought to ritually imitate Yu's lamely walking throughout the Nine Provinces, stopping the floods, and restoring the order and blessing of nature. Andersen describes the symbolic relation between Yubu, Steps of Yu, and legends about Yu. > In Chinese mythology Yu is known first of all as the one who regulated the > waters after the great flood, a fact he accomplished by walking through the > world. His steps provide the exemplary model for the ritual form of Yubu. > The flood may be equated with primordial chaos or, in a more synchronic mode > of thought, the chaos underlying the existing state of order. And the cosmic > order established by Yu may be identified with the societal order instituted > by the emperor in accordance with the patterns of the universe. (1989:21) Thus, one explanation for the Yubu is as a ritual reenactment in imitation of Yu's gait as the lamed flood-hero. An alternative origin myth for the Yu Pace is that Yu himself invented it, inspired by the movements of a divine bird; and, that when Yu assembled the gods together, he used this dance. (Yang, 2005:241) Donald Harper (1999:872) says, \\"Forms of magic related to Yu , the flood hero and legendary founder of Xia, indicate his importance in Warring States magico-religious and occult traditions. Yu's legendary circumambulation and pacification of a world in chaos appear to have made Yu the archetypal pacifier of the spirit world that continued to exist alongside mankind.\\" Classical texts The Chinese classics provide important information about Yubu \\"Paces of Yu\\". =Shizi= The (c. 3rd-4th century CE) Shizi \\"Writings of Master Shi\\", which is attributed to the Syncretist philosopher Shi Jiao (c. 390‚Äì330 BCE) could contain one of the first references to Yubu. The \\"Ruler's Governance\\" chapter says, > Formerly, (when) the Longmen (Mountains) were not yet opened up (for > crossing), and the L√ºliang (Mountains) were not yet tunneled through, the > (Huang) river emerged from high in the Mengmen (Mountains). (It) greatly > overflowed (until it) backed up, (until) there were no hills or mounds (left > unsubmerged), (until even) tall hillocks were destroyed by it: (this was) > called the flood. Yu thereupon dredged the Huang and Jiang rivers, and for > ten years did not (even) glance at his home. (He worked so hard that his) > hands had no nails and (his) lower legs had no hair. (He) contracted a > partial-paralysis sickness, (such that when he) walked (one foot could) not > step past the other, which people (thereafter) called the \\"Pace of Yu\\". [] > Yu had a long neck and a (mouth like a) bird‚Äôs beak, and (his) face was > likewise ugly, (but) the world followed him and considered him a worthy and > enjoyed learning (from him). (tr. Fischer 2012:115) Fischer calls this \\"one of the most famous stories in all of Chinese mythology\\", and notes the \\"'Pace of Yu' would go on to have an important place in early medicine and later Daoist ritual.\\" This descriptive term is Chinese pianku \\"paralyzed on one side, hemiplegia\\". =Fayan= The Exemplary Sayings (Fa yan ) by Yang Xiong mentions Yu (using his surname, Sishi \\"Mr. Si) and the early physician Bian Que (d. 310 BCE) as examples of falsely borrowing names. > In the past, Yu controlled the waters flooding the land, and now shamans > dance the many Steps of Yu. Bian Qiao was a man of Lu, and now many healers > and called men of Lu. Those who want to sell what is fake inevitably borrow > from the genuine. [] (10, tr. Bullock 2011:140-141) Since the original literally reads \\"[wubu ] \\"shaman's steps\\" many Yu\\", an alternate translation (Andersen 1989:16) is: \\"Formerly Sishi (i.e., Yu) regulated the waters and the earth, and the steps of shamans in many cases are those of Yu\\". The French sinologist Marcel Granet (1925:147-151) hypothesized that Yubu dancing, which enabled Daoist priests to achieve a state of trance and become the instrument of a spirit, derived from ancient Wu (shaman) techniques of ecstasy, such as tiaoshen (lit. \\"jump spirit\\") \\"perform a shaman's trance-dance\\". =Baopuzi= Yijing Hexagram 63, Jiji \\"Already Fording\\". Ge Hong's (c. 320 CE) Daoist classic Baopuzi contains some of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of the Paces of Yu, in which \\"each pace comprises three steps, and the movement thus appears like the waddle of a three-legged creature\\" (Andersen 2008:237). The three paces of Yubu were associated with the performer's movement through the three levels of the cosmos, the Santai \\"Three Steps; stars within Ursa Major\\" (Œπ UMa through 61 UMa) in Chinese astronomy, and the Three Steps of Vishnu across earth, air, and heaven in the Rigveda. > The fact that already in the early Han dynasty, the steps seem to have been > connected with the three pairs of stars that are situated under the Northern > Dipper and referred to as the Three Steps (santai ), or the Celestial > Staircase (tianjie ), would seem to support this. It would appear, in other > words, that even in this early period the Paces of Yu constituted a close > parallel to the three Strides Vi·π£·πáu in early Vedic mythology, which are > thought to have taken the god through the three levels of the cosmos > (thereby establishing the universe), and which indeed, just like the Paces > of Yu in Taoist ritual, are known to have been imitated by Vedic priests as > they approached the altar‚Äîand in the same form as the Paces of Yu, that is, > dragging one foot after the other. (Andersen 2008:238-239) The Big Dipper had central importance in Han cosmology, and was seen as the instrument of the emperor of heaven, Taiyi , who resides in the bright, reddish star Kochab (Beta Ursae Minoris) near the pole of heaven. In the so- called \\"apocryphal texts\\" or weishu \\"glosses on the classics that allege esoteric meanings\\", the Big Dipper (Andersen 1989:24) or Shendou \\"Divine Dipper\\" is described as, \\"the throat and tongue of heaven\\", which \\"contains the primordial breath and dispenses it by means of the Dipper\\". The Baopuzi \\"Genie's Pharmacopoeia\\" chapter tells Daoist adepts how to go into the mountains and gather supernatural, invisible shizhi \\"rock mushrooms/excrescences\\". > Whenever excrescences are encountered, an initiating and an exorcising > amulet are placed over them, then they can no longer conceal or transform > themselves. Then patiently await the lucky day on which you will offer a > sacrifice of wine and dried meat, and then pluck them with a prayer on your > lips, always approaching from the east using Y√º's Pace and with your vital > breaths well retained. (tr. Ware 1966:179-180) > Y√º' s Pace: Advance left foot, then pass it with the right. Bring the left > up to the right foot. Advance right foot, then pass it with the left. Bring > the right up to the left foot. Advance left foot, then pass it with the > right. Bring the left up to the right foot. In this way three paces are > made, a total of 21 linear feet, and nine footprints will be made. (11, tr. > Ware 1966:198) The \\"Into Mountains: Over Streams\\" chapter describes Yubu as an element in the Daoist astrological celestial stem-based \\"magic invisibility\\" system of Qimen Dunjia \\"Irregular Gate, Hidden Stem\\". The Dunjia \\"Hidden Stem\\" calculates the position within the space-time structure of the liuding (\\"six ding\\") \\"spirits that define the place of the Qimen \\"Irregular Gate\\". Andersen (2008:239) says, \\"This gate represents a \\"crack in the universe,\\" so to speak, which must be approached through performing the Paces of Yu, and through which the adept may enter the emptiness of the otherworld and thereby achieve invisibility to evil spirits and dangerous influences.\\" > \\"When entering a famous mountain in search of the divine process leading to > geniehood, choose one of the six kuei [] days and hours, also known as > Heaven-public Days, and you will be sure to become a genie.\\" Again, \\"On the > way to the mountains or forests you must take some superior ch'ing-lung [] > grass in your left hand, break it and place half under feng-hsing [].

Ware 1966:285-286) This Yijing Hexagram 63, Jiji \\"Already Fording\\" is composed of the trigrams li (‚ò≤) Fire and kan (‚òµ) Water. =Da Dai Liji= The (c. 2nd century CE) Da Dai Liji version of the Yu legend uses a synonym of bu \\"step; pace; walk\\": l√º \\"step/tread on; shoes; follow\\" (also Yijing Hexagram 10 \\"Treading\\"). > He was the grandson of Gaoyang and the son of Gun . His name was Wenming . > He was generous and capable of helping; his virtue was unfailing. Attractive > in his humanity and reliable in speech, his voice created the standards of > sound and his body those of measure. He was praised as a superior person. > Indefatigable and reverent he laid down the basic principles (gang and ji ). > He inspected the nine provinces and opened up the nine roads.

He made use of shield and spear in > order to punish the insubordinate and reckless. Within the four seas, > wherever boat or cart could reach, all submitted and gave allegiance to him. > (62, tr. Andersen 1989:21-22) This context similarly says Yu's grandfather Gaoyang or Zhuanxu, \\"walked [the patterns of] time in order to resemble (i.e., be in accordance with) heaven .\\" In the ideology of the Da Dai liji, which agrees with other ritual classics of the period such as the Liji, Poul Andersen (1989:22) explains, \\"the walk through the world done by Yu, as well as by other model emperors, is symbolic of the orderly movement of time. It is at the same time a transfer of the patterns of heaven ‚Äî the movements of the celestial bodies and various divine forces ‚Äî to earth, as expressed in one of the standard phrases about the mythical emperors, \\"He carried heaven on his head and walked the earth,\\" daitian l√ºdi .\\" =Cantong qi= The (c. 2nd century) Cantong qi neidan \\"internal alchemy\\" classic, which is attributed to Wei Boyang, gives the earliest recorded criticism of yubu or bugang. The Cantong qi section on \\"Incorrect practices\\" (tr. Pregadio 2001:7) warns against improper or unproductive Daoist techniques, including performing budouxiu \\"pace the Dipper asterism\\" and liujia: \\"treading the Dipper and pacing the asterisms, using the six jia as markers of time\\" (). Excavated texts The discovery of medical and divinatory books in late Warring States period tomb libraries has confirmed the (c. 320 CE) Baopuzi description of Yubu as a series of three steps. Recent archaeology brought to light manuscripts, written on bamboo and silk, documenting early Yubu practices: the (c. 217 BCE) Rishu and (c. 168 BCE) Wushi'er Bingfang. A third text, the (c. 300 BCE) Chu Silk Manuscript, describes the Great Flood survivors (but not Yu) bu \\"stepping\\" to calculate time. The Chinese term zhubo (lit. \\"bamboo silk\\") means \\"bamboo (slips) and silk (for writing); ancient books\\". These excavated tomb texts help to confirm Marcel Granet's proposal that Daoist Yubu went back to ancient shamanistic traditions. > Granet pointed to accounts of Yu's lameness in Warring States philosophical > texts as indirect evidence of an original shamanic trance-inducing limp like > the one described in the Baopuzi. Occurrences of the Pace of Yu in both the > Shuihudi and Fangmatan almanacs concern travel, but the Pace of Yu is > employed seven times in the Mawangdui Wushier bingfong as part of the > magical strategy for exorcising demons blamed for ailments. Granet is surely > correct about its shamanic origins. However, the excavated manuscripts show > that in the third century B.C., the Pace of Yu had already become part of > the fund of magico-religious knowledge regularly employed by the elite. It > was probably in this more popular milieu that the Pace of Yu found its way > into religious Daoism. (Harper 1999:873) =Rishu= The Rishu \\"Day Book\\" almanac or hemerology is one of the Shuihudi Qin bamboo texts recovered in 1975 in Shuihudi, Hubei, from a tomb dated 217 BCE. Donald Harper (1999:843) believes that for describing texts like the Rishu , which determine lucky and unlucky days on sexagenary cycle numerology without reference to astrology, \\"hemerology\\" is a more accurate translation than \\"almanac\\" (typically meaning an annual publication for a single calendar year). The Rishu has one occurrence of Yubu san , \\"'Steps of Yu, three times\\", and one of Yubu sanmian , \\"Steps of Yu, three exertions\\". This is consistent with the Baopuzi descriptions of Yubu in terms of sanbu \\"three steps\\" and jiuji , \\"nine footprints/traces,\\" where each \\"step\\" was composed of three separate steps. Andersen (1989:17) notes that the term Sanbu jiuji was later used synonymously with Yubu. Yu is closely associated with travel in the Rishu (Harper 1999:872). The section titled \\"Yu xuyu\\" \\"Promptuary/Instant of Yu\\" begins by listing the stem and branch sexagenary cycle in five groups of twelve signs each, and gives, for the days in each group, a certain lucky time of day to safely begin a journey. This section concludes with a ritual to be performed before going out of the city gate. > When traveling, on reaching the threshold-bar of the capital gate, perform > the Pace of Yu thrice. Advance one pace. Call out, \\"K«ùgw [gao \\"name of the > spirit being addressed\\"], I dare make a declaration. Let so-and-so [to be > filled in with the name of the traveler] travel and not suffer odium; he > first acts as Yu to clear the road.\\" Immediately draw five lines on the > ground. Pick up the soil from the center of the lines and put it in your > bosom. (tr. Harper 1999:873) Isabelle Robinet (1997:39) says this text lets us reconstruct the connection between \\"exorcistic practices intended to ward off harmful demons, and therapeutic practices intended to ensure good hygiene and good physical balance\\", in other words, \\"the evolution of exorcism toward medicine, a shift from conceiving sickness as caused by demons to seeing sickness as the result of an imbalance\\". =Wushi'er Bingfang= The Wushi'er Bingfang \\"Remedies for 52 Ailments\\" is an early medical text written on silk scrolls unearthed in 1974 from No Tomb 3 (dated 168 BCE) in Mawangdui Han tombs site, Hunan. It has seven occurrences of the descriptive phrase Yubu san , \\"'Steps of Yu, three times\\", which is also seen above in the Rishu. Andersen (1989:17) describes the cures contained in the Wushi'er bingfang to \\"comprise various elements, such as the preparation of medicines, the waving of twigs, the spewing of purifying water, and the pronouncing of incantations. The last two elements are often combined with Yubu and in many cases constitute the concluding part of the cure.\\" =Chu Silk Manuscript= The Chu Silk Manuscript, which is an ancient Chinese astrological and astronomical text from the southern state of Chu, was discovered by grave robbers in a (ca. 300 BCE) Warring States period tomb east of Changsha, Hunan Province. Although this text does not mention Yubu, the \\"Seasons\\" section records a deluge myth about the siblings Fu Xi and N√ºwa being the only survivors of the Great Flood and their children bu \\"stepping\\" to calculate time and seasons. > Long, long ago, Bao Xi of [‚Ä¶] came from [‚Ä¶] and lived in [‚Ä¶]. His [‚Ä¶] was > [‚Ä¶] and [‚Ä¶] woman. It was confusing and dark, without [‚Ä¶], [‚Ä¶] water [‚Ä¶] > wind and rain were thus obstructed. He then married Zuwei [‚Ä¶]'s > granddaughter, named N√º Tian. She gave birth to four [‚Ä¶ (children)] who then > helped put things in motion making the transformations arrive according (to > Heaven's plan). Relinquishing (this) duty, they then rested and acted (in > turn) controlling the sidewalls (of the calendrical plan); they helped > calculate time by steps. The separated (heaven) above and (earth) below. > Since the mountains were out of order, they then named the mountains, > rivers, and Four Seas. They arranged (themselves) by [‚Ä¶] hot and cold qi. In > order to cross mountains, rivers and streams (of various types) when there > was as yet no sun or moon (for a guide), when the people traveled across > mountains and rivers, the four gods stepped in succession to indicate the > year; these are the four seasons. (tr. Li and Cook 1999:174) Present day In contemporary Daoist liturgical rituals, Yubu is commonly seen in bugang performances where the priest paces as a symbolic microcosm of Yu bringing order to the earth (Sailey 1978:342). Edward Schafer (1977:283-9, quoted by Pas 1998:294) explained the \\"step of Y√º\\" as representing a walk among symbolic stars that injects supernatural energy into the practitioner. By pacing the nine stars of the Dipper, the Daoist priest is able to summon the polar deity Taiyi \\"Grand Monad (from which all things sprang)\\" to receive its power for blessing the community. The Daoist Lingbao School performed early and theatrical versions of the Yubu. > It takes place on several levels that are, in reality, only one: a microcosm > consisting of the sacred area; the macrocosm represented by the trigrams; > and the sky, especially the stars of the Dipper. What the participants in > the ceremony see is the movements of the priest. He moves to and fro, > advancing, twisting, and turning as he dances the Step of Yu; he brandishes > the sword that fends off demons; and he moves his fingers to follow the > pattern of his feet and imitate their pacing on the Dipper. He is surrounded > by acolytes who burn incense, chant the text, and play musical instruments. > (Robinet 1997:174) Many present-day manuals of Chinese divination contain a whole section describing variants of Yubu and bugang (Andersen 2008:239). While the modern emphasis is on divination for the purpose of achieving individual immortality and ascending to heaven, this tradition originated in early Shangqing School texts where the divination was to obtain safety through methods of invisibility.

Further, in the year after becoming stars, the recommendations of WSJ stars are significantly worse than those of nonstars; and the recommendations and earnings forecasts of I/I stars, as well as the earnings forecasts of WSJ stars, are not significantly different from those of nonstars.

Together with her spouse, the acrobat Peter Price (1761-1790), she founded the first circus in Stockholm, Sweden and Scandinavia, and as such has an important place in the history of the circus in Sweden and Scandinavia. Alongside Antonio Bartolomeo Spinacuta, Price are counted as one of two of all of the foreign artists during the Gustavian age who made a lasting effect on the cultural development in Sweden. Life Rosalia Masson was married to her colleague Peter Price from London, with whom she had three children. Together with her brother-in-law James Price (1761-1805), they founded a circus company, where they mainly performed with acrobats and pantomime artists by horse. After having applied for a permission to perform in Denmark without success, they were granted such a permission for Sweden, and in October 1787, they founded a circus in Stockholm. Though an individual horse acrobat, Jacob Bates, had performed in Stockholm in 1770, the Price circus was the first circus company in Sweden, and thereby the introduction of the circus in Scandinavia: her brother-in-law James and his spouse Hanne Tott was to introduce the circus in Denmark and Norway in the 1790s. The Price circus were successful in Stockholm, where Rosalia was apparently the main attraction as she was frequently mentioned first when the circus was mentioned; she focused on acrobatics on horse while Peter Price acted in pantomime and displayed his strength. They also toured the Swedish countryside. At an incident at Comediehuset in Gothenburg, Rosalia Price threatened the audience with a whip and a gun when they expressed displeasure, which turned a fiasco to a success. The Price Circus left Sweden in 1790: Peter Price apparently died the same year, as Rosalia Price remarried the horse acrobat Christoph de Bach the same year and followed him to Vienna.

The other Wilmington in Kent is a populous parish, near Dartford. Initial grant and extent In the year 700 C.E. Wihtred, King of Kent, granted four ploughlands to the Church of St. Mary at Lyminge. A copy of the charter was produced in the early eighth century. Both versions carry endorsements or alterations from the ninth century to accommodate changes to the placename. In 700, the lands were described as Pleghelmestun, 'the t√πn of Pleghelm', consisting of four ploughlands, between the three boundaries of Bereueg, Meguines paeth and Stretleg, said to be well- known at the time. Their position has been suggested by Gordon Ward.Ward, G. (1936) 'The Wilmington Charter of A.D. 700', Archaeologia Cantiana, vol.8, pp.11-28. This original, longer charter also included a grant of lands for the grazing of 300 sheep at Rumining seta, in Romney Marsh.

This remote marshland holding was argued by Gordon Ward to be Sellindge in the Marsh, latterly part of the parish of Dymchurch. Endorsements to the first charter One ninth-century hand has added the words daes landes boc aet berwicum or 'the land-book (charter granting land) at Berwick', Berwick being the name of the neighbouring estate to the east. A separate scribe of the same period has endorsed the charter, nunc wigelmignctun, or 'now Wighelm's tun'. Thus by the ninth century, the estate had gained its new name, Wi(g)lmington.Sawyer, P.H. (1978) From Roman Britain to Norman England, New York: St. Martin's Press. The second charter This copy of the grant is similarly modified by a ninth-century scribe. Here, the first two letters of Pleghelmestun, are crossed out and are replaced with the period's alternative spelling to 'Wi', qi, giving rise to Wieghelmestun, or 'the tun of Wieghelm', showing an attempt to tie the earlier name with its later version. Lord or Lady of Wilmington Lord of Wilmington or Lady of Wilmington is an alternative form of Lord of the Manor of Wilmington or Lady of the Manor of Wilmington and is the style borne by the holder of the lordship of the manor. Two old manors were held of Sellindge manor: *Wilmington which lost its physical counterpart (appurtenances) when it came into the same ownership as the manor of Sellindge itself *Somerfield likewise, except identifiable with Somerfield Court Farm. After personal merger, conveyances continued to record the transfer of the manors distinctly, and separate Courts Baron were held for each. As at April 2014, the lordship of the manor of Wilmington is held by Mark Lindley-Highfield of Ballumbie Castle, who became lord of this manor on 23rd November 2011.

The temple was built during the Pallava reign and was repaired and rebuilt during the Chola reign. The temple complex consists of a main temple complex and a tank, and is 2 kilometers towards the east from Guru Nanak College on the Velachery main road. This temple is administered by the HR & CE Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.  Mythology The Temple traces its mythology to that of Lord Yama (God of Death) who is said to have installed this Lingam and prayed to Lord Shiva for forgiveness and restoration of his strength after he was kicked on his chest by Lord Shiva in Thirukadavur at the behest of saving the life of Sage Markandeya. Lord Yama having lost his strength is said to have created a Tank (Yama Theertham) and installed this Lingam and had fervently prayed to Lord Shiva for forgiveness and restoration of his strength so that he can carry out his duties in full measure. Pleased by his prayers Lord Shiva is said to have granted a Staff (Dhandam) to Lord Yama in this place and restored his strength and hence the name Dandeeswarar - or bestower of mythical staff. The Lords Consort is Goddess Karunambika (Merciful Mother). The other important incident associated here is that the 4 Vedas came and prayed to this Lord and regained their strength after they were taken by Hiranyaksha and were kept immersed in Sea before being rescued by Lord Vishnu in Matsya avatar. Thus this place is an apt one for any one wishing to regain their lost strength and vitality. The name Velachery is said to be corruption of Veda Shreni (Place of Vedas).  The Temple The Temple sports a 5 Tier Vimana and has separate shrines for Ganapati, Subrahmanya and Shasta as well. We can find the idols of Lord Surya and many other deities including 63 Nayanmars. The Temple however, has been badly maintained in the past as one can see broken pillars and remnants of carvings spewed around. The Pillars have Tamil and Devnagri etchings. The Temple has however seen good patronage in the recent times after Velachery has become an active suburb. It is said that the rays of the Sun would fall on the Lingam on the exact date of Tamil New Year and this is not happening now as High rises have been built around the Temple. The Temple poojas starts from about 6.30 am and go on up to 11.30 am and is open again from 4 pm to 8.30 pm daily.

Biography He began his journalism career in the mid-1970s at Duga, a bi-weekly magazine re- launched a few years earlier in the early 1970s in Belgrade, SR Serbia. He made his name via interviews with Yugoslav dissidents, such as Franjo Tuƒëman whom he interviewed in 1981. His articles were controversial and in some cases led to terminations of his editors and supervisors. Throughout the 1980s, Mariƒá was able to secure interviews with a number of aging Yugoslav communists ‚Äî a basis for his 1987 book Deca komunizma (\\"Children of Communism\\"). Vladimir Dedijer was his mentor during the time (1979‚Äì1986) he wrote this book. The book was a considerable commercial and critical success, and he soon got an invitation for professional training at Yale, Harvard and Princeton. In the early 1990s, he returned to Belgrade and his old magazine Duga where he was appointed editor-in-chief. Although the magazine was ostensibly critical of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, it also published a monthly column written by Milo≈°eviƒá's wife Mira Markoviƒá, which was often ridiculed for its poetic naivety. During this time, Duga journalist Dada Vujasinoviƒá died from a gunshot under suspicious circumstances (the death is officially described as suicide). Later in the 1990s, Mariƒá was sacked from Duga, leading to a period during which he worked for and edited several publications, including most notably Profil, which he launched himself. In 2001, he became a director at Bogoljub Kariƒá's BK TV. His involvement with BKTV ended during the mid-2000s after the network lost its national broadcasting license.

It provided consumer and business banking services to communities throughout Florida. With roots tracing back to 1923, the legacy Florida Community Bank was the first bank established in Collier County. In January 2010, Florida Community Bank was purchased by Bond Street Holdings Inc, a Weston-based holding company with over $740 million in capital. The acquisition allowed the new Florida Community Bank to leverage its name and presence throughout the state of Florida. Through acquisitions of failed banks, and organic growth, Florida Community Bank continued to expand its branch network and serviced three of the top four largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) in Florida; Orlando, Miami and West Palm Beach. Reaching $9 billion in assets, Florida Community Bank had grown to become the fourth-largest independent Florida-based bank with 54 banking centers. In addition to the purchase of Florida Community Bank, Bond Street Holdings also acquired eight additional Florida-based banks which include Premier American Bank, Peninsula Bank, Sunshine State Community Bank, First National Bank of Central Florida, Cortez Community Bank, Coastal Bank, First Peoples Bank, and Great Florida Bank.FCB Bank - Our History January 2019 Florida Community Bank was acquired by Synovus Financial. History In late 2009, Bond Street Holdings Inc. raised $440 million through a private placement and made its first two acquisitions in January 2010: Premier American Bank, based in Miami, and Florida Community Bank in Immokalee. That year, the holding company raised an additional $300 million through a second private placement, with about 50 percent of which came from existing shareholders. The bank's third acquisition came in June 2010: Peninsula Bank, based in Englewood. Then, Sunshine State Community Bank, based in Port Orange, in February 2011; and both First National Bank of Central Florida, based in Winter Park and Cortez Community Bank, based in Brooksville, in April 2011. They were followed by Coastal Bank, based in Cocoa Beach, in May 2011 and First Peoples Bank, based in Port St. Lucie, in July 2011. That month, the bank re-branded itself from Premier American Bank to Florida Community Bank. The name had a rich history as the state's oldest bank, founded in 1923. It also had the largest share of households at that time, 25,000, which allowed for less disruption for customers. During 2012, the bank moved its headquarters to Weston, Florida and focused on integration and organic growth. Early in 2013, the Bank unsuccessfully attempted to acquire Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and its banking subsidiary, Atlantic Coast Bank, as the deal was voted down by Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation's shareholders in June 2013.

It is long. The stream flows through Cooper Township, Mahoning Township, and Danville. Its only named tributary is Blizzards Run. A. Joseph Armstrong described Sechler Run in Danville as \\"on the whole uninviting\\" in his book Trout Unlimited's Guide to Pennsylvania Limestone Streams. Course Another view of Sechler Run Sechler Run begins in Cooper Township, near the community of Ridgeville. It flows west and slightly south and leaves Cooper Township after a short distance. Upon leaving Cooper Township, the stream enters Mahoning Township and continues flowing southwest, crossing under U.S. Route 11. It then turns northwest, crossing U.S. Route 11 again, and turns west, entering Danville after some distance. In Danville, the stream crosses U.S. Route 11 again and then crosses Pennsylvania Route 54. It reaches its confluence with Mahoning Creek shortly afterwards. =Tributaries= Blizzards Run is the only named tributary of Sechler Run. It is long. It flows under two railroads in Danville and reaches its confluence with Sechler Run near where the Danville Structural Tubing Company's plant stood in the early 1900s. Geography, geology, and hydrology Channelized Sechler Run in Danville The elevation of Sechler Run at its mouth is above sea level. The stream is channelized in Danville, sometimes with concrete. The water temperature on the stream in this location is warm, but the waters are cooler in the upper reaches of it. Rock formations in the southernmost reaches of the watershed of Sechler Run include the Trimmers Rock Formation and the Hamilton Group. Further north in the watershed are the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation undivided, the Wills Creek Formation, the Onondaga/Old Port Formation, and the Keyser and Tonoloway Formation Undivided. The Clinton Group is found yet further north in the watershed. Most of the soil in the watershed belongs to the Berks-Weikert- Beddington soil series. However, the lower reaches of the watershed have the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil series. Sechler Run is narrower in its upper reaches than it is in its lower reaches. The width of the stream is less than . There are a number of entities classified as \\"disturbances\\" on Sechler Run. 34.22 percent are erosion sites, 26.78 percent are deposition bars, and 18.72 percent are pipes. 8.73 percent of the disturbances are riprap, 7.11 percent are tributaries, and 1 percent are concrete walls. Sechler Run experiences siltation. The headwaters and lower reaches of the stream are considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired. Mulberry Street in Danville can be affected by Sechler Run when it floods. The speed of the floodwaters can be as high as to per second. Backwater from the Susquehanna River can also flood the stream. Watershed The watershed of Sechler Run has an area of 7.6 square miles. Most of the land in the watershed is agricultural land. However, there is forested land in the southern part of the watershed and developed land in the eastern part of the watershed. There are of streams in the watershed. Sechler Run is located between the tracks of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and the former Pennsylvania Canal. History Historically, the Danville Stove and Manufacturing Company was located near Sechler Run. The Hanover Brewing Company was located in the Blizzards Run sub-watershed, east of Danville. In the early 1900s, eight residencies on Church Street in Danville discharged water from their water closets into the stream. Historically, the stream was one border of Danville. The waters of Sechler Run are sometimes diverted to a pumping station and then sent into Mahoning Creek. This pumping station was built in 1988. The state of Pennsylvania has a flood protection project on Sechler Run. Biology Sechler Run has a relatively high level of plant and animal biodiversity, especially considering that it is in an urban area. Dragonfly larvae and crayfish have been observed in Sechler Run. This indicates relatively high water quality. However, the lower reaches of the stream do not contain many habitats for fish and none are found in this part of the stream. Numerous chubs inhabit holding water in the upper reaches of Sechler Run, as do smaller numbers of smallmouths. In 1916, 300 rainbow trout were distributed in Sechler Run. Eight species of birds live in the vicinity of Sechler Run. These species are broad-winged hawk, northern flicker, red-winged blackbird, American goldfinch, eastern phoebe, song sparrow, gray catbird, and house wren. Elodea plants inhabit the lower reaches of Sechler Run in Danville. There is a small shrub swamp on the stream. There are also areas of mesic woods in places on the stream. There are 14 species of trees in the watershed, including boxelder, hemlock, black gum, three species of maples, and others. There are five species of shrubs on the stream: Japanese barberry, witch-hazel, staghorn sumac, multiflora rose, and common blackberry. There are also 15 species of herbs on the stream.

She first appeared in the fifteenth series episode \\"Push the Button (Part 2)\\", broadcast on 22 January 2013. Gemma was introduced as an F1 doctor, but she eventually progressed to an F2 during her time in the show. Gemma was introduced along with fellow F1 Arthur Digby (Rob Ostlere). Glaser's casting was announced in October 2012. To help her prepare for the role of Gemma, Glaser visited Whipps Cross University Hospital where she shadowed a surgical team and worked with F1s. Gemma was portrayed as being impulsive, driven, confident and focused on being a good doctor. Glaser also called Gemma ambitious and said wanted to be respected, regardless of her background. During her time in Holby City, Gemma struggled to balance her job as a doctor with motherhood, she was held hostage, had her career placed in jeopardy by another doctor and had a love-hate relationship with Harry Tressler (Jules Knight). Gemma also had to deal with the revelation of her \\"raunchy\\" alter-ego Dr. Honey, who was face of an online problem page. Gemma departed in the sixteenth series episode \\"Father's Day\\", which aired on 17 December 2013. Casting On 24 October 2012, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy confirmed actress Ty Glaser had joined the cast of Holby City as new regular doctor Gemma Wilde. Glaser had already begun filming at the show's studio in Borehamwood and her character made her first screen appearance on 22 January 2013. Glaser explained that she was in town when she learned she had won the role of Gemma. To help prepare for the role, Glaser visited Whipps Cross University Hospital with fellow cast member Rob Ostlere and they watched surgery being performed on a man with stomach cancer. They also shadowed a surgical team and worked with some F1 doctors, a registrar and a consultant. Development =Characterisation= A BBC Online writer described Gemma as being \\"rash and impulsive\\". While Glaser said she was driven, \\"smart and quick and committed\\". Glaser liked that Gemma was good with her patients and that she was confident and focused on being a good doctor. She also thought Gemma's flaws were assuming that everyone was against her and jumping to conclusions. Glaser said she was not competitive as Gemma, but they were both ambitious and wanted to be respected despite their backgrounds. Glaser thought that Gemma's style was similar to her own casual style, saying that she often wore skinny jeans and T-shirts from British retailers Topshop and AllSaints. Glaser also loved wearing Gemma's scrubs, which she described as being \\"so comfortable\\" and said that was useful while she was filming for long periods of time. Gemma is a single mother to Finn (Finley Barrett). Glaser explained that Gemma and her mother have a deal where she looks after Finn, while Gemma is at the hospital. The actress called it \\"a hardcore set up\\" and said Gemma was often pulled in different directions. She continued, \\"She wants to provide a better life for her son and to set a good example, working and achieving. She wants to prove to herself and her family she can do both.\\" The BBC Online writer noted that Gemma was determined to be a good doctor and a good mother to Finn. Gemma's situation saw her juggling both her career and motherhood, but she often refused offers of help from others. When asked what viewers could look forward to with Gemma, Glaser replied \\"I think you will see her grow up a bit and have to deal with some pretty tricky situations. She‚Äôs a tough one though, she'll fight her way through.\\" =Career at Holby= Gemma joined Holby City Hospital as an F1 doctor, along with Arthur Digby (Ostlere). Gemma was assigned to AAU under the watch of Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon). It was not long before Gemma was recognised by a patient as her internet alter ego Dr. Honey. Glaser told Melanie Hancill from The People that it was something Gemma did when she was younger and in financial trouble. The actress continued, \\"She was a single mum who could do with a bit of extra cash coming in and she was offered a lot of money to be the face of an online problem page. She didn't realise quite what was expected of her ‚Äì a revealing photoshoot!\\" While Gemma did not want anything more to do with her alter ego, it was difficult to get away from because it remained on the internet. Glaser thought that Gemma felt undermined by the whole thing and she was worried that her colleagues would judge her for her past. While Gemma competed with Arthur for the same position within the hospital, she also competed with her friend Mary-Claire Carter (Niamh McGrady) for Harry Tressler's (Jules Knight) affections. McGrady believed there would be \\"some friction\\" between Gemma and Mary-Claire, but said they had a good working relationship. Not long after arriving at Holby, Gemma was involved in a hostage situation. She and a female patient named Kelly (Alexia Healy) were confronted by Kelly's estranged husband Dean Delaney (Dean Ashton), who barricaded himself in a room with them. Dean was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and was convinced the hospital was under attack. Gemma found herself in a \\"terrifying position\\" and when Kelly's condition deteriorated, Gemma had to act fast to save her. Gemma's career was placed in jeopardy when Oliver Valentine (James Anderson) lied about his mistreatment of a patient. Harry tried to stand up for Gemma and take control of the situation. Glaser asserted that Gemma wanted to sort things out by herself because Harry did not know what exactly had happened with the patient. Glaser also thought Gemma would be annoyed to learn that Harry had stepped in to try to defend her. Oliver later admitted that he was to blame for putting the patient's life at risk and cleared Gemma's name. Glaser told Inside Soap's Katy Moon that Gemma had had a bad time and nothing had come easy to her, so she was delighted when Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell) informed her that she would be allowed to progress to the next level of her career. Glaser expressed her surprise that Gemma still wanted to be a doctor after all that had happened to her. =Relationship with Harry Tressler= When asked if there were plans to give Gemma a love interest, Glaser mentioned new character, Harry Tressler (Knight), who was about to be introduced and said he had \\"a twinkle in his eye\\". However, the actress was unaware if something was going to happen between Gemma and Harry. She continued, \\"I don't know whether for his character it means anything as it does to Gemma. And if she keeps to herself, workwise I don't know if she has enough time. Casual relationships are not really her thing!\\" Glaser thought a relationship would be fun to portray and that it would show a new side to Gemma. Gemma initially mistook Harry for a psychiatric consultant, but he later impressed her when he solved a puzzling case. Knight described Gemma and Harry's relationship as \\"love- hate\\" with a lot of game playing. Gemma and Harry later shared a kiss, but Glaser reckoned that romance was the last thing on Gemma's mind. She also called Harry \\"a bit of a player\\" and did not think Gemma would enter into a relationship unless she was sure about it, as she had her career and her son to think about. Glaser also stated that the kiss with Harry was \\"a silly thing to do in hindsight\\", especially when he did not seem interested in her afterwards. =Departure= On 28 August 2013, it was announced that Glaser would be leaving Holby City later that year, along with several other actors. In a statement, Glaser said \\"I've had such a wonderful time working on Holby, the cast and crew have all been exceptional, a joy to work with. I'm beyond excited about future projects ahead of me but will always remember Holby as a fantastic year in my career.\\" Executive producer Oliver Kent praised the actors and their \\"unforgettable characters\\". Gemma departed during the sixteenth series episode \\"Father's Day\\", which aired on 17 December 2013. Reception A Daily Star reporter called Gemma's alter-ego, Dr. Honey, \\"raunchy\\". They also thought Gemma found her past career difficult \\"to consign to history\\". Jane Simon, writing for the Daily Mirror, noted that Gemma was humiliated about her \\"saucy past as Dr Honey\\". A BBC Media Centre writer branded Gemma \\"feisty\\". Katy Moon from Inside Soap observed that \\"sparks fly\\" between Gemma and Harry. Simon (Daily Mirror) was devastated to learn that Gemma and three others would be leaving Holby City. She was worried when she saw Gemma in bomb disposal gear, but quipped \\"Don't worry ‚Äì they're not planning a mass exodus.

On 24 November 1794, he was married to V√©ronique Petit-√âtienne, a Huron, and they had nine children. On 22 January 1821, he was remarried to Madeleine, a Malecite who was the widow of Pierre-Jacques Thomas of Penobscot. In 1803, he was named War Chief. By 1810, he became Grand Chief. For the next three decades, he actively tried to reclaim and secure Huron lands from colonizers and loggers operating within the borders of the Huron- Wendat. This effort that eventually took him to England in 1825, alongside the Council Chiefs, Andr√© Romain (Tsohahissen) and Stanislas Koska (Aharathanha), and the War Chief, Michel Tsiewei (T√©hatsiendah√©). They had several conversations with various members of Parliament including the colonial secretary, Lord Bathurst. On 8 April 1825, King George IV received the four Huron chiefs. The London Times reported the exchange between the Huron grand chief and the British sovereign, who had bestowed medals bearing his likeness to the four. In French, Vincent addressed the sovereign: After the speech, King George IV promised that he would take every occasion to enhance their well-being, ensure their happiness, and show himself to be truly a father. He then conversed with them in French for more than a quarter of an hour. A few years later, Nicolas Vincent was the first Native to speak to the members of the Assembly of Lower Canada. In 1829, at the request of colonial authorities, he drew the map known as the 'Vincent Plan' which identified the hunting lands used by the Hurons. He died on 31 October 1844 in Jeune-Lorette.

In April 2014, Wadewitz died from head injuries from a fall while rock climbing. Early life The only child of Betty M., a nurse and attorney, and Nathan R. Wadewitz, a Lutheran pastor, Adrianne Wadewitz was born on January 6, 1977, in Omaha, Nebraska. She graduated from North Platte High School in 1995. Wadewitz studied English literature and received a degree in English from Columbia University in 1999. In 2011, she obtained a Ph.D. from Indiana University and became a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Digital Learning and Research at Occidental College. She was chosen as a Mellon Digital Scholarship Postdoctoral Fellow and a HASTAC scholar. Academic career Editing Wikipedia featuring Wadewitz as the face of Wikipedia =Education= Wadewitz graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University, and later received her masters and doctoral degrees in British literature with a minor in 18th- century studies from Indiana University. She completed both a master's thesis, Doubting Thomas': The Failure of Religious Appropriation in The Age of Reason (2003), and her doctoral dissertation, 'Spare the Sympathy, Spoil the Child:' Sensibility, Selfhood, and the Maturing Reader, 1775‚Äì1815 (2011).. Order Number 3466388. Indiana University. Her dissertation combined her research interests in archival work, children's literature, and gender studies. In it, Wadewitz studied the use of language and discursive strategies such as embedded narratives in children's books by Mary Wollstonecraft, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Maria Edgeworth, and others. She argued that through such reading, the child was supported in the construction of a \\"sympathetic self\\" that was \\"collective, benevolent, and imaginative.\\"Wadewitz (2011), p. vi She also argued that the kinds of subjectivity displayed in late eighteenth-century children's literature challenged \\"the dominant Lockean model\\" by drawing upon \\"Rousseau's theory of education and the discourse of sensibility to construct a 'sympathetic self.' [...] Significantly, this 'sympathetic self' was available to both sexes and to children. Unlike other versions of the self based on sensibility, it was not predicated upon femininity. Moreover, maturation did not depend on age, but rather on one's state of mind; any person educated through this sympathetic literature could be an adult and participate in civic society through, for example, charitable acts.\\" Moreover, through its analysis of \\"how childhood reading informed the reading of 'adult' novels by Jane Austen,\\" it argued that \\"contemporary readers of Austen would have read her novels 'didactically' and followed the structural patterns of the children's literature they grew up reading rather than seeing the irony we value today.\\"Wadewitz (2011), p. vii =Digital humanities= In 2009, Wadewitz began putting The New England Primer online, culminating in a permanent online exhibit in 2012, with text and annotated transcriptions.New England Primer exhibit and analysis, 2012. Retrieved April 21, 2014. She published on topics including 18th-century children's literature, ambiguity in historical scholarship, and use of Wikipedia in the classroom.Selected Works of Adrianne Wadewitz, OxyScholar Digital Repository, Occidental College. Retrieved April 21, 2014. Writing about the use of Wikipedia in education, she argued that in addition to traditional writing and research skills, students should develop skills in media and technological literacy. Reflecting on the construction of knowledge, she emphasized the need to assess sources; distinguish between fact-based and persuasive writing; and be aware of authority and legitimacy. She promoted the development of curricula that included collaborative writing, development of writing skills in the context of a \\"community of practice\\", and writing for a global readership. Wikipedia editing and advocacy Wadewitz's video, \\"The Impact of Wikipedia\\" Wadewitz made her first edit on Wikipedia in 2004, and went on to create articles on female writers and scholars, several of them becoming featured articles. She originally edited anonymously for several years before revealing her gender. She made nearly 50,000 edits in all. As a major promoter of getting more women to edit Wikipedia to help end systematic bias, she said, \\"We need more female editors, more feminists (who can be editors of any gender), and more editors willing to work on content related to women. The single most underrepresented group on Wikipedia is married women of color with children.\\" She increasingly became seen as an authority on Wikipedia, and particularly on the encyclopedia's gender issues, and was cited as such by organizations such as the BBC. Wadewitz also served on the board of the Wiki Education Foundation. Climbing Wadewitz enjoyed rock climbing, which she described in 2013 as enabling \\"a new narrative about herself beyond that of a bookish, piano-playing Wikipedia contributor\\": Death A digital media tribute to Adrianne Wadewitz at Occidental College On April 8, 2014, Wadewitz died from head injuries sustained a week earlier in a rock climbing fall at Joshua Tree National Park. Sue Gardner, then executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, described Wadewitz's death as a \\"huge loss\\" and said she may have been Wikipedia's \\"single biggest contributor on ... female authors [and] women's history\\". Obituaries for her were published in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, (republication of the Los Angeles Times article) The Sydney Morning Herald, (reprint of The New York Times obituary) and the Corriere della Sera, amongst others.E.g. \\"Dr. Adrianne Wadiwitz\\" Fort Wayne, Indiana Newspapers, April 23, 2014. The Sydney Morning Herald also republished one of her last blog posts, in which she discussed how engaging with a difficult activity had taught her about helping students with their own difficulties, partly by teaching them to celebrate the little successes on the way to a goal. She wrote that, \\"Ultimately, nothing was more helpful for me than failing repeatedly\\" and that she wanted her students to realize that failures could be part of learning and were nothing to be ashamed of. The journal ABO, which Wadewitz had worked for from 2011 to 2012, dedicated its March 2014 issue to Wadewitz. Wadewitz is survived by her parents, the Rev. Dr. Nathan R. Wadewitz and Betty M.

As a state defense force, the MSDF is a reserve military force which serves parallel to the Missouri National Guard. As the MSDF falls solely under the command of the state of Missouri, it cannot be federalized or deployed outside the borders of Missouri, unlike the National Guard. Although the MSDF and the Missouri National Guard are separate organizations, the MSDF's primary scope is to work alongside the National Guard during stateside operations, or in lieu of the National Guard when the National Guard is deployed outside of Missouri. Along with the Missouri Army National Guard, the Missouri Air National Guard, and the Missouri Naval Militia, the Missouri State Defense Force is recognized under Missouri law as part of the organized militia of Missouri. The Missouri State Defense Force is a division of the Missouri Department of Public Safety. History The state of Missouri authorized and created state defense forces during each of the world wars. As a response to the United States' entrance into World War I, the United States Congress passed the Home Guard Act of 1917, which allowed the states to create home guards, which could receive surplus weaponry from the federal government. Fearing violence from rioting strikers and anti-war protesters, the state of Missouri created the Missouri Home Guard in 1917 and maintained it until Armistice with Germany. The Missouri Home Guard, at its peak, consisted of five regiments, six separate battalions, and sixteen separate companies, as well as a separate cavalry troop. The Home Guard, which reached a strength of over 6,000 men by the end of the war, was deployed several times to keep the peace after a number of labor strikes turned violent.Stentiford, Barry M. The state defense force was resurrected during World War II. The Missouri State Guard was activated and began recruitment the same day the Missouri National Guard began entering federal service. By December 1941, the Missouri State Guard consisted of over 3,000 soldiers organized into five infantry regiments. In 1943 alone, the State Guard was responsible for responding to statewide flooding, ending a civil disturbance in Cape Girardeau, and fighting a large fire in Lamar which destroyed much of the town square. The regiments were gradually disbanded throughout 1946, following the return of the Missouri National Guard to state service, and as of 1 January 1947 the Missouri State Guard officially ceased to exist. On September 9, 1982, Governor Christopher ‚ÄúKit‚Äù Bond signed Executive Order 82-17 creating a Missouri Reserve Force and ordering the state's adjutant general to organize the force. However, the adjutant general did not execute this order at that time. It was not until December 2012 that the force was officially organized. On June 1, 2018, Missouri Governor Eric Greitens signed HB 1469 into law which modifies provisions of the Missouri military code by changing the name of the ‚ÄúMissouri Reserve Military Force‚Äù to the ‚ÄúMissouri State Defense Force‚Äù. The MSDF was temporarily suspended in 2020 due to budget concerns on the same day of Missouri's first positive COVID-19 case, but the Missouri General Assembly restored funding for the MSDF in May 2020.  Membership  Maj. Gen. Stephen Danner, Adjutant General of Missouri, administers an oath to the initial members of the Missouri Reserve Force at the Ike Skelton Training Site. Prospective members of the MSDF must be at least seventeen years old, but no older than sixty-four. However, the adjutant general may waive the upper age limit on a case-by-case basis. There is no physical examination required for membership, but members must guarantee they are able-bodied citizens, in good health, and capable of performing moderate physical activity.  Duties  The MSDF carries the same stateside responsibilities as the Missouri National Guard, including assisting the National Guard on recovery operations following natural disasters. In the event of the National Guard deploying outside of the state, the MSDF is assigned to assist in the mobilization process and assume the stateside duties of the National Guard for the duration of the deployment, including: *protecting life and property in times of emergency *assisting the adjutant general in preparation of the mobilization of the Missouri National Guard for active duty *assisting family members at home during deployments *assisting the adjutant general in control and operation of state military property left behind following Missouri National Guard mobilizations.  Legal basis  All U.S. states and territories are allowed to create and maintain their own military forces, independent of the federal military, under Title 32 of the United States Code. State defense forces are allowed under Missouri law as well, under Chapter 41, Section 41.070 of the Missouri Revised Statutes. = Legal protection = Members of the Missouri State Defense Force are given the same legal protections under Missouri law as federal reservists are entitled to under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). This guarantees, among other protections, that employers of MSDF members are required to give those employees a leave of absence when they are activated for training or to perform emergency services, and to reinstate these employees to their positions of employment when they return.

A meteorological office was established on Funafuti at the time the islands of Tuvalu were administered as parts of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony of the United Kingdom. The meteorological office is now an agency of the government of Tuvalu. The main observational office is on Funafuti. TMS operates outstations on Nanumea, Nui and Niulakita. TMS operates or monitors: 4 synoptic stations; 5 rainfall stations; 1 upper air research program; 1 tide gauge with Tsunami warning system; 1 Continuous Global Positioning System (CGPS) station; 1 seismic station. The TMS publishes weather forecasts, warnings as to tropical cyclones, weather charts and weather satellite images on its website, with weather forecasts and storm warnings also broadcast by the Tuvalu Media Corporation, which operates Radio Tuvalu. History The meteorological office on Funafuti was established in 1951 under the auspices of the South Pacific Air Transport Council (SPATC). An upper air observation programme was established in 1960. After the dissolution of SPATC in 1979, the Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited supported the upper air programme until the TMS assumed responsibility for the programme, with continuing support by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT)/NZAID. The TMS works with the New Zealand MetService, the Fiji Meteorological Service, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia, the United States Geological Survey and the National Weather Service. Ms Hilai Vavae retired as Director of the Tuvalu Met Service in 2014. Climatology of Tuvalu Sea surface temperature anomalies in November 2007 showing La Ni√±a conditions. Blue=temperature below average; red=temperature above average Tuvalu participates in the operations of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). The climate of the Pacific region at the equator is influenced by a number of factors; the science of which is the subject of continuing research. The SPREP described the climate of Tuvalu as being: The sea level in Tuvalu varies as a consequence of a wide range of atmospheric and oceanographic influences. The 2011 report of the Pacific Climate Change Science Program published by the Australian Government, describes a strong zonal (east‚Äëto-west) sea-level slope along the equator, with sea level west of the International Date Line (180¬∞ longitude) being about a half metre higher than found in the eastern equatorial Pacific and South American coastal regions. The trade winds that push surface water westward create this zonal tilting of sea level on the equator. Below the equator a higher sea level can also be found about 20¬∞ to 40¬∞ south (Tuvalu is spread out from 6¬∞ to 10¬∞ south). The Pacific Climate Change Science Program Report (2011) describes the year-by-year volatility in the sea-level as resulting from the El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO): The Pacific (inter-)decadal oscillation is a climate switch phenomenon that results in changes from periods of La Ni√±a to periods of El Ni√±o. This has an effect on sea levels. For example, in 2000 there was a switch from periods of downward pressure of El Ni√±o on sea levels to an upward pressure of La Ni√±a on sea levels, which upward pressure causes more frequent and higher high tide levels. The Perigean spring tide (often called a king tide) can result in seawater flooding low-lying areas of the islands of Tuvalu. Role of the Tuvalu Meteorological Service The purpose of the meteorological programmes operated by the TMS is to gather data in the tropical western Pacific so as to work to achieve ‚Äúaccurate production of weather forecasts, seasonal and interannual climate forecasting (ENSO predictions), and understanding changes in climate and sea level for Tuvalu and its neighbouring Pacific Islands. Tuvalu lies across a known development region for tropical cyclones and ENSO activity. It provides crucial data to global weather, climate modelling and forecasting centres. It also provides the key data used for tropical cyclone and ENSO forecasting.‚Äù =Meteorological programmes= The TMS operates 2 meteorological programmes (surface observation programme and upper air programme) and hosts other climatological research projects. = Surface observations= The TMS carries out ground level observations of various weather elements. This data is shared with collaborating partners in the World Meteorological Organization - World Weather Watch (WWW), the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). =Upper air observations= A radiosonde shortly after launch. The upper air observation programme in Funafuti makes radiosonde observations to collect upper air weather for weather forecasting and research. The radiosonde observations use a small, expendable instrument package is suspended below a wide balloon filled with hydrogen or helium. As the radiosonde rises at about 300 meters/minute (1,000 ft/min), sensors on the radiosonde measure profiles of pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. These sensors are linked to a battery-powered radio transmitter that sends the sensor measurements to a ground receiver. By tracking the position of the radiosonde in flight, information on wind speed and direction are also obtained. The data is shared with Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMCs) in Nadi, Wellington, Brisbane, Melbourne and Honolulu. The weather modelling carried out by the RSMCs enables more accurate forecasts to be prepared for Tuvalu and for the tropical western Pacific. =Tropical cyclone prediction= The meteorological observations of the TMS are shared with other regional agencies that attempt to predict how many tropical cyclones and severe tropical cyclones will develop within the Southern Pacific. New Zealand's National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and collaborating agencies including the Meteorological Service of New Zealand and Pacific Island National Meteorological Services (including the TMS) issue the \\"Island Climate Update Tropical Cyclone Outlook\\" for the Pacific. This forecast attempts to predict how many tropical cyclones and severe tropical cyclones will develop within the Southern Pacific between 135¬∞E and 120¬∞W as well as how many will affect a particular island nation. The Fiji Meteorological Service, while collaborating with NIWA and partners, also publishes its own seasonal forecast for the South Pacific basin between 160¬∞E and 120¬∞W. The data collected by the regional meteorological agencies is provided to the World Meteorological Organisation, which publishes current tropical cyclone information for the South-West Pacific Ocean. =Other climatological research programmes and projects= The TMS also hosts other scientific and research programmes, which involves the TMS monitoring: * The tide gauge, which was installed in 1978 by the University of Hawaii. * The SEAFRAME tide gauge, which is modern Aquatrak acoustic gauge installed in 1993 by the Australian National Tidal Facility (NTF) as part of the AusAID-sponsored South Pacific Sea Level and Climate Monitoring Project.

The corps was first formed in 1922, and spent most of the interwar period headquartered at Odessa. It fought in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, moving into what became western Ukraine. Stationed on the border when Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941, the corps was destroyed in the first weeks of the war. Reformed in mid-1942, the corps' second formation was converted into the 19th Guards Rifle Corps in April 1943. The corps' third formation was formed in May of that year, and fought in the Continuation War. Postwar it was relocated to the North Caucasus, renamed the 6th Army Corps in 1957 before being disbanded in 1960.  History  = Interwar period = The 6th Rifle Corps was first formed in Kiev in June 1922, in accordance with an order of the Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Crimea on 23 May 1922, to be formed from units formerly part of the Kiev and Kharkov Military Districts. The corps was not headquartered in Kiev for long, however, and moved to Yelizavetgrad in the month of its formation. It became part of the Ukrainian Military District upon its formation, and relocated south to Odessa in March 1923. In May 1935 the corps joined the Kharkov Military District when the Ukrainian Military District was split, but it transferred back to the Kiev Military District in 1937. On 26 July 1938, the Kiev Military District was converted to the Kiev Special Military District (KOVO), and army groups were formed. The headquarters of the Odessa Army Group (ODAGA) was formed on the basis of HQ 6th RC in Odessa. A new headquarters was formed for the corps in Odessa. On 16 September 1939 the corps joined the Ukrainian Front, fighting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. It advanced into what was annexed to the Soviet Union as western Ukraine, and its headquarters was established at Yavorov at the conclusion of the operation. At that time the corps consisted of 41st, 97th, and 159th Rifle Divisions, and was a part of 6th Army of the Kiev Special Military District on 22 June 1941.6th Army, Kiev Special Military District, Red Army, 22.06.41 The corps was part of the \\"operational army\\" from 22 June to 25 September. = Operation Barbarossa = On 22 June, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, began. The 41st Rifle Division maintained the defence in the 6th Fortified Region (Rava-Ruska) and kept the defence there, where they managed to halt the German attack until 23 June. Moreover, part of the 41st Rifle Division not only held the area, but also entered the territory occupied by Germany, more than three kilometers away. The 159th Rifle Division had to be moved from the area of Nemirov Mageruv on 22 June. On 23 June the German troops attacked the junction between the 159th and 97th Division, endangering the army. By the evening of 24 June the gap between the corps' divisions reached 40 kilometers, and was exploited by the German troops, who captured Nemirov by the end of the same day. On 25 June, the 41st Rifle Division and the 159th Rifle Division held defensive positions; the 97th Rifle Division, in conjunction with the 3rd Cavalry Division and parts of the 4th Mechanized Corps, was tasked to restore the position on the flank of the German units, advancing along the highway to reach the Drogomysl‚ÄìSwidnica‚ÄìMorantse line. Although the divisions held fortified area, the morale of the troops dwindled. From 22 to 25 June, there were large numbers of deserters, many of whom were shot. The 97th Division was unsuccessful in securing the corps' flank, and although 41st Rifle Division and the 159th Rifle Division still defended the area, they were forced to leave the position and started a planned withdrawal. The disorganized and battered 97th Rifle Division was meanwhile concentrated in the area of the Stazhiska highway and the forest to the south. On 8 July the corps, supported by the 186th Anti-Tank Regiment, the 109th and 229th corps artillery regiments, and 30 tanks of the 12th Tank Division, went on the offensive. Providing the right flank of 26th Army's assault group, they advanced a few dozen kilometers. However, the troops were forced to retreat to the north, in the direction of Kiev, on the flank of the enemy troops. After this onset the corps as a combat unit ceased to exist. That is, the corps' individual units were directly subordinated to the army. The corps officially ceased to exist by late July. The corps headquarters was officially disbanded on 25 September 1941, after being destroyed during the initial phase of Operation Barbarossa. = Second Formation = The corps' second formation was formed in summer 1942 and became 19th Guards Rifle Corps on 19 April 1943. = Third Formation = The corps' third formation was established in May 1943, and fought through the rest of the war. On 1 Jan 1944, the corps was in the 59th Army and was under command of Maj. Gen. S.P. Mikil'sky, and consisted of the 65th, 239th and 310th Rifle Divisions.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad, 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, p 521 The corps fought in the Continuation War with Finland. During the Battle of Tali-Ihantala, in addition to the losses of the Soviet 21st Army, the 6th Rifle Corps of the 23rd Army that attacked east of the 21st Army closer to the Vuoksi waterway suffered 7905 casualties, of which 1458 were killed in action (KIA) and 288 missing in action (MIA), without taking the losses of its supporting formations into account.  Postwar  The corps headquarters was moved from Latvia to the North Caucasus, and was established at Stalingrad in August 1945.Michael Holm 6th Army Corps, 2015, and V.I. Feskov et al 2013. In October 1945 the corps comprised the 10th, 109th , and 327th Rifle Divisions, the first two in the vicinity of what was then still Stalingrad and the third possibly at Kamyshin. On 4 February 1946 it came under the control of the North Caucasus Military District and at the same time all three divisions became independent rifle brigades: the 15th, 18th, and 46th. However, the 15th Ind. Rifle Brigade disbanded in 1947. On 22 August 1949 the corps came again under the command of the reformed Don Military District with its two brigades located at Stalingrad (18th) and Uryupinsk (46th). In October 1953 the brigades were expanded into divisions and became the 68th Mechanised Division at Stalingrad and the 372nd Rifle Division at Uryupinsk. The 372nd Rifle Division was redesignated as the 68th Rifle Division in June 1955. On 10 June 1957 both the divisions and the corps headquarters was redesignated, the corps becoming the 6th Army Corps which consisted of the 68th Motor Rifle Division (Uryupinsk) and 117th Motor Rifle Division (Stalingrad).

Its followers are divided into Roman Catholics and Protestants (including several denominations) and collectively represent 45% of population.https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR90/FR90.pdf Protestantism The American organization Baptist Mid-Missions was the first Protestant mission to settle in the country in 1925 in Sarh. J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 534 The organizational ties between the missions in southern Chad and Ubangi-Chari were strengthened by France's decision in 1925 to transfer Logone Occidental, Tandjil√©, Logone Oriental, and Moyen-Chari prefectures to Ubangi-Chari, where they remained until another administrative shuffle restored them to Chad in 1932. In 1964, the Association of Baptist Churches of Chad was officially founded. J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 534 These early Protestant establishments looked to their own churches for material resources and to their own countries for diplomatic support. Such independence allowed them to maintain a distance from the French colonial administration. In addition, the missionaries arrived with their wives and children, and they often spent their entire lives in the region. Some of the missionaries who arrived at that time had grown up with missionary parents in missions founded earlier in the French colonies to the south. Some missionary children from this era later founded missions of their own. Many remained after independence, leaving only in the early and or mid-1970s when Tombalbaye's authenticit√© movement forced their departure (see Fall of the Tombalbaye Government, ch. 1). The puritanical message preached by many Protestant missionaries undermined the appeal of the faith. Rather than allowing a local Christian tradition to develop, the missionaries preached a fundamentalist doctrine native to parts of the United States. They inveighed against dancing, alcohol, and local customs, which they considered \\"superstitions.\\" New converts found it almost impossible to observe Protestant teachings and remain within their communities. In the early years, Chadian Protestants often left their villages and settled around the missions. But abandoning village and family was a sacrifice that most people were reluctant to make. Although language and doctrine probably discouraged conversion, the educational and medical projects of the Protestant missions probably attracted people. The missionaries set up schools, clinics, and hospitals long before the colonial administration did. In fact, the mission schools produced the first Western-educated Chadians in the 1940s and 1950s. In general, the Protestant missionary effort in southern Chad has enjoyed some success. In 1980, after a half-century of evangelization, Protestants in southern Chad numbered about 80,000. From bases in the south, Protestants founded missions in other parts of Chad. For the most part, they avoided settling among Muslims, who were not responsive to their message. In the colonial capital of Fort-Lamy (present-day's N'Djamena), the missions attracted followers among resident southerners. The missionaries also proselytized among the non-Muslim populations of Gu√©ra, Ouadda√Ø, and Biltine prefectures. Although Christianity appealed to some in the capital (there were estimated to be 18,000 Christians in N'Djamena in 1980), efforts in other parts of the Sahel were relatively unsuccessful. In the late 1980s, the future of the Protestant missions in Chad remained unclear. As noted, many Protestant missionaries were forced to leave the country during the cultural revolution in the early and mid-1970s. Outside the south, other missions have been caught in the cross fire of warring factions. Rebel forces have pillaged mission stations, and the government has accused the missionaries of complicity with the opposition. Roman Catholicism The cathedral in N'Djamena, Chad, as it was before it was severely damaged during the civil war. The Roman Catholic missions came to Chad later than their Protestant counterparts. Isolated efforts began as early as 1929 when The Holy Ghost Fathers from Bangui founded a mission at Kou, near Moundou in Logone Occidental Prefecture. In 1934, in the midst of the sleeping sickness epidemic, they abandoned Kou for Doba in Logone Oriental Prefecture. Other priests from Ubangi-Shari and Cameroon opened missions in K√©lo and Sarh in 1935 and 1939, respectively. In 1946 these autonomous missions gave way to an institutionalized Roman Catholic presence. This late date had more to do with European politics than with events in Chad. Earlier in the century, the Vatican had designated the Chad region to be part of the Italian vicarate of Khartoum. Rather than risk the implantation of Italian missionaries during the era of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the French administration discouraged all Roman Catholic missionary activity. For its part, the Vatican adopted the same tactic, not wishing to upset the Italian regime by transferring jurisdiction of the Chad region to the French. As a consequence of their defeat in World War II, however, the Italians lost their African colonies. This loss cleared the way for a French Roman Catholic presence in Chad, which a decree from Rome formalized on March 22, 1946. This decree set up three religious jurisdictions that eventually became four bishoprics. The first, administered by the Jesuits, had its seat in N'Djamena. Although its jurisdiction included the eight prefectures in the northern and eastern parts of the country, almost all the Roman Catholics in sahelian and Saharan Chad lived in the capital. The diocese of N'Djamena also served as the archdiocese of all Chad. The second bishopric, at Sarh, also was delegated to the Jesuits. Its region included Salamat and Moyen-Chari prefectures. The third and fourth jurisdictions had their headquarters in Pala and Moundou and were delegated to the Oblats de Marie and Capuchin orders. The Pala bishopric served Mayo-Kebbi Prefecture, while the bishopric of Moundou was responsible for missions in Logone Occidental and Logone Oriental prefectures. By far the most important jurisdiction in 1970, Pala included 116,000 of Chad's 160,000 Catholics. The relatively slow progress of the Roman Catholic Church in Chad has several causes. Although Roman Catholicism has been much more open to local cultures than Protestantism, the doctrine of celibacy probably has deterred candidates for the priesthood. Insistence on monogamy also has undoubtedly made the faith less attractive to some potential converts, particularly wealthy older men able to afford more than one wife. The social works of the Roman Catholic Church have made it an important institution in Chad. Like their Protestant counterparts, the Roman Catholic missions have a history of social service. In the 1970s, along with priests, the staffs of most establishments included brothers and nuns who worked in the areas of health, education, and development. Many of the nuns were trained medical professionals who served on the staffs of government hospitals and clinics. It was estimated that 20,000 Chadians attended Roman Catholic schools in 1980. Adult literacy classes also reached beyond the traditional school-aged population. In the area of development, as early as the 1950s Roman Catholic missions in southern Chad set up rural development centers whose clientele included non-Christians as well as Christians.

In these situations, emotions are still driving the eating but not in a negative way.  Background  Emotional eating includes eating in response to any emotion, whether that be positive or negative. Most frequently, people refer to emotional eating as \\"eating to cope with negative emotions.\\" In these situations, emotional eating can be considered a form of disordered eating which is defined as \\"an increase in food intake in response to negative emotions\\" and can be considered a maladaptive strategy. More specifically, emotional eating in order to relieve negative emotions would qualify as a form of emotion-focused coping, which attempts to minimize, regulate, and prevent emotional distress. A study found that emotional eating sometimes does not reduce emotional distress but instead enhances emotional distress by sparking feelings of intense guilt after an emotional eating session. Those that eat as a coping strategy are at an especially high risk of developing binge-eating disorder, and those with eating disorders are at a higher risk to engage in emotional eating as a means to cope. In a clinical setting, emotional eating can be assessed by the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire which contains a scale for restrained, emotional and external eating. Other questionnaires such as the Palatable Eating Motives Scale can determine reasons why a person eats tasty foods when they are not hungry; sub-scales include eating for reward enhancement, coping, social, and conformity.  Characteristics  Emotional eating usually occurs when one is attempting to satisfy his or her hedonic drive, or the drive to eat palatable food to obtain pleasure in the absence of an energy deficit but can also occur when one is seeking food as a reward, eating for social reasons (such as eating at a party), or eating to conform (which involves eating because friends or family wants the individual to). When one is engaging in emotional eating, they are usually seeking out palatable foods (such as sweets) rather than just food in general. In some cases, emotional eating can lead to something called \\"mindless eating\\" during which the individual is eating without being mindful of what or how much they are consuming; this can occur during both positive and negative settings. Emotional hunger does not originate from the stomach, such as with a rumbling or growling stomach, but tends to start when a person thinks about a craving or wants something specific to eat. Emotional responses are also different. Giving in to a craving or eating because of stress can cause feelings of regret, shame, or guilt, and these responses tend to be associated with emotional hunger. On the other hand, satisfying a physical hunger is giving the body the nutrients or calories it needs to function and is not associated with negative feelings.  Major theories behind eating to cope  Current research suggests that certain individual factors may increase one's likelihood of using emotional eating as a coping strategy. The inadequate affect regulation theory posits that individuals engage in emotional eating because they believe overeating alleviates negative feelings. Escape theory builds upon inadequate affect regulation theory by suggesting that people not only overeat to cope with negative emotions, but they find that overeating diverts their attention away from a stimuli that is threatening self-esteem to focus on a pleasurable stimuli like food. Restraint theory suggests that overeating as a result of negative emotions occurs among individuals who already restrain their eating. While these individuals typically limit what they eat, when they are faced with negative emotions they cope by engaging in emotional eating. Restraint theory supports the idea that individuals with other eating disorders are more likely to engage in emotional eating. Together these three theories suggest that an individual's aversion to negative emotions, particularly negative feelings that arise in response to a threat to the ego or intense self- awareness, increase the propensity for the individual to utilize emotional eating as a means of coping with this aversion. The biological stress response may also contribute to the development of emotional eating tendencies. In a crisis, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is secreted by the hypothalamus, suppressing appetite and triggering the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal gland. These steroid hormones increase appetite and, unlike CRH, remain in the bloodstream for a prolonged period of time, often resulting in hyperphagia. Those who experience this biologically instigated increase in appetite during times of stress are therefore primed to rely on emotional eating as a coping mechanism.  Contributing factors  = Negative affect = Overall, high levels of the negative affect trait are related to emotional eating. Negative affectivity is a personality trait involving negative emotions and poor self-concept. Negative emotions experienced within negative affect include anger, guilt, and nervousness. It has been found that certain negative affect regulation scales predicted emotional eating. An inability to articulate and identify one's emotions made the individual feel inadequate at regulating negative affect and thus more likely to engage in emotional eating as a means for coping with those negative emotions. Further scientific studies regarding the relationship between negative affect and eating find that, after experiencing a stressful event, food consumption is associated with reduced feelings of negative affect (i.e. feeling less bad) for those enduring high levels of chronic stress. This relationship between eating and feeling better suggests a self-reinforcing cyclical pattern between high levels of chronic stress and consumption of highly palatable foods as a coping mechanism. Contrarily, a study conducted by Spoor et al. found that negative affect is not significantly related to emotional eating, but the two are indirectly associated through emotion-focused coping and avoidance-distraction behaviors. While the scientific results differed somewhat, they both suggest that negative affect does play a role in emotional eating but it may be accounted for by other variables. = Childhood development = For some people, emotional eating is a learned behavior. During childhood, their parents give them treats to help them deal with a tough day or situation, or as a reward for something good. Over time, the child who reaches for a cookie after getting a bad grade on a test may become an adult who grabs a box of cookies after a rough day at work. In an example such as this, the roots of emotional eating are deep, which can make breaking the habit extremely challenging. In some cases, individuals may eat in order to conform; for example, individuals may be told \\"you have to finish your plate\\" and the individual may eat past the point in which they feel satisfied. = Related disorders = Emotional eating as a means to cope may be a precursor to developing eating disorders such as binge eating or bulimia nervosa. The relationship between emotional eating and other disorders is largely due to the fact that emotional eating and these disorders share key characteristics. More specifically, they are both related to emotion focused coping, maladaptive coping strategies, and a strong aversion to negative feelings and stimuli. It is important to note that the causal direction has not been definitively established, meaning that while emotional eating is considered a precursor to these eating disorders, it also may be the consequence of these disorders. The latter hypothesis that emotional eating happens in response to another eating disorder is supported by research that has shown emotional eating to be more common among individuals already suffering from bulimia nervosa. = Biological and environmental factors = Stress affects food preferences. Numerous studies ‚Äî granted, many of them in animals ‚Äî have shown that physical or emotional distress increases the intake of food high in fat, sugar, or both, even in the absence of caloric deficits. Once ingested, fat- and sugar-filled foods seem to have a feedback effect that dampens stress related responses and emotions, as these foods trigger dopamine and opioid releases, which protect against the negative consequences of stress. These foods really are \\"comfort\\" foods in that they seem to counteract stress, but rat studies demonstrate that intermittent access to and consumption of these highly palatable foods creates symptoms that resemble opioid withdrawal, suggesting that high-fat and high- sugar foods can become neurologically addictive A few examples from the American diet would include: hamburgers, pizza, French fries, sausages and savory pasties. The most common food preferences are in decreasing order from: sweet energy-dense food, non-sweet energy-dense food then, fruits and vegetables. This may contribute to people's stress-induced craving for those foods. The stress response is a highly-individualized reaction and personal differences in physiological reactivity may also contribute to the development of emotional eating habits. Women are more likely than men to resort to eating as a coping mechanism for stress, as are obese individuals and those with histories of dietary restraint. In one study, women were exposed to an hour- long social stressor task or a neutral control condition. The women were exposed to each condition on different days. After the tasks, the women were invited to a buffet with both healthy and unhealthy snacks. Those who had high chronic stress levels and a low cortisol reactivity to the acute stress task consumed significantly more calories from chocolate cake than women with low chronic stress levels after both control and stress conditions. High cortisol levels, in combination with high insulin levels, may be responsible for stress-induced eating, as research shows high cortisol reactivity is associated with hyperphagia, an abnormally increased appetite for food, during stress. Furthermore, since glucocorticoids trigger hunger and specifically increase one's appetite for high-fat and high-sugar foods, those whose adrenal glands naturally secrete larger quantities of glucocorticoids in response to a stressor are more inclined toward hyperphagia. Additionally, those whose bodies require more time to clear the bloodstream of excess glucocorticoids are similarly predisposed. These biological factors can interact with environmental elements to further trigger hyperphagia. Frequent intermittent stressors trigger repeated, sporadic releases of glucocorticoids in intervals too short to allow for a complete return to baseline levels, leading to sustained and elevated levels of appetite. Therefore, those whose lifestyles or careers entail frequent intermittent stressors over prolonged periods of time thus have greater biological incentive to develop patterns of emotional eating, which puts them at risk for long-term adverse health consequences such as weight gain or cardiovascular disease. Macht (2008) described a five-way model to explain the reasoning behind stressful eating: (1) emotional control of food choice, (2) emotional suppression of food intake, (3) impairment of cognitive eating controls, (4) eating to regulate emotions, and (5) emotion- congruent modulation of eating. These break down into subgroups of: Coping, reward enhancement, social and conformity motive. Thus, providing an individual with are stronger understanding of personal emotional eating. = Positive Affect = Geliebter and Aversa (2003) conducted a study comparing individuals of three weight groups: underweight, normal weight and overweight. Both positive and negative emotions were evaluated. When individuals were experiencing positive emotional states or situations, the underweight group reporting eating more than the other two groups. As an explanation, the typical nature of underweight individuals is to eat less and during times of stress to eat even less. However, when positive emotional states or situations arise, individuals are more likely to indulge themselves with food.  Impact  Emotional eating may qualify as avoidant coping and/or emotion-focused coping. As coping methods that fall under these broad categories focus on temporary reprieve rather than practical resolution of stressors, they can initiate a vicious cycle of maladaptive behavior reinforced by fleeting relief from stress. Additionally, in the presence of high insulin levels characteristic of the recovery phase of the stress-response, glucocorticoids trigger the creation of an enzyme that stores away the nutrients circulating in the bloodstream after an episode of emotional eating as visceral fat, or fat located in the abdominal area. Therefore, those who struggle with emotional eating are at greater risk for abdominal obesity, which is in turn linked to a greater risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease.  Treatment  There are numerous ways in which individuals can reduce emotional distress without engaging in emotional eating as a means to cope. The most salient choice is to minimize maladaptive coping strategies and to maximize adaptive strategies. A study conducted by Corstorphine et al. in 2007 investigated the relationship between distress tolerance and disordered eating. These researchers specifically focused on how different coping strategies impact distress tolerance and disordered eating. They found that individuals who engage in disordered eating often employ emotional avoidance strategies. If an individual is faced with strong negative emotions, they may choose to avoid the situation by distracting themselves through overeating. Discouraging emotional avoidance is thus an important facet to emotional eating treatment. The most obvious way to limit emotional avoidance is to confront the issue through techniques like problem solving. Corstorphine et al. showed that individuals who engaged in problem solving strategies enhance one's ability to tolerate emotional distress. Since emotional distress is correlated to emotional eating, the ability to better manage one's negative affect should allow an individual to cope with a situation without resorting to overeating. One way to combat emotional eating is to employ mindfulness techniques. For example, approaching cravings with a nonjudgmental inquisitiveness can help differentiate between hunger and emotionally-driven cravings. An individual may ask his or herself if the craving developed rapidly, as emotional eating tends to be triggered spontaneously. An individual may also take the time to note his or her bodily sensations, such as hunger pangs, and coinciding emotions, like guilt or shame, in order to make conscious decisions to avoid emotional eating. Emotional eating can also be improved by evaluating physical facets like hormone balance. Female hormones, in particular, can alter cravings and even self-perception of one's body. Additionally, emotional eating can be exacerbated by social pressure to be thin. The focus on thinness and dieting in our culture can make young girls, especially, vulnerable to falling into food restriction and subsequent emotional eating behavior. Emotional eating disorder predisposes individuals to more serious eating disorders and physiological complications. Therefore, combatting disordered eating before such progression takes place has become the focus of many clinical psychologists. Stress fasting In a lesser percentage of individuals, emotional eating may conversely consist of reduced food intake, or stress fasting. This is believed to result from the fight-or- flight response. In some individuals, depression and other psychological disorders can also lead to emotional fasting or starvation.

Rishi Medhatithi (Rig Veda I.15.11) tells us that the intelligent and learned persons must know the Sun shining on its own and the Moon shining brightly in the light of the Sun, both associated with light, and with Agni which purifies and partakes the oblations offered to it. Prasna Upanishad (I.7) explains that Agni which in its material form is identified with the gross self is the Taijasa when in meditation the mind settles inwards, projects impressions and remaining unconnected with the senses is not conscious of the gross body, it then becomes identified as Vaishvanara, the subtle self identified with the mind, the subtle instrument which shines as well as reflects. The mind is the seat of the Intellect, and it is Agni that purifies the mind; a pure mind protects itself, becomes truly invulnerable, and develops super-consciousness and vision which is Samadhi in which state one sees the inner brightness also shining without everywhere. Significance The bright entity at the centre of the yajna of creation is the self-effulgent immortal single Reality who is the light of all lights; the sun signifies Agni and Agni signifies the Almighty Creator. Therefore, a Rishi (Rig Veda X.35.5) prays ‚Äì ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§π‡•á ‚Äì \\"May we know Agni in the form of the brightly shining Sun for our own benefits\\". Rishi Kavi (Rig Veda IX.77.2) declares ‚Äì ‡§∏ ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É ‡§™‡§µ‡§§‡•á ‚Äì that the Eternal Being, the Creator, purifies all beings. The Eternal Being purifies by eliminating Rajoguna from our systems, eliminating the same Rajoguna from which all matter was made. Prak·πõti is a mixture of three gunas but the Atman, which is naturally and eternally liberated, is devoid of association with the gunas because of which fact bliss is not moksha and not the dharma of the Atman. Prana, the vital force and the body of the mind and having the power of manifesting itself and becoming active in its own spheres, is Agni, and also the principle of consciousness as the ultimate reality ‚Äì ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡•ã ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§µ‡•à‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§£‡§ø ‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø (Chandogya Upanishad V.1.15) the purification of the mind is dependent upon the Pranas. It is only when the mind is purified after an initial control of the Pranas that the Atman reveals itself (Mundaka Upanishad III.1.9). Thus, the Rishis of the Rig Veda (IX.24.1-2) tell us - : ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ã‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∏‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•Å‡§É ‡§™‡§µ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§µ‡§É : ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§£‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§™‡•ç‡§∏‡•Å ‡§Æ‡•É‡§û‡•ç‡§ú‡§§ |: ‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø ‡§ó‡§æ‡§µ‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§™‡•ã ‡§® ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡§§‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø : ‡§™‡•Å‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∂‡§§ |that the pleasing (‡§∏‡•ã‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∏‡§É) gunas of the Pramatman purify (‡§™‡§µ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§∏‡§É) men who with the aid of (‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§£‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§É) the body, mind and speech attain purification (‡§Æ‡•É‡§û‡•ç‡§ú‡§§), and that the senses and the sense-organs (‡§ó‡§æ‡§µ‡§É) once purified certainly come to the aid of the karma-yogis in realizing Brahman (‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ü‡§∂‡§§).

Early life She was born to Albert Baldwin Dod (1805‚Äì1845), a professor of mathematics at Princeton University and Caroline Smith Bayard (1807‚Äì1891). Her maternal grandfather was Samuel Bayard (1766-1840) and her great-granddaughter was Continental Congressman John Bubenheim Bayard (1738-1808), sharing lineage with Peter Stuyvesant. Martha was a descendant of the Bayard family who emigrated from Holland to the United States before the Revolutionary War. The Bayards owned the greater part of the land now known as Hoboken and Weehawken, but lost after fleeing the country upon the surrender of the British Army. The land was then sold to Colonel John Stevens, father of Martha's future husband Edwin Augustus Stevens. Contributions to Hoboken Widowed at age 37 by her husband Edwin Augustus Stevens, she had the responsibility of executing the establishment of a \\"school of higher learning\\" as per her husband's will and bequest. As a tribute to her family's curiosity and experimental ventures she chose to erect a school of engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology.Geoffrey Clark, History of Stevens Institute of Technology New Jersey: Jensen/Daniels, 2000, p. 31 She drew upon a wide range of experiences and resources in order to further causes she believed in: education, healthy housing, and opportunities for working class women.Huguenot Society of America, Proceedings of the Huguenot Society of America, Volume II New York: Huguenot Society of America, 1891, p.142 Influenced by experiences in her own life including her own descent during childhood from middle-class comfort into single-parent poverty; her subsequent re-emergence into wealth through marriage; her active participation and acumen in overseeing the business affairs of the Hoboken Land & Improvement Company, a Stevens family business; her role as a founding and lifetime trustee of Stevens Institute of Technology. She used the inheritance of money and land from her late husband, Edwin Augustus Stevens liberally in pursuit of these causes. Martha Stevens played a major role in conceiving, establishing, promoting and financing a range of social-service organizations in Hoboken.

McArthur, \\"Hart Mountain\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 449. From the crest of the Hart Mountain, the land slopes gently down to the floor of the valley.Jackman, E.R. and R.A. Long, The Oregon Desert, Canton Press, Caldwell, Idaho: 1964, p. 368. Steens Mountain's western boundary is Catlow Rim. The rim runs along the east side of Catlow Valley from north to south. At the north end of the valley, the rim begins as gentle rolling hills. The rim gets steeper and high as it runs south. At the south end of the valley, Catlow Rim has a cliff face that rises more than a above the valley floor.Fuller, Richard E., \\"Southern Steens and its Relation to Pueblo Mountain\\" , The Geomorphology and Volcanic Sequence of Steens Mountain in Southeastern Oregon (Volume 3, Number 1), University of Washington Press, Seattle, Washington, November 1931.Forrester, J.W., \\"Cattle/Harney Made to Order\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 15 October 1991, p. A-4. Beatys Butte is a stand-alone peak southwest of Catlow Valley. Its summit is above sea level, which gives it a prominence above the valley floor.\\"Beatys Butte Herd Management Area\\" (PDF), Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, 2 April 2014.  Geology  Rainbow over Catlow Rim escarpment The Catlow Valley is a tectonic depression called a graben. It is bounded on the east and west by high, uplifted fault-block mountains‚ÄîHart Mountain to the west and Steens Mountain to the east‚Äîwith which it forms a horst and graben geological feature. Catlow Rim is a prominent escarpment that forms the western face of the Steens Mountain fault block, overlooking the Catlow Valley.Oregon Wilderness Environmental Impact Statement (Volume III), Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, 1985, pp. 236‚Äì237. The rim is a basalt cliff that runs along the east side of the valley. Catlow Cave is located at the base of Catlow Rim near the southern end of the valley. The cave is wide at its mouth. It is high and deep. Roaring Springs Cave is another prominent cave located at the base of Catlow Rim.\\"Catlow Cave\\", Oregon State Office, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, 23 March 2014. During the Pleistocene Epoch, the Catlow Valley was covered by a single large lake, approximately by length and width. In some spots, the lake was over deep. Today, the valley is a high-desert alluvial basin. However, evidence of the ancient lake can still be seen in the form of shoreline erosion marks, gravel bars, and wave-cut terraces around the edge of the valley, especially along the base of Catlow Rim.Cressman, L. S., \\"Oregon's Ancient Civilization‚Ä¶How Old?\\", The Northwest's Own Magazine, The Sunday Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 12 April 1936, p. 5.  Climate  The climate in the Catlow Valley is typical of the high-desert country of southeastern Oregon. Summers in the valley are short, characterized by high temperatures and very little moisture. The valley gets an average of of precipitation per year, mostly as snowfall. The winters are cold. There is no official weather reporting station in the Catlow Valley. The P Ranch weather station is the nearest official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reporting station to the valley. It is approximately northeast of the Catlow Valley in the neighboring Blitzen Valley. The elevation of the P Ranch weather station is above sea level, approximately lower than the average elevation of the Catlow Valley. It reports daily weather data to NOAA's National Climatic Data Center.\\"Normals Monthly Station Details\\", P Ranch Refuge Reporting Station (GHCND:USC00356853), National Climatic Data Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, Asheville, North Carolina, 13 April 2014.  Ecology  =Flora= Home Creek riparian area The Catlow Valley topography provides a number of wildlife habitats. These include seasonal lakes, marshes, riparian areas, grasslands, sage steppe, dry juniper forests, and rimrock. The valley is predominantly high-desert grassland with gently rolling hills to the north, west, and south of the valley floor. There are wetlands and meadows at the mouth of canyons where runoff from Hart Mountain and Steens Mountain drains into the valley. There are two major drainages from Hart Mountain on the west side of the valley, Rock Creek and Guano Creek. Rock Creek enters the valley from the northwest, and Guano Creek flows in from the southwest. The east side of the valley is bounded by Catlow Rim, a steep and rugged cliff. The rim is cut by canyons that channel runoff into small man-made reservoirs and shallow natural marshes along the edges of the valley floor. The three main drainages on the east side of the valley are Home Creek, Threemile Creek, and Skull Creek.Oregon Wilderness Environmental Impact Statement (Volume III), Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, 1985, pp. 367-368.Jackman, E. R. and John Scharff, Steens Mountain in Oregon's High Desert Country, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, 1967, p. 36. On the east side of the valley, Catlow Rim provides a rimrock habitat. Some of the east slope of Hart Mountain and the west slope of Steens Mountain are lightly covered with western juniper. There are also aspen trees in areas where winter snow tends to accumulate, as well as a ponderosa pine grove in one area on Hart Mountain. The dominant vegetation throughout most of the valley is big sagebrush, low sagebrush, rabbitbrush, and bitterbrush. Common grasses include bluebunch wheatgrass, bunchgrass, and Idaho fescue.Rakestraw, John, \\"Southern Harney County\\", in Birding Oregon, Morris Book Publishing, Kearney, Nebraska, 2007, pp. 17-22. In addition, greasewood, shadscale, spiny hopsage, winterfat, and basin wildrye can be found in parts of the valley.Oregon Wilderness Environmental Impact Statement (Volume III), Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, 1985, p. 282. =Fauna= The Catlow Valley's wildlife includes many high-desert animal species. Large mammals found in the valley include mule deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, coyotes, bobcats, and cougars. The valley is also home to a herd of wild horses. Smaller mammals include badgers, jackrabbits, antelope squirrels, least chipmunks, bushy- tailed woodrats, desert woodrats, Great Basin pocket mice, canyon mice, and long-eared myotis bats.\\"Mammal Checklists of the United States - Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge\\" , Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center, United States Geological Survey, United States Department of the Interior, Jamestown, North Dakota, 1 February 2013. Among the common reptiles are Great Basin fence lizards, sagebrush lizards, desert horned lizards, western skinks, gopher snakes, and western rattlesnakes.\\"Amphibian and Reptile Checklists of the United States - Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge\\" , Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center, United States Geological Survey, United States Department of the Interior, Jamestown, North Dakota, 1 February 2013. Pronghorn in a Catlow Valley field In the sage steppes and grasslands of the Catlow Valley, resident birds include horned larks, Brewer's sparrows, vesper sparrows, sage thrashers, sagebrush sparrows, black-throated sparrows, common ravens, and greater sage grouse. The valley also hosts mountain chickadees, Cassin's finches, black-headed grosbeaks, green-tailed towhees, yellow-rumped warblers, MacGillivray's warblers, mountain bluebirds, white-headed woodpeckers, California quail, mourning doves, magpies, burrowing owls, flammulated owls, and northern harriers. In the valley's riparian areas, dusky flycatchers, yellow warblers, orange-crowned warblers, house wrens, and spotted towhees are common in the summer months. In the rimrock, there are chukars, white-throated swifts, cliff swallows, and barn swallows. The larger birds include great horned owls, long-eared owls, prairie falcons, American kestrels, red-tailed hawks, and golden eagles.Oregon Wilderness Environmental Impact Statement (Volume III), Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, 1985, p. 239. All five of the year- round creeks that flow into the Catlow Valley (Rock Creek, Guano Creek, Home Creek, Skull Creek, and Threemile Creek) support fish populations. The native fish are tui chub, Lahontan cutthroat trout, and Great Basin redband trout. The creeks also host introduced populations of rainbow trout. Redband trout and tui chub are abundant and well-distributed throughout the Rock Creek habitat. In Home Creek, the redband distribution and abundance are moderate; portions of the habitat are degraded. The redband populations in Guano, Skull, and Threemile creeks are limited. In addition, degraded parts of the Threemile Creek habitat include Threemile Reservoir.\\"Catlow Valley Redband Trout\\" (PDF), Oregon Native Fish Status Report (Volume II), Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Salem, Oregon, 2005, p. 379.\\"Fish Checklists of the United States - Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge\\" , Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center, United States Geological Survey, United States Department of the Interior, Jamestown, North Dakota, 1 February 2013.  History  =Early history= Skull Creek dunes archaeological site Native Americans used the Catlow Valley for thousands of years before the first European explorers arrived. The valley has a number of petroglyph sites. Some of these petroglyphs may be up to 12,000 years old.O'Grady, Patrick and Scott Thomas, \\"Archaeology in Harney County\\" (PDF), Destination Harney County 2010, Burns Times-Herald, Burns, Oregon, 31 March 2010, p. 36. When he first excavated Catlow Cave in 1934, archaeologist Luther S. Cressman found evidence of Native American habitation dating back to the Paleo-Indian period (8,000 to 12,000 years ago) as well as artifacts from the Early Archaic period (6,000 to 8,000 years ago). Cressman identified four rock fire pits and other housekeeping features within Catlow Cave. Later excavations found stone tools, baskets, woven mats, sandals, rope, and fragments of leather.Cressman, Luther S., \\"Prehistory of the Northern Area\\", Handbook of North American Indians: Great Basin, Government Printing Office, Washington, District of Columbia, 1986, p. 120. The Skull Creek dunes are another archaeological site that provides evidence of early Native American habitation in the Catlow Valley. That site documents at least 8,000 years of occupation.Mehringer, Peter, \\"A Tale of Two Sites\\" (PDF), Anthro News, Department of Anthropology, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington, Spring 1997, pp. 1‚Äì2. Prior to the arrival of white settlers, the Catlow Valley area was occupied by the Northern Paiute people. =19th century= The first European explorer to enter the valley may have been John Work, who headed a Hudson's Bay Company trapping expedition that explored the area in 1831. While it is not certain that he visited the Catlow Valley, Work is known to have passed through the Steens Mountain area as well as the neighboring Warner Valley, west of Hart Mountain.Carey, Charles H., General History of Oregon, (originally published by the Pioneer Historical Publishing Company, 1922) re-issued by Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1971, p. 228. In 1864, Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Drew of the 1st Oregon Cavalry passed just south of the Catlow Valley while on a long-range reconnaissance patrol for the United States Army. Drew named Beatys Butte in honor of Sergeant A. M. Beaty, one of the noncommissioned officers in his party.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Beatys Butte\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 64. In 1865, the United States Army decided that it needed a fort in southeastern Oregon to facilitate the interdiction of Indian raiding parties passing through the area. In 1866, a detachment from Fort Boise was sent to establish the fort. The soldiers arrived on the east side of Warner Valley in late summer. Unable to cross the valley's long chain of lakes and marshes, the soldiers built a winter camp on the east slope of Hart Mountain, overlooking the Catlow Valley. This outpost was called Camp Warner (later known as Old Camp Warner). The camp was sited poorly, and the men had a very difficult winter. In February 1867, General George Crook visited the outpost. Citing the camp's poor location, Crook ordered that the post be moved to the west side of the Warner Valley. When the new camp was finished in July 1867, Old Camp Warner was abandoned. Today, all that remains of Old Camp Warner is two military graves.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Camp Warner\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 152.Bach, Melva M., \\"Camp Warner Moved to Honey Creek ‚Äì 1867\\" (PDF), History of the Fremont National Forest, Fremont National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Lakeview, Oregon, 1981, p. 14.Hutchings, Terri Crockett, \\"Pvt Lewis Debold\\", non-cemetery burial, www.findagrave.com, Provo, Utah, 13 March 2010. In 1865, the United States Congress authorized the construction of the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road from Eugene, Oregon, to Fort Boise in Idaho. Congress allowed the construction company to claim three sections of land for every mile of road built. As a result, road surveyors laid out a route designed to pass through as much well-watered land as possible. The route of the military road came through the Warner Valley, passed south of Hart Mountain through what is today the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, and then east through the Catlow Valley. However, the road was little more than a trail, and it was rarely used.\\"Oregon Central Military Road\\", Oregon State Office, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, 17 September 2009.\\"Oregon History: Uncle Sam's Handiwork\\", Oregon Blue Book, Oregon State Archives, Office of the Secretary of State, State of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 17 September 2009. Cattle ranchers began using the Catlow Valley in the latter part of the 19th century. The first to arrive was Peter French in 1872, locating one of his five ranches in the valley. Another cattle rancher, John Catlow, followed in 1874. Catlow never owned land in the valley, but he grazed cattle there in the mid-1870s. David Shirk, one of Catlow's foremen, named the valley after his boss.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Catlow\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 180.\\"A Little Bit of Malheur History\\" , Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Princeton, Oregon, 10 November 2008.Conkling, Charles, E. R. Jackman, and John Scharff, \\"Catlow Valley\\", Steens Mountain in the Oregon's High Desert Country, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, 1979, pp. 174-176. Shirk was soon joined by his brother, William. In 1876, the two Shirk brothers established a ranch in the Catlow Valley, near water sources around Home and Threemile creeks. This put the Shirk brothers at odds with French, who already controlled much the valley's water. In 1889, David Shirk killed one of French's ranch hands in a dispute over water rights. While a jury decided it was self-defense, the Shirk brothers moved their main ranch to a location south of Beatys Butte to minimize future conflict with French and his employees.\\"Shirk Ranch\\" (PDF), Cultural Resource Inventory: Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge and Hart Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, February 1985, pp. 57‚Äì70. =20th century= Unincorporated town of Blitzen In the early 1900s, a surge of dry-land farmers arrived in the Catlow Valley. They were drawn by the prospect of free land offered by the federal government's Homestead Act. People's interest in the area was increased by newspaper articles promising that a railroad would soon be built through the valley.\\"Harriman on Map\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 13 August 1907, p. 8.Embree, T.V.B., \\"Harney, Land of Promise\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 27 July 1908, p. 12. By 1916, there were over 700 settlers living in the Catlow Valley. To support these settlers, small unincorporated communities were established across the valley. These sites included Beckley, Delaine, Catlow, Berdugeo, Sageview, Tiara, and Blitzen. Most of these sites were little more than a general store with an attached post office.Maxwell, Ben, \\"Rough Road Through Catlow Valley Recalls Hard-Scrabble Existence of Early, Settlers\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 14 October 1963, p. 6. Beckley was founded in 1911 as a single store. A post office was added the following year. The Beckley post office remained open for 14 years, closing in 1926.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Beckley\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 67. Delaine was located at the west edge of the valley on a lower slope of Hart Mountain, in Lake County. Its post office was opened in 1912, then closed exactly one year later.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Delaine\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, pp. 275‚Äì276. The Catlow post office was opened in 1914 and remained open until 1923. The Berdugo post office was opened near the Roaring Springs Ranch in 1915. It closed two years later.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Berdugo\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 74. Sageview was located on the west side of the valley. A post office was the only building at the site. The post office was opened in 1916 and closed in 1918.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Sageview\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 836. The Tiara post office was open from May 1916 to January 1917.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Tiara\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 953. The largest and oldest community in the Catlow Valley was Blitzen. Its post office was opened in 1916. However, there were only three families left in Blitzen in 1924. By 1928, there were fewer than 100 people living in the entire valley. The Blitzen post office continued to operate as a small rural delivery site until it was closed in 1943.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Blitzen\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 90.Saunders, Lucile F., \\"Retreat of Oregon Antelope Land of Lava Rock, Sage, Dust Whirlpools and Peculiar Houses\\", Section 4, The Sunday Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 21 September 1924, p. 10.Maxwell, Ben, \\"Where Jackrabbits have Roads\\", The Sunday Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 9 September 1928, p. 6. Today, there is no evidence of habitation at any of these sites except at the ghost town of Blitzen, where there are still a few deteriorated buildings at the town site.\\"Blitzen\\", Burns Times-Herald, Burns, Oregon, 20 May 1987.  Human activity  Today, there are no incorporated towns or unincorporated communities in the Catlow Valley, but only a few scattered ranches. Agriculture is the primary source of income for those living in the valley. Much of the private land in the valley is used to grow winter feed for local cattle herds. Wells provide groundwater for large irrigation circles and pipe irrigation systems in the valley. Because of the short growing season, the valley's principal crops are wild hay and alfalfa.Conkling, Charles, E. R. Jackman, and John Scharff, \\"The Mashlands\\", Steens Mountain in the Oregon's High Desert Country, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, 1979, pp. 42‚Äì43. The largest ranch in the Catlow Valley is the Roaring Springs Ranch. It includes of deeded property plus grazing rights on an additional of public land. The ranch is located below Catlow Rim, where a large spring gushes from fissures in the rim wall. The spring feeds numerous ponds and meadows, providing habitat for wildlife as well as productive range land for cattle. The ranch has of irrigated meadow lands that produce of alfalfa each year.Cockle, Richard, \\"Federal Bureaucrat, Oregon Cowboy Swap Jobs as Learning Experience\\",The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 27 July 2008. The ghost town of Blitzen is located on property owned by the ranch. In 2007, the Roaring Springs Ranch won the Environmental Stewardship Award sponsored by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the United States Department of Agriculture.\\"Environmental Stewardship Award Past Winners\\" (PDF), National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Centennial, Colorado, 13 April 2014. All of the public land in the Catlow Valley is administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). These public lands offer a number of recreational opportunities including hiking, hunting, fishing, bird watching, wildlife viewing, photography, and camping. Among the most popular game animals for hunters are mule deer, pronghorn, and chukars. Several of the canyon streams that flow into the valley offer the opportunity for trout fishing. There are no developed campgrounds in the valley; however, dispersed camping is allowed on land administered by the BLM. The availability of potable water is a limiting factor for both day-use visitors and campers.  High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway  Frenchglen-Hart Mountain Road The nearest town to the Catlow Valley is Burns, Oregon, the county seat of Harney County. Burns is approximately north of the valley. To reach the Catlow Valley from Burns, follow the High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway south. The drive takes several hours. From Burns, travel east on Oregon Route 78 for , then turn south on Oregon Route 205 toward Frenchglen. This highway crosses the Harney Basin, passing over The Narrows between Harney and Malheur lakes, and traverses the length of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to Frenchglen. Continue on Route 205 through the small unincorporated community of Frenchglen and over a low pass approximately into the northeast corner of the Catlow Valley.\\"High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway\\" (PDF), Oregon State Scenic Byways, Oregon Department of Transportation, Salem, Oregon, 13 April 2014. Oregon Route 205 is the only paved road in the Catlow Valley. It follows Catlow Rim approximately before turning east towards Fields, located on the far side of Steens Mountain. The High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway ends at Fields. The main east‚Äìwest road through the Catlow Valley is a rough gravel road that connects to Route 205 at the north end of the valley. It is not part of the High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway. After crossing the valley, the road leads west to the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, from the Route 205 junction. This road is not passable year-round; therefore, travelers should contact the local Bureau of Land Management office in Burns or the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge headquarters before taking it. There is no gas available along the road until the traveler reaches Plush, west the refuge headquarters. Plush is east of Lakeview. Lakeview is the nearest incorporated city west of the Catlow Valley.

She is the founder of the Share the Road Cycling Coalition, an urban transportation policy and advocacy group she created following the death of her husband OPP Sergeant Greg Stobbart, in a collision in June 2006. Background McMahon was born and raised in Windsor, Ontario. She was employed on Parliament Hill as press secretary successively for Herb Gray, John Turner and Jean Chr√©tien. Other roles included Director of Public Affairs at the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women, Vice President at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Director of Public Affairs at Petro-Canada, Director, Public Affairs Sustainable Development Technology Canada, Vice President at United Way Ottawa, and Executive Director of Public Affairs at the Ontario Medical Association. Cycling advocate After her husband was killed by a driver with a suspended license in 2006, McMahon founded the Share the Road Cycling Coalition. Her husband was training for a triathlon at the time of his death, and was cycling on Tremaine Road in Milton. She pressed the government to amend the Highway Traffic Act to toughen the law regarding drivers who drive with suspended licences. The amendment, known as Greg's Law was passed in April 2009. In 2010, Share the Road released a policy Green Paper (When Ontario Bikes, Ontario Benefits) in order to advise the Government of Ontario on how best to proceed with much needed policy changes and strategy bicycle strategy and made an evidence-based case for infrastructure funding, education, legislative change and highlighted opportunities including bicycle travel and route development. In 2012, she successfully called for a provincial Coroner's Review into Cycling Deaths in Ontario, and sat as a member of the Review Team. Central to that review was the call for the province to release a Provincial Cycling Policy and in 2013, working with Transportation Minister Glen Murray together they released the first Ontario Cycling Strategy in 20 years ‚Äî CycleON. In April 2014 McMahon again joined Murray in the announcement of $25 million government investment strategy in cycling infrastructure. In 2015, Ontario passed a one-metre safe passing law as part of Bill 31, becoming the second province in Canada to do so. McMahon had advocated for the law prior to her election. In 2017 as Minister of Tourism Culture and Sport McMahon announced two important cycling related policies. The first, $100 M in cycling infrastructure funding in municipalities across Ontario, represented the single greatest investment in cycling in Ontario's history. The other, was an important legislative change stemming from the collision that took McMahon's husband's life in 2006. McMahon led the passage of two important amendments to the Highway Traffic Act, stemming from a Private Member's Bill she tabled in 2016. These amendments ‚Äî Careless Driving Cause Death, and Careless Driving Cause Bodily Harm created the toughest penalties for Careless Driving in Canada. In addition, the legislative change resulted in, for the first time, road user vulnerability being taken into consideration at sentencing. If a motorist is convicted of Careless Driving involving a pedestrian or cyclist, the penalties are enhanced due to their vulnerability. This legislation is the first of its kind in Canada. Politics On January 30, 2014, McMahon was nominated as the Liberal candidate for the riding of Burlington. On June 12, 2014, McMahon defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Jane McKenna by 3,507 votes. Eleanor McMahon, Ontario Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport in June 2016.

He is chiefly remembered as one of six Founders of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity in 1873. Early life Jabez William Clay, born in 1852, was of Green Mountain stock. He was born in Fairlee, Vermont to William B. Clay and Martha M. (Carpenter) Clay.Ancestry.com, public record search, accessed 22 April 2014 He had prepared for college in the Powers Institute of Bernardston, Massachusetts. Enrolling at Massachusetts Agricultural College, he was twenty-one years of age in 1873, and a sophomore when he and his closest college friends determined to create the secret society for which he provided the first glimmer of an idea. (p. 23) Collegiate Activities \\"Clay was a giant both in body and in mind.\\" (p. 16) Rand's 1923 history cites one example of Clay's physical prowess, assuming a common view at the time that Native Americans were excellent wrestlers and skilled at hand-to-hand combat: \\"At one time Clay roomed with an American Indian, a government prot√©g√© whom he [Clay] had tutored for admission to college. On the evening of a Fourth of July this Indian came in upon a little party which Clay was giving to some of his friends, resented the assumed slight of not having been invited himself, and during the night attacked his roommate with fixed bayonet. Clay in some miraculous way parried the thrust and grappled with his opponent. The struggle lasted for some time and was becoming truly desperate when some of the other men broke in and brought it to an end.\\" (ibid) Clay excelled in school, and was considered \\"original and creative in his thinking powers.\\" (p. 18) During his freshman year he won the Pioneer Scholarship offered by the class of '71. Clay graduated as the second ranking student in 1875, his senior year, placing behind another Phi Sig, William Penn Brooks, who was the valedictorian. Clay's commencement address upon the sun as the great source of power was described by a hearer as \\"superb.\\" While at \\"Aggie,\\" Clay was a member of the Washington Irving Literary Society, a popular pastime among the undergraduates, he at one time being its president. He was a member and officer of the Gymnastic Association, and was an editor of the 1875 version of the college yearbook. He chafed somewhat under military discipline in the battalion, and actually left school for a short while because of this. He was a member of varsity crew (rowing team) in 1873. Overall, a popular young man, his peers honored Clay at one point by election as president, captain and orator of his class. Yet among all these activities and honors, it was his role as a Founder of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity in his Sophomore year by which he is best remembered today. > Years later, Founder Barrett recalled, \\"If in 1873 there was a strong and > original mind among the students of the Massachusetts Agricultural College, > it was domiciled in the tall and angular form of Clay. Beneath a somewhat > austere exterior, there existed strength of character, abundant good > fellowship, and a humor that occasionally developed deviltry. From him came > the first thought that later resulted in our Fraternity, and it was an > afterthought that saved certain guileless ones from initiation into a secret > society where the sole ambition was to conduct the attendant ceremonies with > the most telling effect. Certain pranks of the chemical laboratory suggested > great possibilities in this direction, and Clay sought reliable assistance, > thus enlisting Barrett, Brooks, Campbell, Clark and Hague, all of his own > class.\\" (p.23) While Founder Hague gave Clark the nod of credit to his role during those early days, generally the Founders were quick to praise each other's contribution with equanimity, acknowledging each provided an important element to the whole. Yet Barrett would again give the final nod to Clay: \\"And the leader, who was he? Seventy-five had but one leader in all matters requiring originality, foresight, energy, and perseverance. None of his class will demur to the statement that Clay was the leader of us all. It is the fibre of his mind, woven into this fraternal fabric, that largely contributes to its strength, durability and beauty.\\" (p. 24) The first president of the as-yet- unnamed Society was Clay.(p. 27) Soon maturing from a focus on initiation pranks through the realization that they had something of real lasting value, Clay helped write a formal constitution and required each meeting to have a healthy literary program. After Graduation Upon graduation, Clay, like his good friend and fraternity brother Barrett, engaged with the William H. Bowker Fertilizer Co. He moved to New York to manage the office there, remaining active with the alumni for those first few formative years. He was elected - Rand says \\"naturally\\" - to form the Grand Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa in 1878 as its first president, and minutes show that he contributed financially to the Fraternity as an alumnus., page 19. Clay died of pneumonia at the age of 28 on October 1, 1880, at his home in New York City. Sadly, and making his passing even more poignant, the young man was about to be married, and was finally married, in fact, from his death bed.

The dieter does not eat anything while on the diet. It has also been called the \\"Feeding Tube\\" diet in the United States. The diet carries several serious medical risks and is not effective in achieving long-term weight loss.  Nature of the diet  In KE diet, a feeding tube is inserted through the nose of an individual down their oesophagus. At the other end of the tube is an electric pump. The only nourishment the patient receives is KE diet powder ‚Äì an infusion of proteins, fats and micronutrients with no carbohydrates ‚Äì mixed with water through the feeding tube. The patient only takes in about 800 calories a day, but the infusion is constant and the absence of carbohydrates curbs hunger. The dieter does not need hospitalization but requires doctor supervision and can carry the pump and liquid with them. The pump can be removed for up to one hour a day. While on diet, the individual cannot eat anything and may only drink water, tea, coffee (with no milk, sugar or sweeteners) or sugar-free herb teas with the tube in. Laxatives may be given to dieters to ease constipation caused by the diet. Practitioners screen their patients before administering the diet to them and monitor them with blood and urine tests during the diet. The diet does not stop someone from gaining weight in the future. Following the diet, the dieter has to continue a low- carb, high protein diet to keep the weight off.  Safety and effectiveness  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics say it carries a number of serious risks including pulmonary aspiration and infection. Professor of nutritional science Laura Matarese has said \\"I don't know any reputable physician or any reputable health care practitioner who would say that this is a good idea.\\" People who lose weight via the KE diet are at risk of weight gain and binge eating once the diet ceases. The reported side effects of the diet include constipation, bad breath, dizziness and lack of energy. If the process of ketosis is continued for long periods, it may start to eat away at muscles, which could be dangerous. The diet could be dangerous for people with kidney disease and heart problems. Critics of the diet claim it's unhealthy and may cause infection of the lung, kidney failure and erosion of tissues in the nose and throat. According to David L. Katz, another potential danger is the development of eating disorders in connection with crash dieting. Other claimed short-term risks involve insertion trauma, septum damage, perforated throat, lung damage, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Critics of the diet also claim that weight loss with KE diet won't last. Following the diet it is up to the patient to keep the weight off.  In the media  KE diet was introduced in the US by Oliver Di Pietro, a doctor by profession, in 2011. The diet gained considerable media attention when Jessica Schnaider, a woman who received the diet from Di Pietro before her wedding, was profiled in the New York Times. The diet was then profiled by the New York Times and Good Morning America, among other sources. Subsequently, the diet was strongly criticized by the public. Medical field experts called the diet \\"unhealthy and dangerous.\\" A headline on National Review‚Äôs website read, \\"End of the World Watch: The ‚ÄòFeeding Tube‚Äô Diet.\\" After interviewing Schnaider, Good Morning America reported that \\"more and more brides\\" were using the diet. Di Pietro was criticized for offering the diet. Michael Cirigliano, the medical expert for the television station Fox 29 in Philadelphia, dismissed the diet as \\"the most ludicrous, ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever heard of.\\" He cited risks, like sinus infections.

Evans (born September 21, 1958) is currently serving as the executive director of public safety and chief of police of Boston College. Previously, Evans was the commissioner of the Boston Police Department from January 2014 until August 2018. Evans served as interim commissioner from November 2013 until he was permanently appointed by newly elected mayor Marty Walsh (politician). He announced his retirement from the Boston Police Department in July 2018. He currently serves as the chief of the Boston College police department. Early life William Evans was born in South Boston, the son of Paul and Catherine Evans, and one of six brothers. His father was a truck driver and his mother was a housewife and homemaker. He grew up in a crowded triple-decker apartment in South Boston, where he shared a bed with two brothers. His mother died when he was three years old, and six years later, the brother he was closest to was struck and killed by a car. When he was fifteen years old, his father died. He was raised by his four older brothers, the eldest of whom was Paul, who is the current executive vice president of security and compliance for Suffolk Downs. They enrolled him in Saint Sebastian's School in Needham, Massachusetts. After graduation, Evans attended Chaminade University for one year before returning to Boston. Upon his return he enrolled at Suffolk University, graduating in 1982. Boston Police Department =Early years= In 1980, Evans joined the Boston Police Department cadet program. He worked in administrative positions in the department's District Four in the South End at night and attended class at Suffolk University during the day. Evans joined the Boston Police Department in 1982. He spent five years as a patrolman, during which time he was awarded the BPD's Medal of Honor for his role in apprehending an armed robbery suspect following a high-speed chase. In 1987 he scored the highest grade in his class on the sergeant's exam. Five years later he earned one of the highest grades on the lieutenant's test and in 1997 he received the highest grade in his class on the captain's exam. =Captain= As a captain, Evans was first stationed in District 14, which consisted of the Allston‚ÄìBrighton section of Boston. It was the BPD's most densely populated district and contained 75,000 residents. This district included Harvard Business School, Harvard Stadium, Boston College, and Boston University. He dealt with a number of issues involving college students, including public intoxication, noise complaints, and fighting. He pushed for stricter alcohol policies during tailgating for the Harvard‚ÄìYale football game, refused to sign off on a Snoop Dogg concert at Harvard, which he feared would attract \\"the wrong element,\\" unless more officers were hired (which led to the concert being canceled). To smooth over relations between the schools and the Police Department, Evans took college administrators on ride-alongs, addressed students during orientation week, and pressured landlords to pay closer attention to troublesome properties. In 2006 he moved to District 4, which covered the South End and Fenway. In 2008 Evans graduated from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. =Superintendent= In 2009, Evans was promoted to superintendent in charge of the Bureau of Field Services. In this position he oversaw special events and the department's patrol division. Evans played a role in the peaceful handling of Occupy Boston's 70-day occupation of Dewey Square. He served as a go-between for the protesters and the department and ensured that there were no violent confrontations between protesters and police like those that occurred at other camps. Boston Marathon bombings Evans ran the 2013 Boston Marathon and was at the Boston Athletic Club when he was informed by an officer that two bombs went off. Evans returned home for his uniform and then went to the temporary command post at the Westin Hotel. There, he and Commissioner Edward F. Davis designed a plan of action, which Evans took to the streets to implement. Under Evans, the department secured a perimeter around a 20-block radius, swept the scene for secondary devices, and began processing the evidence. When President Barack Obama came to Boston to attend an interfaith service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Evans and his team were responsible for securing the area. They developed a plan to get the President and First Lady in and out of the five different hospitals they visited. Evans also played a role in the manhunt and capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He helped secure the area of the Watertown shootout, process the crime scene, and evacuate nearby houses, as there were live explosives on the scene. He remained in Watertown during the manhunt and stayed even after Governor Deval Patrick lifted the shelter-in-place order. After the 911 call reporting Tsarnaev's location came in, Evans, two BPD Lieutenants, and a Watertown Police Officer were the first officers at the scene. Evans took control of the scene and was the incident commander during the standoff with Tsarnaev. Shots rang out at one point during the standoff and Evans commanded the officers to hold their fire, as he wanted to take Tsarnaev alive for information. After talking with an FBI negotiation team, Tsarnaev surrendered to authorities. =Commissioner= On November 1, 2013, Mayor Thomas Menino named Evans interim commissioner of the Boston Police Department. In January 2014, Mayor Marty Walsh selected Evans to serve as police commissioner on a permanent basis. He was portrayed by James Colby in the 2016 film Patriots Day. On July 23, 2018, Evans announced he would step down as commissioner of the Boston Police Department after having served 39 years and starting a position with the public safety department at Boston College beginning on August 6. He was succeeded by his superintendent in chief, William G. Gross, who became Boston's first police commissioner of color.

She climbed extensively in the Dolomites with several first ascents and is credited as a pioneer in the field of women's climbing. Early life Jeanne Immink was born into a German-Jewish family in Amsterdam in 1853, the eldest daughter of Friedrich \\"Frederik\\" Diest and Hermina Heijbroek. After her father died, Immink's mother and three sisters suffered financially; to escape her poverty Jeanne married Johannes Carolus \\"Karel\\" Immink after finishing high school, with whom she migrated to Pretoria, South Africa. They had one son together before Jeanne began an affair with Henry Percy Douglas-Willan, a British dragoon captain stationed in Pretoria, and followed him to India, leaving her husband and son in South Africa. When Immink fell pregnant again, she relocated to Switzerland since British officers were not permitted to marry or have children before the age of 30. In Switzerland, she became financially independent as she received significant funds from Douglas-Willan to support their son, Louis Immink. Career Immink on the Kleine Zinne, 1893 Immink began climbing in the Dolomites shortly after moving to Switzerland. She made her first major climb in 1889 as she ascended a new route on the Ortler in South Tyrol with a guide. The same year, she made the first female ascent of the Antelao. In 1891 she ascended the Schmitt Chimney of F√ºnffingerspitze in the Langkofel Group, a year after Robert-Hans Schmitt made the first ascent and expressed doubt that the route would ever be climbed again. She climbed an as-yet unnamed and unclimbed mountain in the Dolomites in 1891 which has since been named the Cima Immink. In 1893, German climber and photographer Theodor Wundt asked Immink if she would accompany him on an ascent of the Kleine Zinne (Cima Piccola) of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo; his photographs of her were later published in his book Wanderungen in den Ampezzaner Dolomiten. This would be her final expedition before she retired from climbing in 1894, having sustained an injury from a previous trip. Although her climbing career spanned only five years, Immink made over 70 climbs and earned a reputation for choosing the most difficult peaks and routes of the time and attracting the respect of her male peers. She was well aware of her role as a leading woman climber, and wrote after one climb: \\"I challenge the male mountaineers to follow in my steps.\\" She was a member of the Austrian Alpine Club and the Club Alpino Italiano. Legacy Immink was the subject of a biography published by journalist Harry Mur√© in 2003, titled Jeanne Immink: Die Frau, die in die Wolken stieg (\\"Jeanne Immink: The Woman Who Climbs in the Clouds\\"). Mur√© wrote that Immink noted her pioneering role in women's alpinism, writing that she \\"achieved glory and honor in the male-dominated field of Alpine mountaineering\\". She was the first female climber to wear pants rather than a skirt, and is credited with the invention of the climbing harness.

History A headline from The Intelligencer warns of violence following the courthouse raid in 1893 When Tucker County, West Virginia was created in 1856 out of Randolph County, the enabling act also called for the county seat, where the country court would be located, to be in Westernford, originally known as \\"Fort Minear\\" and first settled in 1776. The name of the town was directed to be changed to \\"St. George\\" to complement the name of the county, which honored Henry St. George Tucker, Sr., a local judge and U.S. Congressman.Maxwell, Hu History of Tucker County Kingwood, West Virginia: Preston Publishing, 1884.

This brought about the rise of the new lumber town of Parsons, built on land along the rail line owned by Ward Parsons, who had a civil engineer lay out lots for the town. In 1888 and 1889, Parsons led a drive to petition the county court to hold an election to approve moving the county seat to the town of Parsons. This election took place in 1890, but the change was not approved, failing to receive the necessary 60% majority. Parson tried again in 1892, but the results were the same. However, the next attempt, in 1893, was successful: after one election which was declared invalid on a legal technicality, a second one received the necessary margin of victory for Parsons. Some of the leaders of St. George suspected that there were irregularities in the second election, and asked the county court to set aside the results; this request was denied. St. George appealed to the state government, asking for an injunction pending an investigation, but before that could happen, the people of Parsons, annoyed by the attempt to repeal the election results, marched to St. George on August 7, 1893,One source gives the date as August 1. See with the purpose of taking the court's records, thus moving the seat to Parson by force. Descriptions of the size of the vigilante group vary from 200 armed men to over a thousand, 700 from Parsons and 400 from along the rail line. A group of citizens of St. George turned out to counter the Parsons contingent, but, fearing the possibility of violence and deaths, the Sheriff ordered them to disperse. By the time the group from Parsons arrived, there were few people around to stop them from breaking into the courthouse and stealing the records, as well as the bell from the building's tower. After encamping overnight at a nearby farm, they returned to Parsons and established a temporary courthouse in an unopened store on Main Street. This was used as the Tucker County Court until a new courthouse was built in 1900. The town of St. George has never regained the prominence it lost by the removal of the county seat. It is now an unincorporated community.

Originally constructed in 1921, the bridge was part of U.S. Route 80, a major transcontinental highway, from 1926 to 1956. Being the oldest bridge of its kind in Arizona, the Ci√©nega Bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Currently, the bridge carries Marsh Station Road. History In 1920, the Arizona Highway Department began construction on a section of the Borderland Highway in southeastern Arizona. The Borderland Highway was part of the larger Dixie Overland Highway, Bankhead Highway and Old Spanish Trail auto trails, which were important early transcontinental highways. The Highway Department received financial aid for the project from the federal government under Federal Aid Project Number 18 as well as a Pima County bond issue and the Cochise County Road Fund. As part of the highway construction, the Highway Department needed to build a large bridge over a chasm known as Ci√©nega Canyon, a natural feature of Ci√©nega Creek, near the town of Vail. Running parallel through the canyon with the creek was the main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad). State engineers decided to design an open-spandrel concrete arch bridge to cross the canyon. The arch would measure in length and would be a combination of two tapered ribs connecting the foundation arch to the bridge deck, supplemented by multiple concrete columns, supporting the deck. Paneled bulkheads and concrete guard rails would be placed on the sides of the bridge deck. The part of the bridge spanning the railroad would be a two span section with three piers supported by a concrete girder structure. In total, the bridge would have 5 spans, with four being approach spans. The overall length of the bridge would be with a width of . The main architect of the bridge was state engineer Merrill Butler. The exact location of the bridge was chosen due to it being the most feasible area to the place the bridge as well as the high solid rocky banks providing added support. Upon finalizing the bridge design, the Highway Department awarded construction of the bridge to a Tucson based firm called English and Pierce. Construction materials would be provided by the Highway Department. The new bridge was internally referred to as \\"Section F\\" of the Borderland Highway construction project. Construction of Ci√©nega Bridge started in 1920. Over of rock had to be blasted to make way for the bridge foundations. The total amount of concrete poured measured while the amount of reinforcing steel used weighed over . Erecting of the false work was a risky endeavor, as the contractors had to deal with the possibility of high water levels generated by the creek. Due to a dispute with the contractor, construction of the bridge was taken over completed by the Highway Department. The Highway Department claimed English and Pierce exceeded the original contracted price necessitating state takeover. Construction of the bridge was completed in March 1921 at a total cost of $40,000. Starting in 1926, the Borderland Highway was designated as part of U.S. Route 80, a transcontinental highway which stretched from Tybee Island, Georgia to San Diego, California. The Ci√©nega Bridge became a heavily traveled section of US 80 which had gained a dangerous reputation by the 1950s, becoming one of the most dangerous roads in the state of Arizona. Between 1952 and 1955, 11 people were killed in different car accidents on the bridge. The route leading to the bridge included an eight degree downhill curve just before the foot of the concrete structure. The bridge itself was an over drop above the creek. Construction started in 1952 on a bypass route which included a new railroad underpass and two wash bridges. The new straighter alignment opened on April 9, 1955, moving US 80 designation off Ci√©nega Bridge onto a newer bridge downstream. The new Ci√©nega Bridge was only above the creek as opposed to the original bridge and had a straighter more even graded approach. Upon the opening of the new route, ownership of the old bridge was transferred to Pima County. US 80 itself was replaced by Interstate 10 in 1977. The Ci√©nega Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 30, 1988. The majority of the bridge's structure remains unaltered, save for the guardrails, which were replaced by Jersey barriers in 1989. Although the guardrail replacement has slightly weakened the bridge's overall structural integrity, it does not pose a significant threat. The Ci√©nega Bridge is the oldest surviving open-spandrel arch bridge in Arizona.

According to the Malleus Maleficarum.Malleus Maleficarum, (German: Hexenhammer) II,16 around 1430 there was an extremely accurate archer named Punker who was rumoured to possess supernatural powers. It was said that he had enabled the capture of a castle (castrum Lendenbrunnen, presumably Lindelbrunn near Dahn) almost single-handed with deadly shots from his bow. In addition a legend about him, similar to one told about the Swiss William Tell, is recounted in Malleus Maleficarum. The story goes that even the Count Palatine, Louis III of the Rhine, was in awe of Punker, so outstandingly accurate he was, whether on the battlefield or in the hunt. In order to try and trap him into admitting his magic powers, he ordered him to use his own son as a target and shoot a penny from the top of his beret. If he failed, the penalty was death. For a long time, Punker refused because he was worried that the devil might cause his normally safe hands to waver. Eventually he agreed to the test. Punker placed a bolt in his crossbow and then drew a second and tucked it in his tunic. He then fired and struck the penny off without grazing the boy's beret.

According to \\"Last Chance High\\" the parents were told the school was closed while the teachers were told they were getting more students in 2016. This was done so that no parents would know to show up for the \\"public hearings\\" to decide if the school should be shut down. Since no parents were told about public hearings or that the school was technically still open, they were forced to either put their children back into public schools where they were expelled from previously or pay for private therapeutic schools. Chicago public school district says they sent out letters to the parents about when hearings would be held but no parents ever received these letters. The school closed in 2016 and had been bought by another private school that opened in 2018. Teachers and administrators in the Chicago Public Schools often used the threat of \\"being sent to Montefiore\\" as an effective disciplinary tool. In 2010, the school had 62 students in grades 5‚Äì8. Prior to 2010 there had been a decline in enrollment and Micah Maidenberg of the Chicago Journal wrote that \\"Staff and administrators at Montefiore had feared closure\\". In 2010 CPS announced plans to add a high school division to Montefiore with a plan to make it a 6-12 school; at the time the district administration was recommending Bartholome De Las Casas Occupational School, which had 82 students, for closure.

Dyer grew up in Hawthorn and Hastings. Dyer was educated at a convent school in Abbotsford where she was the only Aboriginal pupil. She would frequently travel to New South Wales to stay with her mother's family at Cummeragunja Mission. When Dyer's father was serving overseas during World War II, Dyer, aged 15, left school to enter the workforce, where she experienced significant racism. Dyer's first marriage, to Alan Burns in 1947, produced six children all of whom were to become involved in Aboriginal community work and activism, and then married Charlie Dyer. In addition to her six biological children, Dyer would foster 19 children and provide short term accommodation for many more throughout her life. In the 1960s and 1970s, Dyer worked with a group of fellow Aboriginal women to establish and deliver services to the Aboriginal community despite a lack of funding. In 1966, Dyer accepted a full-time position with the Aborigines Advancement League, continuing and formalising her welfare work. When the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service was established in 1973, Dyer moved to a position there.

School safety and bullying The Muhlenberg School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the high school in 2012. Additionally, there were eight thefts and 2 sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in nine incidents at the schools. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. The federal No Child Left Behind Act established the Unsafe School Choice Option. Each state that receives federal funds was mandated to establish a statewide policy requiring that a student at a ‚Äúpersistently dangerous‚Äù public school be allowed to transfer/enroll in a safe public school. The policy permitted a student who becomes the victim of a violent criminal offense, while in or on the grounds of any public school that he or she attends, to transfer to a safe public school. Each year since 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Education has released a list of Persistently Dangerous Schools. Muhlenberg School District schools have not been included on the lists. The Muhlenberg School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. =Safe School grant= In 2013, Muhlenberg School District did not participate in a state Safe Schools Targeted Grant. The maximum of $25,000 grants were awarded through a competitive application process. The funds must be used for research based interventions, like: peer mediation, staff training in managing behavioral issues and creating a positive school climate. The district also did not apply for a police grant. Wellness policy Muhlenberg School Board established a district Wellness Policy in 2012. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. At Muhlenberg School District, the Assistant Superintendent is responsible for ensuring implementation and compliance with the wellness policy. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Muhlenberg High School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense medications to students during the school day. Muhlenberg High School offers both a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low-income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools.

History and profile Led by Aleksandar \\"Sa≈°a\\" Badanjak, Duga magazine was launched by the same staff that had previously worked on the Eva i Adam (Eve and Adam) erotic magazine. Having reached a circulation of 270,000 copies in SFR Yugoslavia, with particular popularity in SR Slovenia, Eva i Adam was eventually shut down in the early 1970s by executive order of the City Committee of the Communist League's Belgrade branch amid public morality accusations of 'spoiling the youth'. Just like at Eva i Adam previously, Badanjak assumed the editor-in-chief role at the newly-launched Duga as well. At its inception, the Belgrade-based biweekly magazine's initial circulation was around 90,000 copies.Planeta Duga quickly became famous for opposition to communism, and interviews with Yugoslav dissidents. In SFR Yugoslavia, from the 1980s especially, the media freedoms existed that were unimaginable in other communist countries. Nevertheless, chief editors were often sacked due to publishing controversial material. In the 1990s Duga continued controversial reporting, until Dada Vujasinovic was shot dead in 1994, possibly due to an unflattering article about the Serbian warlord and gangster Arkan. It also carried a column by Mira Markovic, wife of Slobodan Milosevic and sociology professor, that often had poetic reports about the seasons amid horrible events in the country, but also carried indirect announcements of high politics sackings in the government.

I am a Researcher I am Discovering Materials Science in sport Problem solving  Vision and mission  Vision Al-Bairaq aims to become a nationally and internationally renowned hub for school students that contributes to the growth of their interest in pursuing future high quality STEM education and research at the University. Mission Al-Bairaq's mission is to provide comprehensive, high quality STEM education and research projects that advance knowledge that advance knowledge in the field. Al-Bairaq collectively acts across all levels of the educational spectrum at Qatar University to recognize, attract, nurture and develop talent among Qatari students.  History  Al-Bairaq was established in 2010 under the leadership of Dr. Noora Al-Thani with the vision of developing scientific, experimental and research skills of high school students. The idea was to immerse K-12 students in scientific practice in order to enhance their scientific learning interests through hands-on activities. The program is successful in building appreciation and understanding of the role of scientists and researchers in real world, as they are driven to brainstorm solutions for real world technological problems. Moreover, the students are also motivated to look forward to empower themselves in line with the sustainability goals of Qatar National Vision 2030. Program tracks AL- Bairaq holds the bedrock for four tracks: I am a Researcher, I am Discovering Materials, Science in Sport, and Problem Solving. Students are driven through diverse activities for developing the key competencies consisting of critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, collaboration, curiosity and language of science. Each track facilitates different competitions bi- annually, wherein the students compete for several prizes and competitions. The competing candidates are evaluated by a selected panel of judges from different scientific, business, and industrial organizations. = I am a Researcher = I am a Researcher track is one of Al-Bairaq tracks that offers a unique opportunity for grade 12 students to be involved in the research field. Through this track students work as research assistants with faculty professors in the specialized labs of the Center for advanced materials (CAM) in Qatar University. The laboratory experience gained by students through this track increments their understanding about Material science, develops their research self-efficacy, leading to career choices in science and engineering. The goals of this track are accomplished by subjecting the students in a systematic process of inquiry-driven research environment designed through a curriculum of STEM related contemporary real-life research projects.Students therefore acquire learning outcomes that include generating a hypothesis, developing a plan for gathering data, and constructing evidence based on data consequently reaching out to conclusions either propagating forward to an advanced research or solving a scientific problem. As they propagate through the research process, they foster and cultivate scientific curiosity, problem solving capability and ultimately, the research methodology. http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/albiraq_news/alj_honoring_al_biraq_students.pdf Students demonstrate their understanding of the scientific concepts as well as their ideas and research outcomes via PowerPoint and other presentation tools. They present their research work to the community leaders, from diverse economical and industrial organizations. The students also exhibited artistic skills in photography and videography through competitions like 'Art in Science' and ' Best documentary film', where they capture the beautiful renditions and moments in research course. = I am Discovering Materials = This track aims to introduce the primary, preparatory and high school students to diverse topics or modules in materials science through hands-on activities that are designed in line with STEAM education curriculum. These modules are all designed to follow a unique structure, where three to four activities lead to a design project, thereby driving the students to lead an innovation. Through these activities, students learn about the different concepts of the topic through thorough investigation and research. The design project leads the students to think, innovate, brainstorm, design, test, and build their own product that implements a solution for an existing problem that revolves around the specific module.http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/albiraq_news/alj_qatari_program_for_young_researchers.pdf Our students designed many innovative ideas and projects; among which one of them is light-trash sorter and biodegradable plant pots. Students are also encouraged to establish the contributions of the STEM fields to the development of industrial sector and thereby, its influence on the economy. They are also enlightened on their contributions to the growth of scientific community in Qatar. Likewise in 'I am a Researcher' track, the students also participate in various inter-school competitions as hosted by the program to exhibit their work to the community and get recognized in the global innovators network. = Science in Sport = \\"Science in Sport\\" is one of the tracks that engages students from grade 10 and 11 through different sport activities that merges the science of design of the sport products and the efficiency of their performance on fields.

Shava sadhana is part of the Vamachara (heterodox, Left-hand path) practice of worship, which is followed by the esoteric Tantra. Shava sadhana is regarded as one of Tantra's most important, most difficult and most secret rituals. Tantric texts as well as oral tales detail the process of the ritual and also tell its importance. The purpose of practicing the ritual range from knowledge, propitiating a deity, material motives, even dark objectives to gaining control over the spirit of the deceased. There are strict rules that need to be followed in the ritual, even in selection of a suitable corpse for the ceremony. Textual references and oral legends The goddess Kali (pictured) is believed to have given the poet Ramprasad Sen a vision due to the practice of shava sadhana. The following Tantric texts detail the ritual process: Kaulavali-nirnaya, Shyamarahasya, Tara-bhakti-sudharnava, Purasharcharyarnava, Nilatantra, Kulachudamani and Krishnananda's Tantrasara. The Kali tantra says that those who worship goddess Parvati without shava sadhana will suffer in Naraka (hell) until dissolution of the world. An oral tale about the shava sadhana is told by the Tantrikas of Bengal. Vasudeva Bhattacharya of Tipperah (West Bengal) went to the Goddess temple of Kamakhya and worshipped the deity by Tantric means. A voice told him about the ritual and that he will gain moksha in his next life when he will be reborn as his own grandson Sarvananda. Vasudeva gave his servant Purvananda an engraved copper plate with a mantra. Purvananda, now an old man, now served Sarvananda, who he passed the secret of shava sadhana ritual, told by his former master. Purvananda volunteered to be used as the corpse for shava sadhana and Sarvananda performed the ritual, where ghosts tormented him; storms tried to interrupt his practice; beautiful dancers tempted him, until the Goddess gave him a vision. She blessed him with vak siddhi, the ability to make something happen by just saying it. She also revived the servant. Sarvananda became a siddha and the first tantrika to see the theophany of the Goddess' ten mahavidya forms. The Shakta poet Ramprasad Sen is also told to have performed the ritual and gained the vision of his patron, goddess Kali. Aim and importance Shava Sadhana is regarded the most important ritual in Shakta Tantra, particularly in West Bengal. Shaiva Aghoris from Varanasi are also known to practice this ritual. Shava sadhana is \\"the most secret part of Tantric mysticism\\" and is regarded one of the most \\"misunderstood\\" due to its non-Aryan nature. It is also regarded as the \\"most difficult form of spiritual practice\\". The sadhaka needs to adhere to all rules of the ritual and is warned that violation of the regulations may lead to dire consequences. Even a small mistake in the ritual can lead to death or insanity of the practitioner. Due to the intensity of consequences if the ritual is not properly done, a Tantric priest from Bolpur said that the ritual is rarely practiced in the area. The purpose to do shava sadhana varies from person to person. An aim of shava sadhana is to unite the Kundalini with Param Shiva. From a yogic or Tantric point of view, it signifies detachment from the physical world, and uniting with the Absolute, identified with the male god Shiva, the Divine Mother Shakti or the abstract Brahman. The detachment leads to freedom from Samsara (the cycle of birth, death and reincarnation) and the adept goes beyond the orthodox concepts of purity and impurity; auspiciousness and inauspiciousness. The ritual is done using a corpse, considered a highly impure and inauspicious symbol in traditional Hinduism. Since it deals with directly encountering death, it is believed to lead to non-death, symbolized by longevity, wealth and power. The ritual is said to erase the fear of death from the practitioner's mind. It may also be conducted to placate a personal deity. For Aghoris, the purpose is not spiritual, but simply to acquire the skull for rituals or gain power over the soul of the deceased so that he can act as a medium to other spirits or acquire powers to control them. Andre Padoux interprets shava sadhana as black magic which is done to accomplish evil motives. Selection of the corpse There are strict rules in the Tantra Shastra regarding the corpse. The corpse should be fresh and undamaged. No part of the body should be missing. There should not be deformity in any part; e.g. a one-eyed corpse would be rejected. The Tantrasara specifies that corpse may be human (preferred) or animal. In humans, the most preferred (maha-shava, great corpse) are a chandala (a child of a Shudra father and a Brahmin mother; an outcaste and the lowest of the mixed castes) who died due to drowning, lightning-strike, snake-bite, injury, or was killed by a stick, sword, spear, or other weapon; and a courageous young man who died in battle while fighting his enemy. Specific animals are also recommended in the text. Bhattacharya suggests that the Tantrika may even murder to get hold of a suitable corpse for shava sadhana. A young chandala boy may be intoxicated and then killed by the tantrika by deceit. However, Professor McDaniel notes that tantrikas she met in Tarapith disagreed. They believed that the appropriate corpse is chosen by the Goddess herself and murdering someone for the ritual is interfering with the Goddess' work. Some corpses are taboo for shava sadhana: that of a Brahmin (priest caste), of a cow (sacred Hindu animal), of a woman, of an aged man (age not specified), of a leper, of an \\"untouchable\\", of a beardless man, of a man whose genitals are not clearly visible, a man who died due to suicide or starvation/famine, of an apostate, and of a hen-pecked man. Though corpses of women are forbidden by the Tantrasara, a Tantric priest from Bolpur, West Bengal described how people used to use the corpse of a virgin girl for shava shadhana. The girl is believed to become the goddess Kali's vessel and speak in the ritual. In absence of human corpses or carcasses of specified animals, the carcass of any animal can be used. If even it is unavailable, a human figurine of Darbha (grass), rice, barley etc. can be used. In case an effigy cannot be made, sesame is sprinkled on the ground. According to Hindu belief, death happens on two levels: a physical death and a ritual death. The latter happens only after the kapala kriya ritual of the funeral, when the skull of the burnt corpse bursts or a hole is opened in it so the prana (life force) exits it. The corpse used for shava sadhana thus in an intermediate stage between life and death. Process Shava sadhana is conducted generally on a new moon day. The Tantrasara suggests or the eighth or fourteenth lunar day in a fortnight as well as Tuesdays are suitable for the ritual. The sadhaka is left alone with the corpse in the night. The Tantrasara recommends the following for the ritual: a shmashana (cremation ground) or cemetery, or an abandoned house, a riverbank, a mountain, a battlefield, near a bilva tree or any other lonely place. The ritual is generally done in a shmashana. Siddha pithas, sacred places reputed to grant siddhis may be preferred for the ritual. The sadhaka repeats a mantra while bringing the corpse to the designated site of the ceremony to purify it. In Shakta ritual as described in the Tantrasara, the corpse is worshipped with flowers and invoked as a form of Bhairava (a form of Shiva) and the seat of the Goddess and requested to awaken to please the Goddess. The corpse is washed and placed on tiger or deer skin or a bed of kusha grass. The hair and feet of the corpse may be tied. The corpse is believed to be a vessel of power while the rite is performed and tying the hair ensures that the energy does not escape. Another interpretation states that the bondage reflects the practitioner's desire to control the spirit of the corpse. Then, the sadhaka will sit on the corpse for meditation. In Shakta narratives, betel nut is put into the corpse's mouth and it is turned on its back and smeared with sandalwood paste. Shakta sandhakas draw a yantra on the back of the corpse and sit on it. The 64 yoginis and the guardians of the directions are worshipped with vegetarian offerings. The corpse-seat is again worshipped and the practitioner mounts the corpse like one sits on a horse. Another tradition says that the practitioner is expected to sit in Virasana (\\"the heroic pose\\"). The Tantrasara narrates that the practitioner should get off the corpse to draw a triangle or protective circle around him and the corpse or again to scatter mustard or sesame seeds in all directions. While meditating, the practitioner (whose goal is detachment) should think on what makes the corpse (who was alive till a day after) different from him and other living beings and thus discover the knowledge of the living force within all living beings. He (or she) identifies with the corpse and contemplates on the ephemeral nature of the body, whose dissolution leads to the discovery of the living force within. The sadhaka may also meditate on a deity. Offerings to the deity are put in the corpse's mouth. The practitioner may perform pranayama and meditate on his guru and the deity in his mind. He can also practice japa (repetition of a mantra or a deity's names or epithets), till the corpse promises him to grant his wish. He may encounter an Akashavani (a voice from the skies) which may try to tempt him with material things. He will experience terrifying visions and sounds as well as temptations; however the practitioner should remain untouched and concentrate on the meditation. On conducting the rite successfully, the sadhaka would be blessed with mantra-siddhi (a supernatural power to use a mantra) or become one with Shiva. Uniting with Shiva is said to lead to detachment, a characteristic of the ascetic god. Shiva is himself equated with shava, the corpse. As the vessel of Shiva, the adept becomes an avadhuta, a mystic who is beyond egoic-consciousness, duality and common worldly concerns. The Tantrasara says that a voice may ask for more offerings or bless the practitioner by granting his wishes. Shakta practitioners are said to have a theophany of the Goddess, in the form of a young girl or woman or in the sky or she may possess the corpse. The Shakta practitioner is considered to be a child of the Divine Mother, who is surrounded by fear, tormented by ghosts and demons and overcome with love towards her and needs to be rescued by the Mother. When the Goddess is said to possess the corpse, the corpse is considered sacred as a murti or vessel of the divine spirit. The head of the corpse is said to turn towards the devotee and begins speaking affectionately (or sometimes terrifyingly) with him. The devotee then asks for a boon (spiritual or worldly) that the Goddess is compelled to grant. Some practitioners regard that his own body becomes a corpse while performing the ritual. The Goddess fills life into him by possessing him. A sadhaka who becomes afraid when the corpse comes alive and falls inside the protective circle, dies; while one who falls outside is doomed to eternal insanity. The one who remains resolute is blessed with moksha (salvation) and \\"occult powers\\". Persons who practice shava sadhana with lower goals may be blessed with siddhis, but those in turn may lead to their downfall. At the end of the ritual, the corpse is freed from his bondage of rope and bathed again. The corpse is buried or immersed in a body of water. All articles of worship are also cast into the water. The untying of the rope and immersion of the corpse is believed to release the contained energy, accumulated while the ritual was on. Although it is generally recommended to be performed alone in a deserted place, a sadhu who performs shava sadhana may be sometimes aided by his Tantric female consort, who are known as uttara sadhika. She stays within the protective circle and helps the sadhu if he is getting distracted by the spirits. The sadhu may also call upon his guru (not physically present at the site) to protect him in the ritual. Aghoris of Varanasi are recorded to perform shava sadhana. The Aghoris of Varanasi perform shava sadhana with some difference in the ritual. The corpse is bound to a stake at the wrist or ankle by a silken thread and a protective circle drawn around it to keep evil spirits of the cremation ground away. The spirits are offered meat and liquor outside the circle. The spirits would try to talk with the practitioner and gain entry in the circle but he should ignore them until finally he will conquer them, forcing them to accept his offerings and leave. This is signified by the corpse's mouth opening a bit. An offering of kheer is put in the corpse's mouth. Finally, the Aghori decapitates the corpse to acquire its skull or extracts a bone from its spine to gain control over its soul. The remaining body is cast in the river. The rite should be followed by a period of asceticism to gain mastery of the soul of the deceased. While the Aghori sits on the corpse's chest and meditates, the ojha (exorcist or wizard) performs the ritual by seating on the stomach of the deceased. Related rituals Drinking of panchagavya and feeding of twenty-five Brahmins is prescribed with the rite. God is believed to possess the sadhaka for a fortnight after the ritual. He should stay away from material pleasures like coitus, dance and music in this period.

After the elections she had to choose between the two posts, and decided to retain her Lok Sabha seat and resigned from the Gird Legislative Assembly seat. At the time Gird was seen as a Scindia-BJS stronghold. The main contenders of the by-election were Maheshdutta Mishra and Balkrishna Sharma. Mishra was the candidate put forth by Scindia and represented the BJS. Scindia and other prominent BJS personalities conducted speaking tours across the vast constituency to support Mishra's candidacy, at least 50 jeeps were used the purpose. Sharma was a Communist Party of India leader with 35 years experience in working with the peasant movement in the area. The Indian National Congress had declared its support for Sharma's candidature, but local Congress leaders in Gwalior offered little support for him. The election was held on 5 June 1972. Sharma narrowly won the seat, largely due to support from the peasants. He got 12,704 votes compared to 11,915 votes for Mishra. There were also six independent candidates in the fray; B.

Melai played fifty games with reserves in the Victorian Football League during the early 1960s, and was part of Geelong's 1963 reserves premiership team, but he did not play a senior game for the club. He was cleared to , and played seven senior matches there during the 1964 season. In 1965, Melai crossed to Dandenong in the Victorian Football Association without a clearance. It was a historic transfer, as he was the first player to make the switch from the VFL to the VFA without a clearance after the VFA had terminated its transfer agreement with the VFL in April that year ‚Äì a consequence of the bitter deterioration in relations between the two competitions following North Melbourne's relocation to Coburg.

It was created in Marseille, France, in 1998. The band is famous for having developed from the start their own version of North Indian electronic music incorporating traditional instruments such as the sarod, the esraj and the sitar. The band Nataraj XT has since then broadened its tones with rock and jazz.  History  Nataraj XT started in a music festival in Marseille, France, and was signed soon after by a French record label after being discovered in French press like Lib√©ration. They won the \\"Electronic Talent\\" prize in 2000 at the Midem with Elegia Laurent Garnier. Their first album Tandava was recorded in a short time and with a low budget. Following an extensive tour across India and Europe, the band recorded their second album (Ocean Bird) with a higher budget, a Canadian label Nutone/Nettwerk, and a contract signed with EMI. In 2007, the Sitar player Pierre Grimoud died. The band released what should have been their last album Opposition. In 2008, Philippe Capitani and Richard Bernet decided to produce a new album with no sitar playing, Without Sitar, in order to keep the band alive. Despite the fact that the band is not well known among the French public, they do have a significant number of fans abroad. They were played in a large number of U.S.A Campuses and on the web. In 2012, the band was contacted by Artonik Dance Company from Marseille and was asked to compose the music of a show The Colour of Time based on a traditional Indian festival, Holi. A documentary about the show was filmed by France 3 French TV.

Biography  Smirnov was born in Odessa to a family of minor nobility originally from the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire. He graduated from the Mikhailovsky Artillery School and the General Staff Academy, and served as commandant of the Odessa Infantry Cadet School from 1986-1898. He was chief of staff of the Warsaw Fortress in 1899. In 1900, he was transferred to the Far East to command the Imperial Russian Army‚Äôs Second Infantry Brigade.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 359-360. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Smirnov was appointed commander of the fortress of Port Arthur, Manchuria with a total of over 50,000 men on 4 March 1904. Occupied by the Russians since 1897, the defenses of Port Arthur had been heavily enhanced and modernized in the intervening years, and its position was considered one of the most heavily fortified in the world. However, the previous commander, Anatoly Stessel, chose to interpret the orders to mean that Smirnov was assigned as his subordinate, and remained at Port Arthur, countermanding Smirnov's orders and denying his requests for supplies and reinforcements, and sending misleading telegrams to the Tsar blaming Smirnov for any setbacks. He also ignored orders from General Aleksei Kuropatkin direct orders to leave Port Arthur by a destroyer on 3 July 1904. Stessel's command of the Port Arthur defenses was ineffective throughout the Siege of Port Arthur. Port Arthur was surrendered to the Japanese on 1 January 1905 by Stessel and his close crony General Alexander Fok without consultation to other senior Russian staff, including Smirnov. After the end of the war, Smirnov published a condemnation of the events, charging Stessel, Fok and others of cowardice and dereliction of duty. He also testified at the court-martial which sentenced them to death on 7 February 1908. This sentence was later commuted to ten years imprisonment. For the charge of cowardice, he was challenged to a duel by Fok, and was wounded in the stomach.\\"Women Watch Duel of Russian Generals,\\" NY Times, March 19, 1908. Following the October Revolution, Smirnov emigrated to Yugoslavia, where he would die of pneumonia at Panƒçevo, in what is now Serbia.

Responsible for carrying out capital punishment in the Prussian provinces, he executed a total of at least 144 people, primarily by beheading with an axe, but also with guillotines. Gr√∂pler was one of the most famous executioners in Germany. Life Franz Friedrich Carl Gr√∂pler was born as a child of the railway worker and service man Heinrich Gr√∂pler and his wife Auguste, born Anton, in Magdeburg. He was first a musician, then spent five years as a postal worker. Gr√∂pler learned the horse butcher's trade and business and ran a laundry in Magdeburg named \\"Aegir\\".Ebbinghaus, Angelika; Linne, Karsten, Kein abgeschlossenes Kapitel: Hamburg im Dritten Reich, Hamburg 1997, p. 335. Compare Todte, Mario, Die Hinrichtungen in Sachsen (1900‚Äì1981), p. 11, Hausarbeiten.de (Online-Resource, accessed 19 April 2014). Executioner Executioner Carl Gr√∂pler was described as a man who wore a traditional tailcoat, top hat, and white gloves.Blazek (2010), p. 63. Gr√∂pler was first assistant to the main Prussian executioner Lorenz Schwietz. When the Prussian executioner Alwin Engelhardt was dismissed in 1906, Gr√∂pler took over his duties. Together with his successor Ernst Reindel, Gr√∂pler was one of the last executioners in Germany performing executions by beheading with an axe. Depending on local circumstances he also operated the guillotine. Once Gr√∂pler to have said before an execution to a prison officer: \\"Well, ... you passed an ugly night in the cell. Or don't you believe in God? I ‚Äì yes! Otherwise I could not do that. Thou shalt not kill ‚Äì who sheds blood, his blood shall be shed again ‚Äì our laws are his (God's) laws ‚Äì. In this knowledge I fulfill my duties.\\"Goetz, Walter; Steinhausen, Georg (editors), Archiv f√ºr Kulturgeschichte, Cologne/Weimar 1976, p. 171. The prison officer been on death watch with a man condemned to death in his last night, discussing with him, prior to his decapitation, whether there was any sense in having a clergyman attending executions. Theodor Lessing nicknamed Gr√∂pler (who had executed Fritz Haarmann in 1925) of \\"the red judge\\".Lessing, Theodor, Haarmann ‚Äì Die Geschichte eines Werwolfs, introduced by Rainer Marwedel, Frankfurt 1989, 2nd ed.: 1996, p. 191. In April 1924 Gr√∂pler signed a contract that made him the de facto sole executioner in Northern Germany. In addition to a regular flat-rate fee of 136,- Goldmarks per month, for every execution of a fee of 60,- Goldmarks for themselves and 50,- Goldmarks for each of its agents. At the end of the Weimar Republic, Gr√∂pler had only a few execution orders. This only changed with the increasing number of executions since the takeover by the Nazis in 1933 Gr√∂pler renewed its annual contract with a salary of 1.500,- Reichsmarks per year and a fee of 50,- Reichsmark per execution. That Gr√∂pler summoned the Nazi salute during the executions at each interim report, earned him an admonition to refrain from such practices.Evans, Richard J., Rituals of Retribution: Capital Punishment in Germany 1600‚Äì1987, New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1996. On 2 July 1931 the 48-year-old German serial killer Peter K√ºrten, who once described himself as the Vampire of D√ºsseldorf and as a wild animal, was executed in the Cologne prison, Klingelp√ºtz, with the Fallbeil. The execution was carried out by Carl Gr√∂pler. The Fallbeil, that he had brought with him from Magdeburg, had not been used for five years.Blazek (2010), p. 75. Time quoted on 13 July 1931: \\"Herr Groepler, a stolid individual whose profession forces him to lead a rather unsocial existence, left his cosy home in Magdeburg last week with a bag of tools and a coil of new rope. He took the train to the Prussian State Prison at Klingelpuetz, near Cologne. In the prison yard he disappeared into a dusty, dilapidated shed. Prisoners tense in their cells heard him hammering, hammering, filing metal all day long.\\"Time Inc., 1931, p. 14. One of the last executions with the ax were the executions of the Baroness Benita von Falkenhayn and her friend Renate von Natzmer. The two had been sentenced by the People's Court on charges of espionage and were beheaded by Gr√∂pler on 18 February 1935 in Pl√∂tzensee Prison.Time Magazine, 4 March 1935. Cawthorne, Nigel, Abolition in Germany, Public Executions: From Ancient Rome to the Present Day, London: Arcturus Publishing Limited, 1996 (Online-Resource, accessed 19 April 2014). Carl Gr√∂pler was attributed to at least 144 executions in his 30 years of service. In 1937, he was forced to retire. He was replaced by his assistant, the knacker Ernst Reindel from Gommern. Death In 1945, Carl Gr√∂pler was arrested by the Soviet military at his residence in Magdeburg. The arrest was based presumably on the execution of four communists, which he had made in 1934 in Hamburg Remand Prison (cf. to the process, the executions and to its literary and cinematic processing: Heinrich Jauch (1894‚Äì1945), First prosecutor to Hamburg).Compare Jan Valtin, \\"Out of the Night\\" ‚Äì Entry on the execution of four communists with an axe by Gr√∂pler on 19 May 1934.

It is accessible from the valley of the Zinsel du Nord. The original castle was built in the 12th-13th century, but very little remains from this period. The castle was reconstructed in a neo-romanesque style in the 1930s. It is a listed historical monument since 2007. Ch√¢teau fort de Hunebourg  History  = Middle Ages and Early Modern Period = The counts of H√ºneburg, who probably came from a branch of the counts of Dagsburg-Metz, were mentioned in records in 1125 which prove the existence of the castle and its two first count, Theodoric and Folmar. The lords of H√ºneburg, who occupied the castle until 1225, were patrons or protectors (Schirmherren) of the abbeys of Neuwiller and Honau. The best known member of the von H√ºneburg family was Conrad of H√ºneburg, Bishop of Strasbourg from 1190 to 1202. In the 14th and 15th centuries the castle was a joint inheritance or Ganerben whose owners included the family of Fleckenstein and the lords of Lichtenberg. In the following centuries they were joined by the lords and counts of Hanau. There are no reliable sources for the condition of the castle after the mid-15th century. It is likely that it fell into increasing disrepair and was no longer occupied. = 19th century = The ruins were seized during the French Revolution sold \\"for the good of the nation\\" (Biens nationaux) and purchased in 1809 by Napoleonic general, Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke, who henceforth named himself the Count of Hunebourg (Comte de Hunebourg). He had the medieval bergfried torn down to make way for material for new building work. However, he spent very little time at Hunebourg. The estate was turned into a park with a hunting lodge. After the death of the general in 1818 the Hunebourg was sold by his heirs and was owned by the Feyler family of Neuwiller-l√®s-Saverne from 1823 to 1932. = 20th century = In 1932, an Alsatian autonomist and politician, Friedrich Spieser, purchased the castle ruins and in 1934 had new residential buildings and a bergfried built in the Neo-Romanesque style by Karl Erich Loebell, an architect of the Stuttgart School and student of Paul Schmitthenner. In his autobiographical account, A Thousand Bridges (Tausend Br√ºcken) Spieser described the principles of his reconstruction: a commitment to the history, connectedness with nature, simplicity and objectivity in its features, authenticity of materials, orientation to German building tradition. A \\"hiking hostel\\" (youth hostel) was integrated into the castle. The new bergfried was built on the small rock outcrop of the old inner ward, separated from the plateau of the outer ward by a ravine bridged by an arch. Unlike its medieval precursor it was not placed in the forward position of the outer ward, but moved to the other end of the rock. A \\"Peace Tower\\" (Friedens-Turm) was dedicated to \\"the most unknown soldiers of 1914-18 World War / the fallen of Alsace-Lorraine / and dead fighters of the region\\". Meetings of Alsatian autonomist clubs and folk song and folk dance events organized by Spieser took place at the castle. The Francophile press of Alsace attacked the reconstructed castle in the political conflicts of the pre-war period as a \\"bulwark of Germanness\\". At the start of the Second World War the castle was commandeered by the French authorities. After the occupation of Alsace by German troops, Spieser returned to the castle. At the request of Baden's Gauleiter and Chief of the Civil Administration in Alsace Robert Wagner, the body of the autonomist politician, Karl Roos, who had been executed in 1940, was transferred from Nancy and interred at the castle on 19 June 1941 with military honours.Foto Roos' In the next few years the H√ºneburg was to become an obligatory pilgrimage for students of German-occupied Lorraine. After the Liberation of France and the reconquest of the Alsace by Allied troops the Roos' sarcophagus was thrown into the moat by French troops. Where the remains of Roos are now is unknown. The castle was retaken by French troops and repossessed. The Soci√©t√© mutualiste du personnel de l‚ÄôEnregistrement bought the site and turned it into a holiday home for its members. Today the Hunenbourg houses an hotel.  References  Bernhard Metz: Les familles et le ch√¢teau de H√ºneburg au moyen age. In: Groupe de Recherche sur le ch√¢teau de Hunebourg: Hunebourg.

These territories, a segment of the Captaincies of the Portuguese Empire, which usually conformed to the individual islands, allowing the stewardship of the King through the Donatary and Captaincy system. History Following the discovery of the first islands in the Atlantic, chiefly Madeira, and slow settlement of those possessions, the Portuguese needed a mechanism for control that did not necessitate dislocation by hereditary princes or monarchs. The Donat√°rio system allowed the monarch to appoint individuals of confidence to run their affairs in those territories. Initially, Henry the Navigator was bestowed the administration and development of newly discovered lands, which he then transferred to the possession of the Order of Christ (to which he was its head). His heirs and descendants (the Dukes of Viseu) would therefore oversea the orderly expansion of Portuguese dominion in the New World, without necessarily venturing into the seas. To this end, and by extension, he nominated his own men of confidence (since the Salic Laws only permitted the transfer of title to legitimate male heirs) that would directly oversea the activities in his place. These \\"captains\\" or capit√£es dos donat√°rios (captains of the donataries) would govern in his place, endowed with certain privileges that facilitated their stewardship and rewarded their active development of the territory. The captaincies were, therefore, a scaled-down version of the donat√°rio system. On 15 August 1432 a small vessel disembarked on the northern shore of what became known as the islands of the Azores. There quick settlement, resulted in Prince Henry applying the same method of consolidating faithful relationships, deeming some vassals sources of manpower to conduct political and economic administration of the archipelago. Therefore, the captaincy system was employed on the islands, which in the beginning were limited to a group of rocky outcrops (the Formigas) and the unspoiled island of Santa Maria, where settlers had made a beachhead in the northern region of Anjos. With progressive discoveries, the number of captaincies expanded, only broken by inter- and intra-island rivalries and death. =Commander of Santa Maria and Captain of the Azores= * 1439‚Äì1461 -- Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral As \\"discoverer\\" and commander of the expedition to the Atlantic, Cabral was the first commander to obtain the title of Captain of the Donatary in the Azores. Yet, the title bestowed on Gon√ßalo Velho is not very clear, as it has been both referred to as the comendador da ilha de Santa Maria e nosso capit√£o nos A√ßores (Commander of the island of Santa Maria and Our captain of the Azores), or alternately as the comendador das ilhas dos A√ßores (Commander of the Azores). The more probable interpretation of this role, being from the Order of Christ responsible for the administration of the islands, came from the comenda regime, referring to a knighthood or commandery, normally associated with the Order in Portugal, but applied to the, then, populous island of Santa Maria in the archipelago. Still, in 1460, in a letter from Henry the Navigator, the prince described Cabral as Capit√£o por mim em minhas ilhas de Santa Maria e S√£o Miguel dos A√ßores (Captain for Me in My Islands of Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel in the Azores). Cabral was the ideal Captain to obtain this title, who \\"cultivated the island [of Santa Maria] with noble people, treating the island with much love and caring the people with much gentleness; for this reason he was obeyed by all and very dear to the entire island.Gaspar Frutuoso Saudades da Terra, Book III, p.112/143Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.238 It is still unclear at what time Gona√ßalo Velho Cabral abrogated and vacated the captaincy of the two islands to his nephew, Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria. =Donatary-Captaincy of Santa Maria= After the sale of the captaincy of S√£o Miguel to Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara, the Captaincy of Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel was divided into two separate administrations, with Santa Maria remaining in the hands of Gon√ßalo Velho Cabrals successor, Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria. * 1474‚Äì1499 -- Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria; succeed his maternal uncle (Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral) in the commandership of the Azores, he sold his privileges to S√£o Miguel to Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara in order obtain free-up money during his wife's illness; Albergaria was responsible for promoting the settlement on the island and its defense, but was captured during a Castilian raid and ransomed. He, eventually, returned to the island late in his life. * 1499‚Äì1571 -- Jo√£o Soares de Sousa; until 1509 it was Lieutenant Jo√£o de Marv√£o who administered this territory, since at the time of Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria death (1499), Jo√£o Soares was only six years old at the time. He was recognized for his progressive Captain-ship of Santa Maria, assisting the poor and providing reasonable terms for land rental: for these actions he was arrested and sent to Lisbon to face judgement. He, eventually, appealed to the King and was returned to his post; * 1571‚Äì1576? -- Pedro Soares de Sousa; * 1580‚Äì?? -- Jer√≥nimo Coutinho; * 1594‚Äì?? -- Br√°s Soares de Sousa; * 1626‚Äì?? -- Pedro Soares de Sousa, grandson of the previous; * 1639‚Äì?? -- Br√°s Soares de Sousa, grandson of the previous; * 1649‚Äì?? -- Branca de Gama; * 1654‚Äì?? -- Jo√£o Falc√£o de Sousa; * 1665‚Äì?? -- Joana de Meneses; * 1667‚Äì1720 -- Lu√≠s de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor; * 1720‚Äì1734 -- Afonso de Vasconcelos e Sousa Cunha C√¢mara Faro e Veiga, 5th Count of Calheta; * 1734‚Äì1801 -- Jos√© de Vasconcelos e Sousa Caminha da C√¢mara Faro e Veiga, 1st Marquess of Castelo Melhor; the last donatary captain, before the creation of the Captaincy-General of the Azores, in 1766. After this date, the rest of the captains became honorary, while maintaining the corresponding incomes; * 1801‚Äì1806 -- Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Vasconcelos e Sousa da C√¢mara Caminha Faro e Veiga, 6th Count of Calheta and 2nd Marquess of Castelo Melhor; * 1806‚Äì1827 -- Afonso de Vasconcelos e Sousa da C√¢mara Caminha Faro e Veiga, 7th Count of Calheta and 3rd Marquess of Castelo Melhor; * 1827‚Äì1832 -- Ant√≥nio de Vasconcelos e Sousa da C√¢mara Caminha Faro e Veiga, 8th Count of Calheta and 4th Marquess of Castelo Melhor. =Donatary-Captaincy of S√£o Miguel= Until 1474, the island of S√£o Miguel was part of a larger fiefdom bequeathed to Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria, the Captaincy of Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.22 At that time, the island was a large, underpopulated and, therefore, unproductive possession of the Donat√°rio Diogo, Duke of Viseu, and Ko√£o Soares was more preoccupied with the health of his wife, and looked to the sale as a way of improving his finances (during a period while he was staying with their family in Madeira).Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.23 The sale by Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria of the Donatary-captaincy of the islands of Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel, lead to the separation of the administration of S√£o Miguel from Santa Maria, after 1474. * 1474‚Äì1497 -- Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara, 3rd Donatary-Captain; Duke Diogo, nephew of King Edward approved the transfer of the Donatary-captaincy to Rui da C√¢mara, who offered lands to settlers who were obligated to transform the uncultivated lands within a five-year contract. Those who were unable to fulfill the contract would forfeit their lands to another, who were under the same obligations, thus rapidly populating the island. It was during Rui Gon√ßalves administration that the provincial capital of Vila Franca was destroyed resulting in the death of many and forcing the move of the administration to Ponta Delgada.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.33 Subsequently, all the donatary captains of S√£o Miguel became members of the family of Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara; * 1497‚Äì1502 -- Jo√£o Rodrigues da C√¢mara, 4th Donatary-Captain; At the time of his death Rui Gon√ßalves had no issue; a squire to the house of Donat√°rio D. Ferdinand, this nobleman left no heirs, and contrary to the laws of inheritance on 10 March 1474 D. Diogo authorized the bestowal of the Captaincy to this Captains illegitimate sons.Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.237 * 1502‚Äì1535 -- Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara II, 5th Donatary-Captain; * 1535‚Äì1578 -- Manuel da C√¢mara, 6th Donatary-Captain; * 1578‚Äì1601 -- Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara III, 7th Donatary-Captain and 1st Count of Vila Franca; * 1601‚Äì1619 -- Manuel da C√¢mara II, 8th Donatary-Captain and 2nd Count of Vila Franca; * 1619‚Äì1662 -- Rodrigo da C√¢mara, 9th Donatary-Captain and 3rd Count of Vila Franca; * 1662‚Äì1673 -- Manuel da C√¢mara III, 10th Donatary-Captain, 4th Count of Vila Franca and 1st Count of Ribeira Grande; * 1673‚Äì1724 -- Jos√© Rodrigo da C√¢mara, 11th Donatary- Captain and 2nd Count of Ribeira Grande; * 1724‚Äì1724 -- Lu√≠s Manuel da C√¢mara, 12th Donatary-Captain and 3rd Count of Ribeira Grande; * 1724‚Äì1757 -- Jos√© da C√¢mara Teles, 13th Donatary-Captain and 4th Count of Ribeira Grande; * 1757‚Äì1766 -- Joana Tom√°sia da C√¢mara, descendent titleholder of captaincy, married to Guido Augusto da C√¢mara, her uncle, to whom fell the titles of 14th (and last) Donatary-Captain and 5th Count of Ribeira Grande, owing to the death of the elder son Jos√© da C√¢mara Teles. =Donatary-Captaincy of Terceira= The island of Terceira was established as a single captaincy, and later divided into two captaincies: that of Angra and Praia. It was the only island where the territory was divided into separate captaincies: # 1450‚Äì1466 -- J√°come de Bruges. This captain disappeared mysteriously, with the suggestion that he was murdered, thrown overboard while at sea, during a voyage. Contrary to the Mental Law that favoured legitimate male heirs, in 1450, Prince Henry the Navigator permitted his first-born daughter to inherit the Terceirense Captaincy. What followed was a long process, in which his son- in-law, Duarte Paim, claimed the captaincy, over the claims of √Ålvaro Martins Homem and Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real. This process was decided in favor of the latter, but after some pleading on the part of both men, the island was divided into two captaincies. # 1466‚Äì1474 -- √Ålvaro Martins Homem. Due to constant quarrelling between Homem and Corte Real, the island was divided into two captaincies by charter of Infanta D. Brites, tutor and curator of the donatary, from 17 February 1474. The island was roughly divided diagonally, and following long disputres, it was fixed in 1568, parting from the southern coast at the mouth of the Ribeira Seca, S√£o Sebasti√£o, crossed the island until the Cerro da Ribeira dos Gatos, near the northern coast (along the Canada da Almas, near Cruz do Marco, in Altares). In this area, a commission of \\"good men\\" of navigation, established a mark to distinguish the division, giving rise the locality. The post survived until 1997‚Äì1998, when alterations to the regional roadway resulted in its destruction. Having selected the territory of Angra, Jo√£o Vaz Corte Real compensated √Ålvaro Martins Homem for the public works completed by the latter. Captaincy of Angra The captaincy of Angra was created on 2 April 1474, under the stewardship of Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real (was bestowed on him, in recognition of his \\"many and great services\\"), who promoted the settlement of many nobles from the Kingdom, many in company of their servants and entourage. In the process he opened new roads and established settlements in different points of the western part of the island, until by 1478, most of Angra was built, meriting its elevation to the category of vila (town). For the island's defense, Corte-Real erected the Castle of S√£o Lu√≠s (also known as the Castelo dos Moinhos), which became the first presidium, concluded in 1493, at the same concluding the Church of S√£o Salvador. In order to attend the poor and sick of the captaincy, as well as those who docked in Angra, he built the first hospital on the island, to the invocation of Santo Esp√≠rito. The building was attended by the Franciscans and approved in the regal charter on 15 May 1492. Corte-Real also supported the construction of the Convent of S√£o Francisco, and permitted the Franciscans to begin teaching on its grounds. # 1474‚Äì1496 -- Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real; # 1496‚Äì1538 -- Vasco Anes Corte-Real; # 1538‚Äì1577 -- Manuel Corte-Real; # 1577‚Äì1581 -- Vasco Annes Corte-Real, with same name as his grandfather; # 1581‚Äì1613 -- Margarida Corte-Real, who married Crist√≥v√£o de Moura, 1st Count of Castelo Rodrigo, then 1st Marquess of Castelo Rodrigo, assuming the captaincy; # 1613‚Äì1642 -- Manuel de Moura, 2nd Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo and 1st Count of Lumiares. The captaincy reverted to the crown in 1641, when Manuel de Moura Corte Real opted to remain in the Kingdom of Castille after the Restoration of Independence from Spain; # 1641‚Äì1642 -- the title was incorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown; # 1642‚Äì1649 -- Afonso de Portugal, 5th Count of Vimioso and 1st Marquess of Aguiar; # 1649‚Äì1655 -- Lu√≠s de Portugal, 6th Count of Vimioso; with his death, the title reverted, once again, to the Crown; # 1655‚Äì1766 -- the title was re-incorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown; the captaincy was extinguished with the creation of the Captaincy-General of the Azores. Captaincy of Praia The captaincy was received by √Ålvaro Martins Homem on 17 February 1474, receiving compensation from Corte Real for his works, which he then used to erect eight mills in Agualva and three in Quatro Ribeiras, and construction of churches within this captaincy. The vigorous impulse resulted in the quick elevation of Praia to the status of town between 1478 and 1480, at about the same time as Angra. To complement the islands defenses Homem determined the need to construct a wall, and later, encircled the Bay of Praia with a series of redoubts, visioning a defense of the island from the sea. Meanwhile, within Praia, Afonso Gon√ßalves de Antona Baldaya provided incentives for the construction of the Convent of S√£o Francisco, including the donation of parcels from his own property, similar to what occurred in Angra. Influenced by inciative of Catarina de Ornelas, the Monastery of Luz was founded in this territory. # 1474‚Äì1483 -- √Ålvaro Martins Homem; # 1483‚Äì1520 -- Ant√£o Martins Homem; # 1520‚Äì1540 -- √Ålvaro Martins Homem, with same name as his grandfather; # 1540‚Äì1577 -- Ant√£o Martins da C√¢mara, with same name as his grandfather; # 1577‚Äì1582 -- unknown # 1582‚Äì1613 -- Margarida Corte-Real, who married Crist√≥v√£o de Moura, 1st Count of Castelo Rodrigo, later 1st Marquess of Castelo Rodrigo, who assumed the captaincy; # 1613‚Äì1642 -- Manuel de Moura Corte-Real, 2nd Marquess of Castelo Rodrigo and 1st Count of Lumiares; The captaincy reverted to the crown in 1641, when Manuel de Moura Corte Real opted to remain in the Kingdom of Castille after the Restoration of Independence from Spain; # 1641‚Äì1642 -- the title was incorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown; # 1642‚Äì1649 -- Afonso de Portugal, 5th Count of Vimioso and 1st Marquess of Aguiar; # 1649‚Äì1655 -- Lu√≠s de Portugal, 6th Count of Vimioso; with his death, the title reverted, once again, to the Crown; # 1655‚Äì1663 -- the title was re-incorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown; # 1663‚Äì1665 -- Francisco Ornelas da C√¢mara, who acquired the captaincy for 20,000 cruzados, during the Restoration Wars; # 1665‚Äì1712 -- Br√°s de Ornelas, with the death of this title-holder, the captaincy reverted to the Crown, where it remained until 1715; # 1712‚Äì1715 -- the title was re- incorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown; # 1715‚Äì1749 -- Lu√≠s Ant√≥nio de Basto Baharem, the last private title-holder of the captaincy; # 1749‚Äì1766 -- the title was re-incorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown; the captaincy was extinguished with the creation of the Captaincy-General of the Azores. =Donatary-Captaincy of Graciosa= The captaincy of Graciosa was created in 1470, the year that official settlement was initiated, although it is unclear who were the first donatary captains: Captaincy of Praia da Graciosa # 1470‚Äì1475 -- (unclear date) Duarte Barreto do Couto, just the southern part of the island; # 1475‚Äì1485 -- Vasco Gil Sodr√© (nobleman and relative of Pedro Correia da Cunha) (unclear dates; included the southern portions of the island and group of territories administered by his sister Ant√≥nia Sodr√©, widow of captain Duarte Barreto do Couto. Captaincy of Santa Cruz # 1475‚Äì1485 -- (unclear date) Pedro Correia da Cunha. Captaincy of Graciosa # 1485‚Äì1497 -- Pedro Correia da Cunha;(was a nobleman in the House of Henry the navigator)Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.236 # 1499‚Äì1507 -- Duarte Correia da Cunha, son of the preceding captain; # 1507‚Äì1510 -- Fernando Coutinho (owing to no descendants of the Cunha family, the captaincy was passed to another branch of the family tree); # 1510‚Äì1524 -- √Ålvaro Coutinho; # 1524‚Äì1552 -- √Ålvaro Coutinho, son of the preceding; # 1552‚Äì1573 -- Fernando Coutinho, son of the preceding; # 1573‚Äì1593 -- Fernando Coutinho, son of the preceding; # 1593‚Äì1626 -- Fernando Coutinho, son of the preceding; # 1626‚Äì1666 -- Fernando Coutinho, son of the preceding, died without any descendants; # 1666‚Äì1674 -- Lu√≠s Mendes de Elvas (died without descendants); # 1674‚Äì1708 -- Pedro Sanches de Farinha; # 1708‚Äì1730 -- Rodrigo Sanches Farinha de Baena; # 1730‚Äì1737 -- Pedro Sanches Farinha de Baena; # 1737‚Äì1766 -- the title was re-incorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown; the captaincy was extinguished with the creation of the Captaincy-General of the Azores. =Donatary-Captaincy of S√£o Jorge= The captaincy of S√£o Jorge was annexed to that of Angra, and maintained in that form until it was incorporated by the Crown, after Manuel de Moura Corte-Real, donatary captain of Angra, decided to maintain his allegiance to Spain, following the Restoration Wars. # 1474‚Äì1496 -- Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real; # 1496‚Äì1538 -- Vasco Anes Corte-Real; # 1538‚Äì1577 -- Manuel Corte- Real; # 1577‚Äì1581 -- Vasco Annes Corte-Real, with same name as his grandfather; # 1581‚Äì1613 -- Margarida Corte-Real, who married Crist√≥v√£o de Moura, 1st Count of Castelo Rodrigo, then 1st Marquess of Castelo Rodrigo, assuming the captaincy; # 1613‚Äì1642 -- Manuel de Moura Corte-Real, 2nd Marquess of Castelo Rodrigo and 1st Count of Lumiares. The captaincy reverted to the crown in 1641, when Manuel de Moura Corte Real opted to remain in the Kingdom of Castille after the Restoration of Independence from Spain; # 1641‚Äì1642 -- the title was incorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown; # 1642‚Äì1649 -- Afonso de Portugal, 5th Count of Vimioso and 1st Marquess of Aguiar; # 1649‚Äì1655 -- Lu√≠s de Portugal, 6th Count of Vimioso; with his death, the title reverted, once again, to the Crown; # 1655‚Äì1766 -- the title was re-incorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown; the captaincy was extinguished with the creation of the Captaincy- General of the Azores. =Donatary-Captaincy of Faial and Pico= Captaincy of Faial # 1468‚Äì1482 -- Josse van Huerter. The Donatary- captaincy of Faial was given to Josse van Huerter by charter date 21 February 1468, which was then expanded on 29 December 1482, with the incorporation of the island of Pico Captaincy of Pico # 1460‚Äì1482 -- √Ålvaro de Ornelas. Around 1460, √Ålvaro de Ornelas attempted to settle the island, with colonists from northern Portugal, who arrived by way of Terceira and Graciosa. In a letter written 1481, the Infanta D. Beatriz, acting as Donat√°rio for her underage sons said so much, indicating that she had ceded the island to √Ålvaro de Ornelas, one of the king's squires and resident of Madeira, so he could promote the settlement of the mountain-island. Yet, he never really took effective control of thedonatary. Confronted with the inefficiency of this nobleman, the Infanta withdrew her support, and gave the captaincy to J√≥s Dutra (whose family had already distinguished itself in developing Faial). Captaincy of Faial and Pico  By charter, on 29 December 1482, the Captaincy of Pico was annexed to the Captaincy of Faial, created the dual jurisdiction, under the single regency of van Huerter. # 1482-1495 -- Josse van Huerter; # 1495-1549 -- Joss de Utra, son of the preceding (transliterated name); # 1549-1553 -- Manuel de Utra Corte Real; # 1553-1573 -- √Ålvaro de Castro. # 1573-1582 -- Francisco de Mascarenhas; # 1582-1614 -- Jer√≥nimo de Utra Corte Real; in the 16th century, the town of Lajes do Pico asked the King to command Captain Jer√≥nimo Dutra Corte Real to perform his duties and to assume his place in the Captaincy; # 1614-1642 -- Manuel de Moura Corte Real, 1st Marquess of Lumiares and 2nd Marquess of Castelo Rodrigo. After being confiscated, the captaincy was incorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown, between 1642 and 1680, since Manuel opted to live in the Kingdom of Castille, following the Restoration Wars; # 1680-1730 -- Rodrigo Sanches Farinha de Baena; # 1730-1737 -- Pedro Sanches Farinha de Baena, following his death, the captaincy was reincorporated into the possessions and properties of the Crown, by Rodrigo Sanches Farinha de Baena; # 1825-1832 -- Manuel de Arriaga Pereira, the title remained an honorific, until the captaincy was permanently extinguished with the creation of the Captaincy-General of the Azores. =Donatary-Captaincy of Flores and Corvo= The islands of Flores and Corvo, were since their discovery, administered as a singular captaincy, without any clear statute defining the governance on the islands. What developed was a structure that was not as equal as the other islands, and flowed from a feudal hierarchy, that only improved after the reforms of Mouzinho da Silveira and the extinction of the constitutional monarchy. The following were the doantary captains of the islands: # Diogo de Teive, was the Donatary, and not the Donatary Captain of the islands, responsible for their discovery; # ????‚Äì1475 -- Jo√£o de Teive, son of the preceding, who sold his rights to the group (with the permission of the Crown) to Fern√£o Teles de Meneses; # 1475‚Äì1477 -- Fern√£o Teles de Meneses, 4th Master of Unh√£o; # 1477‚Äì1500 -- Maria de Vilhena, who, in the name of her minor son (Rui Teles), administered the islands; she invited, or permitted, the settlement of Willem van der Hagen, also known locally as Guilherme da Silveira, who for many years lived on the island, near Ribeira da Cruz. Ultimately, with the approval of her son, Maria de Vilhena sold the islands in 1500 to Jo√£o da Fonseca, of √âvora; # 1500‚Äì1528 -- Jo√£o da Fonseca, sent to the islands some of the earliest settlers that remained on the islands, including Lopo Vaz and Ant√£o Vaz; # 1528‚Äì1570 -- Pero da Fonseca, sometimes referred to as Pedro da Fonseca, son of the preceding; # 1570‚Äì1593 -- friar Gon√ßalo de Sousa da Fonseca, son of the preceding; professed knight in the Order of Christ. During this period the Commandery of the Order of Christ was founded, to administer through the Donatary Captain, what consisted of \\"[the] dominion of all the lands of the named islands not already occupied, with the obligation of paying annually a physical quantity of 20$00 r√©is, to care for the provision and payment of ecclesiastical ministers, to promote and support the construction and conservancy of the parochial churches and all in respect of the religious cult\\" and \\"...with the island of Corvo least occupied, took to the Commandery almost all, and on the island of Flores, took the extensive unincorporated lands in the municipality of Santa Cruz and three in Lajes\\". It was this Commandery that resulted in the oppression of the peoples of both islands, resulting in an oppressive signeurial tribute, that was only resolved in the 19th century. Through the death of friar Gon√ßalo da Fonseca the captaincy reverted to the Crown, and later attributed to Francisco de Mascarenhas, for his services in India and awarded for his support of the Iberian Union; # 1593‚Äì1607 -- Francisco de Mascarenhas, 1st Count of Vila da Horta, later changed to 1st Count of Santa Cruz, by letter of thanks from Filipe I, on 17 September 1523. All the remaining captains, except the last, were members of the Mascarenhas family, Counts of Santa Cruz, accumulating other titles along the way. # 1608‚Äì1650 -- Martinho de Mascarenhas, 2nd Count of Santa Cruz; # 1650‚Äì1657 -- Jo√£o de Mascarenhas, married to his cousin, Brites de Mascarenhas, only daughter of the 2nd Count of Santa Cruz. Jo√£o de Mascarenhas lost his title and captaincy to his son, Martinho de Mascarenhas, declared 4th Count of Santa Cruz, after being removed by King Afonso VI on 30 June 1657; # 1657‚Äì1682 -- Martinho de Mascarenhas, married Juliana de Lencastre, daughter and successor of the 2nd Marquess of Gouveia, accumulating the title of Count of Santa Cruz and Marquess of Gouveia within his household; # 1682‚Äì1692 -- Jo√£o de Mascarenhas, 5th Count of Santa Cruz and 4th Marquess of Gouveia, died without any descendants; # 1692‚Äì1714 -- Martinho Mascarenhas, second oldest son of the 4th Count of Santa Cruz, and wife Juliana de Lencastre, he used the title of 6th Count of Santa Cruz, later confirmed by regal charter on 2 July 1692, and 3rd Marquess of Gouveia; # 1714‚Äì1723 -- Jo√£o de Mascarenhas, 7th Count of Santa Cruz, by regal letter of John V (dated 20 January 1714), confirmed in 1723, and 4th Marquess of Gouveia. He was the eldest son of the 6th Count of Santa Cruz, but renounced the title, and escaped to England, for romantic reasons; # 1723‚Äì1759 -- D. Jos√© de Mascarenhas da Silva e Lencastre, 5th Marquess of Gouveia, 8th Count of Santa Cruz, and 8th Duke of Aveiro, obtained his title, owing to Jo√£o de Mascarenhas had renounced his role. Jos√© was the last titleholder of the captaincy from the Mascarenhas family, since the title and his possessions/properties were confiscated by the Crown, during the sequence of events surrounding the T√°vora affair. The last Count of Santa Cruz was condemned and executed on 13 January 1759, and the politico-administrative responsibilities of Donatary Captain ceased on the islands; # 1815‚Äì1832 -- Pedro Jos√© Caupers, following the death of Jos√© de Mascarenhas, the incomes and possessions were administered by Pedro Jos√© Caupers, until the captaincy was ultimately extinguished with the creation of the Captaincy-General of the Azores.

The village settlement was represented at the council of Maharaja of Patiala by the family of Bhaikas and Chowdharys. In fact till around 2003‚Äì04 the village also had an old fort, which has since been demolished. Sidhuwal FortFort at Sidhuwal Village It can also be assumed that the village must have come up in the vicinity of the fort which probably was built in nineteenth century. Demographics Though the name of the village suggests that it may be predominantly of Sidhu gotra, but majority of the population of the village consists of farmers with Khroud gotra. Punjabi language is spoken by all in the village. As per 2011 census, the village has total population of 2290 with 478 households, of which 56% are males (1289) and 44% are females (1001) means sex ratio in the village is skewed as with 777 females per 1000 males. Though residents have now started sending their daughters to schools, still only 53.2% of females are educated as compared to 67.4% of males. Overall literacy rate of the village is 61.2%. Religion Though village has a strong secular culture, majority population follows Sikhism. Some population also follows Hinduism and Islam. Beside a common Gurudwara, there are large number of religious places of various religions in the village and they are visited by all. Gurudwara at Sidhuwal Education Due to its proximity to Patiala city, it does not have many independent facilities like education. However, Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law (RGNUL) has been established in the village by the Punjab Government, which will not only give boost to infrastructure in the village but also to the education of the students from the village.

Main source of irrigation is ground water through pumps, canal water and rainfall. Earlier farmers used to grow wheat, sugarcane, cotton, pulses, peanuts etc. Now, with availability of machinery and knowledge, farmers normally stick to wheat and rice cultivation. Other products grown earlier are minuscule. This has led to large scale use of ground water. Now the level of ground water has reduced to 50‚Äì70 metres.

It once had legal basis in Scotland and England.  History  The tradition is supposed to originate from a deal that Saint Bridget struck with Saint Patrick. In the 5th century, Bridget is said to have gone to Patrick to complain that women had to wait too long to marry because men were slow to propose, asking that women be given the opportunity. Patrick is said to have offered that women be allowed to propose on one day every seven years, but Bridget convinced him to make it one day every four years. The tradition also has background in the number of late February proposals encouraged by how undesirable it was to be unmarried during Lent, because of societal responsibility to marry combined with the ban on marrying during the Lent observance. People who were single by Easter would be publicly named in Skellig Lists, ballads about single people, and harassed in the streets from the Sunday after Shrove Tuesday, known as Chalk Sunday, and throughout Lent. The term \\"Skellig List\\" comes from the name of the Skellig Islands and particularly the largest, Skellig Michael, where Lent was believed to start later than in the rest of Ireland, providing a last opportunity to quickly wed. Bachelor's Day was well established by the 1800s. Several stories of the tradition were then collected by the Irish Folklore Commission between 1937 and 1939, as part of an educational curriculum project.  Irish tradition  The custom is reported to allow women to initiate dances and propose marriage.Marriage Customs of the World: An Encyclopedia of Dating Customs and Wedding Traditions, Expanded Second Edition [2 Volumes] George Monger ABC-CLIO, Apr 9, 2013\\"'Excuse Me, But I Think You're Sitting on My Hershey Bar' and Other Openers\\". The Washington Post. 29 February 1980. p. D5. There are also traditions for if the proposal was refused, namely that the man would have to give recompense to the woman. This could come in different forms, though typically the man was expected to buy the woman gloves, a silk gown or, by the mid-20th century, a fur coat.The Witches' Almanac, Issue 30: Spring 2011-Spring 2012 Andrew Theitic He may have also had to perform a juggling trick on Easter Day. In some areas a woman could propose for the entire leap year. A related tradition is Puss Sunday. On the last Sunday before Ash Wednesday, single women were reported to \\"have a puss\\", from the word pus being a term for scowling, but on Leap Years men would have the puss. This appears to be a kinder form of Chalk Sunday. Some records also include mention that it is traditionally unlucky to actually marry in February of a Leap Year.  Internationally  Similar traditions can be found in other countries, particularly in Scotland. It is also observed in other parts of the United Kingdom and in Finland. By the early 20th century, the tradition had reached the United States, but was treated misogynistically. In some parts of Europe, if a woman proposed and the man refused, he would have to buy her twelve pairs of gloves, supposedly to hide the fact she was not wearing a ring. = Scotland = Irish monks took the tradition to Scotland where, in 1288, it was made into a law that women could propose during leap years, that they must wear a red petticoat while proposing, and that refusals would result in a fine. This was supposedly decreed by the young, unmarried Queen Margaret, though she was 5 years old. The fine could be a kiss, or the traditional silk dress or gloves. The tradition of the fine comes from the story of Saint Bridget and Saint Patrick, where Bridget is said to have immediately proposed to Patrick after he allowed women to, but Patrick turned her down, giving her a kiss on the cheek and a silk dress. = England = In traditional English law, 29 February is not a legal day. Without a legal bar on women proposing (at the time only men were allowed), it may have begun this tradition there. = United States = American postcard about the tradition in 1908 The first record of the tradition in the United States is in 1860, when Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that his daughter had mentioned a \\"leap year dance\\", where the men sit around waiting to be invited by the women. It became more known in the early 20th century, but was the butt of jokes about unmarried, romantically aggressive, women. Cartoons were published mocking the concept in various forms, commonly depicting women discussing the use of, or using, aggressive measures like nets and guns to capture unwitting men. The societal impact of the tradition in the United States has been described as reinforcing gender stereotypes that suggest women should not propose, as it was treated as a joke to let them do so on Leap Day; a similar American tradition was to have women take leadership positions and arbitrarily run local councils on Leap Day, which was treated similarly to suggest that women should not have these roles. Both traditions died out by 1980, when women's roles in relationships were more equal (and when the workplace swap became seen as entirely misogynistic). The 2010 American film Leap Year tells the story of a woman traversing around Ireland to find her boyfriend to propose on the day, and the tradition may have led to the day being used as Sadie Hawkins Day.

In the story, Canute demonstrates to his flattering courtiers that he has no control over the elements (the incoming tide), explaining that secular power is vain compared to the supreme power of God. The episode is frequently alluded to in contexts where the futility of \\"trying to stop the tide\\" of an inexorable event is pointed out, but usually misrepresenting Canute as believing he had supernatural powers, when Huntingdon's story in fact relates the opposite. The episode Henry of Huntingdon tells the story as one of three examples of Canute's \\"graceful and magnificent\\" behaviour (outside of his bravery in warfare),Enimvero extra numerum bellorum, quibus maxime splenduit, tria gessit eleganter & magnifice the other two being his arrangement of the marriage of his daughter to the later Holy Roman Emperor, and the negotiation of a reduction in tolls on the roads across Gaul to Rome at the imperial coronation of 1027. In Huntingdon's account, Canute set his throne by the sea shore and commanded the incoming tide to halt and not wet his feet and robes. Yet \\"continuing to rise as usual [the tide] dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal person. Then the king leapt backwards, saying: 'Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws. He then hung his gold crown on a crucifix, and never wore it again \\"to the honour of God the almighty King\\".Henry of Huntingdon, The Chronicle, p. 199. Later historians repeated the story, most of them adjusting it to have Canute more clearly aware that the tides would not obey him, and staging the scene to rebuke the flattery of his courtiers. There are also earlier parallels in Celtic stories of men who commanded the tides, namely Saint Illtud of Glamorgan, Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd, and Tuirbe, of Tuirbe's Strand in Brittany.Lord Raglan: \\"Cnut and the Waves\\": Man, Vol. 60, (January 1960), pp. 7‚Äì8. Proverbial reference Proverbial reference to the legend in modern journalism or politics usually casts the story in terms of \\"Canute's arrogance\\" of \\"attempting to stop the tide\\". As to usage, however, The Economist's Style Guide writes: It was cited, for example, by Stacy Head as typifying the New Orleans city council's response to Hurricane Katrina (2005), or by Mark Stephens in reference to Ryan Giggs as \\"the King Canute of football\\" for his attempts of stopping \\"the unstoppable tide of information\\" on the internet in the 2011 British privacy injunctions controversy. This, and many other popular representations, are a misrepresentation of Huntingdon's account, in which Canute uses the tide to demonstrate his precise inability to control the elements and his deference to the greater authority of God.Is King Canute misunderstood? BBC news story Theodore Dalrymple refers to the story, without misattributing motives of arrogance to Canute, in the context of the British reaction to the Ukraine crisis (2014), saying Warren Burger, the Chief Justice of the United States, mentions Canute in the 1980 decision Diamond v. Chakrabarty (447 U.S. 303), stating the denial of a patent for a micro- organism \\"is not likely to put an end to genetic research\\". Burger likens doing so to Canute commanding the tides. Historicity and possible location The contemporary Encomium Emmae has no mention of the episode, which has been taken as indicating its ahistoricity, as it would seem that so pious a dedication might have been recorded there since the same source gives an \\"eye- witness account of his lavish gifts to the monasteries and poor of St Omer when on the way to Rome, and of the tears and breast-beating which accompanied them\\".Lawson, M. K., Cnut ‚Äì England's Viking King, Stroud: Tempus (2nd ed. 2004), p. 125. Goscelin, writing later in the 11th century, instead has Canute place his crown on a crucifix at Winchester one Easter with no mention of the sea and \\"with the explanation that the king of kings was more worthy of it than he\\". Nevertheless, there may be a \\"basis of fact, in a planned act of piety\\" behind this story. On the other hand, Malcolm Godden says the story is simply \\"a 12th Century legend... and those 12th Century historians were always making up stories about kings from Anglo-Saxon times\\". The site of the episode is often identified as Thorney Island (now known as Westminster), where Canute set up a royal palace during his reign over London.The Palace of Westminster Factsheet G11, General Series, Revised March 2008Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Living Heritage. History of the Parliamentary Estate: Anglo-Saxon origins Conflictingly, a sign on Southampton city centre's Canute Road reads, \\"Near this spot AD 1028 Canute reproved his courtiers\\". Bosham in West Sussex also claims to be the site of this episode, as does Gainsborough in Lincolnshire. As Gainsborough is inland, if the story is true then Canute would have been trying to turn back the tidal bore known as the aegir. Another tradition places this episode on the north coast of the Wirral, which at the time was part of Mercia.

The Finnish national awakening in the mid-19th century was the result of members of the Swedish-speaking upper classes deliberately choosing to promote Finnish culture and language as a means of nation building‚Äîi.e. to establish a feeling of unity between all people in Finland including (and not of least importance) between the ruling elite and the ruled peasantry. The publication in 1835 of the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, a collection of traditional myths and legends which is the folklore common to the Finns and to the Karelian people (the Finnic Russian Orthodox people who inhabit the Lake Ladoga-region of eastern Finland and present-day NW Russia), stirred the nationalism that later led to Finland's independence from Russia. Nationalism was contested by the pro-Russian element and by the internationalism of the labor movement. The result was a tendency toward class conflict over nationalism, but in the early 1900s the working classes split into the Valpas (class struggle emphasis) and M√§kelin (nationalist emphasis). Language Paavo Ruotsalainen (1777‚Äì1852), a layman, led pietistic revivals Particularly following Finland's incorporation into the Swedish central administration during the 16th and 17th centuries, Swedish was spoken by about 15% of the population, especially the upper and middle classes. Swedish was the language of administration, public institutions, education and cultural life‚Äîonly the peasants spoke Finnish. The emergence of Finnish to predominance resulted from a 19th-century surge of Finnish nationalism, aided by Russian bureaucrats attempting to separate Finns from Sweden and to ensure the Finns' loyalty. In 1863, the Finnish language gained an official position in administration. The language issue overlapped both liberalism and nationalism, and showed some a class conflict as well, with the peasants pitted against the conservative Swedish-speaking landowners and nobles. Complicating this, the Finnish activists divided into \\"old\\" (no compromise on the language question and conservative nationalism) and \\"young\\" (liberation from Russia) Finns. The leading liberals were Swedish-speaking intellectuals who called for more democracy; they became the radical leaders after 1880. The liberals organized for social democracy, labor unions, farm cooperatives, and women's rights. In 1892, Finnish finally became an equal official language and gained a status comparable to that of Swedish. Nevertheless, the Swedish language continued to be the language of culture, arts and business into the 1920s. Legislation since 1922 gives Finnish and Swedish equal official status. By 2000, Swedish was the first language of about 6% of the population, or 300,000 people. However, since the late 20th century there has been a steady migration of older, better-educated Swedish speakers to Sweden. Social movements Senator Johan Vilhelm Snellman (1806‚Äì1881), who also possessed the professions of philosopher, journalist and author, was one of the most influential Fennomans and perhaps one of the most internationally known Finnish statesmen.Snellman, Johan Vilhelm (1806 - 1881)Snellman, the man who inspired Finns to be FinnsPrime Minister Vanhanen at the Celebration of J.V. SnellmanFive Facts That You Didn‚Äôt Know About J.V. SnellmanAndrew Nestingen: Crime and Fantasy in Scandinavia: Fiction, Film and Social Change. University of Washington Press, 2008. . Movements toward Finnish national pride, as well as liberalism in politics and economics involved ethnic and class dimensions. The nationalist movement against Russia began with the Fennoman movement led by Hegelian philosopher Johan Vilhelm Snellman in the 1830s. Snellman sought to apply philosophy to social action and moved the basis of Finnish nationalism to establishment of the language in the schools, while remaining loyal to the czar. Fennomania became the Finnish Party in the 1860s. Liberalism was the central issue of the 1860s to 1880s. in 2000 Suomen Sisu, an association that seeks to promote Finnish nationalism was founded. Educating the Finns in national identity =Schools= Under Russian rule there was a strong grass-roots informal people's enlightenment, based on the Society for the Advancement of Popular Education, run by Swedish elites. It promoted folk high schools teaching in Finnish and youth movements with lessons centered around patriotic and nationalist themes. Full text. The Swedish elites after 1850 also promoted public festivals with patriotic themes, hoping to both instill nationalism and draw the Finnish-speaking peasants and workers away from socialist movements that downplayed nationalism. Team sports and rowing competitions became favorite attractions, and all the festivals began with speeches. Pdf. When independence came, the schools were redesigned to instill Finnish nationalism. Jokela and Linkola (2013) examined the photographs in Finnish geography textbooks and tourist guides in the 1920s and conclude they were an integral part of the everyday teaching of nationalism. Finnish writers, intellectuals and academics saw themselves as part of the authoritative system or \\"state idea\\" that represented the entire national territory. =Media= In the days of Russian rule, music and opera became vehicles for the expression of nationalism. Jean Sibelius (1865‚Äì1957) especially used traditional Finnish folk tunes as the basis of nationalistic compositions. online Nationalist painters were for example Akseli Gallen-Kallela. Independent Finland used its postage stamps to help construct national narrative, a collective memory, and its self-image. Everyone used stamps routinely so it was an inexpensive way to reach the entire population with a popular heroic version of the national story.

She was the head coach of the UCLA Bruins gymnastics team of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from 1991 to 2019, leading the Bruins to seven national championship titles. She is a four-time Conference Coach of the Year, the 2018 West Region Head Coach of the Year, and the Pac-12 Gymnastics Coach of the Century. She is the third most-winning NCAA gymnastics coach, behind Suzanne Yoculan and Greg Marsden.  Early life  Kondos Field grew up in Sacramento, California. Kondos Field was a professional ballet dancer at Sacramento Ballet, Capital City Ballet, and Washington, D.C. Ballet. In 1982, at age twenty-two, she retired from dancing to attend the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1983, she became an assistant coach and choreographer for the UCLA Bruins gymnastics team. She graduated from UCLA in 1987 with a degree in history.  Coaching career  Kondos Field was appointed head coach of the UCLA Bruins gymnastics team in 1991. In 1997, the team won their first national NCAA championship title. The team won again in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2010 and 2018, for a total of seven wins under Kondos Field's leadership. Additionally, the team won nineteen Pac-12 championships, the first in 1993 and the last in 2019.

The book is an autobiography that contains self-help and leadership advice based on Kondos Field's experiences as a gymnastics coach.https://www.amazon.com/Life-Short-Dont-Wait-Dance/dp/1546077146  Controversies  Kondos Field controversially dismissed Alyssa Beckerman from the UCLA gymnastics team in 2003. Kondos Field claimed this was due to Beckerman's \\"subpar training and lack of enthusiasm,\\" which Beckerman disputed. Although Beckerman had been injured, she was a two-time national champion as a member of the Bruins. This controversy was reignited when Beckerman wrote an open letter in August of 2020 detailing the verbal and emotional abuse that Kondos-Field had put her through during her time at UCLA. In 2019, in the aftermath of the college admissions bribery scandal, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Maria Caire, a member of the Bruins gymnastics team, had no previous competitive record. She was admitted to UCLA as a scholar-athlete despite this, raising concerns that she had used personal connections to pave her way: Caire's uncle is a longtime friend of Kondos Field. UCLA officials claimed that Caire was admitted based on her athletic potential.

The park includes beaches and trails.Fort Foster at PortsmouthNH.com Battery Bohlen and Battery Chapin were the major parts of the fort.Fort Foster at NorthAmericanForts.com History The land was acquired by the U.S. federal government in 1872 and the fort was built from 1898 to 1901 as part of the large-scale Endicott Program. Other forts of this era in the Coast Defenses of Portsmouth included Fort Constitution and Fort Stark.Fort Foster at FortWiki.comBerhow, p. 205 The site was a sub-post of Fort Constitution and was named for American Civil War-era Brevet Major General John G. Foster of New Hampshire. Fort Foster originally had two gun batteries: Battery Bohlen with three 10-inch (254 mm) M1895 disappearing guns and Battery Chapin with two 3-inch (76 mm) M1902 guns on pedestal mounts. Battery Bohlen was built in 1898-1901 and Battery Chapin was completed in 1904. Battery Bohlen was named for Brigadier General Henry Bohlen, killed in the Civil War, and Battery Chapin was named for Brigadier General Edward Chapin, also killed in the Civil War. In 1909 a secondary control station for an underwater minefield in the harbor was added; Battery Chapin was built primarily to defend this minefield against minesweepers. After the American entry into World War I in early 1917, many guns were removed from coast defenses for potential service on the Western Front. Most of these weapons were not sent overseas or did not see action. All three 10-inch (254 mm) guns of Battery Bohlen were removed for potential use as railway artillery in October 1917, and were returned to the fort in September 1919. The observation and fire control tower for Battery 205 at Fort Foster. During World War II Fort Foster's heavy guns were superseded by a new 16-inch (406 mm) gun battery at Fort Dearborn. The 10-inch guns of Battery Bohlen were scrapped in 1942. However, new construction also took place at Fort Foster as part of the general improvement of US coast defenses that began in 1940. In 1940-1944 the Harbor Defenses of Portsmouth were garrisoned by the 22nd Coast Artillery Regiment. A new mine control station and mine casemate were built near the former 10-inch battery, along with two new gun batteries at a different location. Battery 205, begun in 1942, was to have two 6-inch (152 mm) M1 guns on shielded barbette carriages with a bunker for ammunition and fire control, but construction was suspended in 1944 and the battery was never armed. A six- story fire control tower was constructed to spot targets for this battery. Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat Battery (AMTB) 952 was also built at Fort Foster in 1943, with an authorized strength of two fixed 90 mm guns and two towed 90 mm guns. The remaining batteries were deactivated in 1946 and the fort was closed in 1948. The site was used as a recreation area for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard personnel from then until the 1950s. It was transferred to the Town of Kittery's Public Works Department and later expanded by another land purchase.

The community's headquarters are located in Pristina and their current leader, the Grand Mufti (), is Naim T√´rnava.  History  Organized Islamic activities have taken place in Kosovo since the Ottoman Empire ruled over the region. All Muslims of the empire were part of the Islamic community, which was headed by the Sultan. During the reign of Sultan Murad II, responsibilities of the caliph were transferred to the Grand Mufti. Since then, the Grand Mufti was given the honorific scholarly title Sheykhul-Islam and considered the highest religious authority within the Ottoman Empire. Additionally, every region inhabited by Muslims has had its own mufti. Each regional mufti was subordinate to the Sheykhul-Islam. During the period 1941 to 1956, the faith community in Kosova joined the Albanian Muslim community (, which was headed by the Grand Mufti based in Tirana. After the First World War, Kosovo was placed under the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The Islamic community of the kingdom was headed by Reis-ul-ulama, based in Sarajevo. The responsibility of the Reis-ul-ulama was to organize Muslim religious life in Bosnia, Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia. In contrast, in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Kosovo, Muslim religious life was organized by the Supreme Mufti, subordinate to the Reis-ul-ulama whose office was in Belgrade. After the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the responsibilities of the Supreme Mufti were transferred to the Ulama Majlis in Skopje and the responsibilities of the Reis-ul-ulama were transferred to the Ulama Majlis in Sarajevo. The newly established Ulama Majlises formed the Rijaset of Islamic community, with its head office in Sarajevo. After the Second World War, the Islamic community of Kosovo became part of the Islamic community of Serbia, based in Pristina. The Islamic community of Serbia was part of the Islamic community of Yugoslav Federation (Rijaset), based in Sarajevo. The Islamic community of Kosovo then declared independence from the Rijaset on 11 December, 1993. = Kosovo Conflict (1998-1999) = The central historical archive belonging to the Islamic Community of Kosovo containing community records spaning 500 years was burned down on June 13, 1999 by Yugoslav Serb police after an armistice and some hours prior to the coming of NATO peacekeeping troops to Prishtin√´.

She played in seven Tests and fourteen Women's One Day Internationals between 1969 and 1987. McKenna first represented New Zealand at hockey, doing so twice in 1967 and 1971. At cricket, opening for her team in the classical batting style was a major contributing skill, as well as being a fiercely competitive player and student of the game and leader, which led to the inevitable role of captain. She batted many a cricketball by herself to perfect her technique, tied in an old sock to a 6 foot high horizontal branch of an oak tree at her married home in Hillsborough Terrace in Christchurch. Norman Kirk prime minister of New Zealand used to live next door for a few years until his death in office in an almost identical standard weatherboard house with nearly no fencing. As perennial captain of St Albans she would often put herself in at number 3, like when she made 88* and Vicki Burtt made 148*, a partnership of 242 unbroken that has become a club record for St Albans. She favoured a Gray Nichols bat. She also bowled medium spin in all the teams she played for. She still held the St Albans club record in 2005 for most appearances for the club at 330 in 2005.

(1918) 'Latest Works of Fiction' The New York Times. July 7. Synopsis One day, the police escort sent along to mind the prisoners as they journey along the Takase River is surprised to find that on this particular journey there will be only one prisoner, an unnervingly polite man named Kisuke who does not fit the stereotypical image of a criminal. The police escort is rattled but curious and asks why Kisuke seems so cheerful when the boat's usual passengers are sad. Kisuke replies that, unlike the majority of the boat's passengers, his previous life was so bad that he is sure that his life in exile will be an improvement. In addition, the money given him by the government to start a new life in exile is the largest sum of money he has ever had, and so he is quite content. Intrigued, the police escort asks about Kisuke's crime. Kisuke says that his parents died young, orphaning him and his little brother. The brothers lived and worked together into young adulthood, when Kisuke's brother became so ill that he could no longer work. Kisuke was forced to work for the both of them, incurring large debts. One day, he returned home to find that his brother had attempted to kill himself. Still alive, his brother begs for Kisuke to finish the job and put him out of his pain, explaining that he wanted to die so that he could no longer be a burden to his older brother.

After studying at the Slade School of Fine Art, Potter began her career, exhibiting in London by the early 1920s. From the 1950s, her work became increasingly abstract, and she gained wider notice. Early life and career Potter was born Marian (Mary) Anderson Attenborough in Beckenham, Kent. Her parents were Arthur (John) Attenborough (1873‚Äì1940), a solicitor, and his wife, Kathleen Mary, n√©e Doble (1872‚Äì1957). Potter attended St Christopher's school in Beckenham, and the Beckenham School of Art. She studied under Henry Tonks at the Slade School of Fine Art, beginning in 1918, where she won many prizes including the first prize for portrait painting After leaving school, she shared a studio in Fitzroy Street in London's bohemian Fitzrovia neighborhood,Inwood, Stephen (2009). Historic London: An Explorer's Companion, Macmillan, p. 229 became a member briefly of the Seven and Five Society and exhibited with The New English Art Club and The London Group. She worked in oil paint and watercolours. She was married to the writer and radio producer Stephen Potter from 1927 to 1955, and the couple had two children, Andrew (born 1928) and Julian (born 1931). Her first solo exhibition was in 1932 at the Bloomsbury Gallery in London. During the Second World War, the family moved out of London but returned soon afterwards. Her paintings ranged from still lifes and landscapes to portraits, including one of Joyce Grenfell. Later years In 1951, Potter moved with her husband to Aldeburgh on the east coast of Suffolk and lived in The Red House which she swapped, in 1957, for Crag House, owned by Benjamin Britten, with whom she became a close friend after her divorce in 1955. With her children grown, she spent long hours painting. By mixing paint with beeswax, she achieved a \\"chalky luminous quality\\" using a \\"pale and subtle\\" range of colours, and her work grew increasingly abstract.\\"Mary Potter 1900-1981\\", Saunders Fine Art, accessed 19 April 2014 In his essay for the catalogue of her 1965 Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition, Mary Potter Paintings 1938‚Äì1964, museum director Kenneth Clark said Potter's works \\"exist in the domain of seeing and feeling; we know that they are exactly right in the same way that we know a singer to be perfectly in tune\\"; he described her paintings as \\"enchanting moments of heightened perception\\".Clark, Kenneth. \\"Mary Potter Paintings 1938‚Äì1964\\", The Whitechapel Art Gallery, 1965 In the 1960s and 1970s Potter gained increasing recognition. From 1967 she had seven solo shows with the New Art Centre in London, which continued to champion her work following her death, holding a further five Mary Potter exhibitions.Mary Potter pamphlet and catalogues, New Art Centre, 1967‚Äì1989 She was awarded an OBE in 1979, and major retrospective exhibitions of her work were shown at the Tate Gallery in 1980 and the Serpentine Gallery in 1981, which opened to great critical acclaim a few months before her death. In a review of that exhibition in The Sunday Times, Marina Vaizey wrote: \\"The results over the past several decades have been paintings of the most exquisite tensile webs of pale resonant colour, the subjects almost vanished, but the echoes imaginatively suggesting the fullness of life: an evanescent evocation of the shapes and surroundings in which people live. The very delicacy is paradoxically full-blooded\\".Vaizey, Marina, \\"A painter at the heart of things\\", The Sunday Times, May 31, 1981, p. 34 Also in 1981 Potter won the John Moores prize. The John Moore prize was given out by The Walker Gallery to encourage lesser known artist to participate in the art world. William Packer the art critic commented on Mary Potter‚Äôs art work, for the Financial Times in London, after one of her shows calling it, ‚Äúvery english, and very good.‚Äù He compared her work to Victor Pasmore, ‚ÄúThose much-vaunted paintings of his, of the Thames along Chiswick Reach made just after the war, are more than equalled by her comparable and contemporaneous images of the breezy, spray-swept front at Brighton, and her views of Regent's Park and in the Zoo.\\" She died of lung cancer, at age 81, at her home in Aldeburgh.

It was built in 1898, in a Northern Renaissance style, and was previously called The Crown. Geoff Brandwood and Jane Jephcote's guide to heritage pubs in London describes it as \\"a truly magnificent pub-cum-hotel\\" with \\"superb fittings\\", including extensive use of marble. The architect was Charles Worley. Interior The highlight is the \\"grand saloon\\" as it was originally known. There is an exceptional marble fireplace, as well as a marble-topped bar counter. Altogether 50 different types of marble are used, with paired marble Corinthian pilasters supporting the opulent part-gilded beamed ceiling, and even the chimney and the saloon walls are faced with marble. Frank Crocker In 1987, the pub's name was changed to Crocker's Folly, which had been its nickname for many years. The story was that Frank Crocker, believing he had a reliable tip-off about the site of the new terminus of the Great Central Railway, built the pub on a lavish scale to serve it, however when the terminus was actually built it turned out to be over half a mile away at Marylebone Station ‚Äì leading to Crocker's ruin, despair and eventual suicide, jumping from the window of an upper floor. In reality, Crocker died in 1904, aged only 41, but of natural causes, although the subsequent landlord, Charles Durden, did kill himself in the way described.See https://pubshistory.com/LondonPubs/Marylebone/CrownTavernAberdeen.shtml retrieved October 2017. It has been claimed that Crocker's ghost haunts the pub. Every wall, window and ceiling was decorated in ornate style, with soaring pillars, wood panelling and elaborate stucco featuring gambolling cherubs. Its grand saloon used 50 types of marble to create a magnificent bar- top, archways, an enormous fireplace and soaring pillars, which in turn supported the opulent part-gilded beamed ceiling. Even the chimney and walls were faced with marble. Redevelopment The pub closed in autumn 2004 and in November 2011, Westminster City Council gave outline planning consent for the conversion of the three upper floors to residential use. It was noted that the building was on the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register, and in need of urgent repair. In February 2014, London Drinker magazine reported that work had begun on the conversion of the upper floors to apartments and that the ground floor would be converted to a restaurant, perhaps with a bar. In 2014, it was acquired by Maroush, a group of Lebanese restaurants, and it reopened in October 2014 as a Lebanese restaurant and bar.

The house's ornate Gothic Revival features include lancet-arch windows with eared hoods, jigsawn vergeboard in most of its gables, and finials at the points of the gables. The roof has two major north-south gabled sections, which are joined by a transverse section, with dormers projecting at a variety of points. The interior features high quality finishes in the Greek Revival style. The erection of the house was started in 1861 and completed in 1863 for Henrietta Brewer, the wife of John Nehemiah Marks Brewer, whose Greek Revival house stands a short way to the south.

Author Aldous Huxley had a major impact on O'Gallagher's life, encouraging him to pursue a career in the arts, which led to him studying with Hans Hofmann in Greenwich Village in 1946. Meeting members of the Ojai Players, a theatrical group focusing on the work of Anton Chekhov, he was invited to paint their sets at the High Valley Theatre in Ojai, California. In Ojai, he began a number of lifelong friendships with remarkable individuals including the actress Iris Tree, artist Beatrice Wood and Rosalind Rajagopal, who invited him to teach art at the recently created Happy Valley School (now the Besant Hill School of Happy Valley. Meeting the Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti had a major impact on O'Gallagher's philosophical views, which became increasingly concerned with mystical experience and creating social change. Career Moving to San Francisco, O' Gallagher and his life-partner Robert Rheem maintained a studio, where they created Abstract Expressionist paintings in the area's Chinatown district during the 1950s and 1960s, where they interacted with a number of artists, writers and philosophers including Richard Brautigan, Jess Collins, Robert Duncan, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Michael McClure, Jean Varda and Alan Watts. Familiar with the Beat Scene in North Beach, O'Gallagher assisted Dr. Francis J. Rigney in researching his book The Real Bohemia: A Sociological and Psychological Study of The \\"Beats\\". Reproduction of Untitled (Bird), A Painting by Liam O'Gallagher Experience with psychedelic drugs Influenced by Aldous Huxley and Gerald Heard, Liam became interested in the potential of LSD and in 1959 he traveled to Mexico with Robert Rheem, Dr. Barbara Brown and Laura Huxley to visit the home of Indra Devi, where he was given a dose of the then legal drug. Having an ecstatic experience on LSD, he returned to San Francisco with an increased interest in mystical experience. In 1962, O'Gallagher tried Psilocybin and the experience was filmed by Michael McClure and later used in a film titled Chinatown Trip, created by Kevin Wallace. Despite his belief that both experiences were positive and expanded his consciousness, O'Gallagher never took any form of recreational drug again and cautioned others about doing so. Beyond painting In 1963, O'Gallagher was invited to the Marcel Duchamp retrospective exhibition at the Pasadena Art Museum, as well as the private party that followed, where he met Duchamp along with Andy Warhol, whose first gallery exhibition in Los Angeles coincided with the event. Duchamp would prove a major influence on O'Gallagher's work and the friendship with Warhol continued. In 1966, when Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable travelled to San Francisco, O'Gallagher and Rheem threw a party for the group, attended by Warhol and members of the Velvet Underground. In the late 1960s, O'Gallagher felt that the future of art was concerned with new technologies as opposed to painting. He was also writing a great deal and published Planet Noise, a book of poetry that utilized the \\"cut-up\\" method he'd learned from William Burroughs and was published in a number of international magazines. He experimented with alternative printing processes, happenings and sound experiments. In 1969, he collaborated with pioneering choreographer Anna Halprin on Ceremony of Us, which featured African-American dancers from the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles and dancers from Halprin's San Francisco Dancers' Workshop, who were primarily white. Ceremony of Us premiered at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and resulted in a record by Charles Amirkanian and O'Gallagher, funded by Jim Newman's Dilexi Gallery. Return Trip event at Precita Park, San Francisco, 1969 In 1972, O'Gallagher's The Blue Planet Notebooks was published, which featured prose, poetry, graphics, collage and experiments with creating art utilizing computers. In the book's introduction, artist, writer and critic Richard Kostelanetz wrote, \\"Liam O'Gallagher is a genuine polyartist, whose adventurous imagination has already moved through several media and will probably pioneer a few more. It is characteristic that he should be, if only 'in passing' one of the finest visual poets ever seen in America. He takes deep walks in all kinds of space, both inner and outer, artistic and socio-futurological, implicitly instigating jumps in time.\\"The Blue Planet Notebooks, X-Communications, 1972 Centers for human growth In the early 1970s, O'Gallagher turned his attention to creating social change through bringing like-minded people together. He was central in creating Feathered Pipe Ranch, working with Jermaine \\"Jerry\\" Duncan and India Supera. Arranging the sale of Bear Creek Lodge, which had belonged to Robert Rheem's parents, he assisted in transforming it into a center for human growth, with Feathered Pipe Ranch evolving into an early yoga center. In 1973, O'Gallagher and Rheem returned to Ojai, transforming the former High Valley Theater into a home and studio and spending time with their friends Rosalind Rajagopal and Beatrice Wood. He convinced Rajagopal to make land available for a new venture, which was originally connected with The Human Dimensions Institute, but evolved into the Ojai Foundation when he brought Joan Halifax from New York City to become its Director. Following the death of Beatrice Wood in 1998, O'Gallagher and Rheem were central to the creation of the Beatrice Wood Center for the Arts in the artist's former home. Later work In the mid-1980s, O'Gallagher and Rheem settled in Santa Barbara, California, where O'Gallagher began a series of smaller canvases that were highly original, yet still concerned with non-objective painting. He wrote poetry, conceptualized a multi-media work titled The 4th World and a set of cards titled Point of Departure. This work continued until his death, at which time the paintings and his intellectual property were given to the Beatrice Wood Center for the Arts, which has since featured the work in annual presentations.

Built in the late 1760s, it is one of the town's oldest surviving buildings. It is further notable for its association with the locally prominent Learned family, and for its role in the summer estate trend of the early 20th century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Learned Homestead is located in a rural setting of southeastern Dublin, near the junction of Upper Jaffrey Road with Swan Hill Road. It is located south of the junction, on the east side of a drive that continues on to the Learned Homestead. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and aluminum siding exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the entrance, which is sheltered by a hip-roofed portico supported by round columns. Two shed-roof dormers project from the front roof face. The interior's surviving original features include fireplaces and wooden paneling. The house was built sometime between 1767-70 by Benjamin Learned, one of Dublin's early settlers, and remained in his family's hands for over a century. Learned was prominent in local affairs, serving as town selectman, school commissioner, and deacon of the Congregational church for many years.

The movie tells a story of a young man and the trouble he goes through to court the girl he is in love with. With the help of his uncle, the father of the girl, he manages to make her fall in love with him ‚Äì but not after the entire town hears rumors about his womanizing ways. The film based on The Whole Town's Talking, a play by Anita Loos and John Emerson.The Film's page on El Cinema.com. See (in Arabic)  Plot  Eshaet Hob starts with the introduction of a wealthy business man, Abdel Qader El Nashashgi (Youssef Wahby), and his eccentric family ‚Äì his outspoken wife, Bahiga (Ehsan Elsherif), his two nephews, Hussein (Omar Sharif) and Mahroos (Abdel-Menam Ibrahim), and his beautiful daughter, Samiha (Soad Hosny). Hussein, a lowly writer turned- manager in his uncle‚Äôs firm, is desperately in love with Samiha who in turn is infatuated with multilingual playboy, Luci (Gamal Ramses). Seeing as she is of marrying age, her parents plan to marry her off. Her father wants to set her up with Hussein, who is an upstanding gentleman with a promising future. On the other hand, her mother encourages her to become engaged to Luci. The difference in opinion leads to a dispute that prompts Samiha‚Äôs father to concoct a seduction plan with which Hussein would woo Samiha. Complicated, convoluted, and complex, the plan relies heavily on making Samiha jealous by \\"exposing\\" Hussein‚Äôs various relationships with different women, thus making him desirable to Samiha. Abdel Qader fabricates love letters and phone calls, with the help of Mahroos, claiming that they are from the Egyptian star Hind Rostom (Hind Rostom). Effectively jealous, Samiha, Luci and their friends search Hussein‚Äôs room for evidence of Hussein‚Äôs lady killer ways. Samiha‚Äôs father, acting enraged, threatens to throw Hussein out of the house they share declaring that Hussein was soiling the family‚Äôs reputation. Due to the gossipy nature of Samiha‚Äôs friends, the people of Port Saeed ‚Äì the city that they live in ‚Äì believe that Hussein is actually in a relationship with Hind Rostom. Trouble bubbles up when Hind Rostom visits the city to perform a show. Luci meets a friend of his at a club, who later turns out to be Hind Rostom‚Äôs overly jealous fianc√©, Adel (Adel Hekal). Spurned by Samiha‚Äôs feelings for Hussein, Luci decides to expose Hussein and Hind Rostom‚Äôs relationship to Adel, who gets furious at the deception. This results in a fight between Hussein and Adel, which culminates in Hind Rostom storming into the fight, intent on teaching her fianc√© a lesson. With the help of a child performer, Hind Rostom deceives Adel, Samiha and Bahiga into believing that she had a child with Hussein. Samiha, heart-broken, ends her relationship with Hussein and listens to her mother‚Äôs advice about marrying Luci. Samiha receives a phone call from Hind Rostom explaining the ploy which patches up Samiha‚Äôs relationship with Hussein. After a couple of comedic moments, all secrets are aired out, finally leaving Samiha and Hussein to have their happy ending.

Research TIGGE is a key component of THORPEX, a World Weather Research Programme to accelerate the improvements in the accuracy of 1-day to 2 week high-impact weather forecasts for the benefit of humanity. Centralized archives of ensemble model forecast data, from many international centers, are used to enable extensive data sharing and research. The Unidata LDM software package is used to transport the ensemble model data from the providers to the archive centers. Currently, the output from the ECMWF, UK Met Office (UKMO), National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting - India (NCMRWF), Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), CMA, Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP-USA), Meteorological Service of Canada (CMC), Bureau of Meteorology Australia (BOM), Centro de Previsao Tempo e Estudos Climaticos Brazil (CPTEC), Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), and MeteoFrance (MF) global models, totaling 440 GB/day, is moved at up to 30 GB/hour to NCAR (Realtime Statistics). By requirement the parameter fields, atmospheric levels, and physical units are consistent across all data from the providers and encoded in WMO GRIB-2 format. In contrast, each provider may submit their model output in a resolution they choose. =Data availability= TIGGE data is available to the public for non-commercial research, with a 48-hour delay after forecast initialization time. The designated TIGGE archive centre is now at ECMWF via its TIGGE web portal Meteorological Archival and Retrieval System (MARS). It offers fast access to terabytes of data kept online and delayed access to data in the long term archives. Users can select parameters, grid resolution, and spatial subsets for the most current two-week period. Forecast files are organized by level type (single level, pressure level, potential vorticity level, and potential temperature level), and forecast time-step for a specified model. All ensemble members are included in each forecast file. History =Early discussion= TIGGE appears to have been originally envisaged in the THORPEX International Research Implementation Plan (TIP) whose first draft was released on February 14, 2005. In the plan, TIGGE was viewed as a first step towards a Global Interactive Forecasting System (GIFS) (GIFS has still not been made available to the public). According to the plan: \\"The initial basic components of TIGGE will be global ensembles run to around 14 days, including those run currently at a number of operational centres.\\" (p. 38) Interactivity was a key component of the original vision. According to the plan: \\"The concept of interactivity will be tested in the TIGGE framework. As a response to the day to day changes in uncertainty, extra observations could be called on in ‚Äòsensitive areas‚Äô, ensemble size and resolution adjusted, and regional ensembles run as and when needed; all these adapting in real time to meet user needs.\\" (p. 38) The following expected outcomes were listed (pp. 38‚Äì39): * Enhanced collaboration on development of ensemble prediction, internationally and between operational centres and universities * New methods of combining ensembles from different sources and of correcting for systematic errors (biases) * Understanding of the feasibility of interactive ensemble system responding dynamically to changing uncertainty (including use for adaptive observing, variable ensemble size, on-demand regional ensembles) and exploiting new technology for grid computing and high-speed data transfer. * Test (through FDPs) concept of TIGGE Prediction Centre to produce ensemble-based predictions of high-impact weather, wherever it occurs, on all predictable time ranges. * A prototype future Global Interactive Forecasting System. =First workshop= The first workshop devoted to setting up TIGGE was held on March 1‚Äì3, 2005, at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The final report of the workshop laid out a plan for setting up the THORPEX TIGGE-GIFS working group as soon as possible and for setting up the infrastructure for TIGGE over the next few years, in time to contribute to proposed real-time THORPEX support for the International Polar Year field campaigns in 2007-08 and the 2008 Beijing Olympics WWRP Research and Development Project. =Progress and research= TIGGE was made operational over the coming years, and can now be accessed through multiple portals including the websites of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in the United States. Data from TIGGE has been used in many meteorology papers. A 2010 review by Bougeault et al. surveyed the past work and future plans of TIGGE, and concluded: \\"We are convinced that the TIGGE databases will constitute a key resource for reaching the objective of THORPEX: the acceleration of the progress of the forecast skill for severe weather events from 1 day to 2 weeks ahead. This will be reached by a robust combination of research on the scientific basis of ensemble prediction, experimentation with new products, and development of new protocols and policies for data exchange across WMO Member States and across the science and application communities.\\" Another 2010 paper provided a timeline with 2008-2012 as the development phase for the Global Interactive Forecasting System (GIFS) and 2012 onward as the implementation period. Some research on TIGGE has compared it with the North American Ensemble Forecasting System (NAEFS) operated jointly by meteorological agencies in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The research compares the ensembles and considers whether combining them can yield even better forecasts than either one individually. =Introduction of TIGGE-LAM= In March 2014, the TIGGE-LAM (limited area model) was launched to improve on regional ensemble forecasts. Reception =Academic reception= Data from TIGGE has been used in many meteorology papers. The most common subject of the papers referencing TIGGE is tropical cyclones, suggesting that cyclones are an area where having two-week ensembles provides the most marginal value.

Built in 1898, it is one of two houses in the town to be designed by the prominent Boston architectural firm Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, and is a prominent local example of Shingle style architecture. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Markham House stands in a rural setting west of the village center of Dublin, on the west side of Snow Hill Road a short way south of its junction with Main Street (New Hampshire Route 101). It is set in a small clearing on a slope with west-facing views of nearby Dublin Pond. It is a three story frame structure, with a gambrel roof and shingled exterior. The roof hangs over a recessed porch on the ground floor, and its steep west face has a long shed-roof dormer whose windows are topped by shallow gables. A service wing extends west from the main block. The house was designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge and built in 1898 for Mrs. Hugh McKittrick, whose daughter later married George D. Markham. It is one of two known designs by this firm in Dublin; the other is the main house of the Knollwood estate. The area immediately west of the house was landscaped about 1910 by the Boston landscape designers Brent and Hall. In the mid-20th century, the house was purchased by Gray Thoron, dean of the Cornell University Law School.

It is native to eastern Australia. The black rock scorpion was described by Swedish naturalist Tamerlan Thorell in 1876 as Ioctonus manicatus. The type locality was described as \\"New Holland\\". In 1888 Reginald Innes Pocock, an assistant at the Natural History Museum in London, was cataloging specimens of the genus and described what he thought was a new species‚Äînaming it U. abruptus‚Äî from two dried female specimens, one from Adelaide and the other labelled \\"New Holland\\". German naturalist Karl Kraepelin concluded that Thorell's I. manicatus was the same species as U. abruptus and U. novaehollandiae. It was also collected from Cooma by William Joseph Rainbow who named it Buthus flavicruris in 1896. The genus Urodacus was placed in its own family in 2000. Before this, the group had been a subfamily Urodacinae within the family Scorpionidae. Measuring up to 5.5 cm (2.2 in), it is dark brown or black. It ranges from Queensland through New South Wales and Victoria into South Australia. Its preferred habitat is granite outcrops in open forest. It excavates a burrow underneath rocks or logs with a terminal chamber and passage to the surface. It preys upon insects such as cockroaches and beetles, as well as other invertebrates such as millipedes, centipedes, spiders and rarely earthworms. Its sting can cause local pain and swelling in humans. It is one of the species of scorpion most commonly seen for sale in pet shops in Australia and is relatively easy to keep in captivity, where it has a lifespan of 6 to 10 years. There are concerns wild populations are being depleted because of specimens taken for the pet trade. U. manicatus was recently shown to harbor a unique peptide toxin, presumably for defensive purposes. This cell-penetrating peptide selectively activates mammalian TRPA1 receptors, which are expressed in pain-sensing peripheral neurons, to produce acute pain and pain hypersensitivities, but not inflammation. For mechanistic insights into this discrepancy, see ref. . Because TRPA1 is also known as the 'Wasabi Receptor,' given its role as the principle detector of the piquant ingredients in Brassica and Allium (mustard and onion) family plants, this U. manicatus toxin has been named the Wasabi Receptor Toxin or WaTx  References  Further reading  Scorpionidae Scorpions described in 1876 Fauna of Australia ","title":"Urodacus manicatus"},{"id":"42530969","text":"V√§rmd√∂ HC, also known as V√§rmd√∂ Hockey, is a Swedish ice hockey club located on the island of V√§rmd√∂.

In 1890 she became the first woman to reach the summit of Mount Rainier. Biography Fay Fuller was born in 1869 in New Jersey to Ann E. and Edward N. Fuller. In 1882, when Fuller was 12 years old, her family relocated to Tacoma, Washington, where she began to explore the wilderness. After graduating from high school, Fuller began teaching at the age of 15, eventually moving to work in Yelm, Washington. While teaching in Yelm, her school was visited by P. B. Van Trump, one of the first climbers to ascend Mount Rainier, with whom she became friends and who would inspire her to climb Rainier herself. Fuller made her first attempt on Rainier in 1887, reaching an elevation of approximately and setting a goal to someday \\"climb to the summit of the great peak\\". In 1890 she was invited by Van Trump to join a climbing party for a second attempt at climbing the mountain. On the afternoon of August 10, she and four teammates reached Columbia Crest, Rainier's highest summit, making her the first woman to have climbed the mountain. The next climbing party on the mountain found Fuller's hair pins on the route and joked that this proved \\"a woman really had made it to the summit\\". Fuller gave up teaching to become a journalist like her father, an editor of several Tacoma newspapers, with whom she found her first reporting job as the first female reporter for the Tacoma Ledger. Following her successful ascent of Mount Rainier, she was given a column titled \\"Mountain Murmurs\\" in which she covered mountaineering social events near Paradise, Washington and accounts by earlier climbers of Rainier. She also played a significant role in developing the Pacific Northwest climbing community: she helped to found the Washington Alpine Club in 1891, the Tacoma Alpine Club in 1893, and the Mazamas mountaineering club in Portland, Oregon in 1894. Fuller left Tacoma in 1900 to continue her career in journalism in Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York City. In New York, she met and married Fritz von Briesen, an attorney. They later moved to Santa Monica, California, where Fuller died in 1958 at the age of 88. Fay Peak in Mount Rainier National Park was named after her.

It is the amount by which a project‚Äôs expected return on investment (ROI) is reduced due to the critical path drag of a specific critical path activity Task (project management) or other specific schedule factor such as a schedule lag or other delaying constraint.Stephen A. Devaux \\"The Drag Efficient: The Missing Quantification of Time on the Critical Path\\" Defense AT&L; magazine of the Defense Acquisition University. Drag cost is computed at the activity level, but is caused by the impact at the project level due to: 1\\\\. A reduction in a project's expected value because of later completion, or 2\\\\. An increase in a project's cost due to its indirect costs being increased because of a longer project duration. Drag cost computation is often used on projects in order to justify additional project resources. For example, if a project's expected ROI will be reduced by $5,000 for every day of duration, then an activity that has critical path drag of ten days (i.e., is delaying project completion by ten days) will have a drag cost of $50,000. If the addition of a resource that costs $10,000 would reduce the activity's drag to five days, the drag cost would be reduced by $25,000 and the project's expected ROI would be increased by $15,000 ($25,000 minus the additional $10,000 of resource costs). On projects which are performed for non-monetary reasons, such as public literacy programs or emergency response, drag cost can be measured in units of reduction in citizens educated or lives lost due to the additional time taken by critical path activities. Just as drag is only found on the critical path, the same is true of drag cost.

It ranges across inland Australia from Birdsville on the border of southwestern Queensland and northwestern New South Wales across South Australia and the southern Northern Territory to Broome and Laverton in Western Australia. The genus Urodacus was placed in its own family in 2000. Before this, the group had been a subfamily Urodacinae within the family Scorpionidae. Measuring up to 7 cm (2.8 in), it is one of largest species of scorpion native to Australia. It has a red-yellow-brown carapace, with tergites, tail and pedipalps a darker red to red-black. Its underside and legs are brown-yellow. The male has a long tail, while the female has a short tail. The inland robust scorpion builds and resides in a spiral burrow in the sand. A field study near Broken Hill measured the burrows and found they all had the same basic structure: a sloping entrance chamber to a depth of 8‚Äì10 cm, followed by up to nine spiral turns leading to a lower horizontal terminal chamber. The depth of the burrow and number of spiral turns depended on the instar of the scorpion; the younger (2nd instar) scorpion burrows were 15‚Äì20 cm deep while those of the oldest (6th instar) scorpions reached a depth of around 100 cm. The scorpion digs by moving sand with its chelicerae and scraping it backwards under successive pairs of legs. The amount of sand removed can be 200‚Äì400 times its own weight.

In field hockey, a penalty stroke, sometimes known as a penalty flick, is the most severe penalty given. It is predominantly awarded when a foul has prevented a certain goal from being scored or for a deliberate infringement by a defender in the penalty circle. Awarding a penalty stroke There are two reasons why a penalty stroke may be awarded: *For an intentional foul on an attacker who has possession of or opportunity to play the ball in the circle *For a foul in the penalty circle that prevents \\"the probable scoring of a goal\\". Procedure Upon the awarding of a penalty stroke, time in the match is stopped. The penalty stroke is between any chosen attacking player and the defensive goalkeeper. The penalty stroke is taken from the penalty spot which is directly in front of the centre of the goal. Before the penalty stroke is taken, the goalkeeper must be standing with both feet on the goal line and the attacker within playing distance of the ball. When the umpire blows the whistle, the attacker may play the ball at goal using a \\"push, flick or scoop\\" motion. The attacking player must not feint and can only play the ball once (there is no rebound); the goalkeeper is not permitted to move their feet until the ball is played. A goal is scored if the ball completely crosses the line. Otherwise, play resumes with a defensive 15 m free-hit. Any infringement by an attacking player during the stroke concludes in the same result, an infringement by a defensive player may result in the penalty stroke being retaken if a goal has not been scored. History The first equivalent penalty in the rules was introduced in 1908 and known as a penalty bully, a form of bully-off between the offending player and any player from the attacking team. Other players could not take part until the penalty bully was complete and had to remain outside the penalty circle; in 1909 this was revised to remaining beyond the 25-yard line (now known as the 23-metre line). The penalty bully would cease when either a goal had been scored or the ball was played out of the penalty circle or over the back line by the attacker. Play was then resumed with a normal bully-off at the centre of the 25-yard line. If the ball was played over the back line by the defender (outside the goal) then the penalty bully was retaken. A foul during the penalty bully could result in a penalty goal. In 1963, the penalty stroke replaced the penalty bully and was awarded for deliberately stopping a certain goal. Then the penalty spot was from goal. In 1973, a stroke could also be awarded for a deliberate foul in the circle. The penalty spot was moved to its current position in 1974. Penalty goals could also be awarded for intentional fouls during a penalty stroke until 2009.

The headquarter of the community is in Skopje and the current leader, titled Reis-ul-ulema, is Sulejman Rexhepi.  History  There has been organized Islamic religious life in Macedonia since the time when Ottoman Empire started administering this region. All(Sunni) Muslims who lived in the Ottoman Empire were part of the Muslim community headed by the sultan, who replaced the role of the caliph. During the reign of the Sultan Murad II the competences of the caliph were transferred to the grand mufti. Since then, the grand mufti was titled Sheykhul-Islam and was considered the highest religious authority within the Ottoman Empire. However, every region inhabited by Muslims had its own mufti, who was in lower position than the Sheykhul-Islam. After the First World War, North Macedonia was under the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Islamic community of the Kingdom was headed by Reis- ul-ulama, whose office was in Sarajevo. The Reis-ul-ulama responsibility was to organize the Islamic Religious life in Bosnia and Hezegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, whereas in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Kosovo the Islamic Religious life was organized by the Supreme Mufti (that was in a lower position than the Reis-ul-ulama), whose office was in Belgrade. After the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the competences of the Supreme Mufti were transferred to the Ulama Majlis in Skopje and the competences of the Reis-ul-ulama were transferred to the Ulama Majlis in Sarajevo. The newly formed Ulama Majlises formed the Rijaset of Islamic Community with its head office in Sarajevo. After the Second World War the Islamic Community of Macedonia became part of the Islamic Community of Yugoslav Federation (Rijaset), with its office in Sarajevo. After the Breakup of Yugoslavia and the independence of Macedonia, this community continues to act as an independent religious community in North Macedonia, based in Skopje. =Arabati Baba controversy= In 2002, a group of armed members of the Islamic Community of Macedonia invaded the Shi ªi Bektashi Order Arabati Baba Tekke in an attempt to claim the Shia tekke as a mosque for their followers, although the facility has never functioned as such. Subsequently, the Bektashi Order of Macedonia has sued the Macedonian government for failing to defend and later, to restore the tekke to the Bektashi community, pursuant to a law passed in the early 1990s returning property previously nationalized under the Yugoslav government. The law, however, deals with restitution to private citizens, rather than religious communities. The ICM claim to the tekke is based upon their contention to represent all Muslims in Macedonia; and indeed, they are one of two Muslim organizations recognized by the government, both Sunni. The Bektashi Order filed for recognition as a separate religious community with the Macedonian government in 1993, but the Macedonian government has refused to recognize them. In March 2008, there were reports that the ICM members squatting on the facility grounds have taken control of additional buildings, have been intimidating visitors to the tekke, and have discharged their weapons on the grounds.WahhabiWatch = Modern period = On 26 November 2019, an earthquake struck Albania.

Prior to playing professionally, Jones attended Louisiana State University (LSU) and played college baseball for the LSU Tigers. Jones was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the third round of the 2013 MLB draft, and traded to the Tigers in 2015. Amateur career Jones grew up in Richton, Mississippi. He attended Richton High School, where he starred for his school's baseball team. In 2009, he was an Aflac All American and an Under Armor All American. During his senior year in 2010, he was named Mississippi High School Player of the Year. He was also named the Louisville Slugger Mississippi Player of the Year. Jones was also a 2nd Team All American in 2010. Jones is the all-time career hit leader in the state of Mississippi. Jones was a four time All-state selection in high school and was also a 1st Team All-District. He was a Wendy‚Äôs High School Heisman in Mississippi recipient. Jones was then drafted in the 19th round of the 2010 MLB draft straight out of high school, but chose to go to LSU. He then enrolled at Louisiana State University (LSU), and played college baseball for the LSU Tigers baseball team as a second baseman. As a freshman with the Tigers, Jones had a .338 batting average, four home runs and 32 runs batted in. He was named to the All-Southeastern Conference (SEC)'s freshman team and a freshman All-American. As a sophomore, the Tigers tried to play Jones in center field, but moved him back to second base. He batted .252 on the season. In 2012, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he was champion of the Home Run Derby. As a junior, Jones batted .294 with six home runs in 59 games, and was named to the All-SEC second team. Professional career =Minor Leagues= The Pirates selected Jones in the third round of the 2013 MLB draft as an outfielder. He signed with Pittsburgh and reported to the Jamestown Jammers of the Class A-Short Season New York‚ÄìPenn League. After playing 15 games for Jamestown, he suffered a knee injury that ended his season. He began the 2014 season with the West Virginia Power of the Class A South Atlantic League as a shortstop. He hit 23 home runs for West Virginia. He began the 2015 season with the Bradenton Marauders of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. The Pirates promoted him to the Altoona Curve of the Class AA Eastern League in July. On July 30, 2015, the Pirates traded Jones to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Joakim Soria. He was assigned to the Erie SeaWolves of the Eastern League. In his third game with the SeaWolves, Jones went three- for-four with three home runs and five RBIs. He finished with a .250 average, six home runs and 20 RBIs in 37 games for the SeaWolves. Following the 2015 season, Jones went on to play for the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League (AFL). Jones was named the AFL Co-Player of the Week for the week ending October 20, and was named to the AFL's Fall Stars Game. On November 5, 2015, while playing in the AFL, Jones was suspended 50 games for his second violation of MLB's joint drug prevention and treatment program. =2016= Jones began the 2016 season with the Toledo Mud Hens of the Class AAA International League. The Tigers promoted Jones to the major leagues on August 30, 2016. In his first two games, he hit 4 for 8, including three doubles. His first major league hit on August 30 was an RBI double against the Chicago White Sox, and on August 31, he scored the game-winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning on a shallow sacrifice fly.Sweep! Walkoff! JaCoby Jones scores winner for Detroit Tigers, 3-2, George Sipple, Detroit Free Press, August 31, 2016 Jones again participated in the Arizona Fall League in 2016, playing mostly center field for the Scottsdale Scorpions in hopes of becoming the Tigers everyday center fielder in 2017. =2017= During a Spring Training broadcast on March 26, 2017, Tiger great Al Kaline described Jones as \\"the best outfielder we have...(as a) runner, thrower, getting a jump on the ball.\\" On March 31, Jones was named as the Tigers opening day center fielder by manager Brad Ausmus. Jones hit his first career Major League home run in his first at-bat of the season on April 4, 2017, a three-run shot against Jos√© Quintana of the Chicago White Sox. Jones became the first Tigers rookie to hit a home run on opening day since Kirk Gibson in 1980, and the first Tiger to record his first Major League home run on opening day since John Sullivan in 1965. On April 22, 2017, Jones was hit in the face by a pitch from Justin Haley. With blood coming from Jones' lips, he left the game. Later tests revealed no structural damage to his jaw or teeth, but he did receive stitches on the outside and inside of his lower lip. Jones was placed on the 10-day disabled list the next day. After the DL stint, Jones was assigned to Triple-A Toledo. He was recalled to the Tigers on August 18. Jones had two home runs in a September 5 game against the Kansas City Royals. =2018= Jones made the Tigers 2018 opening day roster as an outfielder. On April 20, he hit a walk- off home run in the bottom of the tenth inning to win a game against the Kansas City Royals. On August 13, Jones was placed on the 10-day disabled list after suffering a strained right hamstring. While struggling at the plate in 2018 with a .207 batting average and 11 home runs, Jones was superb on defense. His Defensive Runs Saved rating of 24 (meaning 24 better than league average) was among the major league leaders for outfielders, and he finished second to Mookie Betts in Ultimate Zone Rating. =2019= Jones started the 2019 season on the 10-day injured list, after sustaining a left shoulder sprain running into an outfield wall in a March 23 spring training game. He was recalled on April 11, and made his 2019 debut with the Tigers that afternoon against the Cleveland Indians. Jones ended up back on the IL on July 4 with a lower back strain.

Petunia skylight in the roof of a lava tube associated with Prince Kuhio Kalaniana\`ole (PKK) flows of Kƒ´lauea on the Big Island of Hawaii. View looks downstream. Martian lava tubes are volcanic caverns on Mars that are believed to form as a result of fast-moving, basaltic lava flows associated with shield volcanism. Lava tubes usually form when the external surface of the lava channels cools more quickly and forms a hardened crust over subsurface lava flows. The flow eventually ceases and drains out of the tube, leaving a conduit-shaped void space which is usually several meters below the surface. Lava tubes are typically associated with extremely fluid pahoehoe lava. Gravity on mars is about 38% that of Earth's, allowing Martian lava tubes to be much larger in comparison. Detection and access Lava tubes and related flow structures were first recognized upon examination of Viking orbiter images, and later identified using orbiter imagery from Mars Odyssey, Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Express, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Lava tubes can visually be detected two ways. The first is as long sinuous troughs known as rilles, which are believed to be the remains of collapsed lava tubes. The second method of possible identification is through observation of cave \\"skylights\\" or pit craters, which appear as dark, nearly circular features on the surface of Mars. In June, 2010, a group of seventh grade science students at Evergreen Middle School in Cottonwood, California, participating in the Mars Student Imaging Project, helped researchers discover a new series of lava tubes near Pavonis Mons through identification of a skylight estimated to be 190√ó160 meters wide and at least 115 meters deep. It is only the second skylight known to be associated with this volcano. In addition to orbital imagery, lava tubes could be detected through the use of: *Ground-penetrating radar *Gravimetry *Magnetometry *Seismography *Atmospheric effects *Lidar *Infrared *Human or robotic exploration There has been increased interest in the identification and investigation of lava tubes because they could present scientists with information regarding the geological, paleohydrological, and supposed biological histories of the planet. When speaking about lunar lava tubes, Dr. William \\"Red\\" Whittaker, CEO of Astrobotic Technology, states that \\"something so unique about the lava tubes is that they are the one destination that combines the trifecta of science, exploration, and resources.\\" Access to uncollapsed sections of lava tubes can be done by entering at the end of rille, through skylights, or by drilling or blasting through the roof of a lava tube. Initial exploration of lava tubes may involve rovers, but with difficult challenges. Traditional skylights have large rubble piles directly below them (as seen in the first figure) which would be an obstacle for the rover. The vertical drop that the rover would have to perform would also have to be taken into consideration, as well as the ability of the rover to remain in communication with assets at the surface or in orbit. =Lava tube conditions= Gravity on Mars is about 38% that of Earth, allowing Martian lava tubes to be much larger in comparison. Lava tubes represent prime locations for direct observation of pristine bedrock where keys to the geological, paleohydrological, and possible biological history of Mars could be found. The surface of Mars experiences extreme temperature fluctuations and receives a high amount of Ionizing radiation due to the lack of a magnetic field and the planet's thin atmosphere, which is about 100 times thinner than Earth's. The thin atmosphere allows Mars to radiate heat energy away more easily, so temperatures near the equator can get up to during a summer day, and then drop down to at night. Subsurface conditions on Mars are dramatically more benign than those on the surface, which lead researchers to believe that if life did (or does) exist on Mars, it would most likely be found in these more hospitable environments. Life forms would not only be protected from the high surface temperatures and ultraviolet radiation, but also from wind storms and regolith dust. Martian lava tubes could possibly trap volatiles such as water which is considered essential for life, and may also contain reservoirs of ancient ice since cold air can pool in lava tubes and temperatures remain stable. The ability to tap into these reservoirs may provide dramatic insight into the paleoclimatology and astrobiological histories of Mars. Possibilities for life on Mars The discovery of Martian lava tubes has implications for the possibility of past or present life on Mars. The magnetic and climatic histories of Mars and Earth are extremely different, and would have greatly dictated the evolution of both biospheres. Around four billion years ago, the Martian dynamo shut down following a proposed period when a long-lasting Noachian ocean existed, and when life may have existed at the surface. A sudden and intense increase of solar particles eliminated the atmospheric and hydrological protection, causing the atmosphere to thin and water to retreat from the surface. At this point, life may have sought refuge in subterranean environments such as lava tubes. A wide range of organisms may have survived in the subsurface, such as chemolithotrophs and lithoautotrophs, and certain extremophiles like halophiles or psychrophiles. Microbes found on Earth have been discovered thriving in near-freezing temperatures and very low-oxygen air. This allows researchers to believe that organisms can live in similar extreme situations such as those on Mars where temperatures are colder and less oxygen is available. Volcanic minerals found in lava tubes could provide a rich source of nutrients to chemosynthetic organisms. Scientists are also interested in gaining access to Martian lava tubes because they could give insight into the processes that led to life on Earth since the geologic rock record is better preserved on Mars. Future human habitation The interior of lava tubes, along with other subsurface cavities, could prove to be prime locations for future manned missions to Mars by providing shelter for habitats. These natural caverns have roofs estimated to be tens of meters thick which would provide protection from the extreme conditions that would be experienced on the surface. The habitat would be protected from solar radiation, micrometeorites, extreme temperature fluctuations (ambient temperature is believed to be stable in lava tubes), winds, and regolith dust storms which could pose a threat to human health and technology. These natural shelters would also reduce the landed payload mass for manned missions which would be economically advantageous.

It replaces the Helios 2 satellites. It is sometimes referred to as the MUltinational Space-based Imaging System for Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Observation (MUSIS program).  Program history  Since the launch of Helios 1A in 1995, France has developed a series of military Earth observation programs. Due to the limited lifetime of satellites, a program was launched to replace the currently operational Helios 2 satellites. This program started as a French contribution to the larger pan-European MUSIS program, and eventually became a mostly French program. French Finance Law for 2013 : Defence : Equipment An agreement between France and Germany was reached in April 2015, under which Germany contributes 200 million Euros to building a third satellite, and in exchange receives access rights to the imagery. Sweden and Belgium are also a program partners, which enables the use of a polar ground station.  Technical capabilities  Unlike the Helios satellites, which used the same bus as the Spot satellites, CSO uses technology derived from the Pl√©iades satellites. It is much heavier than Pl√©iades with a mass of 3600 kg. They are made out of 3 identical satellites. The first one was launched in 2018, and provide Very High Resolution imagery - like the Helios 2 satellites, so around 35 cm from an 800 km orbit. The second satellite provides Extremely High Resolution imagery - around 20 cm - from a 480 km orbit. The third satellites will be launched in 2022 and will provide increased revisit capabilities. The satellites have the ability to take infrared images. The satellite manufacturing was awarded to Airbus Defence and Space, while the optical payload is built by Thales Alenia Space. The CSO system is able to produce at least 280 images a day on average. The program cost is estimated at 1.3 billion Euros, with an additional 300 million for the ground segment and 12 years of operations.

Wac≈Çaw Jaworski, nom de guerre Kra (8 February 1911 ‚Äì 23 February 1993) was an officer of the Polish Army in interwar Poland, infantry captain, and an underground soldier of the elite Polish Cichociemni unit (the Silent Unseen) during the occupation of Poland in World War II. Military career In 1934‚Äì35 Kopisto attended the PodchorƒÖ≈ºy military academy in Tarnopol. In 1939 he fought in the September Campaign defending Poland around the town of Podkarpacie. Following Poland's defeat by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, he escaped to Hungary, then to France, and finally Great Britain, where he became a Polish Armed Forces in the West parachutist. He was deployed back to Poland on the night of 2 September 1942 in the area of Gr√≥jec. Kopisto took part in several spectacular military actions in Volhynia against the occupying German forces as well as the collaborationist units of the UPA. On the 20 January 1943 he was involved in the rescue of Polish prisoners of war from Wachlarz of the Armia Krajowa who were being held and tortured at the Pi≈Ñsk prison. The first platoon of Cichociemni rescuers drove undetected through the prison gate in an Opel car, while dressed in the SS uniforms and shouting at the guards in German. Once inside the compound, they shot the commandant who refused to cooperate. They opened the prison cells and released the inmates who were loaded onto a lorry they had requisitioned and they drove away ten minutes before the German reinforcements arrived. Two days later, on 22 January 1943 the SS executed 30 local civilian hostages in retaliation. Kopisto after arrest by the Soviet NKVD, 1944 Kopisto served as commander of Kedyw in the ≈Åuck Inspectorate, and organized Polish self-defence in Wo≈Çy≈Ñ.

They are found in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Queensland. However in 2007, Cooke and Edwards argued that the patterning of the scribbles was different for each of the three eucalypts, Eucalyptus pauciflora, E. racemosa ssp. rossii, and E. delegatensis) and that it was likely that these differing patterns were caused by different species of scribbly gum moths. Taxonomy In 2012, Horak et.al. published a new account of the genus, describing eleven new species of Ogmograptis, and distinguishing three groups, the scribula, maxdayi and triradiata groups. The groupings of Ogmograptis given by Horak et.al. are shown below: One species, Ogmograptis notosema Meyrick 1922 (Cryphioxena), was unable to be assigned to a group as no holotype could be located.

While Fazaeli's blog aims are largely cultural and artistic‚Äîsharing Iranian street fashion with other, predominantly Western, audiences‚ÄîFazaeli also has larger motives of promoting cross-cultural understanding. In a September 2013 interview with The Atlantic Post, Fazaeli explains these larger motives: ‚ÄúI have realized that people have a wrong understanding of us. They believe what they see in the news and even though a lot of it is true there is much more to see ... That is the side that I am trying to show. I don‚Äôt think many have portrayed that about Iranian women before.‚Äù The Tehran Times Format Fazaeli's blog focuses on fashion as illustrated through regular street style posts showing how women interpret enforced codes of dress in Iran.http://arabia.style.com/fashion/news/the- tehran-times-first-street-style-and-fashion-blog-iran/ In addition to these street style posts, which appear without text and feature images of fashionably dressed women in public spaces throughout Iran, The Tehran Times also includes long-form articles by guest writers‚Äîoften in both English and Persian‚Äîon topics relating to Iranian culture. Here Fazaeli explains the inclusion of these cultural, long-form articles on the blog: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think my responsibility is to only post photos of stylish women ... I think there are cultural norms behind fashion and there is a great history behind Iran. A combination of both could make the blog much more interesting and create stronger messages.‚Äù Restrictions on Dress in Iran Women in Iran are obliged to cover their hair and their bodies while in public, but recently many have been pushing these boundaries on \\"appropriate dress\\" with dramatic makeup, elaborate hairstyles, and brightly colored and more fashionable clothing. These codes of dress are enforced by the Basij, the morality police of the Iranian regime established by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979 after the Iranian Revolution. In recent years, scholars have noted an increase of the ways in which youth flout these dress codes and seek to express themselves in both a social and political fashion through their styles of dress.Mahdavi, Pardis, \\"Re-creation of Recreation: The Politics of Fun in the Islamic Republic of Iran\\" Arab Youth : Social Mobilization in Times of Risk London: Saqi, 2011 (149-161) Fazaeli himself highlights in particular the way in which Iranian women can be seen as wearing the hijab in a way that is appropriate both politically and religiously, as well as capable of making fashion and personal statements. Pardis Mahdavi, a scholar whose academic focus is sexual revolutions in the Middle East, argues that not only are youth subverting these codes of dress in order to assert their agency in the face of the regime's attempts at repression, but also that \\"this youth movement is changing the sociopolitical atmosphere Iran, and presenting the clerical members of the regime with their biggest challenge yet.\\" Fazaeli supports this idea of women as changing the sociopolitcal atmosphere in Iran, but also emphasizes that there is no monolithic Iranian woman and thus no monolithic approach to dress in Iran: \\"Are all Iranian women miserable or are all modernized? ... The answer is that they both exist, in all societies.\\" With his blog, Fazaeli is merely seeking to show the multi-faceted approaches to fashion in Iran. Since the 2013 Iranian presidential elections in which Hassan Rouhani was elected as the 7th President of Iran, many remain hopeful about the prospect of a loosening of the constraints of social rights, such as those surrounding codes of dress. Rouhani acknowledged these demands for greater individual freedom in a tweet from his official English-language Twitter account on July 3, 2013, shortly after his election: ‚ÄúIf some1 doesn‚Äôt comply with rules for clothing, person‚Äôs virtue shuldn‚Äôt come under question.

Girkin, a self-described Russian nationalist, was charged by Ukrainian authorities with terrorism. He is currently sanctioned by the European Union for his leading role in the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities have called him a retired colonel of the GRU (Russia's external military intelligence organisation). According to different sources, he unreservedly demands that the \\"liberal clans\\" (liberal elements of the Russian elite) be destroyed. On 28 May 2016 he formed the Russian National Movement, a political group in favor of \\"uniting the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, and other Russian lands into a single all-Russian state and transforming the entire territory of the former USSR into an unconditional zone of Russian influence.\\" On 19 June 2019, Dutch prosecutors charged Girkin for murder in the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and issued an international arrest warrant against him. Involvement in Transnistria, Bosnia, and Chechnya The Russian media has identified Girkin as an officer of the Russian military reserves who has expressed hardline views on eliminating perceived enemies of the Russian state and has fought on the federal side in Russian counter-separatist campaigns in Chechnya and on the pro-Moscow separatist side in the conflict in Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria. According to various sources, Girkin took part in the Bosnian War as a volunteer on the Serb side, and in Chechnya under contract.The pro-Russian group Heroes of New Russia (–ì–µ—Ä–æ–∏ –ù–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏) published Girkin's past military assignments, disclosed by himself on military reconstructions forum: June 1993 ‚Äì July 1994 military unit (–≤/—á) 11281 –ú–û –ü–í–û; Feb‚ÄìDec 1995 contract service 22033 ¬´–•¬ª (166-—è –≥–≤. –ú–°–ë–†); 24 March 1995 till 10 October 1995 67th –û–ì–°–ê–î; August 1996 ‚Äì July 2000 military unit 31763.

In 1999, he published his memoirs of the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2014, he was accused by Bosnian media (Klix) and a retired Bosnian Army officer of having been involved in the Vi≈°egrad massacres in which thousands of civilians were killed in 1992.The leader of Ukrainian separatists Igor Strelkov in 1992 painted in Visegrad cleansed of Bosniaks. Klix. 25 July 2014 The BBC reported Girkin may have worked for Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) in a counter-terrorism unit, citing Russian military experts. According to Russian media, he has served as an FSB officer and his last role before retirement was reportedly with the FSB's Directorate for Combating International Terrorism. In 2014 Anonymous International disclosed what it said were Girkin's personal emails, revealing that he had served in the FSB for 18 years from 1996 to March 2013, including in Chechnya from 1999 to 2005, The Moscow Times reported. The newspaper also said Girkin was born in Moscow and that it contacted him by email and phone but that he would not confirm the claims. A local pro-Russia militia leader in Ukraine, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, a self-described old friend of Girkin's, said the information about Girkin was true. His pseudonym \\"Strelkov\\" (\\"Strelok\\") can be roughly translated as \\"Rifleman\\" or \\"Shooter\\". He has also been dubbed Igor Groznyy (\\"Igor the Terrible\\"). Alexander Cherkasov, head of Russia's leading human rights group Memorial, is convinced that the \\"Igor Strelkov\\" involved in Ukraine is the same person as a Russian military officer called \\"Strelkov\\", who was identified as being directly responsible for at least six instances (on four separate occasions) of the forced disappearance and presumed murder of residents of Chechnya's mountain Vedensky District village of Khatuni and nearby settlements of Makhkety and Tevzeni in 20012002, when \\"Strelkov\\" was attached to the 45th Detached Reconnaissance Regiment special forces unit of the Russian Airborne Troops based near Khatuni. None of these crimes were solved by official investigations. The website of Chechnya's official human rights ombudsman lists several residents of Khatuni who went missing in 2001 (Beslan Durtayev and Supyan Tashayev) as having been kidnapped from their homes and taken to the 45th DRR base by the officers known as \\"Colonel Proskuryn and Strelkov Igor\\"; another entry lists the missing person Beslan Taramov as abducted in 2001 in the village of Elistandzhi by the 45th DRR servicemen led by \\"Igor Strelko (nicknamed Strikal)\\". Cherkasov too lists Durtayev and Tashayev (but not Taramov) among the alleged victims of \\"Strelkov\\". Cherkasov and other observers suspected it was in fact the same \\"Strelkov\\" until May 2014, when Girkin himself confirmed he has been present at Khatuni in 2001, where he fought against the \\"local population\\". According to Cherkasov, as a result of Girkin's actions in Chechnya, two sisters of one of those \\"disappeared\\", Uvais Nagayev, in effect turned to terrorism and died three years later: one of these sisters, Aminat Nagayeva, blew herself up in the 2004 Russian aircraft bombings over the Tula Oblast aboard a Tu-134 \\"Volga-Aeroexpress\\" airliner, killing 43; the other sister, Rosa Nagayeva, participated in the Beslan hostage crisis that same year. The emails leaked in May 2014 and allegedly authored by Girkin contain his diaries from Bosnia and Chechnya he sent to his friends for review. One story describes an operation of capturing Chechen activists from a village of Mesker-Yurt. Asked by one of friends why he didn't publish them, Girkin explained that \\"people we captured and questioned almost always disappeared without trace, without court, after we were done\\" and this is why these stories cannot be openly published. Involvement in Ukraine = Crimea = In an interview on 22 January 2015, Igor Girkin, one of the major \\"Russian self-defence\\" commanders in 2014 Crimean crisis, explained that the \\"overwhelming national support for the self-defence\\" as portrayed by the Russian media was fiction, and they actually had to \\"forcibly drive the deputies to vote [to join Russia]\\". Under his command, the rebels \\"collected\\" the deputies into the chambers to vote. A majority of the law enforcement, administration and army did not support the \\"self-defence\\".\\"–Ø –Ω–µ —É–≤–∏–¥–µ–ª, –∫ —Å–æ–∂–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é, –Ω–∏–∫–∞–∫–æ–π –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–∏ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –≤ –°–∏–º—Ñ–µ—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–µ. –ù–µ –±—ã–ª–æ –µ–µ. –î–µ–ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–≤ —Å–æ–±–∏—Ä–∞–ª–∏ –æ–ø–æ–ª—á–µ–Ω—Ü—ã, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∑–∞–≥–Ω–∞—Ç—å –∏—Ö –≤ –∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –æ–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è–ª–∏ —Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è. –ò —è –±—ã–ª –æ–¥–Ω–∏–º –∏–∑ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∏—Ä–æ–≤ —ç—Ç–∏—Ö –æ–ø–æ–ª—á–µ–Ω—Ü–µ–≤\\", According to an accomplice, Girkin arrived in Crimea describing himself as the \\"Kremlin's emissary,\\" and soon after formed the Crimean self-defense forces. His position was above that of self-declared Crimea prime minister Sergei Aksyonov, and his main task in March 2014 was the accelerated military training for the newly formed Crimean forces, and selecting the best among them for transfer to the invasion of the Donbas. Girkin personally negotiated and oversaw the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Crimea. According to Girkin, he was in charge of the Simferopol Photogrammatic Center's assault. = Siege of Sloviansk = According to Girkin, the head of the newly instituted Russian government in Crimea Sergei Aksyonov asked him to deal with the northern provinces. On 12 April 2014, Girkin led a group of militants who seized the executive committee building, the police department, and the Security Service of Ukraine offices in Sloviansk. Girkin claimed that his militia was formed in Crimea and consisted of volunteers from Russia, Crimea, and also from other regions of Ukraine (Vinnitsa, Zhitomir, Kyiv) and many people from Donetsk and the Lugansk region. According to him, two thirds were Ukrainian citizens. The majority of men in the unit had combat experience. Many of those with Ukrainian citizenship had fought in the Russian Armed Forces in Chechnya and Central Asia, others had fought in Iraq and Yugoslavia with the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In an interview, Girkin stated that he was given orders not to give up Sloviansk. The SBU presented Girkin's presence in Donbass as proof of Russia's involvement in the East Ukraine crisis and released intercepted telephone conversations between \\"Strelkov\\" and his supposed handlers in Moscow. Russia denied any interference in Ukraine by its troops outside Crimea. In July, Ukrainian authorities alleged Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu has coordinated all of Girkin's actions, supplying him and \\"other terrorist leaders\\" with \\"the most destructive weapons\\" since May and instructing him directly, with Russian President Vladimir Putin's approval. = Allegations of sabotage and terrorism = On 15 April, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) opened a criminal proceeding against \\"Igor Strelkov\\". He was described as a Russian recruiter and leader of armed \\"saboteurs\\" and a chief organizer of the \\"terror\\" in Ukraine's Sloviansk Raion (including an ambush that killed one and wounded three SBU officers), who had coordinated Russian military takeovers of Ukrainian units in Crimea during the 2014 Crimea crisis in March, after having crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border in Simferopol on 26 February. In Crimea, he was reported to be instrumental in negotiating the defection of the Ukrainian Navy commander Denis Berezovsky. The next day (16 April), he allegedly sought to recruit Ukrainian soldiers captured at the entrance to Kramatorsk. = Involvement in kidnapping and murder = Ukrainian government claims Girkin was behind the 17 April kidnapping, torture and murder of a local Ukrainian politician Volodymyr Rybak and a 19-year-old college student Yury Popravko. Rybak's abduction by a group of men in Horlivka was recorded on camera. The SBU released portions of intercepted calls in which another Russian citizen, alleged GRU officer and Girkin's subordinate Igor Bezler orders Rybak to be \\"neutralized\\", and a subsequent conversation in which \\"Strelkov\\" is heard instructing Ponomarev to dispose of Rybak's body, which is \\"lying here [in the basement of the separatist headquarters in Sloviansk] and beginning to smell.\\" Rybak's corpse with a smashed head, multiple stab wounds and ripped stomach was found later in April in a river near Sloviansk; Popravko's body was also found nearby. Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov described Girkin as \\"a monster and a killer\\" and the incident helped prompt the government's \\"anti-terrorist\\" military offensive against the pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. In May 2020 Girkin confessed in an interview with Ukrainian journalist Dmitry Gordon that he ordered the killing of Popravko and another man: \\"Yes, these people were shot on my orders. No one ripped open their stomach. Do I regret that they were shot? No, they were enemies.\\" Strelkov also stated that the killing of Rybak was also to some extent under his responsibility. = Functionary of the Donetsk People's Republic = During the weekend of 26‚Äì27 April, the political leader of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), Girkin's long-time friend, Alexander Borodai, also a Russian national from Moscow, ceded control of all separatist fighters in the entire Donetsk region to him. On 26 April, \\"Strelkov\\" made his first public appearance when he gave a video interview to Komsomolskaya Pravda where he confirmed that his militia in Sloviansk came from Crimea. He said nothing about his own background, denied receiving weapons or ammunition from Russia, and announced that his militia would not release the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observers that it had taken hostage unless pro-Russia activists were first freed by the Ukrainian government. On 28 April, the EU sanctioned \\"Igor Strelkov\\" as a GRU staff member believed to be a coordinator of armed actions and a security assistant to Crimea's Sergey Aksyonov. On 29 April, Girkin appointed a new police chief for Kramatorsk. On 12 May, \\"I. Strelkov\\" declared himself \\"the Supreme Commander of the DPR\\" and all of its \\"military units, security, police, customs, border guards, prosecutors, and other paramilitary structures.\\" According to a report issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \\"reportedly, on 26 May, by order of Strelkov, Dmytro Slavov ('commander of a company of the people's militia') and Mykola Lukyanov ('commander of a platoon of the militia of Donetsk People's Republic') were 'executed' in Sloviansk, after they were 'sentenced' for 'looting, armed robbery, kidnapping and abandoning the battle field'. The order, which was circulated widely and posted in the streets in Slovyansk, referred to a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the USSR of 22 June 1941 as the basis for the execution.\\" The report also mentions Girkin's efforts to recruit local women into his armed formations: \\"A particular call for women to join the armed groups was made on 17 May through a video released with Girkin 'Strelkov', urging women of the Donetsk region to enlist in combat units.\\" Sloviansk's separatist \\"people's mayor\\" and former boss of Girkin, Ponomarev, was himself detained on an order of Girkin on 10 June for \\"engaging in activities incompatible with the goals and tasks of the civil administration\\". In an interview with \\"Radio-KP\\" on 18 January 2016, Girkin acknowledged that he used extrajudicial punishment and at least four people were executed by firing squad, while he was in Sloviansk. = Loss of Sloviansk = On the night of 4‚Äì5 July, during a large-scale offensive by the Ukrainian military following the end of a 10-day ceasefire on 30 June, Girkin and his militants fled from Sloviansk, which was then captured by Ukrainian forces, thus ending the separatist occupation of the city which had started on 6 April. Shortly before this, a video was posted on YouTube in which Girkin desperately pleaded for military aid from Russia for \\"Novorossiya\\" (\\"New Russia\\", an historical name for South-East Ukraine with particular popularity amongst separatists) and said Sloviansk \\"will fall earlier than the rest.\\" Other rebel leaders denied Girkin's assessment that the people's militia were on the verge of collapse. One of them, the self-proclaimed \\"people's governor\\" of Donetsk Pavel Gubarev, compared Girkin to the 19th century Russian general Mikhail Kutuzov, claiming that both \\"Strelkov\\" and Kutuzov would \\"depart only before a decisive, victorious battle.\\" However, his retreat was strongly criticized by the Russian nationalist Sergey Kurginyan and a rumor inside Russian ultranationalist circles alleged Russia's powerful \\"grey cardinal\\" figure Vladislav Surkov conspired with east Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov to organize a campaign against \\"Strelkov\\" as well as against the Eurasianism ideologue Alexander Dugin. Kurginyan accused Girkin of surrendering Sloviansk and not keeping his oath to die in Sloviansk. Kurginyan believes that surrendering Sloviansk is a war crime, and Girkin should be responsible for that. Donetsk People's Republic security minister Alexander Khodakovsky, the SBU Alfa defector and commander of the rebel Vostok Battalion, also protested and threatened a mutiny. In social networks Girkin claimed that \\"Junta forces\\" drive their newly mobilized Ukrainian soldiers into the ground with bulldozers, National Guard of Ukraine shoots at peaceful citizens and own \\"punishers\\" and the \\"punishers\\" with use of artillery and MRLs succeeded in destroying the local potato harvest.Social networks battles: Does Kremlin \\"drains\\" out Girkin? BBC Russia. 7 July 2014 = Sloviansk aftermath = On 10 July 2014, news outlet Mashable reported finding execution orders three days earlier for Slavov and Lukyanov in Girkin's abandoned Sloviansk headquarters. The orders were signed \\"Strelkov\\" with the name Girkin Igor Vsevolodovich printed underneath. Also sentenced to death was Alexei Pichko, a civilian who was caught stealing two shirts and a pair of pants from an abandoned house of his neighbour; according to an unconfirmed story, his body \\"had been dumped on the front lines\\" after he was executed. On 24 July, Ukrainian authorities exhumed several corpses from a mass grave site on the grounds of a children's hospital near the Jewish cemetery in Slovyansk, which might contain as many as 20 bodies of those executed by order of Girkin. Among the identified victims were four Ukrainian Protestants who the police and locals said have been kidnapped on 8 June after attending a service at their church, falsely accused of helping the Ukrainian Army, robbed for their cars, and shot the following day. = Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 = Multiple sources cited a post on the VKontakte social networking service that was made by an account under Girkin's name which acknowledged shooting down an aircraft at approximately the same time that the civilian airliner Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was reported to have crashed in eastern Ukraine in the same area near the Russian border on 17 July 2014. The post specifically referenced how warnings were issued for planes not to fly in their airspace and the downing of a Ukrainian military Antonov An-26 transport plane which the Ukraine Crisis Media Center suggested was a case of misidentification with the MH17. This post was deleted later in the day and the account behind it claimed that Girkin has no official account on this social service. Most of the 298 victims in the plane's crash came from the Netherlands; on 19 July the country's biggest newspaper De Telegraaf included Girkin's photo in the front page collage of pro-Russian rebel leaders under the one-word headline \\"Murderers\\" (\\"Moordenaars\\"). Russian opposition lawyer and politician Mark Feygin posted a purported order by Girkin where he instructs all his men and commanders who \\"have in their possession personal effects from this plane\\" to deliver the found items to his HQ so \\"the valuables (watches, earrings, pendants, and other jewelry and items from valuable metals)\\" would be transferred to \\"the Defense Fund of the DPR.\\" Girkin was reported to be the author of an alternative version of the incident, wherein \\"no living people were aboard the plane as it flew on autopilot from Amsterdam, where it had been pre-loaded with 'rotting corpses'.\\" This conspiracy theory was then distributed and discussed in Russian state-controlled media outlets. At his press-conference on 28 July 2014, Girkin denied his connection to the downed plane and announced that his militants were killing \\"black-skinned\\" mercenaries. In July 2015 a writ was filed in an American court by families of 18 victims formally accusing Girkin of 'orchestrating the shootdown'. The writ claimed damages of US$900 million and was brought under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991. MH-17-Russian-separatist-leader-sued-for-900-million-by-crash-victims On 19 June 2019, the Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), investigating the shooting down of MH17, officially announced a criminal case against Girkin. The court proceedings were scheduled to start on 9 March 2020 before the District Court of The Hague, at the The JIT said it would ask Russia to extradite the suspects who are currently on Russian soil, saying: \\"The criminal trial will take place even if the suspects choose not to appear in court.\\" Interfax news agency quoted Girkin as saying: \\"I do not give any comments. The only thing I can say is the rebels did not shoot down the Boeing.\\" = Dismissal as Donetsk People's Republic minister = According to ITAR-TASS news agency on Wednesday, 13 August 2014, Girkin was seriously wounded the previous day in fierce fighting in the pro-Russian rebel held territories of Eastern Ukraine, and was described to be in \\"grave\\" condition. DNS representative Sergei Kavtaradze refuted this news this shortly after, saying Girkin is \\"alive and well\\". On 14 August the leadership of the DNR announced that Girkin was dismissed from his position of defense minister \\"on his own request\\" as he was assigned \\"some other tasks\\". On 16 August the Russian TV-Zvezda claimed that Girkin was \\"on vacation\\" and was appointed as a military chief of combined forces of Lugansk and Donetsk (he had been in command of Donetsk forces only) and after he returns he will be put to a task of creating an unified command over forces of Federal State of Novorossiya. According to Stanislav Belkovskiy, the main reason for removal of Girkin from the \\"defense minister\\" position was the amount of attention caused by downing the MH17 and negative impact on Russia's actions in Ukraine that it caused. On 22 August a former rebel Anton Raevsky (\\"Nemetz\\") said in an interview in Rostov-on-Don that Girkin and his supporters are being cleansed from DNR by FSB because of this insufficient compliance with Kremlin's policy on the republic. On 28 August Russian media published photos of Girkin walking with Alexander Dugin and Konstantin Malofeev in Valaam Monastery in northern Russia.http://imageshack.com/a/img909/2262/7coxaw.jpg Girkin meeting with Malofeev and Dugin at valaam Monastery In November 2014 in an interview for \\"Moscow Speaking\\" radio, Girkin said that \\"the existence of Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics in their current form, with the low-profile but still bloody war, is definitely convenient for USA in the first place, and only for them, because they are the ulcer that divides Russia and Ukraine\\". Later in November in an interview for Zavtra newspaper Girkin stated that the war in Donbass was launched by his detachment despite both Ukrainian government and local combatants avoided an armed confrontation before. Also he recognized himself responsible for actual situation in Donetsk and other cities of the region. According to the Nemtsov Report Girkin acknowledged that he resigned from his official position in the DNR due to pressure from the Kremlin. He also stated that Vladislav Surkov plays a decisive role in Donbass. Nemtsov Report: Putin. War. Ukrayinska Pravda. 12 May 2015 Life in Russia In late April 2014, \\"Strelkov\\" was identified by Ukrainian intelligence as Colonel Igor Girkin, registered as a resident of Moscow.

Gordon. 26 June 2014 were told by neighbors that a \\"fancy black car\\" had that same morning picked up the woman living there. The neighbors also described him as \\"polite\\" and quiet, and knew him under two surnames, Girkin and Strelkov. Girkin is known as a fan of military-historical movement and has participated in several reenactments connected with various periods of Russian and international history, but especially the Russian Civil War where he would play a White movement officer. His personal idol and role model is said to be the White Guard general Mikhail Drozdovsky, killed in a battle with the Red Army in 1919. According to The New York Times, \\"his ideological rigidity precedes any connections he has to Russia's security services, stretching back at least to his days at the Moscow State Institute for History and Archives. There, Mr. Strelkov obsessed over military history and joined a small but vocal group of students who advocated a return to monarchism.\\" Vice News claimed that \\"during the 1990s, Girkin wrote for the right-wing Russian newspaper Zavtra, which is run by the anti-Semitic Russian nationalist Alexander Prokhanov\\" and where Borodai was an editor. Writing for Zavtra (\\"Tomorrow\\"), Girkin and Borodai, who too was reported to have fought for Russia-backed Transnistria and Republika Srpska separatists in Moldova and Bosnia and Herzegovina, together covered the Russian war against separatists in Chechnya and Dagestan. He would also often write as a \\"Colonel in the Reserves\\" on Middle East subjects, such as the conflicts in Libya, Egypt and Syria, and for the Abkhazian Network News Agency (ANNA), a Russian-language pro-Russian publication which supports Abkhazian separatism in Georgia. Girkin claims that he worked as a security chief for the controversial Russian businessmen Konstantin Malofeev. The Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Republic Alexander Borodai was also a close associate of the businessman. Andrey Piontkovsky adduces Girkin's name among the those of like- minded persons and says, \\"The authentic high-principled Hitlerites, true Aryans Dugin, Prokhanov, Prosvirin, Kholmogorov, Girkin, Prilepin are a marginalized minority in Russia.\\" Piontkovsky adds, \\"Putin has stolen the ideology of the Russian Reich from the domestic Hitlerites, he has preventively burned them down, using their help to do so, hundreds of their most active supporters in the furnace of the Ukrainian Vend√©e.\\" In his interview with Radio Liberty, Piontkovsky says, maybe the meaning of the operation conducted by Putin is to reveal all these potential passionate leaders of social revolt, send them to Ukraine and burn them in the furnace of the Ukrainian Vend√©e. In his interview with Oleksandr Chalenko on 2 December 2014, according to the journalist, Girkin did confirm that he is an FSB colonel, but this claim was then subjected to censorship and omitted from publishing.\\"Twice cut\\" interview of Strelkov: no word about FSB. BBC Russia. 2 December 2014 He also acknowledged that anarchy exists among the so-called Novorossiya militants. He stated that Igor Bezler's militants in particular acted independently, the so-called \\"Russian Orthodox Army\\" had split in half, and others forces represented a patched cover of various unrelated groups. Girkin criticised the ongoing attacks on the Donetsk International Airport as pointless and harmful. After Lugansk commander Alexander \\"Batman\\" Bednov was killed by other militants in January 2015, Girkin criticised the killing as a \\"murder\\" and \\"gangster ambush\\", and suggested that other commanders seriously consider leaving Donbass to Russia, as he did. In a January 2015 interview for Anna News, Girkin said that in his opinion \\"Russia is currently at state of war\\", since the volunteers who arrive to Donbass \\"are being supplied with arms and shells\\". He also noted that \\"he never separated Ukraine from Soviet Union in his mind\\" so he considers the conflict as a \\"civil war in Russia\\". In October 2015, Girkin said that he planned to create a party that would oppose Putin's government and \\"respond to the Western fascist threat that Russia faces today.\\" In March 2016 Girkin's appearance as panelist on Moscow Economic Forum along with Oleg Tsarev and Pavel Gubarev attracted critical reactions in Russia, with Yaroslav Grekov from Ekho Moskvy accusing MEF organizers of \\"promoting terrorism\\". In May 2016, Girkin announced the creation of the , a neo-imperialist political party. The party is in favor of \\"uniting the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, and other Russian lands into a single all- Russian state and transforming the entire territory of the former USSR into an unconditional zone of Russian influence.\\" Girkin said \\"the Russian National Movement fully rejects President Vladimir Putin's regime and calls for an end to the current climate of fear and intimidation of Russia's citizens\\". The party has called for \\"strict quota system for migrant workers from the former Soviet republics in Central Asia and the Caucasus\\" and the cancelling of laws on internet control.

Throughout the history, they are often noted for having one of the oldest presence in the world, and also applauded for its tolerance with other religions.  Hinduism  Like Hinduism, the traditional African religion recognizes the presence of one supreme deity as well as the existence of God in multiple aspects. Traditional Igbo doctrine of reincarnation and connection to the spiritual mortal identity of the culture, themes about spiritual instrumentality based on the traditional Igobo beliefs and practices with the Hindu mantra, specifically the doctrine in the creative power of the spoken word are identical.\\"Gendering Global Transformations: Gender, Culture, Race, and Identity\\", p. 114, by Chima J. Korieh, Philomina E Okeke-Ihejirika, publisher = Routledge  Christianity  God is esteemed by both African religion and Christianity as both the very ground being, and the necessary of life, and any form of being or existence, such as the creation itself. Anthropology is the basic starting place for both religions, human beings are the temporal mirrors and mediators (imago Dei) of God in the feature world. The Christian idea of church has similarities with African traditional life in which brotherhood and the extended family play a central role. The Church is the Christian family, in which all are accompanied to one another through belief and baptism in Jesus Christ. The Church also combines those who have died and those who still live. This is parallel view to the African view of the family of both the living and the omitted.\\"Introduction to African Religion\\", by John S. Mbiti, p. 190 publisher = Heinemann,  Islam  African traditional religion is also regarded to have influenced Islam, but despite this African customs were simply rejected by the Muslims. Muslim missionaries in Africa have often used violence as a means of conversion. It also notable that before the expansion of Islam, human sacrifices were common in Egypt, Egyptians conducted to sacrifice female to River Nile, every year when it was flooded. The flood would remain until a young female was thrown into it as a sacrifice. During the reign of Caliph Umar bin al-Khattab, Amr bin al-Aas, the governor of Egypt, wrote to Umar askin his direction for such activity. There is a story that Umar answered by writing a note to be thrown into the Nile river instead of sacrificing a female to it. The note enclosed verses from the Qur'an and a command from Umar asking the Nile to flow fluently in the name of Allah without causing any damage to inhabitants. When the note was thrown into the Nile, the flood dissolved. After that they won't sacrifice human.p. 329 - 330 by Elias Kifon Bongmba Today, even after the suppression of African traditional religion, the religion has its notable traces in northern Africa. Followers of African religion in Muslim dominated areas can be found, adhering their beliefs, rituals, magic, medicines. Generally they have adopted the Muslim way of dressing but in matter of deeper subjects such as life, birth, marriage, death, they remain the followers of African religion.\\"An Introduction to African Religion (2nd Edition)\\", by John S. Mbiti, p. 191 publisher = East African Publishers Buddhism Relations of African religion with Buddhism dates back to 17th century. After the establishment of the Dutch settlement at Cape Agulhas, some Buddhists paid short, coincidental visits to the Cape Agulhas - such as the few Thai monks who were aboard the Portuguese ship which ran aground off. Like Hinduism, Akan tradition shares belief in reincarnation with Buddhism.

It was commissioned in the mid-1470s in Bruges for the Old St. John's Hospital (Sint- Janshospitaal) during the building of a new apse. It is signed and dated 1479 on the original frame ‚Äì its date of installation ‚Äì and is today at the hospital in the Memling museum. The altarpiece consists of five paintings ‚Äì a central inner panel and two double-sided wings. Those on the reverse of wings are visible when the shutters are closed, and show the hospital donors flanked by their patron saints. The interior has a central panel with the enthroned Virgin and Child flanked by saints; the left wing features episodes from the life of John the Baptist with emphasis on his beheading; the right wing shows the apocalypse as recorded by John the Evangelist, pictured writing on the island of Patmos. St John Altarpiece is one of Memling's more ambitious works, and shares near-identical scenes with two other works: the Donne Triptych, in London's National Gallery, and the Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Background and commission Memling's St Barbara might be an early likeness of Margaret of York. Hans Memling purchased citizenship in Bruges in late January 30, which suggests he was a recent arrival to the city. He probably came from Brussels where he had been apprenticed to Rogier van der Weyden. In Bruges he established himself as a painter fairly quickly.Ainsworth (1997a), 400 Although it appears he was absent from the city for Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's extravagant 1468 wedding celebration,Bruce (1994), 79 art historian James Weale speculates Memling might have gone to England to execute a bridal portrait, commissioned either by Charles the Bold or his father Philip the Good. According to Weale, Memling's position in Bruges was secured by the Dukes of Burgundy.Weale (1910), 177 Old St. John's Hospital (Sint- Janshospitaal) was one of four public hospitals in the city; one took in lepers, one paupers, and two ‚Äì including St John's ‚Äì treated men, women and children. Established in the late 12th century, it was dedicated to John the Evangelist; at an unknown later date the dedication was extended to include John the Baptist. The Bruges civic authorities financed the hospital and oversaw its direction until the 1440s when a fiscal crisis caused them to decrease funding and increase their supervision. At that time, the hospital brothers and sisters placed themselves under the authority of the Bishop of Tournai, Jean Chevrot, and directly aligned themselves with Philip the Good on whose council Chevrot sat. By the 1470s the hospital masters and bursars not only averted bankruptcy, but accrued a surplus to spend on expansion. The altarpiece was probably commissioned in the mid-1470s for the new apse,Ridderbos (2005), 142 and almost certainly completed in 1479. The central frame is inscribed in Latin and reads; OPUS. IOHANNES MEMLING. ANNO. M. CCCC. LXXIX,Weale (1901), 40 The date gives clues to the donors on the exterior panels; and because one died in 1475, scholars are confident in a start date before that year.Blum (1969), 87 Memling probably began work on the piece as early as 1473, when plans were made to extend the already large 240-bed infirmary, which, with two patients per bed, served about 500 people. As at the Hospices de Beaune, patients in Sint-Janshospitaal could follow the Liturgy of the Hours from their beds. The altarpiece's prestigious location, coupled with its scope and execution, secured additional commissions for Memling.Ainsworth (1997c), 35 The Augustinian prelates, who were allowed to own property, ordered several further works from him, including the St Ursula Shrine, the Triptych of Jan Floreins, and the Triptych of Adriaan Reins ‚Äì each still located in the hospital.Silver (2010), 6 Those are today displayed in the Memling museum, located in a room adjacent to the original infirmary.Blum (1969), 87‚Äì88 Although still in its original frames, the altarpiece has seen extensive overcleaning, affecting its condition.  Exterior panels  The exterior panels contain both saints and donors; the kneeling donors face inwards towards the center panel. These exterior panels are unusual for devotional triptychs of the period in that the donors face each other, seemingly without an object for their devotion; the usual convention was to show them facing saints. Art historians speculate Memling meant to emphasize the importance of the devotional scenes on the interior panels by having the donors gaze directly at the opening between the panel doors. With the shutters closed, the two outer panels reveal the donors kneeling in front of their patron saints The left panel has St Anthony Abbot (a saint commonly associated with sickness and healing in the Middle Ages) with his emblematic pig and St James standing behind two male donors, identified as Anthony Seghers, master of the hospital, and Brother James Ceuninc. Seghers joined the hospital as a brother in 1445 and by 1461 had risen to hospital master, a position he held intermittently until his death in 1475. He faces the center of the panel, flanked by his patron saint, Anthony, who leans on a tau staff with one hand and holds a bible in the other. Ceunic, a hospital brother from 1469 and bursar between 1488 and 1490, kneels to the left behind Seghers. His patron saint, James (identifiable by his attributes of pilgrim's staff and hat), stands behind him.Blum (1969), 88 The right panel shows St Agnes and St Clare standing behind the female donors, Agnes Casembrood, hospital prioress, and sister Clara van Hulson.Ridderbos (2005), 136 Casembrood faces the center. She joined the hospital in 1447, became prioress in 1455, and remained in that office until her death in 1489. Her namesake, St Agnes, is identified by the lamb at her side. Van Hulson was a hospital sister from 1427 until she died in 1479; she kneels in front of St Clare who holds a monstrance. Unlike his predecessors Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, who typical painted exterior wings in grisaille, Memling shows the saints in a realistic manner. Although the donors in van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece and van der Weyden's Beaune Altarpiece are also painted realistically, they are placed within architectural niches separate from the adjacent statue-like grisaille saints. Memling breaks with that tradition in these exterior panels, but the subdued palette he uses retains some sense of grisaille.Ridderbos (2005), 135 The donors are dressed in their Augustinian habits; the two men in stark black and the two women in white on black. The saints are dressed in monochromatic clothing. St James wears a light blue cloak and St Anthony's is grey. St Agnes is dressed in drab green and St Clare is also in a dark habit. Although the figures seem to be in two niches, they are enclosed in a single shallow space, with stone walls behind, trefoil arches above, and two columns adorning the outermost edges. Where the wings open is a single column which has the appearance of two separate columns. Netherlandish art in the 15th century was typically devotional:Harbison (1984), 87 it was meant to entice the viewer into a meditative state of personal devotion and even perhaps the \\"experience of miraculous visions.\\"Ainsworth (1997b), 79 Art historian Craig Harbison believes Memling, when compared to van der Weyden, is \\"less exalted\\", more \\"down-to-earth\\" and that the exterior panels in this piece might represent a popularization of van der Weyden's earlier concepts. Memling clearly shows that the donors are set apart from the depiction of the religious vision on the interior panels.Harbison (1984), 105 The movement from the earthly realm to the heavenly, frequently represented with grisaille sculpture in van Eyck's and van der Weyden's work, is here less obvious. The St John Altarpiece has been criticized for having the donors merely \\"praying to a crack\\" but Harbison contends that Memling clearly shows the distinction between the worldly figures on the exterior and the biblical figures on the interior panels, and clarifies the \\"levels of reality\\" between the two sets of images. Harbison writes of Memling that \\"he has implied more strongly than earlier artists that it is donors' prayers which bridge the gap or crack leading to the visionary heart of the triptych.\\"Harbison (1984), 106 The panels within were meant to provide a personal religious vision to the donors on the outside.Harbison (1984), 88 Interior panels The hinged doors open to vividly colored interior panels. The central focal point is the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints; the left panel depicts the decapitation of John the Baptist with John the Evangelist opposite on the right.Blum (1969), 89‚Äì90 As a devotional piece it presents a narrative, meant to emulate a vision the donors or viewers would experience when viewing the inside panels. Unlike most altarpieces of these types, Memling's fails to present a single unifying iconographical focus and is quite generalized with themes that seem unsuited for its specific location, according to Blum.Blum (1969), 93 She speculates the donors may have chosen the specific iconography, which \\"celebrated intercessory saints on the interior\\". It is an unusual painting in that it seems to \\"have served a double function: that of personal propitiation and that of public altarpiece, which portrayed the role of the religious community within the hospital and venerated the saints who might particularly favor the sick\\".Blum (1969), 92 The iconography reflects the hospital's brothers' and sisters' existence, with quiet devotion juxtaposed against the active battle against illness, borne out in the choice of patron saints. John the Evangelist with book in hand, represents the quiet, contemplative life; John the Baptist's beheading is a scene of action, and, according to Blum, \\"the final dramatic end to one of the most active lives of any Christian saint\\". The central panel, sometimes called The Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine, depicts the Virgin enthroned with Child. Saints Catherine and Barbara sit before her, John the Baptist and John the Evangelist stand behind. The panels capture the essence of Memling's style, which Ridderbos describes as serene and filled with \\"sublime peace\\". The Baptist's decapitation portrayed by Memling, is subdued and restrained, and the apocalyptic scenes on the opposite panel are \\"more poetic than horrific\\". Maryan Ainsworth says it shows a carefully balanced composition, painted in light clear colors. Memling catered to foreign patrons, most of whom were Italian, and he became known for his unique style that combined southern Italian elements with those of the northern Netherlandish tradition. He juxtaposed \\"an Italianate monumentality and simplification of form with a northern sense of atmosphere and light in a format that often placed his subjects before a charming locally inspired landscape background\\", according to Ainsworth.Ainsworth (1997c), 34-35 =Mystic marriage of St Catherine= The central panel, called the Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, depicts Mary seated on a throne beneath a baldachin covered with sumptuous brocade. Two seraphim hover directly beneath the canopy, holding her crown; they wear deep blue robes, and in the uncleaned version have blue faces and hands, a style evocative of earlier Netherlandish painters such as van der Weyden and Robert Campin.Michiels (2012 ed.), 111 The Christ child sits on his mother's lap, holding an apple in one hand and slipping the ring on St Catherine's finger to signify the mystic marriage with the other hand. St Catherine of Alexandria, the patron saint of nuns, sits to the left of the throne with her emblems, the breaking wheel on which she was tortured and the sword used for her beheading. She wears a crown and is dressed in a surcoat over a costly brocade skirt, symbols of royal status. St Barbara, patron of soldiers, sits opposite reading a missal in front of her emblem (the tower in which her father held her prisoner), which is shaped as a monstrance meant to hold the sacramental bread. Weale thought Catherine was an early portrait of Mary of Burgundy and that Memling's Barbara is perhaps the earliest likeness of Margaret of York. The central panel is usually considered a sacra conversazione (Virgin and Child shown with female and male saints) and less often as a Virgo inter Virgines (Virgin and Child shown with virgin saints); it blurs the lines between the two, failing to adhere strictly to either convention. A subgenre of the more established sacra conversazione, Virgo inter Virgines became popular in Germany and the Low Countries in the 15th century. Conventionally set within an enclosed garden (Hortus conclusus), the Virgin and Child were always shown with Saints Catherine and Barbara, Catherine's mystic marriage was frequently shown, while Virgin saints might also be added to the grouping.Pumplin (2010), 317‚Äì18 Often referred to as the \\"Mystic Marriage of St Catherine\\", the marriage itself is one of great number of iconographical depictions in the panel yet might be particularly important to the nuns, who, like Catherine saw themselves wedded to Christ. The two St Johns stand either side of the throne. On the left is John the Baptist pointing at the Christ Child and holding a staff, with his lamb beside him; John the Evangelist, holding the poisoned chalice, is on the right. An angel dressed in a costly gold brocade dalmatic, plays a portable organ in front of John the Baptist; another angel, wearing a simple alb and holding the Book of Wisdom for the Virgin, is in front of John the Evangelist.Ridderbos (2005), 136-7 The cloistered space is enclosed with pillars with representations from the lives of the two Johns. The capitals on the pillars above John the Baptist show the vision of his father Zachariah and the Baptist's Nativity; above the Evangelist are the Drinking of the Cup by the Priest of Diana and the Resurrection of Drusiana.Blum (1969), 89 The floor tiles are decorative and the Virgin's throne sits on a Memling carpet that extends almost to the front of the pictorial space. Behind is a cityscape, in the far background a landscape. The city is probably 15th-century Bruges and contains contemporary scenes as well as episodes from the lives of two Johns.Ridderbos (2005), 137 John the Baptist is shown in a wilderness, preaching to a crowd, led to prison, and burning on a fire. The Evangelist is placed in a church with his wife and disciples kneeling behind him, leaving for Patmos, and immersed in burning oil. The more mundane and secular activities in the background, as evidenced by the image of the city crane used by the hospital to measure and fill wine barrels, place the altarpiece's spiritual vision in a worldly context. The measuring of wine was a lucrative concession given to the hospital by the city authorities during the mid-1300s and in the 1470s the hospital secured the right to fish in the Reye river ‚Äì both activities shown in the far background. The figure of the hospital brother has been variously identified as Jan Floreins or Josse Willems; both held the position of the hospital's wine measurer and so were associated with the crane. =John the Baptist= Salome receives John the Baptist's head from the executioner The left wing depicts the beheading of St John the Baptist. His headless body lies in the left foreground and seems to reach out of the picture, as blood spurts from his severed neck, spraying his hands and the nearby plants. The foreground in the flora are reduced to the extent that they could not have been painted without a magnifying glass.Michiels (2012 ed.), 114 The executioner stands with his back to the viewer, placing the freshly severed head on Salome's platter. The executioner, Salome, and three gesticulating bystanders form a circle around John's headless and lifeless body. According to Ridderbos, the five figures mirror and create a sense of unity with the five holy figures in the central panel.Ridderbos (2005), 137‚Äì138 The scene is set in a courtyard in front of Herod's palace; the banquet that preceded the Baptist's decapitation can be seen in the left-midground of the palace, where minstrels play for Salome's dance.Weale (1901), 38 The banquet is well-lit and with good architectural perspective.Michiels (2012 ed.), 115 Albert Michiels described Salome as ravishing but emotionless; she receives the head, with her eyes held aloof. Other versions of St John's beheading (decollation) more typically showed Salome holding an empty plate for the executioner; with an early version typified in a miniature in the Petites Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry.Lane (1978), 663 Detail from Rogier van der Weyden's Altar of Saint John, showing Salome and the executioner averting their gaze from the head on the platter Carvings of St John's head on a dish were popular from the 13th to 16th centuries and were made of various materials, some quite expensive. The Duke of Berry owned one made from gold. The head on the dish assumed eucharistic connotations, and is mentioned in the York breviary; \\"St John's head on the dish signifies the body of Christ which feeds us on the holy altar\\". The head became associated with the host and Salome's charger with the paten ‚Äì iconography that appeared in Early Netherlandish art from about 1450. The heads in these paintings resembled carvings, as in van der Weyden's Altar of Saint John. Van der Weyden's depiction of St John's beheading includes the next sequence in the event: Salome delivering the head to the banquet table where her mother, Herodias, stabs it. Furthermore, van der Weyden follows the prevailing iconography with Salome and the executioner, who were pagan and thus not permitted to look at the head (or that which it symbolized), twisting away and averting their gaze. In Memling's version, the executioner looks directly at the head as he places it on the charger and Salome only partially averts her eyes. Barbara Lane speculates that although Memling patterned the scene after van der Weyden's, he \\"misunderstood the symbolism\\".Lane (1978), 663, 665 The background extends the landscape in the central panel. In the far distance we can see the River Jordan with the Baptism of Jesus by John and as the skies open; the divine Dove, symbol of God the Holy Spirit, descending from heaven. John introduces Andrew and James to Christ on the riverbank, the same two apostles who are in Herod's courtyard, where they visited the Baptist during his imprisonment.Hayum (1977), 510 =John the Evangelist= The right panel depicts John the Evangelist on the island of Patmos, recording his visions of the apocalypse in a book. The rest of the panel shows \\"with astonishing literalness\\" the most important events from the Book of Revelation, chapters four to twelve (Revelation 4-12).Blum (1969), 90 As with the two other two panels, Memling presents a series of events according to a narrative.Ridderbos (2005), 138 The Evangelist looks up at Heaven; the detail of his vision \\"unfold in a series of events at sea, on land, and in the air\\". The panel's detail is so densely packed, that according to Ridderbos it requires the Book of Revelations.Ridderbos (2005), 139 Weale writes of the panel that it is perhaps the \\"earliest example of so many of the incidents being included in one picture\\".Weale (1901), 38 John the Evangelist on Patmos and visions of the apocalypse The Evangelist sits on a rocky cliff in the foreground; he gazes at two concentric rainbows in the top left corner, in which God is enthroned, surrounded by four multi-winged beasts and 24 elders. The inner rainbow, with God's throne, flashes with lightning; above are seven lamps. He holds a book with the seven seals on his lap; the Lamb of God stand on rear legs to his left, breaking the book's seals with its forelegs. Seven angels above the rainbow blow the seven trumpets, heralding the events unfolding below on earth. The 24 elders are seated within the outer rainbow. An angel stands in front of them, announcing the breaking of the seals, casting fire towards earth, which causes the disasters heralded by the trumpeting angels. Outside the rainbows another angel kneels at an altar, who gazes up towards God. Detail of enthroned God within a rainbow, the Lamb of God breaking the seven seals, the 24 elders seated in a semi-circle In the mid-ground below on a sea, which Ridderbos likens to glass crystal, are the apparitions released as the seals are broken; the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse gallop across the flat islands, \\"scattering, spoiling, and slaying\\".Weale (1901), 38 These riders, which manifest as the first four seals are broken, are set at a diagonal in the pictorial space. The white horse of victory carries an archer, the red horse of war a swordsman, the black horse of famine a man with scales, and from the mouth of hell emerges the pale horse of death. Stars fall from the sky, mountains and islands move, ships sink, and people hide in caverns.Weale (1901) 38‚Äì39 According to Ridderbos, \\"We see hail and fire burning trees and grass, a burning mountain cast into the sea destroying ships, a falling star that poisons the waters, a wailing eagle, a second falling star that opens a bottomless pit from which monstrous locusts arise, and four angels and their horsemen sent out to kill\\". Behind the armored angels on land, with one leg in the sea, the other on land, \\"stands a colossal figure: the angel described as clothed with a cloud, with a rainbow upon his head, a face like the sun and legs like pillars of fire\\", who brings down seven thunders as can be seen in the dark clouds above. In the sky above a woman \\"clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars\\", bearing a male child, is attacked by a ten-horned, seven-headed dragon (each head crowned), lashing its tail and bringing stars down from heaven. The next scene in the sequence is to the right as the child is rescued by an angel, and St Michael with his angels \\"defeat the dragon, who then pursues the woman. On the horizon it finally surrenders its power to another seven-headed beast, like a leopard, which rises from the sea\\", and Michael casts Satan out of heaven. The panel is a \\"composition of wonderful accuracy and taste\\", according to Weale, and Ridderbos says the flat, two- dimensional compositions are \\"appropriate to their unrealistic, visionary character\\". The dominant and largest features are John the Evangelist recording his visions at the bottom right, and God in Heaven at the top left. The typical 15th-century depiction of the Evangelist's contemplations on Patmos is here extended to include his visions; this is, according to Blum, \\"the first time that John's visions had been presented in such a way in a panel painting.\\" Versions of the Evangelist's apocalyptic visions existed in 12th- and 13th-century illuminated manuscripts and tapestries, each event depicted singly, whereas here Memling presents the visions all on one panel and therein \\"lies the germ of the fantastic forms that were to become the work of Bosch's innovation of the late fifteenth century.\\"Blum (1969), 91 Adaptations Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, is adapted from the central panel of The St John Altarpiece.\\"Virgin and Child with Saints\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved April 25, 2014. The altarpiece is unusual because of the degree to which Memling copied and repeated the composition's elements in other paintings. The same four saints are found in works executed between 1468 and 1489. The most similar is Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York. Except for the setting, which is a garden instead of a columned space, it is almost identical. Ainsworth writes aside from differences in the folds of the saints' dresses they are \\"virtually identical to type, costume and gesture\\". Art historians are uncertain when the New York panel was painted; 1480 seems a probably date according to tree ring analysis. The Donne Triptych, held in the National Gallery in London, also has a similar setting and the same saints, but the donors are positioned with the female saints on the central panel; the two Johns are each depicted on separate wing panels.Donne Triptych . National Gallery. Retrieved May 24, 2014 Art historians are unsure whether the Donne Triptych was painted in the early 1480s, at about the same time as Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara, or in the late 1470s when the altarpiece was completed, or whether it was perhaps an earlier piece painted as a precursor to the altarpiece. Sir John Donne, a Welsh-born diplomat for the House of York, came to Bruges in 1468 to attend Charles the Bold's and Margaret of York wedding; how Donne became acquainted with Memling is as uncertain as when he commissioned the triptych, but it could possibly have occurred during the 1468 visit to Bruges. Another similar Memling work is the Diptych of Jean Cellier held at the Louvre, which Georges Hulin de Loo determined to have been completed earlier than the St John Altarpiece and the New York panel. The Cellier Diptych has the Virgin and Child in an enclosed garden with the same two Saints Catherine and Barbara on the left-hand panel. The composition is remarkably similar to the New York panel and the altarpiece, with the Virgin on her throne and St Catherine and St Barbara positioned to form a triangle. The Cellier Diptych includes four additional female saints (with attributes) sitting around the Virgin: St Agnes, St Cecilia, St Lucy, and St Margaret. Three musical angels hover above. The opposite right-hand panel, which at one time was separated, shows the donor, Jan Cellier, with John the Baptist and John the Evangelist.Weale (1901), 19 Memling almost certainly took studies in his workshop to use in the central panel which he probably reused for the New York panel and the Donne Triptych.Ainsworth (1997a), 116 No evidence of transfer can be found on any of the three paintings; Ainsworth speculates that \\"Memling relied on detailed workshop drawings of figures and drapery studies from which he could copy by eye both for the rough sketch and for the finished painted details\\". Ainsworth sees these three paintings as the beginning of Memling's \\"classic phase\\", with balanced and harmonious compositions, and bright coloring. His ideal of female beauty is reflected in the oval faces, that are \\"wider across the eyes, narrowing at the chin, [and] reflect a state of beatific acceptance.Ainsworth (1997a), 117 The painting is heavily influenced by van der Weyden and contains elements characteristic of his later work; it is perhaps the first of his enthroned Virgins ‚Äì with angels playing musical instruments or hovering holding her crown. Mary sits in an open hall with columns leading to architectural features similar to those in the St John Altarpiece. The blend of colors, her red dress, the blue angels, and in this triptych, a dark-green silk carpet-type floor-covering, are found, repeatedly, in his later paintings.Ganz (1925), 235‚Äì236 According to Blum; \\"We have encountered triptychs that served more than one purpose before ‚Ä¶ but we have never ‚Ä¶ seen altarpieces that repeat with very few changes the basic iconography of another work.\\"Blum (1969), 92-3 Gallery =Altarpiece= Memling, polittico di san giovanni 07.jpg|Detail, left panel, the dance of Salome Memling, polittico di san giovanni 04.jpg|Detail, left panel, John the Baptist's head on a platter Memling, polittico di san giovanni 16.jpg|Detail, right panel, two of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, \\"Famine\\" on a black horse (carrying a scale) and \\"Death\\" entering from the fiery mouth of hell Memling, Hans - St John Altarpiece (detail) - 1474-79.jpg|Detail right panel, a giant angel rises from the sea and on land armored angels battle mounted locusts =Adaptations= File:Hans Memling 041.jpg|Memling.

Biography Caroline Herzenberg was born Caroline Stuart Littlejohn to Caroline Dorothea Schulze and Charles Frederick Littlejohn on March 25, 1932 in East Orange, New Jersey. In the aftermath of the Great Depression, her parents decided to move to Oklahoma City Oklahoma to join his sister, Hilda Littlejohn Will and her family. Herzenberg grew up and attended public school in Oklahoma City. In 1961 she married Leonardo Herzenberg and is the mother of two grown children, Karen Ann Herzenberg and Catherine Stuart Herzenberg Larson. She lives in Hyde Park, Chicago. After winning the Westinghouse Science Talent Search in high school, Herzenberg attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She was one of very few women students at M.I.T. at that time. She was awarded a bachelor's degree by M.I.T. in 1953. For graduate study she went on to the University of Chicago. She took a class with Enrico Fermi and subsequently conducted some calculations for him. She went on to receive her master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1955. For doctoral work she turned to Samuel K. Allison, who became her thesis advisor. Her thesis research, in experimental physics, was in low energy nuclear physics, and was conducted on the 3 Mev Van de Graaff accelerator in the Research Institutes. She was awarded a PhD in 1958 by the University of Chicago. Herzenberg continued at the University of Chicago for another year as a postdoctoral fellow and a research associate at the Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Studies at the University of Chicago. She then went on to become a research associate in the Physics Division of Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. In 1961 Herzenberg became an assistant professor of physics at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, where she worked for 5 years as Director of the High Voltage Laboratory and the Van de Graaff accelerator, and directed experimental nuclear physics and M√∂ssbauer research programs, supervising MS and PhD theses and undergraduate and graduate physics instruction. After being denied tenure at Illinois Institute of Technology, she worked at IIT Research Institute from 1967 to 1971 as a research physicist and then as a senior physicist. At IIT Research Institute, she conducted her work as a principal investigator in the NASA Apollo returned lunar sample analysis program, and continued applications of M√∂ssbauer spectrometry. Subsequently she held a position as a visiting associate professor of physics at the University of Illinois at the Medical Center from 1971 to 1974. She was responsible for organization, instruction, and planning for the College of Pharmacy, and she supervised graduate laboratory instruction in radioisotope utilization and applications for the University of Illinois at the Medical Center. From 1975 to 1976 she spent an academic year in California at California State University, Fresno, where she was a lecturer in physics, and was involved in general physics curriculum organization and instruction and presented lectures on electromagnetic theory. Herzenberg returned to Argonne National Laboratory in 1977, and worked there until her retirement in 2001. At Argonne during this period of time, she was engaged primarily in applied work. This involved applications of physics in engineering and in specific areas such as radiation safety. In particular, her work included engineering research relative to fossil energy utilization, as well as radioactive waste disposal, technology for arms control verification, and radiological emergency preparedness and also chemical warfare agent emergency preparedness. Initially, in 1977, Herzenberg joined a project for developing instrumentation for process control for a new generation of coal conversion and combustion plants. Development proceeded on non-invasive techniques for measuring the composition and flow rate of coal slurries and pulverized coal in pneumatic transport in pipes. For the analysis of the composition of coal, she worked on the application of neutron-induced gamma spectrometry; while measurement of slurry flow was based on using short lived radioactivity induced in the slurry. She later worked in technology assessment and evaluation of programs in areas that included fossil energy utilization, arms control verification, and radioactive waste disposal. She also worked in emergency preparedness and response for technological hazards, mainly in radiological emergency preparedness for nuclear power plants and emergency preparedness for chemical demilitarization. Herzenberg was the first scientist to be inducted into the Chicago Women's Hall of Fame. She was awarded an honorary Sc.D. degree by the State University of New York, Plattsburgh in 1991. As a result of her work, Herzenberg was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, and the Association for Women in Science, and served as the president of the Association for Women in Science from 1988 to 1990. Research in the History of Science Herzenberg has contributed to our knowledge of the history of women in science. She published a number of articles and chapters in books on this topic. In 1986 she authored a book titled Women Scientists from Antiquity to the Present and later in 1999 with Ruth Howes coauthored another book titled Their Day in the Sun: Women of the Manhattan Project. As a result of her work Herzenberg was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Physical Society, and served as president of the Association for Women in Science from 1988 to 1990. Research in Physics and Related Fields Following Caroline Herzenberg's doctoral research in experimental low energy nuclear physics with Samuel K. Allison as thesis advisor, her research continued at the University of Chicago during her year of postdoctoral work when she measured the products of nuclear reactions between lithium isotopes and those of beryllium and boron; research which laid foundations for future heavy ion investigation. Subsequently her work focused on M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy; she was engaged in pioneering research on the M√∂ssbauer effect and was part of the team which succeeded in verifying the M√∂ssbauer effect. She later established M√∂ssbauer-effect research facilities at Illinois Institute of Technology and at IIT Research Institute. Turning her focus to geological applications of the effect, Herzenberg concluded that it would be possible to analyze rocks and minerals retrieved from the Moon using M√∂ssbauer spectrometry; and she was awarded a grant from NASA to carry out M√∂ssbauer spectrometry during the Apollo program. She served as a principal investigator in the NASA Apollo Returned Lunar Sample Analysis Program, and analyzed some of the first returned lunar samples as well as material from subsequent sample returns. Herzenberg has authored or coauthored hundreds of scientific and technical papers, and has written a number of chapters in books dealing with scientific and technical topics. Further Activities Caroline Herzenberg has had a longstanding interest in certain societal issues, largely centering on peace and justice and human rights issues, but also including related concerns. Already when she was an undergraduate at M.I.T., she participated in student group support of M.I.T. mathematics professor Dirk Jan Struik when he had drawn the unwelcome attention of Senator Joseph McCarthy after the advent of McCarthyism. Throughout much of her adult life, she has worked very extensively and successfully on women's issues, especially issues relating to women in science, notably with the Association for Women in Science. In conjunction with concerns about ethical issues, she developed some recognized guidelines on ethical issues in physics. A foray into politics, seeking a position as an alderman in Freeport, Illinois, was unsuccessful, but the experience guided her efforts in related activities. While in Freeport, she developed and presented a television series on science, \\"Camera on Science\\". National attention was directed at her when in 1986 she conducted independent research and published a short paper showing that Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) weapons under development for use in defense would also be able to be used offensively. Following her retirement, Herzenberg has been active as a citizen in a variety of ways, including engaging in demonstrations and vigils in support of peace and justice and human rights and related endeavors. She has participated with the American Friends Service Committee, the 8th Day Center for Justice, Jewish Voice for Peace and a number of other groups. She occasionally writes popular material, including correspondence to newspapers. In her leisure time, Herzenberg enjoys bird watching, usually in nearby Jackson Park (Chicago).

Location  The remains of the former hill castle are located near Wilgartswiesen before the Rinnthal at around 245 metres above sea level on a spur of the G√∂ckelberg hill above the River Queich. This left tributary of the Rhine rises in the Wasgau region which comprises the southern part of the Palatinate Forest in Germany and the northern part of the Vosges in France.  History  The Wilgartaburg is one of the oldest castles in the Palatinate region, probably dating to the 8th or 9th century. According to an unverified source it was built in the late 10th or early 11th century by an abbot of Hornbach Abbey, initially as a wooden castle. In the Salian era (11th century) it was rebuilt in stone. This was expanded in the 12th century and a final remodelling took place in the 13th century. The castle was probably abandoned at the end of the 13th century in favour of the better situated Falkenburg Castle. According to legend, after the death of her husband, Gaugrave Wernher I, his widow, Wiligarta, led a hermit's life here as penance to atone for his dissolute life. On 16 April 828, her granddaughter, also called Wiligarta and the daughter of Wernher II, donated her estate, Wiligartawisa, with all the fields, pastureland and woods within which the castle stood, to Hornbach Abbey.  Layout  All that survives of the castle are a few wall remains, numerous putlog holes and rock chambers.  Literature  * Helmut Bernhard, Dieter Barz: Fr√ºhe Burgen in der Pfalz.

One of the pioneering architects of the early Art Nouveau or Jugendstil style in Finland at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, he continued to influence generations of students by introducing them to the style. Many of his key architectural works were made while he was in the architectural partnership Usko Nystr√∂m‚îÄPetrelius‚îÄPenttil√§ which operated from 1895 to 1908. His most famous work is the Grand H√¥tel Cascade (1903) (nowadays known as the Imatran Valtionhotelli) in Imatra. Grand H√¥tel Cascade (1903) (nowadays the Imatran Valtionhotelli) Imatra.  Life and career  Usko Nystr√∂m was born in Virrat, Finland, at a time when Finland was a Grand Duchy under the rule of Russia. His parents were Johan Abraham Nystr√∂m, a civil servant, and Clara Chalotta Nystr√∂m (n√©e Vikman). There were several children in the family. Nystr√∂m's brother, Konrad Into Nystr√∂m, is even more well known, as a photographer, writer and translator, under the name I. K. Inha.I.K. Inha ‚Äì The Dream of the Landscape Usko Nystr√∂m was schooled in the city of H√§meenlinna before going on in 1880 to study first mathematics and then ‚Äúhumanities‚Äù, among other things aesthetics, at the Imperial Alexander University of Finland (the precursor to the present-day University of Helsinki). However, in 1885 he switched to studying architecture at the Polytechnic Institute in Helsinki, graduating in 1888. While still studying he worked first for architect Josef Stenb√§ck (a notable designer of churches) and then architect Gustav Nystr√∂m (no relation), who was also professor of architecture at the Polytechnic Institute. He achieved some success almost immediately on graduating, winning the competition for the design of the pedestal for the memorial bust to commemorate the architect Carl Ludwig Engel ‚Äì but it was never realised.Eija Rauske, Kivet puhuvat arkkitehtuuritoimiston Usko Nystr√∂m-Petrelius-Penttil√§ asuinkerrostalot Helsingiss√§ 1895-1908, Helsinki: Suomen muinaismuistoyhdistys, 2004. In 1890 Nystr√∂m won a state grant to travel and study abroad, studying at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890‚Äì91, and travelling throughout Europe. He travelled to Italy and Greece, exploring the ancient architecture, as well as around France and to England, where he was particularly interested in the medieval church architecture. During his time abroad he kept detailed notebooks and sketchbooks (nowadays held in the Museum of Finnish Architecture archives). In 1892, soon after returning to Finland, he was appointed assistant lecturer at the Polytechnic Institute (founded 1879), where he himself had previously been a student, a position he held for the rest of his life, and where the head of the school at the time was Gustaf Nystr√∂m. He was a highly skilled draftsman and his talent was used first in teaching linear and free-hand drawing. In 1901 he was promoted to lecturer in architecture, teaching ancient and medieval architecture and their styles, along with exercises in design and drawing. For many years Nystr√∂m also taught ornamentation and style history at the Central School of Applied Arts in Helsinki (precursor to the present-day Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture). He received the honorary title of professor in 1922. It has often been noted by his former students how very popular he was as a teacher, in part due to his keen sense of humour but also in conveying something of his drawing skills to the students. He also had a significant role in spreading the Art Nouveau style to several generations of students.Pekka Korvenmaa (ed.), The Work of Architects, Rakennustieto, Helsinki, 1992. Nystr√∂m never married. He died suddenly on January 6, 1925 in Kotka, while visiting his sister. He is buried in Hietaniemi cemetery in Helsinki. In 1928 the Finnish Association of Architects arranged a competition for the design of Nystr√∂m's gravestone: it was won by his former student, Alvar Aalto; the gravestone, in white marble, with the text Bene latuit from French philosopher Rene Descartes‚Äô work Meditations, where he had quoted Ovid, Bene vixit qui bene latuit, i.e. The One who lives well, lives unnoticed. \\"Neo-Renaissance\\" Wuorinen apartment building, Helsinki (1896) Nystr√∂m had contributed to the journal Suomen Teollisuuslehti (Finnish Industrial Magazine) edited by his architecture partner Vilho Penttil√§. However, his most significant written contributions were to the 11-volume encyclopaedia Tietosanakirja published between 1909 and 1922. Nystr√∂m wrote the descriptions for almost 300 entries.Jalmar Castr√©n et al (eds.), Tietosanakirja, 11 osa, T√§ydennysosa, Helsinki, Tietosanakirja, 1922.  Architectural firm Usko Nystr√∂m‚îÄPetrelius‚îÄPenttil√§  Usko Nyst√∂m established a joint architectural form with Albert Petrelius (1865‚Äì1946) and Vilho Penttil√§ (1868‚Äì1918) in 1895 and the partnership continued until 1908. The office was one of many joint architectural firms established in Helsinki at around that time ‚Äì Gesellius, Lindgren, and Saarinen becoming the most renowned. Each of the partners had at one time worked for the master builder J. G. Rosenberg. Nystr√∂m was the leading figure in the architectural firm ‚Äì only his first name was included in its official name. Albert Petrelius was both an architect and master builder and as well as being a partner in the architectural form also simultaneously worked for a fire insurance company, while the architect Vilho Penttil√§ was also editor-in-chief of the journal Suomen Teollisuuslehti (Finnish Industrial Magazine), and which provided an outlet for showing the works of the architectural firm. Petrelius and Penttil√§ were members of the pro-Finnish language and pro-Independence Fennoman movement (at that time the vast majority of architects were Swedish-speaking). In fact, some of the architectural firm's customers were also connected with the Fennoman movement, in particular the KOP Bank (Kansallis-Osake-Pankki). Among the most notable works of Usko Nystr√∂m‚îÄPetrelius‚îÄPenttil√§ were 18 bourgeois apartment buildings in central Helsinki, designed and built between 1895 and 1907. Helsinki was going through a building boom period at that time, aided by the Companies Act of 1895 and new forms of credit institutions, at a time when industry in the cities was on the rise and there was a shortage of housing. The style of their architecture represents the period of transition from neo-gothic and neo- renaissance to the Jugendstil or Art Nouveau style, also referred to as the National Romantic style. Historian Eija Rauske suggests that models for the designs of the apartment blocks came from the major cities of central Europe, and in particular Paris and Vienna. An idea of the transitional style of the architectural firm can be seen by comparing two apartment blocks, both fairly close to each other in central Helsinki. The Wuorinen apartment building is a 5-storey (plus attic storey) neo-Renaissance style building taking up an entire city block, with heavily rusticated ground floor (containing shops) and heavy roof cornice; the finesse of the facades is supposedly picked out in the exposed brickwork on the upper floors and plaster-cast emblems of various forms, in particular the letter W, referring to the client of the project. By contrast, the Schalin apartment building at Kapteeninkatu 11 ‚Äì Tehtaankatu 9, Helsinki (1902), is a 5-storey (plus attic storey) Jugendstil or Art Nouveau work, in unpainted rough render decorated with patterns depicting seaweed made from granite insets. The corner dome has echoes of medieval castle towers. The fa√ßade also includes seemingly randomly placed decorative balconies. The curved forms continue partly in the interior with some oval-shaped rooms. However, the rear internal courtyard is far more restrained and rational, and painted in white.Johnathan Moorhouse, Michael Carapetian, Leena Ahtola- Moorhouse, Helsinki Jugendstil Architecture 1895-1915. Helsinki, Otava, 1987. Nystr√∂m's most famous work was designed during the period of the partnership ‚Äì though it is attributed to him alone ‚Äì the Grand H√¥tel Cascade (1903) (nowadays known as the Imatran Valtionhotelli) in Imatra. With its turreted towers, the work brings to mind the castles in France Nystr√∂m had seen during his travels there a decade earlier.Henrik Lilius, Imatran valtionhotelli: Kuvia rakennuksen vaiheista, Helsinki, Alko, 1983. In actual fact, the first building designs of Usko Nystr√∂m‚îÄPetrelius‚îÄPenttil√§ were wooden buildings, designed in a rustic, proto-National Romantic style. Penttil√§ even campaigned for a Finnish National Romantic style of architecture on the pages of the journal he edited, Suomen Teollisuuslehti, with the designs showing exposed notched corner joints, rather than covering the logs with boarding, which had been the custom at that time. Among their distinct wooden buildings were the Hollola Municipal House (1902), the Suviranta artists‚Äô home for artist Eero J√§rnefelt, in Tuusulanj√§rvi, along the same lake shore where other artists would build their atelier homes, most notably Jean Sibelius. By far the largest scale project of the architectural firm was never realised, the Vyborg City Hall, which Nystr√∂m and Penttil√§ had won in an architectural competition in 1899. Their entry is in the neo-gothic style. However, over the following years, as the project awaited the go-ahead, the design changed to a more neo- renaissance style. The project was never built. Interior, Lammi Church (1918-1929) In total the firm employed 15 people, and as a teacher at the school of architecture Nystr√∂m was able to hire talented students. Among their staff who went on to have distinguished careers were Emil Werner von Essen, Kauno Kallio, Kalle Kontio, V√§in√∂ Kein√§nen, Clas Axel Gylden and Uno Ullberg. After the joint architectural firm was disbanded, each of the architects continued individually, but with Penttil√§ continuing with their main clients, that is, the banks.Otto-I. Meurman, Viipurin arkkitehdit, Viipurin Suomalaisen Kirjallisuusseuran toimitteita 2, Helsinki, 1977. Following the break up of the Usko Nystr√∂m‚îÄPetrelius‚îÄPenttil√§ Nystr√∂m continued to teach, but also worked on a number of architectural projects of his own. His former architect partner Vilho Penttil√§ was killed during the Finnish Civil War of 1918. The medieval Lammi Church was burnt down during the war ‚Äì and afterwards Nystr√∂m was awarded the commission for its restoration and reconstruction. Historian Rauske even calls the fire a ‚Äúblessing in disguise‚Äù. While the main outer granite walls had mostly been preserved, Nystr√∂m devoted his creativity to a completely new interior using reinforced concrete to create new vaults, which while inspired by medieval church architecture have a more modern feel, a colourful example of Art Nouveau but also in a fluidity that has affinities with Expressionism which was already at its height at that time in central Europe. The work was finally completed in 1929, after Nystr√∂m's death.

The scandal arose from allegations by Norman Josiffe (otherwise known as Norman Scott) that he and Thorpe had a homosexual relationship in the early 1960s, and that Thorpe had begun a badly planned conspiracy to murder Josiffe, who was threatening to expose their affair. Thorpe, while admitting that the two had been friends, denied any such relationship. With the help of political colleagues and a compliant press, he was able to ensure that rumours of misconduct went unreported for more than a decade. Scott's allegations were a persistent threat, however, and by the mid-1970s he was regarded as a danger both to Thorpe and to the Liberal Party, which was then enjoying a resurgence of popularity and was close to a place in government. Attempts to buy or frighten Scott into silence were unsuccessful, and the problem deepened, until the fallout following the shooting of his dog during a possible murder attempt by a hired gunman in October 1975 brought the matter into the open. After further newspaper revelations, Thorpe was forced to resign the Liberal leadership in May 1976, and subsequent police investigations led to his being charged, with three others, with conspiracy to murder Scott. Before the case came to trial, Thorpe lost his parliamentary seat at the 1979 general election. At the trial in May 1979, the prosecution's case depended heavily on the evidence of Scott, Thorpe's former parliamentary colleague Peter Bessell, and the hired gunman, Andrew Newton. None of these witnesses impressed the court. Bessell's credibility was undermined by the revelations of his financial arrangements with The Sunday Telegraph. In his summing-up the judge was scathing about the prosecution's evidence, and all four defendants were acquitted. Nevertheless, Thorpe's public reputation was damaged irreparably by the case. He had chosen not to testify at the trial, which left several matters unexplained amid public disquiet. Thorpe's retirement into private life was followed by the onset of Parkinson's disease in the mid-1980s, and he made few public statements afterwards. He eventually achieved a reconciliation with the North Devon Liberal Democrat constituency party, of which he was honorary president from 1988 until his death in 2014. Allegations of suppression of evidence by the police before the trial were under investigation from 2015, reaching a culmination in June 2018 when the police said that there was no new evidence and the case would remain closed. Background =Homosexuality and English law= Before the passage of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, which decriminalised most homosexual acts in England and Wales (but did not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland), all sexual activity between men was illegal throughout the United Kingdom, and carried heavy criminal penalties. Antony Grey, a secretary of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, wrote of \\"a hideous aura of criminality and degeneracy and abnormality surrounding the matter\\". Political figures were particularly vulnerable to exposure; William Field, the Labour MP for Paddington North, was forced to resign his seat in 1953 after a conviction for soliciting in a public lavatory. In the following year Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, the youngest peer in the House of Lords, was imprisoned for a year after being convicted of \\"gross indecency\\", victim of a virulent \\"drive against male vice\\" led by the Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe. Four years later public attitudes had changed little. When Ian Harvey, a junior Foreign Office minister in Harold Macmillan's government, was found guilty of indecent behaviour with a Coldstream Guardsman in November 1958, he lost both his ministerial job and his parliamentary seat at Harrow East. He was ostracised by the Conservative Party and by most of his former friends, and never again held a position in public life.Parris, pp. 136‚Äì40 Thus, anyone entering politics at that time knew that revelations of homosexual activity would likely bring such a career to a swift end.Chester et al., pp. 31‚Äì33 =Thorpe= Barnstaple, the main town in Thorpe's North Devon constituency John Jeremy Thorpe was born in 1929, the son and grandson of Conservative MPs. He attended Eton, then studied law at Trinity College, Oxford, where, having decided on a political career, he devoted his main energies to making a personal impact rather than to his studies.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 13‚Äì19 Rejecting his Conservative background, he joined the small, centrist Liberal Party‚Äîwhich by the late 1940s was a declining force in British politics, but still offered a national platform and a challenge to an ambitious young politician.Chester et al., pp. 14‚Äì15 He became secretary and eventually President of the Oxford Liberal Club, and met many of the party's leading figures. In the Hilary term (January‚ÄìMarch) of 1950‚Äì51 Thorpe served as President of the Oxford Union. In 1952, while studying at the Inner Temple prior to his call to the bar, Thorpe was adopted as prospective Liberal parliamentary candidate for the North Devon constituency, a Conservative-held seat where, at the 1951 general election, the Liberals had finished in third place behind Labour.Chester et al., pp. 22‚Äì23 Thorpe worked in the constituency tirelessly, using the slogan \\"A Vote for the Liberals is a Vote for Freedom\\", and at the 1955 general election, had halved the sitting Conservative MP James Lindsay's majority. Four years later, in October 1959, he captured the seat with a majority of 362, one of six successful Liberals in what was generally an electoral triumph for the Conservative Macmillan government.Chester et al., p. 29 The writer and former MP Matthew Parris described Thorpe as one of the more dashing among the new MPs elected in 1959.Parris, p. 208 Thorpe's chief political interest lay in the field of human rights, and his speeches criticising apartheid in South Africa attracted the attention of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who took note of this rising star in the Liberal Party. Thorpe was briefly considered as best man at the 1960 wedding of his Eton contemporary Antony Armstrong-Jones to Princess Margaret, but was rejected when vetting checks indicated that he might have homosexual tendencies.Snowdon: The Biography by Anne de Courcy (2008); Weidenfeld & Nicolson. .Chester et al., p. 31 The security agency MI5, which routinely keeps records on all Members of Parliament, added this information to Thorpe's file.Freeman and Penrose, p. 36 =Josiffe, later named Scott= Norman Josiffe was born in Sidcup, Kent, on 12 February 1940Freeman and Penrose, p. 37.‚Äîhe did not assume the name Scott until 1967. His mother was Ena Josiffe, n√©e Lynch; Albert Josiffe, her second husband, abandoned the family home soon after Norman's birth. Norman's early childhood was relatively happy and stable. After leaving school at 15 with no qualifications, he acquired a pony by means of an animal charity, and became a competent rider.Chester et al., pp. 34‚Äì35Freeman and Penrose, pp. 37‚Äì38 When he was 16 he was prosecuted for the theft of a saddle and some pony feed, and was put on probation. With the encouragement of his probation officer he took lessons at Westerham Riding School at Oxted in Surrey, and eventually found work at a stable in Altrincham in Cheshire. After moving there he chose to cut all links with his family, and began to call himself \\"Lianche-Josiffe\\" (\\"Lianche\\" being a stylised version of \\"Lynch\\"). He also hinted at an aristocratic background, and of family tragedies that had left him orphaned and alone.Chester et al., pp. 36‚Äì37 In 1959 Josiffe moved to the Kingham Stables in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, where he learned dressage while working as a groom. The stables were owned by Norman Vater, the self-made son of a coalminer who, like Josiffe, had inflated his name and was known as \\"Brecht Van de Vater\\". In the course of his rise, Vater had made numerous friends in higher social circles, among them Thorpe. Initially, Josiffe was settled and happy at the stables, but his relationship with Vater deteriorated in the face of the latter's assertive and demanding manner, and he was unable to form good relationships with his fellow-workers.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 39‚Äì40 He began to evidence the kind of behaviour which a journalist would later summarise as his \\"extraordinary talent for wheedling his way into people's sympathy before turning their lives to misery with his hysterical temper-tantrums.\\" =Bessell= Peter Bessell, eight years older than Thorpe, had a successful business career before entering Liberal politics in the 1950s. He came to the party leadership's attention in 1955 when, as the Liberal candidate in the Torquay by-election, he substantially increased his party's vote in the first of a series of impressive Liberal results during the 1955‚Äì59 parliament.Cook and Ramsden, pp. 153‚Äì54 He was subsequently selected as candidate for the more winnable constituency of Bodmin, and became both an admirer and personal friend of Thorpe, who in turn was impressed by Bessell's apparent business acumen.Freeman and Penrose, p. 90 At Bodmin in the 1959 general election, Bessell reduced the Conservative majority, and he followed this in the October 1964 election with victory by over 3,000 votes. With the prestige of the letters \\"MP\\" after his name, Bessell set out in pursuit of serious money-making, while staying close to Thorpe whom he considered the likely next leader of the Liberal Party.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 93‚Äì94 Bessell noted that Thorpe, for all his gregariousness and warmth, appeared to have no female friends and lacked any interest in women. The former Liberal MP Frank Owen confided to Bessell his suspicions that Thorpe was homosexual; other West Country Liberals had formed the same opinion.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 91‚Äì92 Aware that exposure as a gay man would end Thorpe's career, Bessell became his self-appointed protector, even to the extent, he later said, of falsely claiming to be bisexual, as a means of acquiring his friend's confidence.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 94‚Äì96 Origins =Thorpe‚ÄìScott friendship= In late 1960 or early 1961, Thorpe visited Vater at the Kingham Stables, and briefly met Josiffe. He was sufficiently taken with the young man to suggest that, should Josiffe ever need help, he should call on him at the House of Commons. Soon after this, Josiffe left the stables after a serious disagreement with Vater. He then suffered a mental breakdown, and for much of 1961 was under psychiatric care. On 8 November 1961, a week after discharging himself from the Ashurst clinic in Oxford, Josiffe went to the House of Commons to see Thorpe. He was penniless, homeless and, worse, had left Vater's employment without the National Insurance card which, at that time, was essential for obtaining regular work and access to social and unemployment benefits. Thorpe promised he would help.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 40‚Äì43 According to Josiffe's account, a homosexual liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at his mother's (Ursula Thorpe, n√©e Norton-Griffiths, (1903-1992)) home in Oxted, and continued for several years.Chester et al., p. 41Parris, pp. 209‚Äì10 Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship.Parris, p. 223 He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term stay with a family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, in an effort to find work with horses for his friend,Chester et al., p. 41; Freeman and Penrose, pp. 48‚Äì53 arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.Parris, pp. 208 and 212 When, early in 1962, the police questioned Josiffe about the alleged theft of a suede jacket, Thorpe persuaded the investigating officer that Josiffe was recovering from mental illness, and was under his care. No further action was taken.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 50‚Äì51 In April 1962 Josiffe obtained a replacement National Insurance card which, he later said, was retained by Thorpe who had assumed the role of his employer. This was denied by Thorpe, and the \\"missing card\\" remained an ongoing source of grievance for Josiffe.Chester et al., p. 44 He began to feel marginalised by Thorpe, and in December 1962, in a fit of depression, confided to a friend his intention to shoot the MP and commit suicide. The friend alerted the police, to whom Josiffe gave a detailed statement of his sexual relations with Thorpe, and produced letters to support his story. None of this evidence impressed the police sufficiently for them to take action, although a report on the matter was added to Thorpe's MI5 file.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 58‚Äì60 In 1963, a relatively calm period in Josiffe's life as a riding instructor in Northern Ireland ended after he was seriously hurt in an accident at the Dublin Horse Show.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 65 and 74 He moved back to England, and eventually found a job at a riding school in Wolverhampton, where he stayed for several months before his erratic behaviour proved too much, and he was asked to leave.Chester, p. 49 After a period of aimlessness in London, Josiffe saw an advertisement for a groom's post in Porrentruy in Switzerland. Thorpe used his influence to secure him the job. Josiffe left for Switzerland in December 1964, but returned to England almost immediately with complaints that conditions were impossible. In his hurry to depart he left his suitcase behind, which contained letters and other documents that, he believed, supported his claims to a sexual relationship with Thorpe.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 76‚Äì78 =Threats and counter-measures= Thorpe proved to be a lively and witty performer in the cut and thrust of parliamentary debates, and his presence in the House of Commons was soon noticed. In July 1962, in the wake of some disastrous Conservative by-election performances, Macmillan sacked seven cabinet ministers in what was known as the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\". Thorpe's comment‚Äî\\"Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his friends for his life\\"‚Äîwas widely regarded in the press as the most apt verdict on the prime minister.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 33‚Äì34 Thorpe raised his political profile with effective attacks on government bureaucracy, and in the October 1964 general election was returned in North Devon with an increased majority.Chester et al., p. 48 A year later he secured the office of Liberal Party treasurer, a significant step towards his ambition to become the next party leader.Freeman and Penrose, p. 109 By early 1965 Josiffe was in Dublin, where he worked at various horse-related jobs while continuing to badger Thorpe by letter about his missing luggage and the continuing National Insurance card issue.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 79‚Äì80 However, Thorpe rejected any responsibility for these matters.Chester et al., pp. 50‚Äì52 In mid-March 1965 Josiffe wrote a long letter to Thorpe's mother, which began: \\"For the last five years, as you probably know, Jeremy and I have had a homosexual relationship.\\" The letter blamed Thorpe for awakening \\"this vice that lies latent in every man\\", and accused him of callousness and disloyalty.Parris, p. 213 Ursula Thorpe gave the letter to her son, who drafted a quasi-legal statement rejecting the \\"damaging and groundless accusations\\" and accusing Josiffe of attempting to blackmail him. The document was never sent; instead, Thorpe turned to Bessell for advice.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 84‚Äì86 Bessell, anxious to be of service to his party's highest-profile figure, flew to Dublin in April 1965. He found that Josiffe was being advised by a sympathetic Jesuit priest, Father Sweetman,Freeman and Penrose, pp. 97‚Äì99 who believed that at least some of Josiffe's allegations might be true; otherwise, he asked Bessell, why had he flown all the way from London to deal with them?Chester et al., p. 63 Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure, but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the missing luggage and insurance card. He also hinted at the possibility of an equestrian job in America. Bessell's intervention appeared to contain the problem, particularly as Josiffe's suitcase was recovered shortly afterwards‚Äîalthough letters implicating Thorpe had been removed.Chester et al., pp. 68‚Äì69 For most of the following two years Josiffe remained largely quiescent in Ireland, attempting to establish himself in various careers; part of this time was spent in a monastery. It was during this period that he formally adopted the name of Scott.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 126‚Äì27 In April 1967 Scott wrote to Bessell from Ireland, asking for help in obtaining a passport in his changed name so that he could begin a new life in America. A second, less positive letter, dated July, indicated that Scott had returned to England and was once again in difficulties, with medical bills and other debts. His lack of an insurance card prevented him from claiming benefits.Chester, pp. 82‚Äì84 By this time, Thorpe had succeeded Jo Grimond as leader of the Liberal Party.Chester et al., pp. 74‚Äì78 To resolve Scott's immediate problems, and to prevent a resumption of his tirades against the new party leader, Bessell began paying him a \\"retainer\\" of between ¬£5 and ¬£10 a week, ostensibly in lieu of lost national insurance benefits.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 128‚Äì30 Bessell also arranged Scott's new passport, but by this time Scott had abandoned his American plans and wished to establish a career as a model. He asked Bessell for ¬£200 to set him up; Bessell refused, but in May 1968 gave him ¬£75, on the understanding there would be no further demands for a year.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 139‚Äì40 Developments =Incitement= Thorpe's leadership of the Liberals was not, initially, an unqualified success; his local campaigning skills did not readily transfer to set speeches on national or international issues, and some sections of the party became restless.Chester et al., p. 80 His engagement to Caroline Allpass, announced in April 1968, reassured those in the party who had reservations about his private life; others were shocked by Thorpe's emphasis on the political motivation for the marriage‚Äîworth five points in the polls, he opined to Mike Steele, the party's press officer.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 133‚Äì35 For much of 1968 Thorpe was untroubled by Scott, who had acquired new friends and, according to Bessell, had burned his Thorpe letters.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 140‚Äì42 His reappearance in November 1968, again penniless and without prospect of work, was particularly unwelcome to Thorpe, as he fought to establish his leadership credentials. Bessell provided immediate relief by resuming the weekly cash retainer, but this was a short-term respite. Early in December 1968 Bessell was summoned to Thorpe's office in the House of Commons. According to Bessell, Thorpe said of Scott: \\"We've got to get rid of him\\", and later: \\"It is no worse than shooting a sick dog.\\"Parris, p. 215 Bessell said later that he was unsure whether Thorpe was serious, but decided to play along, by discussing various ways of getting rid of Scott's body. Thorpe supposedly thought that disposal down one of Cornwall's many disused tin mines offered the best option, and also suggested his friend David Holmes as an appropriate assassin. Holmes, one of four assistant treasurers of the Liberal Party appointed by Thorpe in 1965, had been best man at Thorpe's wedding, and was completely loyal to him.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 143‚Äì46 Bessell further maintained that in January 1969 Thorpe called him to a meeting together with Holmes, and that again Thorpe put forward suggestions for eliminating Scott. These were dismissed as impractical or ridiculous by Bessell and Holmes, who nevertheless agreed to give the matter further consideration. They hoped, said Bessell, that if they stalled, Thorpe would see the absurdity of his murder scheme and abandon it. Holmes, who largely confirmed Bessell's account of the meeting, later justified this decision on the grounds that \\"if we had simply said no, he might have gone elsewhere‚Äîand that might have led to an even greater disaster.\\" According to Bessell and Holmes, discussions of the plan ended in May 1969, after the surprising news of Scott's wedding that month. =Party enquiry= By early 1971, Thorpe's political career had stalled. He had led the party to a disastrous performance in the general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400.Chester et al., pp. 110‚Äì12 Bessell, with mounting business worries, did not stand for re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party on the verge of bankruptcy; but the matter was put aside in a wave of sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a road accident 11 days after the election. Thorpe was devastated; he continued as leader, but for the next year performed little beyond routine party duties. Tal-y-bont, North Wales, where Scott lived in 1971 Meanwhile, Bessell's efforts ensured that for the time being the Scott threat was kept at bay. The missing insurance card meant that Scott's wife, who was pregnant, could not claim maternity benefits. Scott threatened to talk to newspapers, but the matter was resolved by the issue of an emergency card after Bessell's intervention at the Department of Health and Social Security.Chester, pp. 96‚Äì98 In 1970 Scott's marriage collapsed; he blamed Thorpe, and again threatened exposure.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 160‚Äì61 Bessell successfully prevented Thorpe's name being mentioned in court during the divorce proceedings, and arranged that Thorpe would anonymously pay the legal costs.Chester et al., pp. 120‚Äì21Freeman and Penrose, pp. 161‚Äì64 Early in 1971 Scott moved to a cottage in the village of Talybont in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones. He sufficiently persuaded her of his mistreatment at the hands of Thorpe that she contacted the Liberal MP for the adjoining constituency of Montgomeryshire‚ÄîEmlyn Hooson, on the right wing of the party and a friend of neither Thorpe nor Bessell. Hooson suggested a meeting at the House of Commons.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 166‚Äì70 On 26 and 27 May 1971 Scott told his story to Hooson and David Steel, the Liberals' chief whip. Neither was fully convinced, but felt the matter warranted further investigation. Against Thorpe's wishes, a confidential party enquiry was arranged for 9 June, to be chaired by Lord Byers, the leader of the Liberals in the House of Lords. At the enquiry Byers took a tough line against Scott, failing to offer him a chair and treating him, Scott said, \\"like a boy at school up before the headmaster.\\"Freeman and Penrose, pp. 170‚Äì75 Byers's unsympathetic manner quickly unsettled Scott, who changed the details of his story several times and frequently broke down in tears. Byers suggested that Scott was a common blackmailer who needed psychiatric help. Declaring that Byers was a \\"pontificating old sod\\", Scott fled the room. The enquiry then questioned police officers about letters which Scott had shown to the police in 1962, but were told that these were inconclusive.Chester et al., pp. 137‚Äì38 Thorpe persuaded the Home Secretary, Reginald Maudling, and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, John Waldron, to inform Byers that there was no police interest in Thorpe's activities, and no evidence of wrongdoing on his part.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 176‚Äì77 As a result, the enquiry dismissed Scott's allegations. =Further threats= Angry at his treatment by the Byers inquiry, Scott sought other means of pursuing his vendetta against Thorpe. In June 1971 he met Gordon Winter, a South African journalist who was also an agent for the South African intelligence agency BOSS. Scott provided details of his supposed seduction by Thorpe, a story which Winter assured his BOSS masters would destroy Thorpe and the Liberal Party. He found that no newspaper would print the story on largely uncorroborated and unreliable evidence.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 178‚Äì82 In March 1972 Scott's friend Gwen Parry-Jones died; Scott used the inquest to denounce Thorpe for ruining his life and driving Parry-Jones to her death. None of these accusations was published.Chester et al., pp. 154 and 158 Depressed, Scott retreated into a state of torpor, assisted by tranquillisers, and for a while presented no threat to Thorpe.Chester et al., p. 160 In 1972 and 1973 Thorpe's political fortunes, and those of the Liberals, revived. Thorpe's personal standing was enhanced when, on 14 March 1973, he married Marion, Countess of Harewood, whose former husband was a first cousin to the Queen. After a series of by- election victories and local government gains, an electoral breakthrough for the party looked plausible when Heath called a general election in February 1974. In that election, with more than six million votes (19.3% of those cast), the Liberals achieved by far their best election result since the Second World War,Freeman and Penrose, p. 195 but under the first-past-the-post voting system this large vote translated into only 14 seats. However, as neither major party won an overall majority, these seats gave Thorpe (whose personal majority in North Devon increased to 11,072) significant leverage. He was briefly in coalition discussions with Heath, who was prepared to give cabinet posts to Thorpe and other senior Liberals. Thorpe later denied that there was any serious prospect of agreement,Trewin (ed.), p. 93 and in March 1974 Harold Wilson formed a minority Labour government. In the second 1974 general election, in October, Wilson achieved a narrow majority; the Liberals lost ground, with 5.3 million votes and 13 MPs. After Parry-Jones's death Scott lived quietly for a while in the West Country.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 183 and 200 In January 1974 he met Tim Keigwin, Thorpe's Conservative opponent in North Devon, and gave his version of his relationship with Thorpe. Keigwin was advised by the Conservative leadership that the material should not be used.Chester et al., pp. 186‚Äì87 Scott also confided in his doctor, Ronald Gleadle, who was treating him for depression. He had shown Gleadle his dossier of documents; the doctor, without Scott's knowledge or consent, sold the papers to Holmes, who had assumed the role of Thorpe's protector after Bessell settled permanently in California in January 1974. Holmes paid ¬£2,500 for the documents, which were promptly burned in the home of Thorpe's solicitor.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 200‚Äì01 A further cache of papers was discovered in November 1974, by builders renovating a London office formerly used by Bessell. They found a briefcase containing letters and photographs that apparently compromised Thorpe, among them Scott's 1965 letter to Ursula Thorpe. Undecided what to do with their find, they took it to the Sunday Mirror newspaper. Sidney Jacobson, the paper's deputy chairman, decided not to publish the material and passed the briefcase and its content to Thorpe.Parris, p. 216 Copies of the documents were, however, kept in the newspaper's files.Freeman and Penrose, p. 211 =Alleged conspiracy= In their analysis of the case, the journalists Simon Freeman and Barry Penrose state that Thorpe probably formed the outline of a plan to silence Scott early in 1974, after the latter's re-emergence became a matter of increasing concern.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 206‚Äì08 Holmes later said that Thorpe was insistent that Scott be killed: \\"[Jeremy felt] he would never be safe with that man around\\".Freeman and Penrose, p. 208, quoted from Holmes's article in the News of the World, 31 May 1981 Uncertain how to proceed, late in 1974 Holmes approached a business acquaintance, a carpet salesman named John Le Mesurier (not to be confused with the actor of that name). Le Mesurier introduced Holmes to George Deakin, a fruit machine salesman who, he thought, would have contacts with people who might be prepared to deal with Scott. Holmes and Le Mesurier concocted a story involving a blackmailer who needed to be frightened off; Deakin agreed to help.Chester et al. pp. 217‚Äì20 In February 1975 Deakin met Andrew Newton, an airline pilot, who said he was willing to deal with Scott for an appropriate fee‚Äîbetween ¬£5,000 and ¬£10,000 was suggested.Parris, p. 217 Deakin put Newton in touch with Holmes. Newton always said that he had been hired to kill, not frighten, citing the size of the fee that he was offered‚Äîtoo much, he said, simply to scare someone.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 214‚Äì16 While these arrangements proceeded, Thorpe wrote to Sir Jack Hayward, the Bahamas-based millionaire businessman, who had given generously to the Liberal Party in the past. In the wake of the Liberals' February 1974 election successes, Thorpe asked for ¬£50,000 to replenish the party's funds. He further requested that ¬£10,000 of this sum be paid, not into the party's regular accounts but to Nadir Dinshaw, an acquaintance of Thorpe's who was resident in the Channel Islands. Thorpe explained that this subterfuge was necessary to deal with a special category of unspecific election expenses. Hayward trusted Thorpe, and sent the ¬£10,000 to Dinshaw who, instructed by Thorpe, passed the money to Holmes. After the October 1974 election Thorpe again requested funds from Hayward, and again asked that ¬£10,000 be sent via the Dinshaw route. Hayward obliged, though this time with more reluctance and after some delay. No accounting of this ¬£20,000 was ever provided; Holmes, Le Mesurier and Deakin all said that it was used to finance a \\"conspiracy to frighten\\", although they disagreed as to how much was spent. Thorpe later changed the story he had given Hayward about special categories of election expenses, and said he had deposited the sum with accountants \\"as an iron reserve against any shortage of funds at any subsequent election.\\" He denied that he had authorised any payment to Newton or to anyone else connected with the case.Parris, pp. 228‚Äì29 =Shooting= The moorland road above Porlock Hill, close to the scene of the shooting Newton met Holmes early in October 1975 when, the former claimed, he was given a down payment on a fee of ¬£10,000. Holmes later denied any such transaction, admitting only an agreement that Newton would carry out a frightening operation. On 12 October Newton, calling himself \\"Peter Keene\\", drove to Barnstaple in a yellow Mazda car where he approached Scott, claiming to have been hired to protect Scott from a supposed Canadian hit man.Chester et al., p. 215 This seemed plausible to Scott, who had been beaten up a few weeks earlier,Chester et al., p. 210 and he agreed to meet \\"Keene\\" at a later date. He was sufficiently cautious to ask a friend to make a note of the stranger's car registration number.Preston, p. 198 On 24 October Newton, now driving a Ford saloon, met Scott by arrangement in Combe Martin, just north of Barnstaple. Newton explained that he had to drive to Porlock, about 25 miles away, and suggested that Scott accompany him‚Äîhe and Scott could talk on the journey. Scott had with him his recently acquired pet dog, a Great Dane called Rinka; this disconcerted Newton, who was afraid of dogs, but Scott insisted that Rinka go with them. At Porlock, Newton left Scott and Rinka at a hotel while he supposedly dealt with his business. He picked them up shortly after 8 pm, and they began the drive back to Combe Martin.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 216‚Äì17 On a deserted stretch of road, Newton began to drive erratically, feigning tiredness, and accepted Scott's suggestion that he take over the driving. They stopped; Scott got out, followed by Rinka, and ran round to the driver's side, where he found Newton, gun in hand. Newton shot the dog in the head and, saying \\"It's your turn now\\", pointed the gun at Scott. The pistol failed to fire several times; eventually Newton jumped into the car and drove away, leaving Scott and the dead or dying dog by the roadside.Chester et al., pp. 226‚Äì27Preston, pp. 202‚Äì04 After Scott had been picked up in a distressed state by a passing car, the police were notified, and began enquiries. Newton was quickly identified through the Mazda's registration number, and arrested; his story was that Scott was blackmailing him and that the shooting had been intended to frighten him.Preston, pp. 207‚Äì08 He made no mention of any deal with Holmes, perhaps calculating that by keeping silent he would maximise his chances of payment from that quarter.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 222‚Äì23 Revelations On 12 December 1975 Private Eye included another short teasing piece by Auberon Waugh which ended: \\"My only hope is that sorrow over his friend's dog will not cause Mr Thorpe's premature retirement from public life\\".Waugh, pp. 22‚Äì23, quoting from Private Eye, 12 December 1975 By this time most newspapers knew of the stories surrounding Thorpe and Scott, but were wary of libel; according to Parris, by keeping silent they were \\"serving notice on Thorpe that they knew a bigger story must break, and could wait for it\\". In January 1976 Scott appeared before magistrates on a minor social security fraud charge, and stated that he was being hounded because of his previous sexual relationship with Thorpe. This claim, made in court and therefore protected from the libel laws, was widely reported.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 229‚Äì30 The Daily Mail had meanwhile discovered Bessell's whereabouts in California, and on 3 February 1976 carried a long interview with the former MP. Bessell's claim that he had been blackmailed by Scott provided Thorpe with temporary cover.Freeman and Penrose, p. 233 On 6 March newspapers reported Holmes's purchase of Scott's dossier from Gleadle, and a few days later David Steel discovered from Dinshaw, a personal friend, that ¬£20,000 intended for the party had been diverted to Holmes and was unaccounted for. Steel told Thorpe that he should resign, but he refused.Parris, pp. 218‚Äì19Freeman and Penrose, pp. 235‚Äì36 In an attempt to reassure his wavering parliamentary colleagues, on 14 March Thorpe made arrangements with The Sunday Times newspaper to publish a detailed rebuttal of Scott's charges, under the heading \\"The Lies of Norman Scott\\".Chester et al., p. 259 Newton's trial took place at Exeter Crown Court from 16 to 19 March 1976, where Scott repeated his allegations against Thorpe despite the efforts of the prosecution's lawyers to steer him away. Newton was found guilty of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, but he did not incriminate Thorpe.Chester et al., pp. 261‚Äì64 Thorpe's difficulties increased when Bessell, fearing for his own position and perhaps scenting the possibility of making money, changed his stance and confessed in the Daily Mail on 6 May that he had lied to protect his former friend. A further concern for Thorpe was the danger that newspapers would publish letters he had sent to Scott early in their friendship. In an effort to forestall this, Thorpe arranged for the publication of two of the letters in The Sunday Times, a paper generally sympathetic towards him. In one of these letters Thorpe referred to Scott by the pet name \\"Bunnies\\". The tone of this letter convinced readers and commentators that Thorpe had not been frank about the nature of the relationship. On 10 May 1976 he resigned as Liberal leader amid rising criticism, again categorically denying Scott's allegations but acknowledging the damage that they were inflicting on the party.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 238‚Äì41 After Thorpe's resignation the relative lack of press attention to the story for 18 months disguised the extent to which investigative reporting continued. Barry Penrose and Roger Courtiour, collectively known as \\"Pencourt\\", had originally been hired by Wilson after his retirement, to investigate the former prime minister's theory that Thorpe was a target of South African intelligence agencies.Chester et al., pp. 272‚Äì77 Pencourt's investigations led them to Bessell, who gave them his account of a conspiracy to murder Scott, and Thorpe's role in it.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 262‚Äì66 Before they could publish, they were scooped; Newton, released from prison in October 1977, sold his story to the London Evening News. He said that he had been paid ¬£5,000 to kill Scott, and provided photographs of him receiving payment from Le Mesurier.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 286‚Äì87Parris, p. 220 A lengthy police inquiry followed, at the end of which Thorpe, Holmes, Le Mesurier and Deakin were charged with conspiracy to murder. Thorpe was additionally charged with incitement to murder, on the basis of his 1969 meetings with Bessell and Holmes. After being released on bail, Thorpe declared: \\"I am totally innocent of this charge and will vigorously challenge it\\".Freeman and Penrose, p. 324 On 2 August 1978 Thorpe participated in a House of Commons debate about the future of Rhodesia, but thereafter played no further active part in parliament, although he remained North Devon's member. At the Liberals' 1978 annual assembly in Southport, he embarrassed the leadership by making a theatrical entrance and taking his place on the platform.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 333‚Äì34 Committal and trial The prosecution set out its case at the pre-trial committal hearing, which began in Minehead on 20 November 1978. At the request of Deakin's counsel, reporting restrictions were lifted, which meant that newspapers were free to print anything said in court without fear of the libel laws.Chippindale and Leigh, pp. 13‚Äì17 This move infuriated Thorpe, who had hoped for an in camera hearing which would avoid unfortunate newspaper headlines and perhaps lead to the dismissal of the case. Whatever the outcome, Thorpe knew that the adverse publicity would destroy his career, and that Scott would thus have his revenge.Freeman and Penrose, p. 340 As the hearings began, Bessell described the 1969 meetings where he alleged that Thorpe had suggested that Holmes should kill Scott, including the comment about the shooting of a sick dog.Chippindale and Leigh, pp. 30‚Äì33 The court learned that Bessell had a contract with The Sunday Telegraph, which was paying him ¬£50,000 for his story.Chippindale and Leigh, p. 58 Dinshaw gave evidence of the ¬£20,000 he had received from Hayward and passed to Holmes, and of subsequent attempts by Thorpe to obscure the details of these transactions.Chippindale and Leigh, pp. 80‚Äì83 Newton testified that Holmes had wanted Scott killed: \\"He would prefer it if [Scott] vanished from the face of the earth and was never seen again. It was left to me how to do it\\".Chippindale and Leigh, p. 86 Scott gave clinical details of his alleged seduction by Thorpe at Thorpe's mother's house in November 1961 and on other occasions, and also recounted his ordeal on the moors above Porlock Hill.Chippindale and Leigh, pp. 104‚Äì06 and 112‚Äì15 Scott contended that homosexuality was an incurable disease, with which Thorpe had infected him, and that Thorpe therefore should be held responsible for Scott's lifelong care. At the end of the hearing the presiding magistrate committed the four defendants for trial at the Central Criminal Court, commonly known as the Old Bailey.Chippindale and Leigh, p. 189 In March 1979 the Labour government fell on a vote of no confidence, and a general election was called for 3 May. This led to a brief delay in the start of the trial as Thorpe, who still had a following among North Devon Liberals, was adopted as their candidate in the election. Largely isolated from his party's national campaign, he lost the seat to Conservative Antony Speller by over 8,000 votes.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 345‚Äì46 The trial began on 8 May, under Sir Joseph Cantley, a relatively obscure High Court judge with limited experience of high-profile cases.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 350‚Äì51 To conduct his defence Thorpe engaged George Carman, who had established a criminal law practice on the Northern Circuit in Manchester; this was his first high-profile national case.Parris, p. 230 Carman undermined Bessell's credibility by revealing his financial interest in Thorpe's conviction: his newspaper contract provided that in the event of acquittal, only half the ¬£50,000 would be paid.Waugh, pp. 85‚Äì86 The judge left no doubt as to his own low opinion of Bessell's character;Waugh, pp. 65‚Äì66 Auberon Waugh, who was writing a book on the trial, thought that Cantley's general attitude to other prosecution witnesses became increasingly one-sided.Waugh, p. 142 On 7 June Deakin testified that although he had put Newton in touch with Holmes, he had thought that this was to help someone to deal with a blackmailer‚Äîhe knew nothing of a conspiracy to kill.Waugh, pp. 179‚Äì81 Deakin was the only defendant to testify; the others all chose to remain silent and call no witnesses, believing that, based on the testimonies of Bessell, Scott and Newton, the prosecution had failed to make its case.Freeman and Penrose, p. 357 During his closing speech on behalf of Thorpe, Carman raised the possibility that Holmes and others might have organised a conspiracy without Thorpe's knowledge.Waugh, p. 210 On 18 June the judge began his summing-up. He drew the jury's attention to the previous good character of the defendants, whom he characterised as \\"men of hitherto unblemished reputation.\\"Waugh, p. 217 Cantley described Thorpe as \\"a national figure with a very distinguished public record\\". The judge was scathing about the principal witnesses: Bessell was a \\"humbug\\" whose contract with The Sunday Telegraph was \\"deplorable\\";Waugh, pp. 220‚Äì21 Scott was a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite‚Äî\\"but of course he could still be telling the truth. It is a question of belief.\\"Waugh, pp. 223‚Äì25 Newton was characterised as a perjurer and a chump, \\"determined to milk the case as hard as he can.\\"Waugh, pp. 225‚Äì27 The mystery surrounding the ¬£20,000 that Thorpe had obtained from Hayward was dismissed as an irrelevance: \\"The fact that a man obtains money by deceit does not [prove] that the man was a member of a conspiracy.\\"Waugh, p. 233 Waugh felt that the judge's lack of even-handedness could well provoke a counteraction against the accused from the jury. The summing-up became the subject of a scathing parody by the satirist Peter Cook.Cook (ed.), pp. 268 and 275‚Äì76 Acquittal and aftermath The jury retired during the morning of 20 June. They returned just over two days later, and acquitted all four defendants on all charges. The judge awarded costs to Deakin, but not to Holmes or Le Mesurier who he thought had been insufficiently co-operative in the enquiry. Thorpe made no application for costs.Waugh, pp. 236‚Äì37 In a brief public statement, he said that he considered the verdict as \\"totally fair, just and a complete vindication.\\"Waugh, p. 238 David Steel, on behalf of the Liberal Party, welcomed the verdict as \\"a great relief\\", and hoped that Thorpe would, \\"after a suitable period of rest and recuperation ... find many avenues where his great talents may be used.\\" In North Devon Thorpe's acquittal was celebrated with a thanksgiving service at which the presiding vicar, The Rev. John Hornby, gave thanks to God \\"for the ministry of His servant Jeremy ...The darkness is now past and the true light shines. This is the day the Lord hath made! Now is the day of our salvation!\\"Preston, pp. 310‚Äì11 Despite the acquittal, the broader public perception was strong that Thorpe had not behaved well, nor had he adequately explained himself.Parris, p. 232Chester et al., p. 369 Ronald Herniman, the Archdeacon of Barnstaple, who was critical of Hornby's melodramatic thanksgiving service, wrote: \\"There is a great deal of unhappiness about the result at the Old Bailey. As far as most people are concerned, the trial ended with a big question mark over the case\\".Freeman and Penrose, p. 367 Prevented by his party from a return to active politics,Freeman and Penrose, p. 369 in 1982 Thorpe was appointed by Amnesty International as director of its British section, but after protests from the organisation's staff, he withdrew. Not long afterwards, Thorpe first showed signs of the Parkinson's disease that led to his almost complete withdrawal into private life in the mid-1980s. There was a political reconciliation when, in 1988, following the merger of the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party, the newly formed North Devon Liberal Democrat association made him their honorary president. When he attended the Liberal Democrat party conference in 1997 he received a standing ovation. In 1999, Thorpe published his political memoir, In My Own Time, in which he justified his silence at the trial, and stated that he had never doubted the outcome.Thorpe, pp. 202‚Äì03 Nine years later, in January 2008, Thorpe gave his first press interview in 25 years, to The Guardian. Referring to the affair he said: \\"If it happened now I think the public would be kinder. Back then they were very troubled by it ... It offended their set of values.\\" Thorpe died on 4 December 2014.Bloch, p. 555 After the trial Le Mesurier kept a low profile, after unsuccessful attempts to sell \\"the real story\\" to national newspapers.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 385‚Äì86 In June 1981, in a series of articles printed in the News of the World, Holmes reasserted his allegation that Thorpe had asked him to kill Scott: \\"The incitement charge which Jeremy faced was true, and if I had gone into the witness box I'd have had to tell the truth.\\"Freeman and Penrose, pp. 379‚Äì80 Holmes, who died in 1990, had previously admitted his participation in a conspiracy to \\"frighten\\" Scott, though not to kill him.Waugh, p. 200 Bessell's account of the affair was published in America in 1980. He died in 1985; his final years were devoted to a campaign to stop the erosion of the San Diego beaches in California. Newton, like Le Mesurier, attempted to cash in on the case, but failed to find a newspaper willing to print his story.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 383‚Äì84 Scott's comments on the affair, immediately after the trial verdict, were that he was unsurprised by the outcome, but was upset by the aspersions on his character made by the judge from the safety of the bench. In December 2014, Scott, then aged 74, was reported to have recently relocated from Devon to Ireland, although John Preston, in his 2016 account, places him \\"in a village on Dartmoor ... with seventy hens, three horses, a cat, a parrot, a canary, and five dogs.\\"Preston, p. 320 In a BBC investigative documentary broadcast in December 2014, an antique firearms collector named Dennis Meighan claimed that he had been hired by an unidentified senior Liberal to kill Scott, for a fee of ¬£13,500. Having initially agreed, Meighan says, he changed his mind, but provided Newton with the gun used in the shooting. After confessing to the police, he was asked to sign a prepared statement which, according to him, \\"left everything out that was incriminating, but at the same time everything I said about the Liberal Party, Jeremy Thorpe, et cetera, was left out as well.\\" The BBC's Tom Mangold said that Meighan's account, if true, indicated the existence of \\"a conspiracy at the very highest level\\". In 2016 the Avon and Somerset police passed their files to Gwent Police, for an independent review of the original investigation. After the police came to the conclusion that Andrew Newton had died, the Crown Prosecution Service closed the case. In 2018, Gwent Police reported that they had \\"now revisited these enquiries and have identified information which indicates that Newton may still be alive\\", therefore re- opening lines of inquiry. On 4 June 2018 the force announced that they had interviewed Newton, who had been living under a new name, Hann Redwin, in Dorking, Surrey, but that he had given no new useful information, and so the case would remain closed. In popular media At the 1979 Secret Policeman's Ball, in aid of Amnesty International, the biased summing up speech by Mr Justice Cantley was parodied by Peter Cook. The sketch was written and delivered shortly after the trial, and was, according to Freeman and Penrose, \\"actually not that different from the original\\".Freeman and Penrose, p. 365 The nine-minute opus, \\"Entirely a Matter for You\\", is considered to be one of the finest works of Cook's career. Cook and show producer Martin Lewis brought out an album on Virgin Records entitled Here Comes the Judge: Live of the live performance together with three studio tracks that further lampooned the Thorpe trial. In 1997 Bloomsbury Publishing published Rinkagate: The Rise and Fall of Jeremy Thorpe by investigative journalist Barrie Penrose. The 2020 novel Beneath the Streets, by Adam MacQueen, is an alternate history version of 1976 where Rinka survived and Scott was killed. In 2016, approximately a year and a half after Thorpe's death, Viking Press published A Very English Scandal, a true crime non-fiction novel about the affair by journalist John Preston. In May 2018, BBC One broadcast a three-part television miniseries adaptation of the book, written by Russell T Davies, likewise titled A Very English Scandal, directed by Stephen Frears and starring Hugh Grant as Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Scott.

It was the winner in the lowest powered class of the Round Germany Flight contest of 1925. Design and development The 1925 Round Germany Flight involved five circuits over a total distance of over . Competing aircraft were classified by total engine power, the lowest powered group having less than . Three Daimler aircraft were in this group, all designed by Hanns Klemm, two single engined L20s and the L21. They were all powered by the new Mercedes F7502 light aircraft engine which Klemm had championed and Ferdinand Porsche designed. This unit produced , so the twin engined L21 just qualified within the lowest power group. The L21 had a parasol wing constructed in three pieces around two wooden spars. The outer panels were tapered, with sweep only on their trailing edges. On its first flight and tests the centre panel was also tapered and the overall span was but these early flights revealed an instability around the longitudinal axis. This was cured by extending the centre section span, making it just under half the new overall span of and giving it a rectangular plan. The wing was plywood covered from the forward spar to the leading edge, forming a torsion resisting box, and had internal wire bracing. An unusual feature that the L21 shared with the L20 and the earlier L15 was the supplementation of conventional ailerons with short chord tip flaps, each with an area of , rotating on axes toward the leading edge of the wing and connected to the ailerons by rods and cranks. Both before and after the wing extension lift struts ran from the lower fuselage longerons to the end of the centre section, taking them well outside the engines on the final version. The L21's engines were wing mounted just outside the cabane struts, each cylinder with a tall, ram's horn exhaust discharging over the wing. They were fed from a tank in the central part of the wing. The flat sided, short nosed fuselage of the L21 was a wooden structure, partly covered with stress bearing ply and with wire bracing and fabric covering elsewhere. The single seat, open cockpit was accessed through a port side door. The tail surfaces were fabric covered over a wooden structure, apart from the ply reinforced leading edge of the tailplane; they were straight edged and square topped. The tailplane was set at mid-fuselage height and the rudder, hinged at the elevator trailing edge, extended down to the keel. The L21 originally had a fixed undercarriage with solid plywood wheel without tyres, like those on the L15, mounted on an axle which passed through the fuselage on rubber blocks. To absorb vibrations when the engines were at full power for take-off, these wheels were then fitted with tyres but the final undercarriage arrangement had rubber tyred, spoked wheels on a single, faired, rubber sprung axle held below the fuselage by a pair of very short V struts to the lower longerons on each side. The L21 first flight was probably in the spring of 1925. Two were built but, despite its success at the Round Germany contest, it was not further developed or produced. One result of the low engine power which limited its appeal was that with one engine out it could not maintain altitude. Head-on view of the L21 Mercedes engine installation Operational history Flown by Bruno Loerzer, the L21 was the Class A winner in the Round Germany contest in June 1925. The low powered aircraft all proved much less reliable than those in the higher power classes but he covered , about 63% of the total distance, flown between 31 May and 9 June.. Because of engine changes he was accredited with flying only . The prize was 25,000 Goldmarks (worth ¬£1,250 in 1925). The two L20s came second and third and won another 25,000 Goldmark between them, all three aircraft also contributing to the award of first prize in the contest between German-engined aircraft to Mercedes.

The game released on 14 May 2015 for Microsoft Windows. A later update, which was built using the Chowdren runtime for Clickteam Fusion 2.5, introduced builds for OS X and Linux, on 30 September 2015. The PlayStation 4 version of the game released on 2 February 2016, with the PlayStation Vita version being cancelled. A Supper Sanzzy Edition, including a new extra campaign, was released on Xbox One by Team17 in May 2016, and on Nintendo Switch by Devolver Digital in August 2018.http://www.jeuxvideo.com/videos/896628/not-a-hero- disponible-sur-switch.htm  Plot  The anthropomorphic, purple rabbit BunnyLord has travelled back in time from 2048 to be elected as mayor to save the world as it is known from total destruction and alien invasion. During his candidateship, he needs to show the citizens why he should be elected and sets up freelance anti-heroes to clean up crime in the city under his name.  Gameplay  Not a Hero is a 2D side-scrolling cover-based shooter presented in a pixel art style. Players can choose one of nine protagonists at the start of each level, each with their own twists on the mechanics of the game. The player is equipped with a primary weapon that can be upgraded temporarily or for the rest of the level with various upgrades found on the map. The player can pick up special weapons, such as deployable turrets or, more bizarrely, exploding cats. The player is unable to jump but can slide, and is able to use this to take cover against objects in the game world or tackle enemies, leaving them open to an execution. The player can only sustain a few hits, but health is regenerated quickly. The objectives of each level vary, but they amount to accomplishing different tasks to promote BunnyLord's mayoral campaign, such as killing all criminals on the level, rescuing hostages or destroying drug production - each level also has three minor objectives to complete, with some randomness used to generate these. The game also boasts dynamic mid-level events, such as an attacking SWAT team or a helicopter gunship. The nine protagonists, in order of unlocking, include: Steve, a cockney assassin who wields a fast-reloading pistol; Cletus, a supposedly- Scottish hillbilly who uses a shotgun to blow enemies backwards and shoot doors open; Samantha, a fast Welsh woman who can reload and fire while moving; Jesus, a hip-thrusting SMG-wielder, can run fast and execute enemies while moving; Mike, a rapidly-moving alcoholic from St. Helens, with a powerful sawed-off shotgun; Stanley, a slow-moving and slow-reloading paramilitary soldier with a high-capacity rifle; Clive, a bumbling spy who can shoot and run, as well as shoot two guns at each side of the screen; Ronald Justice, a deranged superhero wielding a hammer and pistol and Kimmy, who can use a katana in conjunction with her SMG. Each have various modifiers upon their normal gameplay mechanics such as movement speed.  Development  Not a Hero was originally created under the title Ur Not a Hero by John Ribbins as a free indie game to accomplish his game list of ideas he made in 2012, which also included OlliOlli. Ur Not a Hero was released to on The Daily Click under the user name butterfingers on 10 January 2013. Although Not a Hero mostly relies on Ur Not a Hero, its mechanics are based on three games from John Ribbins' list: the cover-based shooter aspect, and with that the major aspect, comes from Ur Not a Hero, the indoor level design comes from his game Jeffrey Archer and BunnyLord's randomly generated sentences and sounds are from his game Hackathor. Roll7 later developed the game further, partnering up with ISO- Slant, a Clickteam Fusion add-on to make a 2D game appear 2¬ºD and to make one able to look around it using ISO-Slant glasses. This port was arranged by Roll7's artist Jake Hollands, making Not a Hero the first game to use ISO- Slant technology. The visual style developed for the game is a bright pixel art. In an interview, lead artist Hollands stated \\"I learned to create pixel art in the week before my interview at Roll7 and got much better at it whilst working on Not a Hero, but don't plan to return to it - I think that outside of a nostalgic choice there should be a good reason to use it\\". The game was later picked up by Devolver Digital, who had published OlliOlli as well. BunnyLord was later given his own Twitter account to post his ideas and opinions about politics, as well as parodying it. On 21 April 2015, Not a Hero was announced to be hacked, although it later turned out to be official demo being released. For that, the developer, Roll7, created a web page for the so- called UJIP Party, representing the opponent of BunnyLord, with advertisement video, information on why BunnyLord's \\"illegal immigration\\" should not be tolerated and a download for the game's \\"hacked\\" demo. On 1 May 2015, Roll7 announced that the game's release will be delayed one week, due to Jake Hollands wanting to implement 60 FPS into the game, as all previous version have run at 30 FPS. A later update, which was built using the Chowdren runtime for Clickteam Fusion 2.5 by MP2 Games, introduced builds for OS X and Linux on 30 September 2015. On 12 January 2016, it was announced that Not a Hero would be released for PlayStation 4 on 2 February 2016, with the PlayStation Vita version being officially cancelled later that day.

A powerful explosion at an unlicensed fireworks factory producing illegal fireworks killed eleven, injured one, and revealed the existence of the factory for the first time to law enforcement and the public. The initial explosion was heard more than away. The event gained national attention, covered by multiple media outlets, and triggered a federal investigation that eventually led to the conviction of a number of people including the owner, a man who was considered to be the mastermind, and several others from multiple states who conspired to manufacture, transport, and/or allow the fireworks manufactured at the operation to be transported. Investigators determined the factory to have been the largest and most profitable known illegal fireworks operation in US history. The disaster was the deadliest event in US history involving illegal fireworks. Background Webb's Bait Farm, located along Welcome Valley Road near an intersection with Reynolds Bridge Road and Pankey Lane in rural Polk County about south of Benton, grew and manufactured worms and other fishing bait and sold fishing equipment. It had been in operation since 1978 and was owned by Dan Lee Webb, aged 30 at the time of the disaster. In addition to the farm, Webb also owned a masonry business. In December 1982, Webb, Howard Emmett Bramblett of nearby Ocoee, and David Parks decided to start manufacturing M-80 and M-100 fireworks, which are banned by federal laws, in an old metal dairy barn on the farm. Webb reportedly chose to begin the operation to combat financial problems, but quickly chose to continue it after it became highly profitable. Bramblett, who owned a fireworks store in Benton, had reportedly taught Webb and Parks how to manufacture these fireworks and where to get the materials. He was considered by authorities to be the mastermind of the operation. Each fireworks case, which contained 1,440 individual fireworks, was sold for $160, with Bramblett, who was responsible for selling the fireworks, and John Franklin Miller, an Ohio fireworks manufacturer who was the primary supplier of materials and was responsible for soliciting customers, each receiving $10. Both men had a history of involvement with illegal fireworks, and had helped start other unlawful fireworks manufacturing operations, some of which exploded and killed workers. The factory employed several family members of Webb and Parks who were reportedly out of work at the time. The two-story barn that housed the factory consisted of a chemical mixing room on the first floor and an assembly room on the second floor. A former employee, whose mother and daughter were killed in the blast, stated that they were paid five dollars an hour in cash. Other relatives of the victims stated that the explosives were usually mixed by hand. Most employees were not aware of the dangers involved, and were not educated in safe working conditions. Between December 1982 and the date of the explosion, a total of 1,542,880 M-series fireworks were reported to have been manufactured at the factory and distributed to at least twelve states. The factory was determined to have accumulated a profit of about $1.25 million during its operation. At its peak, the factory ran a minimum of six days a week, employed between 12 and 14 people, and produced between 100 and 130 cases of fireworks a week. Months before the explosion, the Polk County Sheriff's Office, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) had received word of an illegal fireworks manufacturing operation in the area, but were uncertain of the location. Explosion and response  On May 27, 1983, at approximately 9:15 AM, eleven workers were on duty when a cache of M-80 and M-100 explosives, flash powder, and other chemicals in the barn detonated, producing a powerful explosion and instantly killing all eleven workers and leveling the barn. The initial blast was followed over the next several minutes by several smaller blasts which witnesses described as sounding like shotguns, believed to have been from individual firework cases which were not detonated initially. Dan Lee Webb's cousin Tommy Webb, who was mowing the grass near the site, was reported to have been thrown more than . The blast also threw debris as far as from the site, and produced a shock wave that leveled trees as far as away. The force of the blast shattered windows in several homes and other structures on nearby properties, which reportedly resulted in some neighbors receiving minor cut wounds. Parts of bodies were hurled through the roofs of the nearby house and carport and as far away as from the site. Nothing in the barn was left intact; all of the bodies had lost limbs and six were decapitated. Some were stripped by the force of the blast. Several witnesses claimed to have seen a white mushroom cloud which was estimated to be tall, and the blast was heard and felt in Cleveland over away. Several 911 calls were received moments after the initial blast, and within minutes, several police units arrived at the scene. Webb's wife Linda Sue, who was in the house at the time, fled before deputies arrived. Tommy Webb, who was critically injured, was taken to Erlanger Medical Center in Chattanooga with burns to about 35 percent of his body. Crews from the ATF and TBI arrived later to investigate the cause of the explosion. A Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) crew, which included forensic anthropologist William M. Bass of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, later arrived on the scene to identify the victims. Investigation Authorities were unable to determine the cause of the explosion, but concluded that it probably occurred while explosives were being mixed. The charred remains of an electric drill with a paint-stirring attachment were found, and it was suggested that a spark from the drill's motor reached the mixture. A cigarette lighter and three packs of cigarettes were also found at the site, which investigators determined could have caused the ignition of highly explosive vapors that were byproducts of the manufacturing process. Other possible theories of the cause include the scraping of boots on the floor and sparking from an electrical wire. TEMA later identified the dead as Faye Trentham (38), daughter Tanya Trentham (19), Doris Burns Longmire (38), David Nelce Webb (21, brother of Dan Lee Webb), Sybil Duggan (34), William Lee Burns (38), Beatrice Webb (51, mother of Dan Lee Webb), Dixie Freeman (21), David Parks (38) and his wife Judy (45), and Albert Kenneth Johnson (52, uncle of Dan Lee Webb). Authorities found a cache of about 30 to 40 boxes of unexploded fireworks worth about $20,000 and six 55-gallon steel drums full of chemical explosives in a nearby trailer. Federal firearms agents also found a firework case eight to ten inches in length and three to four inches in diameter which, due to the large size, prompted Polk County deputies to speculate that some of the explosives were being purchased by people with criminal intents, such as terrorists. They were buried in the ground on the farm and later detonated in an open pit in nearby Copperhill having been used as evidence in Webb's trial. A total of 172 cases of fireworks were found. The farm was also found to be guarded by an elaborate security system which consisted of surveillance cameras, electric fences, alarms, guard dogs, and warning signs. Polk County Sheriff Frank Payne told reporters that he thought that they were gearing up for the Fourth of July. Polk County police and multiple media outlets interviewed several people living near the farm. One man, who did not know about the fireworks operation, stated that he had wondered how the farm employed as many people as they did raising worms. One neighbor said that the blast shattered his windows and blew sheetrock off his ceiling. He had been told three months before by the Webbs that they did not want his children to go near the barn. Another neighbor said that he had heard one large blast followed by several smaller blasts over the course of about 20 minutes. The initial blast shattered glass in his living room. Sheriff Payne, a Vietnam War veteran, said that he \\"hadn't seen anything like this since Vietnam,\\" and equated the explosion to a direct hit from a powerful bomb. Many of the friends and relatives of the victims interviewed stated that they did not know about the operation and were surprised to learn of it.  Aftermath  Dan Lee Webb, who had been in Lansing, Illinois, delivering 86,400 M-80s during the event, surrendered at the Polk County Jail two days later. He was charged with eleven counts of involuntary manslaughter and illegally manufacturing and possessing explosives and jailed with a $300,000 bond. Linda Sue Webb was held on $50,000 bail as a material witness. She told her defense attorney that she believed that her husband was in the New York-New Jersey area at the time of the blast. On April 19, 1984, Dan Lee Webb received a ten-year federal prison sentence for manufacturing explosives without a license. On May 1, 1984, he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter charges and received a ten-year prison sentence. He served it concurrently with the federal sentence and in addition was fined $10,000. Bramblett was arrested two days later in nearby Chatsworth, Georgia, after cases of M-80 fireworks were found in two locations in Murray County. He was extradited to the Polk County Jail. A federal court jury convicted him and another man on May 3, 1984 of one count of manufacturing illegal fireworks, one of conspiracy, and one of storing the homemade explosives. He was sentenced to ten years in prison in July 1984 for his role in a similar incident that occurred on May 24, 1983, in Rowesville, South Carolina, in which an explosion at an illegal fireworks operation killed two and injured five. On August 27, 1985, twenty men from nine different states, including Bramblett, were indicted on federal charges for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the illegal fireworks made at the farm to as many as twelve states including Tennessee, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Fifteen others were charged with transporting the fireworks or causing them to be transported. On June 25, 1986, four men, including Bramblett, Miller, and two others involved were found guilty by a jury of conspiracy in the operation. A few weeks later on July 7, a U.S. District Court Judge handed Bramblett a ten-year sentence for one count of participating in the illegal manufacture of explosives, concurrent ten-year terms for fifteen counts of causing illegal fireworks to be transported across state lines, and one count of illegally dealing in explosives. He served them concurrently with his 1984 sentence. A chapter of American author Jon Jefferson's 2007 non-fiction book Beyond the Body Farm, coauthored with Dr. Bass, is about Bass' investigation of the event. A segment about the event is also included in Tennessee Tragedies: Natural, Technological, and Societal Disasters in the Volunteer State, a 2012 book by former TEMA official Allen R. Coggins.

Among all the sexual vertebrates, the only examples of true parthenogenesis, in which all- female populations reproduce without the involvement of males, are found in squamate reptiles (snakes and lizards). There are about 50 species of lizard and 1 species of snake that reproduce solely through parthenogenesis (obligate parthenogenesis).Vitt, Laurie J., and Janalee P. Caldwell. Herpetology: an introductory biology of amphibians and reptiles. Academic Press, 2013. It is unknown how many sexually reproducing species are also capable of parthenogenesis in the absence of males (facultative parthenogenesis), but recent research has revealed that this ability is widespread among squamates.  Mechanisms  Parthenogenesis can result from either full cloning of the mother's genome, or through the combination of haploid genomes to create a \\"half-clone\\". Both mechanisms of parthenogenesis are seen in reptiles. = Full-cloning = Females can produce full clones of themselves through a modification of the normal meiosis process used to produce haploid egg cells for sexual reproduction. The female's germ cells undergo a process of premeiotic genome doubling, or endoreduplication, so that two consecutive division cycles in the process of meiosis result in a diploid, rather than haploid, genome. Whereas homologous chromosomes pair and separate during meiosis I in sexual species, identical duplicate sister chromosomes, produced through premeiotic replication, pair and separate during meiosis I in true parthenotes. Pairing of identical sister chromosomes, in comparison to the alternative of pairing homologous chromosomes, maintains heterozygosity in obligate parthenotes. Meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids in both sexual and parthenogenetic species. This method of parthenogenesis is observed in obligate parthenotes, such as lizards in the genus Cnemidophorus and Lacerta, and also in certain facultative parthenotes like the Burmese python. = Half-cloning = Another mechanism typically observed in facultative parthenote reptiles is terminal fusion, in which a haploid polar body produced as a byproduct of normal female meiosis fuses with the egg cell to form a diploid nucleus, much as a haploid sperm cell fuses its nucleus with that of an egg cell to form a diploid genome during sexual reproduction. This method of parthenogenesis produces offspring that are homozygous at nearly all genetic loci, and inherit approximately half of their mother's genetic diversity. This form of parthenogenesis can produce male as well as WW- genotype females. Because the meiosis process proceeds normally in species employing this mechanism, they are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction, as in the Komodo dragon and several species of snakes. The process of meiosis in sexually reproducing females leads to the production of an egg cell as well as a haploid polar body, which can fuse nuclei with the egg cell to allow facultative parthenogenesis  Types of parthenogenesis  = True parthenogenesis = \\"True\\" parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction in all-female species that produce offspring without any male involvement.  Lizards  There are at least eight parthenogenetic species of Caucasian rock lizard in the genus Lacerta.Darevskii IS. 1967. Rock lizards of the Caucasus: systematics, ecology and phylogenesis of the polymorphic groups of Caucasian rock lizards of the subgenus Archaeolacerta. Nauka: Leningrad [in Russian: English translation published by the Indian National Scientific Documentation Centre, New Delhi, 1978].Tarkhnishvili DN (2012) Evolutionary History, Habitats, Diversification, and Speciation in Caucasian Rock Lizards. In: Advances in Zoology Research, Volume 2 (ed. Jenkins OP), Nova Science Publishers, Hauppauge (NY), p.79-120 This genus is unique in containing the only known monoclonal parthenogenetic species, Lacerta rostombekovi, where the entire species originates from a single hybridization event. In all other cases of unisexual reptilian species that have been examined, multiple separate asexual lineages are present. As true parthenotes, Lacerta do not require stimulation from sperm to reproduce. The best-known and perhaps most evolutionarily derived example of parthenogenesis in reptiles occurs within the Teiid genus of whiptail lizards known as Cnemidophorus. This genus contains at least 13 truly parthenogenetic species, which originate from hybridization events between sexual Cnemidophorus species.Moore, Michael C., Joan M. Whittier, and David Crews. \\"Sex steroid hormones during the ovarian cycle of an all-female, parthenogenetic lizard and their correlation with pseudosexual behavior.\\" General and comparative endocrinology 60.2 (1985): 144-153. Parthenogenetic whiptails are unusual in that they engage in female-female courtship to induce ovulation, with one non- ovulating female engaging in courting behavior normally seen in males while the ovulating female assumes the typical female role. While sex hormone levels in parthenogenetic Cnemidophorus uniparens mimic the cycles seen in their sexual relatives, their nervous systems appear to have evolved unique responses to female sex hormones. Male-like behavior in C. uniparens is correlated with high progesterone levels. This female-female pseudocopulation has also been found to enhance fecundity. A triploid parthenogenetic species in the genus Aspidoscelis, formerly part of Cnemidophorus, has been fertilized with sperm from a sexual species in the same genus to produce a new tetraploid parthenogenetic species in laboratory experiments. Such experiments provide evidence that even truly parthenogenetic species are still capable of incorporating new genetic material and may therefore be capable of evolution. There are six parthenogenetic gecko species in five genera: Hemidactylus garnotii (Indo-Pacific house gecko), Hemidactylus vietnamensis (Vietnamese house gecko), Hemiphyllodactylus typus (dwarf tree gecko), Heteronotia binoei (Binoe‚Äôs gecko), Nactus pelagicus (pelagic gecko), and Lepidodactylus lugubris (mourning gecko). The often quoted parthenogeneetic species N. arnouxi is nomen rejectum (ICZN 1991) and therefore a synonym of N. pelagicus, while Gehyra ogasawarisimae is a misidentified L. lugubris. The gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris is a parthenogenetic species also known to engage in female-female copulation. The species consists of a number of clonal genetic lineages thought to arise from different hybridization events. Surprisingly, parthenogenetic females of this species occasionally produce male offspring, which are thought to be the result of non-genetic hormonal inversions. While these males are anatomically normal, they produce abnormal sperm and are sterile. Parthenotes are also found in two species of the night lizard genus Lepidophyma. Unlike most parthenogenetic reptiles, Lepidophyma lizards show very low genetic heterozygosity, suggesting a non-hybrid origin.  Snakes  The brahminy blindsnake is a triploid obligate parthenote and the only snake species known to be obligately parthenogenetic.Wynn, Addison H., Charles J. Cole, and Alfred L. Gardner. \\"Apparent triploidy in the unisexual brahminy blind snake, Ramphotyphlops braminus. American Museum Novitates no. 2868.\\" (1987). = Facultative parthenogenesis = A juvenile male komodo dragon, Varanus komodoensis, at the Chester Zoo. Females of the species can occasionally, reproduce through parthenogenesis Facultative parthenogenesis is the type of parthenogenesis when a female individual can reproduce via both sexual and asexual reproduction.Bell, G. (1982). The Masterpiece of Nature: The Evolution and Genetics of Sexuality, University of California Press, Berkeley, pp. 1- 635 (see page 295). Females can produce viable offspring with or without genetic contribution from a male, and such an ability may, just like true parthenogens, enable colonization of new habitats by single female animals. Facultative parthenogenesis is extremely rare in nature, with only a few examples of animal taxa capable of facultative parthenogenesis, of which none are vertebrate taxa. Facultative parthenogenesis is often incorrectly used to describe cases of accidental or spontaneous parthenogenesis in normally sexual animals, including many examples in squamata. For example, many cases of accidental parthenogenesis in sharks, some snakes, Komodo dragons and a variety of domesticated birds were widely perpetuated as facultative parthenogenesis. These cases should, however, be considered accidental parthenogenesis, given the frequency of asexually produced eggs and their hatching rates are extremely low, in contrast to true facultative parthenogenesis where the majority of asexually produced eggs hatch. In addition, asexually produced offspring in vertebrates exhibit extremely high levels of sterility, highlighting that this mode of reproduction is not adaptive. The occurrence of such asexually produced eggs in sexual animals can be explained by a meiotic error, leading to automictically produced eggs.Suomalainen E. et al. (1987). Cytology and Evolution in Parthenogenesis, Boca Raton, CRC Press = Gynogenesis = Gynogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction in which female eggs are activated by male sperm, but no male genetic material is contributed to offspring. While this mode of reproduction has not been observed in reptiles, it occurs in several salamander species of the genus Ambystoma. = Hybridogenesis = Hybridogenesis is a variation of parthenogenesis in which males mate with females, but only the mother's genetic material is propagated by these offspring to their own young. While this form of reproduction has not been observed in reptiles, it does occur in frogs of the genus Pelophylax.  Evolution  Cnemidophorus neomexicanus is unusual in being a diploid parthenote, produced as a result of hybridization between C. inornatus (left) and C. tigris (right)Lowe, Charles H., and John W. Wright. \\"Evolution of parthenogenetic species of Cnemidophorus (whiptail lizards) in western North America.\\" Journal of the Arizona Academy of Science (1966): 81-87. = Origin = In all parthenogenetic reptile species studied to date, chromosomal evidence supports the theory that parthenogenesis arose through a hybridization event, although members of the genus Lepidophyma may be exceptions to this rule. The original hybridization event is believed to occur between two related species and is often followed by backcrossing to either parent species to create triploid parthenogenetic offspring. As no crosses of two sexual species in captivity have ever produced parthenogenetic offspring, it is unclear how a hybridization event would actually lead to asexual reproduction. It is possible that parthenogenesis evolved as a way of overcoming sterility due to improper chromosomal pairing and segregation during meiosis in hybrids, and that rare hybrid individuals that could premeiotically duplicate their chromosomes could escape hybrid sterility by reproducing through parthenogenesis. The ability to premeiotically duplicate chromosomes would be selected for in this scenario as it would be the only option for successful reproduction. = Selective advantage = While it is often assumed that parthenogenesis is an inferior evolutionary strategy to sexual reproduction because parthenogenetic species lack the ability to complement genetic mutations through outcrossing or are unable to incorporate new genetic material, research on parthenogenetic species has gradually revealed a number of advantages to this mode of reproduction. Triploid unisexual geckos of the species Heteronotia binoei have greater endurance and aerobic capacity than their diploid ancestors, and this advantage may be the result of polyploidy and a form of hybrid vigor. It has also been observed that obligate parthenotes are often found at high altitudes and in sparse or marginal habitats, a pattern known as \\"geographical parthenogenesis,\\" and their distribution in suboptimal territories may be a result of their increased colonization ability. A single parthenogenetic individual can colonize a new territory and produce offspring, while for a sexual species multiple individuals would need to occupy a new habitat and come into contact with each other for mating in order for successful colonization to occur. A parthenogenetic species can undergo a more rapid population increase than a sexual species because all parthenotes are female and produce offspring, while in sexual species half of all individuals are males and do not give birth to offspring. Additionally, laboratory experiments have revealed that even obligate parthenotes retain the capability of incorporating new genetic material through sexual reproduction to form new parthenogenetic lineages, and the ability to outcross on occasion may explain the lengthy evolutionary persistence of some parthenogenetic species.

The first storm of the 2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it developed over the Bay of Bengal on May 10\\\\. Favorable environmental conditions allowed the system to intensify steadily while moving northwestward. The storm reached peak maximum sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) on May 13, making it a very severe cyclonic storm according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the basin. The cyclone drifted north over the central Bay of Bengal, gradually weakening due to heightened wind shear. Turning eastward, the storm deteriorated to a deep depression on May 16 before it curved northeastward and re-intensified into a cyclonic storm. It came ashore in western Myanmar and dissipated over land the following day. In the wake of prolonged precipitation during the first half of May, the cyclone produced torrential rains across southwest Sri Lanka while stationary in the central Bay of Bengal. The storm drew extensive moisture that coalesced in the mountainous portion of the island. A station at Ratnapura recorded of rainfall in 18 hours on May 17, including in one hour. In southwestern Sri Lanka, the rainfall caused flooding and landslides that destroyed 24,750 homes and damaged 32,426 others, displacing about 800,000 people. Overall damage totaled about $135 million (2003 USD), and there were 260 deaths. The cyclone also produced some rainfall in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India and along the country's eastern coast. The storm funneled moisture away from the mainland, which possibly contributed to a heat wave that killed 1,900 people, and dropped heavy rainfall in Myanmar. Meteorological history Around May 6, the monsoon trough extended across the southern Bay of Bengal, producing a vast field of thunderstorm activity. A broad low-pressure area formed by the next day and remained nearly stationary. Over the next few days, the convection varied in intensity until becoming more organized around the nascent surface low on May 10. At 03:00 UTC on May 10, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported the formation of a depression about 535 km (330 mi) west of Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Within nine hours, the depression further intensified into a deep depression. Around the same time, the system was classified as Tropical Cyclone 01B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. With warm sea surface temperatures, a formidable anticyclone aloft, and low wind shear, the system continued to mature as it tracked northwestward. Early on May 11, the deep depression strengthened into a cyclonic storm ‚Äì marked by maximum sustained winds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) ‚Äì and later in the day into a severe cyclonic storm. Simultaneously, the system was driven toward the north by a ridge of high pressure to the northeast. At the time, the cyclone was located about east of Sri Lanka. The storm continued to intensify, becoming a very severe cyclonic storm on May 12. That day, the JTWC upgraded Tropical Cyclone 01B to the equivalence of a minimal hurricane with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). In post-season analysis, however, the agency revised the storm's maximum winds to 110 km/h (70 mph). At 06:00 UTC on May 13, the IMD estimated that the storm attained peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). The intensity estimate was based on a satellite-derived Dvorak number of 4.5, limited chiefly by the lack of an eye feature. After peaking in intensity, the storm began weakening due to increasing easterly wind shear from the ridge to the north, displacing the center of circulation from the deepest convection. Early on May 14, the IMD downgraded the storm to a severe cyclonic storm. Around this time, steering currents slackened, and the cyclone meandered northward over the central Bay of Bengal. By late on May 14, convection had largely dissipated, with the exception of a small area near the center, and the system weakened to minimal cyclonic storm status. Thunderstorm activity continued to wax and wane as the storm turned to the southeastward, though persistent hostile conditions caused the storm to weaken further to a deep depression on May 16\\\\. As the nearby ridge translated eastward, the depression was able to move more steadily to the east and later to the northeast, passing northwest of the Andaman Islands on May 18. On the next day, the deep depression re-intensified into a cyclonic storm, reaching a secondary peak with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). At about 10:00 UTC on May 19, the storm made landfall close to Kyaukpyu, Ramree Island, in western Myanmar. The storm rapidly weakened into a depression and later degenerated into a low pressure area on May 20, and was no longer discernible on satellite imagery by the next day. Preparations and impact =Sri Lanka= Location map of Sri Lanka Due to the significant distance between Sri Lanka and the Bay of Bengal storm, no cyclone warnings were posted. The India-based National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting anticipated the flood event three days in advance. However, the Sri Lankan government did not issue the first flood warnings until May 17, the same day that the flooding began. Many residents learned about the impending floods through loudspeakers and word of mouth, although some were alerted by television or radio. About 8,000 people evacuated on May 18, utilizing schools and public buildings as emergency shelters. The precipitation occurred in the wake of an already rainy period; a station near the Kalu River reported over of rainfall in the first 15 days of May. While the storm was nearly stationary in the central Bay of Bengal, the southwesterly flow drew abundant moisture over Sri Lanka to produce severe flooding. In the island's mountainous southwestern portion, the winds across the island produced heavy rainfall rates through a process known as orographic lift, mostly occurring on May 17-18\\\\. Throughout May 2003, the highest rainfall in the country was at Gonapenigala Iranganie Estate. A station at Ratnapura recorded of precipitation in the month, of which fell over an 18‚Äëhour period on May 17; at the same station, there was a peak hourly rainfall total of . These were the heaviest rains on the island since 1947. Rainfall was primarily concentrated in southwestern Sri Lanka, with a rain shadow farther inland that resulted in minimal precipitation in and Matale. After the Kalu River overflowed, floodwaters reached deep in Ratnapura City, submerging the first floors of most homes and persisting for about three days. Landslides created a temporary natural dam on the river that washed away a bridge when it broke. Along the Gin River, flood waters inundated the surrounding terrain up to deep, covered roadways, and complicated evacuations. In Hambantota District, the inundation occurred after an ongoing drought, which amplified flood-related damage. Although the flooding was severe in the southwestern portion of Sri Lanka, effects were minimal in the central and north-central regions, and there was no severe flooding in the capital city of Colombo. Since the previously wet conditions had saturated soils, the rains related to the cyclone caused severe flooding and landslides, mostly in Ratnapura and Nuwara Eliya districts. A landslide in Batugoda killed 81 people, and at least 125 people died in Ratnapura. The floods increased river levels in Hambantota, Matara, Galle, and Kalutara districts, persisting until May 30 in Matara. Many roads were damaged, including the one that links Ratnapura to Colombo. About 100 schools were destroyed and another 200 were damaged, and some health facilities lost their equipment. Flooding from the cyclone destroyed of tea crops, representing an estimated 20-30% loss for the year in the low country. Farmers in the affected areas also lost some of their rice paddies to the high waters, although only about 3% of the rice crop in the region was damaged, so no impact on the rice harvest was expected. Many areas lost electricity and telephone service, and there were disruptions to food and water supplies. Throughout Sri Lanka, the floods destroyed at least 24,750 homes and damaged 32,426 others, displacing about 800,000 people, many of whom lost everything they owned. Total damage was estimated at $135 million (2003 USD), primarily to homes and roads. Across the island, floods related to the cyclone killed 260 people. Most of the deaths were along the nation's southern coast where the floods occurred, primarily along the Kalu River, and were mainly farmers. Levees helped drain floodwaters where systems were already in place. =Elsewhere= In its formative stages, the storm produced moderate rainfall in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, totaling at Mayabunder. Later, as the storm was approaching Myanmar, it dropped of rainfall on Hut Bay. Several stations in Tamil Nadu reported light precipitation, including a total of at Adirampattinam. Along the coast of Odisha, the fringes of the cyclonic storm dropped light rainfall, reaching at Swampatna. As the storm made landfall in Myanmar, it produced heavy rainfall in Rakhine State, signalling an early start to the monsoon season. The slow movement of the storm altered the atmospheric flow over southeastern India. According to the IMD, the cyclone \\"might have caused the severe heat wave conditions prevailing over the coastal Andhra Pradesh\\" from May into early June, killing up to 1,400 people, and increasing air temperatures to . Aftermath Satellite-derived precipitation rates related to the storm from May 15‚Äì19; Sri Lanka is in the bottom center with the highest totals in a dark shade of red In the immediate aftermath of the flooding in Sri Lanka, the country's air force, army, and navy, as well as police forces, operated search and rescue missions. The navy and air force collected residents stranded in trees and on roofs, and were later assisted by the Indian military. However, the lack of electricity and the damaged infrastructure hampered relief work. In the hardest hit area of Ratnapura, there was a shortage of doctors, prompting officials to request help from adjacent towns. There were increased reports of diarrhea, viral flu, and typhoid in the aftermath of the floods. Mobile health crews treated over 44,000 residents, which helped reduce the spread of disease. Residents in one village went without food for three days, and in the storm's aftermath, many were also without access to clean water. By May 19, flooding had begun to recede in the worst affected areas, allowing workers to repair roads. The government released RS6 million (LKR, US$62,500) for immediate relief, and also provided RS15,000 (LKR, US$156) toward funeral expenses for each death. From May 22-25, the country's legislature had reduced sessions so members could return to their districts. By the end of May 2003, the government had allocated RS17.29 million (LKR, US$180,000) for relief measures, including RS27,000 (LKR US$280) for each family to rebuild houses. The Sri Lankan government also set up a four-person task force to manage flood relief. The local Red Cross chapter utilized emergency supplies to distribute 10,000 food packages while also deploying trained volunteers to assist in the disaster areas. The Red Cross ultimately distributed about 26,000 loaves of bread, of sugar, and of rice, among other supplies. By May 20, the Sri Lankan air force had distributed 35 tons of food, using eight helicopters to airdrop parcels. Red Cross workers cleaned hundreds of contaminated wells in the region, thereby restoring clean water access; this task was finished by August. By May 16, or nine days after the floods began, power was restored to about 95% of areas, and roads were gradually rebuilt. Road access to most villages was restored by May 26, with the exception of Matara. There, the ongoing floods prompted officials to close schools to reduce the spread of disease. After the floods largely subsided, the World Socialist Web Site criticized the Sri Lankan government for not having better disaster management in place, as well as noting that deforestation and gem mining contributed to the landslides. A Red Cross report in August 2003 noted the swift work to bring relief to the affected citizens, while also commenting that the floods displayed the country's problems with disaster mitigation. On May 19, the Red Cross launched an appeal to the international community for assistance. A day prior, the Red Cross allocated CHF50,000 to buy relief supplies, while the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided a $50,000 grant. In the days after the floods, the government of India sent a ship with inflatable dinghies and medical supplies. A total of 18 countries or local Red Crosses sent Fr.2.3 million CHF worth of cash to Sri Lanka. Sweden sent kr800,000 (2003 SEK) toward relief transport and distribution. The government of Japan sent ¬•19.8 million yen worth of tents, sheets, and other supplies to the country, The Iranian Red Cross sent $65,625 (USD) worth of blankets and tents to Sri Lanka, which helped about 240 families. Australia's government sent about $400,000 (AUD) to UNICEF to help rebuild the damaged schools and other social services. The European Community Humanitarian Aid Office donated about ‚Ç¨800,000 (US$944,000) to the country. The World Food Programme distributed meals to about 10,000 families, while the World Health Organization provided water purification tablets, typhoid vaccines, and health kits to about 100,000 people. During a peace agreement amid the ongoing civil war, the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka sent trucks with clothing and food to the affected areas. In July 2004, the Asian Development Bank provided $12.5 million of the $17.5 million needed to repair the damaged infrastructure, while the Sri Lankan government provided the remaining $5 million.

An outside right, Rogers appeared for Swansea Town in the abandoned 1939‚Äì40 Football League season, and played non-league football for Weston Rhyn, Llanerch Celts, Chirk, and Oswestry Town. Internationally, Rogers was capped for the Wales Amateur XI and played twice for his country in wartime internationals. Life and career Rogers was born in Chirk, Wales, on 15 October 1909. His younger brother Joe also played League football, for Manchester City and Shrewsbury Town. Rogers played football in Wales for Weston Rhyn, Llanerch Celts, Chirk and Oswestry Town. He represented his country in an amateur international against Scotland in March 1934, and earned himself a reputation as \\"one of the finest Welsh amateur wingers playing [in the 1933‚Äì34] season\\", before turning professional with Football League Third Division North club Wrexham in May. By mid-season he had scored twice from eleven league appearances. He signed for Arsenal in January 1935, and, with Joe Hulme and Alf Kirchen both injured, played in the last five First Division matches of the 1934‚Äì35 season. He scored twice on his debut, in an 8‚Äì0 win at home to Middlesbrough, and two matches later, was a member of the team that won 1‚Äì0 in the reverse fixture to ensure Arsenal won the 1934‚Äì35 Football League titletheir third in a row. He played intermittently during the latter part of the following season, sometimes on the left wing rather than his more normal right, and took his appearance total to 16, all in league competition. He scored another three times, including both goals in a 2‚Äì0 home win against Middlesbrough. Rogers signed for Second Division club Newcastle United in June 1936 for a ¬£2,500 fee. He played in 38 matches in his first season, scoring 8 goals, but appeared in only 13 in the following campaign and just 5 in 1938‚Äì39. He joined Swansea Town in May 1939, and made three appearances before the 1939‚Äì40 Football League season was abandoned when war broke out. During the war, Rogers served in the Royal Air Force and made guest appearances for clubs including Everton and Lovells Athletic. He played twice for his country in wartime internationals, both against England, in 1941 at Cardiff and in 1944 at Liverpool. He rejoined Wrexham between his two international appearances, and played once for them in the post-war Football Leagueat the age of nearly 38before returning to Oswestry Town. After retiring as a player, Rogers returned to his native Chirk, where he worked as a newsagent and coached at his former club. He died in the town on 25 January 1996 at the age of 86.

These and similar issues are dealt with in the book Dance with Chance: Making Luck Work for You (co-authored with Robin Hogarth and Anil Gaba) and in a special issue of the International Journal of Forecasting on ‚ÄúDecision Making and Planning Under Low Levels of Predictability‚Äù (co-edited with Nassim Taleb). Contributions to forecasting =Empirical testing of forecasting accuracy through competitions and time series compilation= A 1979 paper by Makridakis and Hibon compared 111 time series from a variety of different sources in order to determine the relative accuracy of different forecasting methods, and came to the conclusion that simple methods, such as exponential smoothing, outperformed complicated ones. This was followed with publication of results from three Makridakis Competitions: the M-competition in 1982, the M-2 competition in 1993, and the M-3 competition in 2000. =Service to the forecasting community= Apart from organizing the Makridakis Competitions, Makridakis was one of the founders and the first editor-in-chief of the Journal of Forecasting and the International Journal of Forecasting, a publication of the International Institute of Forecasters (he was editor-in- chief from 1982 to 1987). =Books and popular articles= Professor Makridakis has authored, or co-authored, twenty-four books and more than 270 articles.

History On February 3, 1821,Buch \\"Geschichte der Stadtsparkasse Dresden\\", 1996 the first savings bank was opened in the city of Dresden. The second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century were determined by modernization and growth spurts. Saxony became the driving motor for the industrialization of Germany and the bank benefited from rising wages and increasing demand for credit. With the incorporations around the turn of the century numerous new district branches were opened, more professional management structure and staff training and cashless payment was enabled. After a brief dip in the years of inflation, the real wage in 1923 stabilized again, as well as the account balance of the bank. The global economic crisis of 1929 and the Second World War along with the 1945 bombing of Dresden all led to deep crises in the bank. After the partition of Germany and the establishment of the East Germany the bank became part of the socialist planned economy for the next 40 years. In 1986, the bank's first ATM was set up at the G√ºntzplatz branch. Organization As a public institution, the Osts√§chsische Sparkasse Dresden is subject to the legal bases of the Savings Bank Act of the Free State of Saxony and the Articles of Association adopted by the Board of the Savings Bank.

It is aired at Am√©rica TV channel since 2013. Premise The program started as an Archive television program, focused on the Argentine show business. It was hosted by Santiago del Moro, who was already working in Infama. As a summer season program, it had a light approach to all topics at that point. They sought a personal style to endure the upcoming start of the 2013 season of Showmatch, and focused instead in politics. It became a talk show, using archived footage only to introduce the topics of discussion. Del Moro, however, rejected the usual format of political TV programs, and kept a style similar to video clips: each person in the studios talk for a limited time and someone else talks then, and topics are halted abruptly to introduce new ones. The program includes people from all sides of the political spectrum, and Moro tries to grant everyone equal speaking time.

Created as a merger of several historic neighborhoods including Merriam Park, Snelling-Hamline, and Lexington-Hamline, it is bordered by University Avenue on the north, Lexington Parkway on the east, Summit Avenue on the south, and the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area on the west. History The first area of Union Park to be settled is the area known as Merriam Park, named after John L. Merriam, a local real estate investor and entrepreneur. Merriam Park was one of the city's first streetcar suburbs, growing around a depot on what is now the Canadian Pacific Railway's Merriam Park Subdivision. Merriam envisioned the neighborhood, located approximately midway between downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis, as a natural home for the two cities' elite. Although the area was considered in the late nineteenth century for both the Cathedral of Saint Paul and the Minnesota State Capitol, these plans did not come to pass, and the area developed as a home for businessmen and professional workers and their families. Streetcar lines along Marshall Avenue (which becomes Lake Street in Minneapolis), Selby Avenue, and Snelling Avenue helped propel development in the neighborhood, which grew a tightly- knit and largely Catholic community around St. Mark's Church. The neighborhood remained stable into the middle part of the twentieth century, when plans to build a section of Interstate 94 through the neighborhood drew intense community activism. Although the freeway was ultimately built along the original alignment, the fight galvanized the formation of the area's strong neighborhood organizations, many of which continue to operate to this day. Neighborhood activism against the freeway was focused against plans to construct an interchange for southbound Interstate 94 at Prior Avenue, a largely residential street at the center of the district which fronted parks, schools, and St. Mark's Church. Because of the area's upper-middle class character, the neighborhood was more successful in pushing its goals than the Rondo and Prospect Park neighborhoods to the east and west, respectively, both of which were largely inhabited by people of more mixed socioeconomic status. Local leaders enlisted to help fight the interchange included Archbishop William Brady and Senators Hubert Humphrey and Eugene McCarthy. Until 2007, the area was divided into three neighborhood organizations which represented areas substantially smaller than those represented by most of the other 16 district councils. In order to provide more equitable funding citywide, the three neighborhoods were merged into one entity, which took the name Union Park. The nonprofit which represents Union Park today retains substantial representation from these previous groups, most of which remain active. Name Union Park in 1886 The original Union Park was a large recreational area located at the intersection of University and Lynnhurst Avenues in Saint Paul, Minnesota.AIA guide to the Twin Cities by Larry Millett, (St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2007) p. 502. Also known as Lake Iris Park,Lake Iris Park mnhs.org. Retrieved 04/19/14. it opened in 1880 shortly after the completion of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad‚Äôs \\"Short Line\\" route. The grounds of the park included a bowling alley, bandstand, dance hall, carousel, zoo and observation tower. By 1884 the amusement park had closed, and the property was divided into residential lots. The resulting neighborhood was also called Union Park.The street where you live: a guide to the place names of St. Paul by Donald Empson, (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2006) p. 273. All that remains of Lake Iris is the present- day Iris Park, a small public space with an artificial pond. Transportation The METRO Green Line light rail, which opened on June 14, 2014, serves the neighborhood with stops on University Avenue at Fairview Avenue, Snelling Avenue, Hamline Avenue, and Lexington Parkway. The A Line bus rapid transit system also runs along Snelling Avenue through the district.

The project allows users to virtually explore such former districts and landmarks in Vancouver as Hogan's Alley and the original Hotel Vancouver, in year 1948. Circa 1948 is set in two distinctly different neighbourhoods: West End, Vancouver, which was a wealthier district, home to many veterans back from the war, and East Vancouver, which was, in the words of Douglas, \\"basically an ethnic slum where the laws of the city had been suspended. There was bootlegging, gambling, prostitution. Even the mayor would go there to party.\\" The project was originally pitched to the NFB as a film noir feature by Douglas and screenwriter Chris Haddock, but evolved into a non-linear work based on Douglas' expertise in that field as well as that of the NFB's digital studio, which had produced such works as Bear 71. Douglas has also stated that his initial concept had been for site specific installations in Vancouver but the NFB, with its mandate to create works accessible to all Canadians, encouraged him to rethink the project as an app and movable immersive experience. Douglas, who lives in Vancouver, researched the project with maps and photos, which were digitally converted by the NFB into an explorable virtual world, using Autodesk Maya. Kevin Kerr wrote the narration for the project. Approximately 20 Vancouver-based character actors provided voices. Release The app was launched on April 22, 2014, followed one day later by the installation, at the Tribeca Film Festival. The installation premiered in the Greater Vancouver area in the fall of 2015 at the downtown campus of Simon Fraser University (SFU) from September 18 to October 16, followed by SFU's Surrey campus, from October 27 to November 13.
