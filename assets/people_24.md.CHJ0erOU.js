Stan (born December 31, 1956) is an American woman who was kidnapped and held as a sex slave by Cameron and Janice Hooker in their Red Bluff, California, home for over seven years, between 1977 and 1984. At Cameron Hooker's trial, Stan's experience was described as unparalleled in FBI history. Her case has received international publicity, and has been the subject of multiple books, films, and television series. Kidnapping In 1977, Colleen Stan was hitchhiking from her home in Eugene, Oregon, to a friend's home in northern California, where she was heading to a birthday party. Cameron Hooker (born November 5, 1953) kidnapped 20 year-old Stan after picking her up. Stan stated that she was an experienced hitchhiker and had allowed two rides to go past before accepting the ride with Hooker. She reportedly \\"felt confident climbing into the blue van\\",(Woollard p. 5) because Hooker's wife, Janice, and their baby were in the car. When they stopped at a gas station along the way, Stan went to use the restroom. \\"A voice told me to run and jump out a window and never look back,\\" she recalled, but she calmed her fears and went back to the car. According to Stan and Janice Hooker's testimonies, once they were alone in an isolated area, Hooker pulled off the highway and put a knife to Stan's throat. She was subsequently locked in a wooden \\"head box\\" which was designed to prevent light, sound, and fresh air from entering. Imprisonment Before this, Hooker, then a lumber mill worker (at Diamond International Lumber Mill), and Janice had reached an agreement that he could capture a slave to take Janice's place, because up until that time Cameron had been using Janice to act out sexual bondage. There was to be no penetrative sex with Stan according to the agreement, but this later changed. On the first night of her kidnapping, Stan was strung up by her hands, physically attacked by Cameron, and left blindfolded and suspended while the pair had sex below her. After her kidnapping, Stan stated that she was tortured and kept locked in a box 23 hours a day until she was given a contract and forced to sign herself into slavery for life in January 1978. In view from the box, under her bed, propped up against her purse, Stan told ABC10 news, was a photo Stan saw every day, of Marie Elizabeth Spannhake, a previous victim whose body was never found. She further stated that Cameron led her to believe that she was being watched by a large, powerful organization called \\"The Company\\" which would painfully torture her and harm her family if she tried to escape. Stan subsequently became a slave referred to as \\"K\\", was forced to call Cameron \\"Master\\", and was not allowed to talk without permission. Cameron reportedly wanted Stan to be like the female character in the 1954 French erotic novel, Story of O and soon started raping her, which consisted of oral rape. Cameron did not want to have vaginal sex with Stan because he considered that to be a breach in his agreement with his wife.Michael H. Stone & Gary Brucato. The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 174-177. Instead, he raped her vaginally and anally with implements. Following this, the Hooker family moved to a mobile home in Red Bluff with Stan, where she was kept locked in wooden boxes under the couple's water bed. In 1978, Janice gave birth to a second child on the water bed above Stan. Stan said that her faith in God and belief in a chance of escape helped her survive; her greatest fear was \\"The Company\\", which Cameron \\"reinforced\\" daily. To avoid painful punishments, Stan tried to comply with his commandments, which later led to her being allowed to go out to jog, work in the yard, care for the family's children in the mobile home, and help him build bigger accommodations — like an underground dungeon — for more slaves. Even with an open door, neighbors and a telephone, she made no attempt to escape as—according to Stan—her fear of \\"The Company\\" kept her from seeking help. Additionally, Stan was allowed to visit her family by herself in 1981, but did not reveal her situation due to her fear of the possible consequences. Her family thought she was involved in a cult because of her homemade clothes, lack of money, and absence of communications over the years; they did not want to pressure her, fearing she would stay away forever. The next day, Stan returned for a second visit, with Hooker posing as her boyfriend. At the trial, Stan explained that she was happy about visiting her family, who were therefore able to take a photograph of her and Cameron happily smiling together. According to Stan, Hooker feared he had given his slave too much freedom and took her back to his mobile home, where he locked her in the wooden box under his water bed; she remained in the box 23 hours a day for the next three years. Bodily functions were dealt with by her using a bed pan which she positioned under herself with her feet. It was stated in court that Hooker's children were told \\"K\\" had gone home; however, once his children had gone to bed, Hooker would take Stan out of the box to feed and torture her. She was reportedly not allowed to make any noise, and had to lie still 23 hours at a time in the dark, with little air to breathe. During the summers, conditions were especially harsh on her, as the temperature in her box would rise to over 100 °F (38 °C). To feed herself, she ate scraps of food. Aftermath and consequences Escape and trial It was not until 1983 that Stan was reintroduced to the children and neighbors; she was also allowed to get a job as a maid at a motel. Hooker wanted Stan to become his second wife, which was a turning point for Janice. Janice confessed that—starting with their first date—she had also been tortured, brainwashed, and referred to as a \\"whore\\" over the years by Cameron. Janice further stated that she survived their relationship by engaging in denial and compartmentalization. By August 1984, Janice began struggling with herself and went to Stan, in order to inform her that Hooker was not part of \\"The Company\\". However, she maintained that the organization did exist. In a televised interview for Girl in the Box, Stan told the interviewer that she then went to a bus station and phoned Hooker to inform him that she was leaving him, and that he reacted by bursting into tears; Stan subsequently caught a bus home. In the months that followed, she did not contact the police but continued to call Hooker regularly; she explained this at the trial by saying that she wanted to give Hooker, at Janice's request, a chance to reform. Three months later, Janice reported her husband to the police. She informed Lt. Jerry D. Brown of the Red Bluff Police that Cameron had kidnapped, tortured, and murdered Marie Elizabeth Spannhake, who had disappeared on January 31, 1976. Authorities were unable to locate the remains of the woman. Due to the lack of physical proof, no murder charge was brought. Chris Hatcher, a forensic psychologist and criminal profiler, testified for Cameron's prosecution at the start of the 1985 trial, and Janice testified against her husband in exchange for full immunity. In the end, Hooker was sentenced to consecutive prison terms totaling 104 years for sexual assaults, kidnapping, and using a knife in the process. Originally ineligible for parole until 2023, he had his hearing date moved up seven years to 2015 by California's Elderly Parole Program. On April 16, 2015, his request for parole was denied, and Hooker will be eligible for another hearing in 2030.However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, California officials contacted Stan and advised her that they were looking into possibly granting him parole in March of 2021 Post-trial After the trial, Stan studied for an accounting degree and, as reported by Mara Bovsun in a March 9, 2014 New York Daily News article, \\"tried to move on to a normal life, but misery followed her — a string of failed marriages and a troubled child, now in jail.\\" Stan also joined and volunteered for Redding Women's Refuge Center, an organization to help abused women. Janice reverted to her maiden name, Lashley; became a registered associate social worker; and has worked as a mental health professional. Stan has changed her last name; both Janice and Stan continue to live in California. They do not communicate with each other. Cultural impact Films The main plot of the American documentary- style horror film, The Poughkeepsie Tapes (2007), was based on this case. On September 10, 2016, a television movie based on the case, titled Girl in the Box, premiered on Lifetime starring Addison Timlin as Colleen Stan, Zane Holtz as Cameron Hooker, and Zelda Williams as Janice Hooker. The movie was followed by a two-hour documentary called Colleen Stan: Girl in the Box. Literature The case is documented in the book Perfect Victim: The True Story of the Girl in the Box (1989), by prosecutor Christine McGuire and Carla Norton, and referenced in Kathy Reichs' novel Monday Mourning (2004). An updated version of Stan's story, Colleen Stan, The Simple Gifts of Life by Jim Green, was published in 2009. Music In 1996, the American rock band Elysian Fields released a song titled \\"Jack in the Box\\" for their debut studio album, Bleed Your Cedar, which was made available for purchase that same year. Its lyrical content delves into Stan's experience of being imprisoned by Cameron in the box under the bed he shared with his wife, and alludes to the power he had over her. The case inspired the name for Richard Ramirez's Texas experimental noise group Black Leather Jesus. In 2012, a short opera piece composed by Patrik Jarlestam and Jonas Bernander was based on the kidnapping, and premiered in Stockholm, Sweden under the name of Den 4444:e dagen (The 4444th day). Television The case, and its core elements of an invisible conspiracy used to coerce the victim into servitude and long periods of confinement, have formed the basis for several episodes of television crime series, including Criminal Minds (episode \\"The Company\\", season seven), Ghost Whisperer (episode \\"Ball & Chain\\", season four), and Law and Order: Special Victims Unit (episode \\"Slaves\\", season one). It was also profiled in the 2008 episode \\"Kidnapped\\" of the Investigation Discovery series Wicked Attraction. \\"The Apartment\\", a 2012 episode of the SyFy series Paranormal Witness, told the story of the disappearance of Marie Spannhake, and includes a cameo mention of Stan's kidnapping. The case was also mentioned in passing during an episode of Waking the Dead (episode \\"Fugue States\\", part 1, season 4).

Kenneth is delighted with the slap-up food hamper and champagne, while Barbara loads the vintage clips. As the films remorselessly play out, Kenneth feels the need to relieve himself but Barbara is determined to plough through every film.

He is usually identified as Raoul le Breton, though this is disputed by some.Jean-Luc Deuffic (2002) identifies the two.Confusion is possible since the contemporary Raoul de Presles (1316—1382) is also sometimes known as Raoul le Breton. Besides works of grammatical speculation -- he was one of the Modistae -- he wrote on Aristotle, Boethius and Priscian. Radulphus was Master of arts in the University of Paris in 1296, and joined the theology faculty in 1311. Very few of his works are edited, although he was a prolific and influential writer. He was one of a group of grammarians called the modistae or modists who flourished around Paris from about 1260 to 1310, so-called because they wrote on the mode of signifying.

Barbara Gonzaga. Eberhard im Bart, 1492. Coat of arms adopted by Eberhard I in 1495 on the occasion of the elevation of Württemberg to a duchy. Eberhard I of Württemberg (11 December 144524 February 1496). From 1459 to 1495 he was Count Eberhard V, and from July 1495 he was the first Duke of Württemberg. He is also known as Eberhard im Bart (Eberhard the Bearded).  Early life  Born at Urach, he was the son of count Ludwig I and his wife Mechthild of the Palatinate, born as countess palatine by the Rhine. Count Eberhard V officially took charge of the government of Württemberg-Urach when he was still underage; Württemberg had been divided since 1442. At first he had a legal guardian, a respected nobleman who had mentored his father as a youth, Rudolph von Ehingen of Kilchberg. However, in 1459, assisted by Frederick I, Elector Palatine, he threw off this restraint, and undertook the government of the district of Urach as Count Eberhard V. He neglected his duties as a ruler and lived a reckless life until 1468. During this time, a fencing manual was created for Eberhard in 1467 by Hans Talhoffer.Internally dated on folio 16v. The manuscript is currently held by the Bavarian State Library.Fechtbuch von 1467 . Manuscript published in Swabia, Germany. Via World Digital Library. In 1468, he traveled to Jerusalem and became a knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. To commemorate this he chose the palm as his symbol. He visited Italy and became acquainted with some famous scholars. Returning home, in Urach on 12 April (or 4 July) 1474 he married a prestigious bride, Barbara, daughter of Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua. The only child from this marriage, Barbara, was born in Urach on 2 August 1475 and died on 15 October of that year. In 1477 Eberhard, whose motto was attempto (\\"I dare\\"), founded the University of Tübingen. He ordered the expulsion of all Jews living in Württemberg. He invited the Brethren of the Common Life and the community of devotio moderna to his country and founded collegiate churches in Urach, Dettingen an der Erms, Herrenberg, Einsiedel near Tübingen and Tachenhausen. He also took an interest in reforms of the church and monasteries. Despite not being able to speak Latin he held education in high esteem and had a great number of Latin texts translated into German.Mertens, Dieter: Eberhard im Bart und der Humanismus Parts of his large library have been preserved. Finally on December 14, 1482, Eberhard reunified the two halves of Württemberg, Württemberg-Urach and Württemberg-Stuttgart, in the Treaty of Münsingen, with his cousin Eberhard VI of Württemberg-Stuttgart, later the second duke. He moved the capital to Stuttgart. In the same year, Pope Sixtus IV awarded him the Golden Rose. Eberhard, although a lover of peace, was one of the founders of the Swabian League in 1488, and assisted to release Maximilian I, from his imprisonment in Bruges in the same year. In 1492 he was awarded the Order of the Golden Fleece, by Maximilian, then King of Germany. In the same year, the treaty was finally sanctioned by the nobility. Johannes Nauclerus, a humanist and historian, served at his court. Elevation to Dukedom On 21 July 1495, at the Diet of Worms, the County of Württemberg was elevated to a Duchy. After Maximilian I's councilor, Veit von Wolkenstein, delivered a speech praising the House of Württemberg, Eberhard was dressed as an Herzog and bestowed a sword by Maximilian, who confirmed the treaty. Frederick III, Elector of Saxony and the Imperial Marshal, then led Eberhard I to Württemberg's seat in the Reichstag, between the Duke of Jülich and the Landgrave of Hesse. To confirm Württemberg's elevation to a Duchy, the Emperor hosted a banquet attended by his person, the electors, and the other princes of the Diet. In the hierarchy of the Holy Roman Empire, this put Württemberg's status above all the Margraves and Counts, but behind all the existing Duchies. Eberhard died at Tübingen in 1496, and the succession passed to his cousin, who became Duke Eberhard II. He was first buried in the collegiate church Saint Peter auf dem Einsiedel, and later in the collegiate church of Tübingen. Legacy In the 19th and 20th century the patriotic historiography transfigured him. A bust of him was erected in Walhalla. In the Swabian anthem \\"Preisend mit viel schönen Reden\\" by Justinus Kerner, he is praised as: \\"Eberhard the one with the beard, Württemberg's beloved ruler.\\" In this so-called song of the Württembergers, he is praised as the richest prince amongst the German princes, as he is able to rest his head on the lap of every one of his subjects without having fear for his life or property.

It is a scholarship for actors at the Swedish theater. It has been awarded annually by the Royal Dramatic Theatre since 1956. Eugene O'Neill U. S. Postage (1967) History Eugene Gladstone O'Neill (1888-1953) was a noted American playwright. He was a four winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama and was the Nobel laureate for literature in 1936. Just before Eugene O'Neill died in 1953, he drew up a will in which he gave the then not yet staged play Long Day's Journey Into Night (written in 1941) to Sweden's Royal Dramatic Theatre (Dramaten), along with exclusive first performance rights. The play had its world premiere in Stockholm on February 2, 1956. The gesture was as thanks for Dramaten's continued interest in staging his plays (more so than any other theatre in the world), and for Swedish appreciation of his work long before he became recognized internationally, or in his home country. Later his widow American stage and film actress Carlotta Monterey (1888– 1970), also gave Dramaten the performing rights to A Touch of the Poet (1942), Hughie (1942) and More Stately Mansions (posthumous). She refused staging fees for his plays in Sweden, provided that 8% of the royalties from the revenues of each performance were given to the Eugene O'Neill Memory Fund, which manages the money for the Eugene O'Neill Award. The scholarship is bestowed annually on the 16th of October, the anniversary of O'Neill's birthday. In accordance with O'Neill's own wishes, it is given to \\"highly deserving actors of Dramaten\\". Recipients of the award are decided by Dramaten's board of directors. As an extra honour to Eugene O'Neill, the first award was granted to the two actors who played the leading parts of James and Mary Tyrone in the original staging of Long Day's Journey Into Night at Dramaten in February 1956; Lars Hanson (1886-1965) and Inga Tidblad (1901–1975).

In form pillas is described as being similar to rye, but with much finer straw. The straw, being much softer and tougher than wheat straw, was used for plaiting hats. The small yellow grain was seldom ground into flour but was made into a type of porridge known as gurts. Pillas gurts were prepared by damping the grain and leaving it to stand in a warm place until it started to cheeny (sprout). It was then put in a baker (iron pan) and stirred over a slow fire until completely dry and a little scroached (scorched). The grain was then left to cool spread out on a cloth before being crushed a handful at a time in a small granite trough with a large round bowel (pebble). As well as being made into porridge with milk the gurts were often used in place of flour or rice in puddings. A small amount was also added by the old housewives to the malt when extra strong ale was required. It was for that latter use that old women were threatened with fines by the excisemen if they continued to put their grain to cheeny.

Steins is a ghost town in Stein's Pass of Hidalgo County, New Mexico. It was originally called Stein's Pass after the nearby pass through the Peloncillo Mountains (Hidalgo County).Julyan, Robert Hixson (1998) \\"Embudo\\" The Place Names of New Mexico (2nd ed.) University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, NM, pages 341–342, . The pass was named after United States Army Major Enoch Steen, who camped nearby in 1856, as he explored the recently acquired Gadsden Purchase. History The town can trace its origin to a small stop on the Birch Stage Line that was established in 1857. Properly founded in 1880, the town was named after United States Army Major Enoch Steen (whose name was sometimes spelled as \\"Steins\\"). The town began to prosper when mineral deposits like gold, silver, and copper were discovered in the nearby Peloncillo Mountains. Further success was brought when the Southern Pacific Railroad established a rail line in 1878, and a local quarry was opened up. Steins had no natural source of water, so all water had to be brought in by train. In 1905 a rock-crushing plant was built to produce track ballast for the railroad. In 1944, toward the end of World War II, the railway ceased operations at the Steins quarry and gave notice it would no longer subsidize water deliveries. The railway offered the inhabitants of Steins free transport elsewhere with what they could carry; most of the population accepted this offer, leaving their houses and many of their possessions behind. The post office in the town closed at that time, and eventually Steins was completely abandoned; a later fire destroyed a good majority of what was left behind. In 1988, Larry and Linda Link purchased the locale and began offering ghost town tours. In 2011, however, Larry Link was murdered and tours ceased. It is unusual in the old West ghost towns in having been a railroad rather than a mining town. Steins Pass has been mistaken by some people for the pass at Doubtful Canyon near Steins Peak, a location to the northwest in the same mountain range, which was the location of a Butterfield Overland Mail station and the site of the Battle of Doubtful Canyon.

The airport is located about outside the town in the village of Røssvoll. In 2014 Mo i Rana Airport served 104,474 passengers. It is operated by Avinor. Service The airport is served by Widerøe with Dash 8 aircraft connecting the community to Bodø, Trondheim, and other communities in Nordland and Nord-Trøndelag counties. The routes are operated on public service obligation with the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. The runway is too short for flights with enough fuel to reach Oslo (in 2017 flights with a fuel stop were introduced).  Airlines and destinations  Ground transportation The airport is located in Røssvoll about 20 minutes north-east of the town along the E6. There are no buses to the airport, but taxis are available. Rental cars are available in the town of Mo i Rana. Future In 2002 the Ministry of Transport launched an idea of merging the three airports serving Northern Helgeland, Mosjøen Airport, Sandnessjøen Airport and Mo i Rana Airport into one new airport with a large enough runway to fly jet aircraft like Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 aircraft directly to Oslo, and make it unnecessary to operate subsidized regional aircraft to Helgeland. There are also doubts about the future availability of large enough aircraft for 800 m runways. Better roads between the areas including two long tunnels (Korgfjell Tunnel opened in 2005 and Toven Tunnel) opened 2014) have also been built. It's not possible to extend the present runway at Røssvoll. A location was selected at Drevjadalen in Vefsn, 15 km north of Mosjøen (55 km from Sandnessjøen, 70 from Mo i Rana). Meteorological tests showed that the location was too foggy, so a new location was searched for. In June 2013 the parliament decided to build the new airport a few km south of Røssvoll airport, and there was a construction start ceremony with the Prime minister in 2017. Still the real construction start is delayed because the government has delayed their financial support.

He was appointed Assistant Professor of Ethics and English at the United States Naval Academy on 1 October 1871. Only two years later, he became Head of the Department of English Studies, History, and Law. On 9 June 1882, Soley was assigned to the Bureau of Navigation. He served as Superintendent of the naval war records office and he headed the Navy Department Library: Office of Naval Records and Library. During this duty, Soley began the collection of the naval documents of the American Civil War and started the editorial work which culminated in the publication of the 31-volume collection, The Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion. These years also saw the publication of several of Soley's books and articles on American naval history. In 1884, Commodore Stephen B. Luce appointed Soley instructor in International Law at the newly established United States Naval War College, thereby becoming that institution's first civilian faculty member. While serving in Washington, D.C., Soley studied law at Columbian University (now called George Washington University) and received his law degree in 1890. On 18 July 1890 he resigned his commission to become an Assistant Secretary of the Navy, dealing with administration of labor in naval shore establishments. He served in this position until March 1893. After his service with the Navy Soley moved to New York City to practice law, working with his former naval chief, Benjamin F. Tracy, who had been Secretary of the Navy from 1889 to March 1893. Soley specialized in international law.

Biography Whitemore studied for the stage at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he was taught by Peter Barkworth, then on the staff at RADA, who recognised he had the potential to make a significant contribution to the theatre, \\"though perhaps not as an actor.\\" He began his writing career in British television with both original television plays and adaptations of classic works by Charles Dickens, W. Somerset Maugham, Daphne du Maurier, and Charlotte Brontë, among others, and had won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award twice. His work for American TV includes Concealed Enemies (1984), about the Alger Hiss case, and The Gathering Storm (2002), which focused on a troubled period in the marriage of Clementine and Winston Churchill just prior to World War II. He won an Emmy Award for each script. He was also nominated for his adaptation of the Carl Bernstein/Bob Woodward book about President Nixon, The Final Days starring Lane Smith as Nixon. Whitemore's last work for television was My House in Umbria (2003), an adaptation of the novella by William Trevor starring Maggie Smith. He also wrote the episode, \\"Horrible Conspiracies\\", for the BBC series Elizabeth R (1971). Whitemore's film credits include: Man at the Top (1973), All Creatures Great and Small (1975), The Blue Bird (1976), The Return of the Soldier (1982), 84 Charing Cross Road (1987) and Utz (1992). The plots of Whitemore's plays frequently focus on historical figures. Stevie (1977) centred on the life of English poet and novelist Stevie Smith and Pack of Lies (1983) covered events leading up to the arrest of the Krogers, two Americans spying for the Russians in London in 1961. Whitemore's best known work taking the form of a staged biography was Breaking the Code (1986) which was centered on Alan Turing, who was responsible for cracking the German Enigma code during World War II and resisted an adherence to the English code of sexual discretion with his homosexuality, for which he was charged with gross indecency. A television adaptation was broadcast in the UK in 1996. The Best of Friends (1987), about the friendship Dame Laurentia McLachlan, the Abbess of Stanbrook Abbey in Worcestershire, shared with George Bernard Shaw and Sydney Cockerell, director of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. An adaptation by Whitemore of the Luigi Pirandello play As You Desire Me was staged at London's Playhouse Theatre in 2005 with Kristin Scott Thomas in the lead. Whitemore was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He died at the age of 82 on 17 July 2018 . Notes References *\\"Hugh Whitemore Biography (1936- )\\". Film Reference.

Hyman, from a screenplay by James Hilton, Zoë Akins, and Frances Marion.. The picture is based on the 1848 novel and 1852 play, La Dame aux Camélias, by Alexandre Dumas. The film stars Greta Garbo, Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore, Elizabeth Allan, Jessie Ralph, Henry Daniell, and Laura Hope Crews. It grossed $2,842,000. The film inspired Milton Benjamin to write and publish a song titled \\"I'll Love Like Robert Taylor, Be My Greta Garbo\\". Camille was included in Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Movies in 2005.Time magazine. It was also included at #33 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions. Plot Beautiful Marguerite Gautier (Greta Garbo) is a well- known courtesan, living in the demi-monde of mid-19th century Paris. Marguerite's dressmaker and procuress, Prudence Duvernoy (Laura Hope Crews), arranges an assignation at the theatre with a fabulously wealthy prospective patron, the Baron de Varville (Henry Daniell). Marguerite has never met the baron, and she briefly mistakes Armand Duval (Robert Taylor), a handsome young man of good family but no great fortune, for the baron. She finds Armand charming, but when the mistake is explained, she accepts the baron without hesitation. Marguerite spends money carelessly, sometimes out of generosity, as when she bids a fortune on a team of horses in order to give an old coachman employment, but more often because she loves her lavish lifestyle and the late nights of dancing and drinking—and because she knows her days are numbered. She has consumption, which is a death sentence for anyone who lives as she does. She has bouts of severe illness, and during one spell, the only person who came to her door was Armand, bearing flowers (the baron contrived to be in England). She finds this out after she has recovered, and she invites him to her birthday party (the baron has just departed for a long stay in Russia.) During the party, Marguerite retreats into the bedroom with a coughing spell, and Armand follows, He professes his love, which is something she has never known. She gives him a key and tells him to send everyone home and come back later. While she is waiting for him, the baron returns unexpectedly. She orders Nanine to shoot the bolt on the door. The baron, who is clearly suspicious, plays the piano furiously, not quite masking the bell. He asks who might be at the door and, laughing, she says “The great romance of my life—That might have been.” At Armand's family home in the country, he asks his father for money to travel, to prepare for his career in the Foreign Service. He sends Marguerite a scathing letter (he saw the baron's carriage) but when she comes to his rooms they reconcile immediately. She sees a miniature of his mother and is amazed to learn that his parents have loved each other for 30 years. “You'll never love me 30 years,” she says, sadly. “I'll love you all my life,” he replies, and they embrace. Fadeout. Fade in to the two of them on the floor, Armand's head in her lap. He wants to take her to the country for the summer, to get well. She tells him to forget her but agrees in the end. However, she owes 40,000 francs, which must be paid. The baron gives her the money as a parting gift, and slaps her in the face when she kisses him in thanks. Armand takes her to a house in the country; Marguerite thrives on fresh milk and eggs and country walks and love. A shadow is cast by the discovery that the baron's château is in the neighborhood. Marguerite tells him she has asked Prudence to sell everything, pay everything. ”Never doubt that I love you more than the world.” Armand asks her to marry him, but she declines. The idyll ends when Armand's father (Lionel Barrymore) comes to the house and, acknowledging her love is real, begs Marguerite to turn away from his son, knowing her past will ruin his chances at a career or profession or place in society. When Armand returns to the house, she is cold and dismissive and tells him the baron is expecting her. He watches her walk over the hill. Back in Paris, at a gambling club, Armand comes face to face with the baron and Marguerite, who is ill. Armand wins a fortune from the baron at Baccarat and begs Marguerite to come with him. She lies and says she loves the baron. Armand wounds the baron in a duel and must leave the country for six months. When he returns, Marguerite is deathly ill. \\"Perhaps it's better if I live in your heart, where the world can't see me,\\" she says. She dies in his arms.

The film was not changed to modern times, but Thalberg wanted the film to have a more contemporary feeling than earlier Camilles. He wanted audiences to forget that they were watching a \\"costume\\" picture. He also felt that morality had changed since the earlier Camilles, and the fact that Marguerite was a prostitute was not as shameful anymore; as a result, Garbo's character became more likable than in previous productions. The modernization of the story proved to be successful. While filming Marguerite's death scene, Robert Taylor brought his phonograph to Garbo's dressing room so that she could play Paul Robeson records to put her in the mood. In the words of Camille's director George Cukor: \\"My mother had just died, and I had been there during her last conscious moments. I suppose I had a special awareness. I may have passed something on to Garbo without realizing it.\\" Garbo later praised Cukor's sensitivity: \\"Cukor gave me direction as to how to hold my hands\\", said Garbo. \\"He had seen how, when his mother lay dying, she folded her hands and just fell asleep.\\" While producing Camille, producer Irving Thalberg died. After filming was ended, and post-production began, Louis B. Mayer assigned Bernard Hyman as the film's new producer. Hyman arranged re-takes, cut some scenes, or edited scenes from the original Thalberg produced film. It is not exactly known which scenes were edited or cut. The famous death scene we see is not the original version from the first version of the film. In the original version, Garbo died on the bed, had more text to say, and folded her hands before she died. This original death scene is lost. Cukor thought that it didn't really feel very natural talking that much when you are about to die; so, Garbo's last scene was re-written and re- shot three times. In the first and second alternative endings, Garbo was on the deathbed, with less words to say, but they still weren't satisfied. They thought it seemed unreal for a dying woman to talk so much. In the third alternative ending, Garbo had to be even quieter, and just slowly slipped away in Robert Taylor's arms. The 1936 production of Camille was the 84th anniversary of its original stage presentation in Paris in 1852. It was also far from new to the films because it was done once in 1915, twice in 1917, again in 1921 with Nazimova and Rudolph Valentino, and last in 1927 with Norma Talmadge. News items in Daily Variety and Hollywood Reporter on Jul. 25, 1936, note that John Barrymore originally was cast in the role of Baron de Varville, but a bout of pneumonia prevented him from working on the picture. Barrymore's brother Lionel was scheduled to replace John in the role; however, a few days later, it was reported that a change in casting resulted in Lionel Barrymore's assignment to the role of Monsieur Duval, and Henry Daniell's assignment to Baron de Varville. Cinematographer William Daniels mistakenly is listed as a cast member in early Hollywood Reporter production charts. Camille marked the screen debut of actress Joan Leslie, who appeared under her real name, Joan Brodel. Reception Promotion The \\"Selling Angles\\" section in BoxOffice Magazine, Dec. 26, 1936, suggested tips for selling Camille. Theatre managers were advised to make a display of some of the famous Camilles of past decades, including Garbo as the latest to join the list of immortal actresses; have local florists stage a \\"Camille Show\\"; find old reviews from metropolitan daily papers' back files and run them in conjunction with reviews of the modern film story; and print throwaways in the style of the old \\"Gas Light Era\\" programs. The suggested best \\"Catchlines\\" for selling Camille, according to BoxOffice, were: * \\"Her love was like a great flame…burning…scorching…withering…and when the flame died, she no longer cared to live.\\" * \\"Her destiny was to be loved…but not to love…until she met the man who was to change that destiny.\\" * \\"Again...Dumas' classic love tale...with the screen's most dramatic love team – Garbo and Taylor.\\" Premiere Plaza Theatre in Palm SpringsCamille had its grand premiere on December 12, 1936, at the brand new Plaza Theatre in Palm Springs, California. Many celebrities attended the gala which cost ten dollars a seat. The desert resort of Palm Springs was turned upside down with all the commotion of the film's premiere. Some of the film was buried in stone to commemorate the celebration. Ralph Bellamy, who was a leading civic figure and Racquet Club owner in Palm Springs, was master of ceremonies. Rumors were spread that Greta Garbo was staying at the desert resort and would attend the premiere, but these rumors proved to be unfounded. At the gala premiere, Camille was given an enthusiastic reception; the critics praised it as the finest performance ever given by Greta Garbo, Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore, and Lauren Hope Crews, and the best work by Director George Cukor. The enthusiasm accorded the picture was seen as a tribute to the genius of the late Irving G. Thalberg, who conceived of, and was responsible for, the production. The 37-year-old Thalberg died just before the film's release. Box office According to MGM records, the film earned $1,154,000 in the U.S. and Canada, and $1,688,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $388,000. Critical response Camille has been well-received by critics since its release, and the role of Marguerite is generally regarded as Greta Garbo's finest screen performance. Camille is often named as a highlight among 1936 films. Rotten Tomatoes reports 91% approval among 11 critics. On watching a scene in the film where Garbo is at a theater, Thalberg said: \\"George, she's awfully good. I don't think I've ever seen her so good.\\" \\"But Irving\\", said Cukor, \\"she's just sitting in an Opera Box.\\" \\"She's relaxed\\", said Thalberg. \\"She's open. She seems unguarded for once.\\" Garbo's new attitude prompted Thalberg to have the script reworked. \\"She is a fascinating artist, but she is limited\\", Thalberg told the new writers. \\"She must never create situations. She must be thrust into them. The drama comes in how she rides them out.\\" Awards Won * New York Film Critics Circle Awards: NYFCC Award; Best Actress, Greta Garbo; 1937. Nomination * Academy Awards: Oscar; Best Actress in a Leading Role, Greta Garbo; 1938. Cultural references * In the 1982 musical film Annie, the film is both seen and referenced to.

He has worked for the World Wrestling Council, the International Wrestling Association and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling as both a referee and wrestler. Shane Sewell is a fourteen-time World Heavyweight Champion, having won the IWA Undisputed World Unified Heavyweight Championship ten times, the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship three times, and the WWL World Heavyweight Championship one time. By winning the IWA, WWC, and WWL World Heavyweight Championships, Sewell won the three world titles from three top promotions in Puerto Rico. Professional wrestling career World Wrestling Council (1995 - 2000) During the mid 1990s Sewell formed a tag team with Glamour Boy Sean they were known as the Canadian Glamour Boys. Together they won the WWC World Tag Team Championships twice before going their own way. Sewell also became a three time WWC Television Champion on separate occasions. After two years out of the tag team division Sewell won the vacant WWC World Tag Team Championships for a third time teaming with Ricky Santana. International Wrestling Association (2000 - 2005) Sewell debuted in the IWA days after leaving WWC in a run-in to help Savio Vega as he was being double-teamed by Miguel Perez and Jesus Castillo in Carolina, Puerto Rico. He became the company's first World Heavyweight Champion on October 28, 2000 in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. He started a notable feud in December 2001 when Vega returned and unified with Starr Corporation and attacked both Sewell and Ricky Banderas forming Los Hermanos en Dolor (Brothers in Pain). In December 2004, Sewell turned heel with Vega after he won the Heavyweight title from Ray Gonzalez at Christmas in Puerto Rico. He lost the title to Chicano at Juicio Final on April 2, 2005 in Caguas, Puerto Rico and after that teamed with Jean- Pierre Lafitte part-time. Sewell returned to the IWA in 2008 with former TNA stars Ricky Vega and The Naturals as well as veteran stalwart Big Vito. Sewell tagged with Vega for a time before Vega turned heel and became undisputed IWA heavyweight champion. The two former partners would meet several times after, with Sewell falling short of the title he helped make famous. Time split between WWC and IWA (2005 - 2006)  Sewell wrestled part-time in then-new Puerto Rican federation New Wrestling Stars. During his time in the company, as part of a talent exchange with the WWC, he won the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship title from \\"La Amenaza\\" Bryan in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico on November 5, 2005, which made Sewell the first wrestler to win both the top titles in both IWA and WWC in a calendar year. He lost the Universal title to Bryan on February 12, 2006 and split his time with both companies. Sewell later feuded with Tim Arson over the NWS Heavyweight title until June 3, 2006 when he lost a Title vs. Leave The Company match. When the New Wrestling Stars promotion folded, he made his IWA return on Impacto Total on August 19, 2006 in an angle with Miguel Perez Jr. in his office saying the Glamour Boy is ready to return. Later that night in Caguas, Puerto Rico, Sewell, under the masked gimmick Mr. GPR ran in and helped Perez Jr., Ray Gonzalez, Thunder and Lightning clear of the ring of Savio Vega's La Compania before Sewell unmasked himself. Sewell won the Heavyweight title in a three-way match from Gonzalez and Lightning at IWA Christmas in Puerto Rico on December 9, 2006 for a record ninth time. He has been making part-time appearances for WWC since 2008. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2008-2009) Sewell began working for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling to help develop and train upcoming wrestlers while (at the time) also appearing as a referee on Impact!. He first made a mark in TNA by defending himself after Sheik Abdul Bashir took exception to being defeated after a restart in a match against Consequences Creed. Sewell quickly clotheslined Bashir over the top rope to the floor and had to be calmed down by referee Earl Hebner. Since the altercation, he had a number of brawls with wrestlers who shoved him while he was working as a referee. On the November 13 episode of Impact! during an X Division Championship match between Eric Young and champion Sheik Abdul Bashir, Sewell stopped a three-count in noticing an illegal action on the part of Bashir, then asking the audience if Bashir had done so. Bashir then shoved Sewell to the mat, causing him to remove his referee shirt and begin attacking Bashir. As a result, Young hit a Death Valley Driver on Bashir and won the match, becoming the new X Division Champion. However, the decision was reversed one week later by Jim Cornette due to Sewell's interference. A similar incident occurred at Final Resolution, where Bashir shoved Sewell and he retaliated by kicking Bashir's feet off the top rope, thus causing him to be pinned by Young. Bashir then attacked Sewell and busted him open in the process. On January 8, 2009, Sewell was (kayfabe) fired as an official after another confrontation with Bashir. However, as part of the confrontation, Cornette announced that Sewell would be hired as a wrestler and face Bashir at TNA's pay-per-view event Genesis, which Sewell won. Sewell apparently was allowed to officiate matches again, as on the Impact! following Genesis, he officiated Hernandez's disqualification loss against Sting. After having a number of confrontations with Booker T, Cornette announced that at Against All Odds, Booker would defend his Legends Championship against Sewell. At the pay-per-view, Sewell was defeated in his first and only championship match in TNA. On the March 26 episode of Impact!, Sewell took part in a Captain's Gauntlet match, but was quickly eliminated by Kurt Angle. On May 22, 2009, it was confirmed that Sewell had been released from the company. Return to WWC After being released from TNA, Sewell worked the June 25 tapings of Florida Championship Wrestling, before returning to WWC.

History The church was built as a parochial church in 1922 in a new quarter of the city, the Città Giardino, on orders from Pope Benedict XV, to a design by Gustavo Giovannoni. The Clerics Regular Minor of S Francesco Caracciolo, also known as the Caracciolini, started working in the area on 7 April that year, and on 8 December the church was consecrated and granted to them by Pope Pius XI. Six years later, in 1926, it was formally established as a parish. It was built in a Neo-Classical style, inspired by the Italian Renaissance, with a staircase in front of the façade, a travertine doorway, a single nave with side chapels, and a basilical baldachino. The church's dome is decorated with frescoes by Aronne del Vecchio, painted in 1961, of The Angels in Paradise with the Most Holy Trinity and the Blessed Virgin.

Formed in 1994, they played for two years for the fun of it and released their first EP, titled Sólo Un Día Más (Just One More Day) in 1996. Shaila is one of the most important bands of the genre in South America. They have played with bands such as Lagwagon, MxPx, The Ataris and NOFX. Besides Argentina, they have also played in Chile, Uruguay and Peru. Their Punk rock influences have been noticed since their beginning, in the different shows through Die Shule, Remember, Continuará, Teatro del plata, Rock & Blues, between others. Solo un día más Their first self-production was edited in the end of 1996: Solo un día más was a cassette that contained four songs. That year the band participated in many other compilations. Santiago joined the band in 1999 as a second guitar. Now, the sound is more powerful for their second production: Shaila, which allows them to reach farther areas like Uruguay, Mar Del Plata and the whole Buenos Aires province. Progresar Alejo (the previous drummer) quits the band in 2000 and Guido comes to replace him on drums. With him they record their first LP called Progresar, that includes thirteen melodic hardcore songs. This album marks a new era for the band, when the sound becomes more neat and the melodies become more mature. El Engaño In 2002 they edited El Engaño, their second LP, which received very good critics by the press and this can be seen through the disc sales. They were invited to the \\"Festival AntiGlobalización\\" with El Otro Yo, Carajo and Cadena Perpetua in the \\"Microestadio de Independiente\\", and to the two editions of the \\"Rock Al Parque\\" Fest in Avellaneda Park, in September with Arbol, Raíz and Nativo (with 3000 spectators) and in December with Raíz, Totus Toss, Smitten and Nativo (with 4000 viewers). Mañanas (2004) was recorded between February and March 2004. It was edited by their own record company: Speed Power Emotion, it includes fourteen songs that were presented in a national tour that finished in Cemento in July. The end of that tour took place at Peteco's. Los Caminantes and Camino a Idilia They started to record Los Caminantes, an EP for the LP Camino a Idilia in 2006. They showed this LP in July 2007 in El Teatro with Rodia, Jordan and Sudarshana, in which show they presented their video \\"Sudamérica II - El Fracaso Regional\\". On 8 September, they organised a massive festival called \\"Festival Contra la Violencia y Discriminación\\" (Festival against violence and discrimination). They got 11 bands together, something remarkable in the history of Argentinian music. These bands were Rodia, Sudarshana, Jordan, Buzzer, Inadaptados, Despierta Tu Mente, Hyntu (replacing a Da-Skate), Euforia and Esencia.

Life and career  Ume was born the second son of the domain doctor of Matsue domain, Izumo Province (present-day Shimane Prefecture). He was sent to study French at Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, and upon graduation was employed by the Ministry of Justice. He also taught at Tokyo Imperial University. Ume was sent by the government for advanced studies to the University of Lyon in France in 1886, completing his studies in 1889. After an additional year of study at the Humboldt University of Berlin in Germany, he returned to Japan in 1890. He was awarded the degree of doctorate of law by University of Lyon in 1891. On his return, Ume became embroiled in the Civil Code controversy, and urged the immediate adoption of the code as drawn up by French foreign advisor to the government, Gustave Emile Boissonade. When the adoption of the code was delayed in 1892, he appealed to Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi to establish a committee to prepare the new draft, and was chosen to be a member of the new committee in 1893. Together with Hozumi Nobushige and Tomii Masaaki, he is regarded as the father of Japan's civil law, which was put into effect in 1898. In 1894, Ume was one of a group of lawyers who established the Tokyo Law School, the forerunner of present-day Hosei University, of which he served as president in 1899. In 1906, he was asked by Itō to help codify the laws for the Japanese protectorate of Korea. He died in Keijo (Seoul) in 1910, of typhoid fever at the age of 50. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure (1st class) on his deathbed, one day before he died. His grave is at Gokoku-ji in Tokyo. References & further reading *Hozumi, Nobushige.

It is operated by Avinor. Service The airport is served by Widerøe with Dash 8 aircraft connecting the community to Bodø and other communities in Nordland. The routes are operated on public service obligation with the Norwegian Ministry of Transportation and Communication. Flights to Oslo via Bodø take about 3 hours with connecting routes Widerøe/Scandinavian Airlines.  Airlines and destinations  Ground transportation The airport is located approximately from the town center. There are no buses, but taxis are available. Future Avinor is planning building a new primary airport to serve Lofoten and possibly also Vesterålen. The region wants to be more attractive on the conference market which would create more job opportunities outside the tourist season, and there is a need to adopt airports to modern aircraft types. Two locations have been put forward, Gimsøya () and Hadselsanden (). The former could replace Leknes Airport and Svolvær Airport, the latter could also replace Stokmarknes Airport. As both alternatives imply direct services to Oslo, the leakage to Evenes would be reduced.

The basic goals of organic work included educating the Polish masses and increasing their economic potential, which was intended to turn the Polish lower classes into a modern nation and to end the population's Germanisation and Russification, pursued by the partitioning occupiers. History Increasing oppression by Russia after failed national uprisings (the November Uprising of 1830-1831 and the January Uprising of 1863-1864) finally convinced Polish leaders that the insurrections had been premature at best and perhaps fundamentally misguided and counterproductive. During the decades that followed, Poles largely forsook the goal of immediate independence and turned instead to fortifying the nation through the subtler means of education, economic development and moderniaation. That approach took the name \\"organic work\\" because of its philosophy of strengthening Polish society at the grassroots level and was influenced by Positivism. For some, the adoption of organic work meant permanent resignation to foreign rule, but many advocates recommended it as a strategy to combat repression and to await an eventual opportunity for the achievement of self-government. Methods Neither as colourful as the Polish rebellions nor as loftily enshrined in national memory, the quotidian methods of organic work proved well suited to the political conditions of the late 19th century. The international balance of forces then did not favour the recovery of Polish statehood, and both Russia and Germany appeared bent on the eventual eradication of Polish national identity. The German Empire, established in 1871 as an expanded version of Prussia, aimed at the assimilation of the eastern provinces inhabited by Poles. At the same time, St. Petersburg attempted to russify the former Congress Kingdom and joined Berlin in levying restrictions against use of the Polish language and culture. Poles under Russian and German rule also endured official campaigns against the Roman Catholic Church: the cultural struggle (Kulturkampf) of German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to bring the Roman Catholic Church under state control and the Russian campaign to replace Catholicism by extending Orthodoxy throughout the empire. Toleration The Polish subjects under Austrian jurisdiction (after 1867, the Habsburg Empire was commonly known as Austria-Hungary) confronted a generally more lenient regime. Poles suffered no religious persecution in predominantly-Catholic Austria, and Vienna counted on the Polish nobility as allies in the complex political calculus of its multinational realm. In return for loyalty, Austrian Poland, or Galicia, received considerable administrative and cultural autonomy. Galicia gained a reputation as an oasis of toleration in contrast to the oppression of German and Russian Poland. The Galician Sejm acted as a semiautonomous parliamentary body in the province, and Poles represented the region in the empire government in Vienna. In the late 1800s, the Universities of Krakow and Lwów became the centers of Polish intellectual activity, and Krakow became the centre of Polish art and thought. Even after the restoration of independence, many residents of southern Poland retained a touch of nostalgia for the days of the Habsburg Empire.

At the same time, he founded several websites dealing with politics and the position of Turks in the Netherlands. He was elected member of the States-Provincial of North Brabant. In 2006, he was nominated as a candidate for the Dutch House of Representatives but withdrew as a result of his denial of the Armenian Genocide.

Mahomet was the great-grandson of Uncas, founder of the Mohegan tribe. In 1735, Captain John Mason, a descendant of the settler who had been asked by Uncas to act as guardians and trustees over the Mohegan land, engineered Mahomet's election to the position of Sachem in place of his great Uncle, Ben Uncas, who was more favoured by the Colony of Connecticut. By 1735, the Mohegan people had lost much of their planting and hunting lands to English settlers. Accompanied by two settlers who supported his cause, John and Samuel Mason, and another Mohegan, AughQuant, Weyonomon travelled to England, where the trio rented accommodation at St Mary Aldermanbury in the City of London while they prepared their petition to the King. The King referred the matter to the Lords Commissioners on Foreign Trade and Plantations; however, both John Mason and Weyonomon succumbed to smallpox in 1736 before their case could be heard by the commission. As a foreigner, he was not permitted to be buried in the City of London, and he was interred in an unmarked grave outside St Mary Overie, now Southwark Cathedral. On 22 November 2006, Queen Elizabeth II dedicated a memorial (a sculpture by British artist Peter Randall-Page) to Mahomet Weyonomon at the cathedral, accompanied by a traditional funeral ceremony conducted by members of the Mohegan tribe.

Her first poem, At East Balmain, was published when she was 19 years old. Her poetry, fiction and drawings were published in literary magazines, as well as several collections of poetry. She wrote prolifically up until her untimely death at 50 years old, which was much mourned in Australia's poetry community. Viidikas was an iconic member of the collection of Sydney poets now known as the “generation of ‘68”. The ‘counter culture’ and her travels in Asia, especially India, are recurrent subjects in her poetry. Early life Viidikas was born and grew up in Sydney, Australia. Her mother, Betty Kunig, was Anglo-Australian, her father Estonian. She had a sister, Ingrid Lisners, who has been involved with publishing the collection New and Rediscovered in tribute to her sister. Viidikas attended schools in Queensland and Sydney, until the age of 15 when she left education and her home. After leaving home, she held various jobs, including veterinary assistant, typist, bartender, apple packer, bookshop assistant, and research assistant, before starting to write at 16 without any formal training. Career Alternative literary magazines began publishing Viidikas' poetry and fiction in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Her writing discussed the drug and sexual revolution taking place. She joined the Balmain New South Wales poetry scene in the late 1960s, she encountered, among others, Ken Bolton, John Forbes, Martin Johnston and John Tranter. Michael Wilding's recollections of her can be found in his 'Wild and Woolley: a publishing memoir' (Giramondo, 2011) and 'Growing Wild' (Arcadia, 2016). Viidikas' work was influenced by her travels, including trips to Europe and the Middle East.

Yukinori, the founder of the Watari clan and the Torii clan, was from a family of Kumano Gongen Shinto priests in Kii Province. Yukinori was given the family name of Taira from Taira no Kiyomori, and was named Taira no Yukinori. His son Yukitada, moved to Yahagasho in Mikawa Province after the Jokyu War (1221), and changed his name to 'Watari'. During the disturbance of the Northern and Southern Courts, Tadakage fought for Nitta Yoshisada of the Southern Court, and changed his name to 'Torii'. Loyal retainers of the Tokugawa clan since the late 16th century, the Torii are perhaps most famous for the bravery and valor of Torii Sune'emon, who was crucified by Takeda Katsuyori at the 1575 siege of Nagashino castle, and for Torii Mototada whose Seppuku is one of the most celebrated in the whole thousand years of Samurai's history. The family was originally granted the fief of Yahagi in Shimōsa Province in 1590. It was worth 40,000 koku. Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, in 1606 the Torii were given Iwakidaira Domain in Mutsu Province, worth 100,000 koku. Then, in 1622 they moved once more to Yamagata in Dewa Province, with an annual income of 260,000 koku. Torii Tadatsune died without an heir in 1636, and his fief thus reverted to the shogunate; his brother Torii Tadaharu was given Takatō in Shinano province (30,000 koku).

Early life The son of an English sailmaker, Edward William Raey and his Irish wife, Johanna Brennen, Reay was born in Balmain, Sydney, but grew up in Williamstown, Melbourne. He ran away to sea when he was thirteen, but left his ship at Dunedin, New Zealand, and worked as a clerk for a while before working his way home. He then attended King's College, Melbourne and joined the Victoria Sugar Company at Yarraville, where he worked for nine years. Career In June 1883 he bought the Coleraine Albion, followed by the Port Melbourne Standard. From 1887 to 1890 he was editor of the Hamilton Spectator, and from 1891 he was leader-writer and assistant editor of the Melbourne Daily Telegraph. When it closed in 1892 he moved to the Melbourne Weekly Times and then to The Herald as literary editor and later associate editor. In 1886, he obtained a commission in the Victorian Mounted Rifles and commanded a detachment of them at the Queen's diamond jubilee in London in 1897. In October 1899 he accompanied the first Australian contingent to the South African War, serving under Lieutenant-General Rundle in the area of the Orange River, and was awarded the South African Medal at Jasfontein after visiting the grave of a fellow Australian correspondent William Lambie in Boer-held territory. Reay also wrote articles as a war correspondent for The Herald and the South Australian Register until he returned ill after the capture of Bloemfontein. From Australia he published Australians in War (1900), which was widely distributed to Victorian soldiers. He retired from the Mounted Rifles in 1903 with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, although, perhaps with an eye towards the likelihood of further hostilities, he wrote a report on the training of volunteers based on the Swiss system. Politics In 1900, on his third attempt, he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the member for East Bourke Boroughs, describing himself as radical and often voting with Labor. Policing career and accolade He also resumed his newspaper career, becoming The Herald's managing editor in 1904. In 1911 he moved to London as The Herald's representative and stayed in England until his death. In the First World War he joined the Metropolitan Special Constabulary, becoming a Divisional Commander and in 1915 Inspector-General of Divisions. For this work he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1917 and promoted to Commander (CBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours. Personal life Reay married Lucinda Braithwaite Broadbent on 10 April 1882 at Hotham Hill, Melbourne, and had five daughters, two of whom were nurses; one was awarded the Royal Red Cross and the other worked for the hospital voluntary service. Reay died at Woolwich Memorial Hospital, London, a day after his 71st birthday, and was cremated at West Norwood Cemetery, where his remains were scattered.

In agriculture, a sprayer is a piece of equipment that is used to apply herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers on agricultural crops. Sprayers range in size from man-portable units (typically backpacks with spray guns) to trailed sprayers that are connected to a tractor, to self-propelled units similar to tractors, with boom mounts of 4-30 feet up to 60–151 feet in length depending on engineering design for tractor and land size.  Engineering  Sprayers are fully integrated, mechanical systems, meaning they are composed of various parts and components that work together to achieve the desired effect, in this case: the projection of the spray fluid. This can be as simple as a hand sprayer attached to a bottle that is pumped and primed by a spring-lever, tube, and vacuum-pressure; or as complex as a 150 foot reach boom sprayer with a list of system components that work together to deliver the spray fluid. For more complex sprayers, such as agricultural sprayers, common system components include: the spray nozzle, sometimes with a spray gun, fluid tank, sprayer pump, pressure regulators, valves and gaskets, and fluid plumbing. The sprayer pump can be just as important as the sprayer type itself as there are many sprayer pump design types with various construction materials, inlet/outlet sizes, and performance specifications. Common sprayer pump types include diaphragm, centrifugal, and roller pumps.

They range from small spot-spraying machines to very large sprayers with extensive land and plant coverage. Agricultural sprayers have been engineered to optimize their applicability and performance for the many purposes that the machines are put to, whether being used on crops, vegetation, or soil. Agriculture sprayers are often used for applying water and water/chemical solutions containing acids or caustic materials for crop-performance or pest- control; i.e. fertilizers and pesticides.  Agricultural Sprayers  There are a number of agriculture sprayers designed for spraying applications and designed to be versatile and suitable for various uses from spot applications, gardens, crops, row crops, crop trees, fruit, groves, vineyards, perimeter maintenance, livestock needs, weed control, pastures and rangeland.

Early life Sherlock was born on 1 October 1981 in Derby, England, to Rob and Karen Sherlock. He started out playing for his hometown's BBL franchise, the Derby Storm, when he was just 17, before moving on to Mansfield Express in 1999, where he played alongside future Newcastle Eagles teammate Andrew Bridge. United States schooling In 2000 Sherlock moved to the United States to begin his basketball education at Mid-Prairie High School in Wellman, Iowa. He played one season in Iowa averaging 18 pts, 9 rebounds, 3 steals and 1 block per game gaining a McDonald's All-American nomination. On moving to college he found himself in Wayne, Nebraska at Wayne State College where the Wildcats play in the NCAA Division II basketball programme out of the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC). Tom majored in computer information systems in a five-year college stay. He spent his first year in 2001–02 sitting out as a red-shirt. His college career started in 2002–03 playing in 26 games. Earning 13 starts he finished the season with a 3.5 pts and 2.4 rebounds per game average. He led the team in 3-point % and was third on blocked shots. In 2003–04 he played in 24 games averaging 3.1 pts and 1.5 rebounds. Second on the team in blocks he had a 48.2% field goal percentage and shot 71.4% from the charity stripe. In 2004–05 where he appeared in 23 games and averaged 2.2 points and 1.7 rebounds with a season high performance of 10 pts and 12 rebounds in a 97–75 win at Augustana. Sherlock represented Great Britain Students at the World Student games in Izmir, Turkey (2005). Playing in Turkey and Finland for the representative squad. In his final senior year Sherlock upped his numbers considerably with a 9.2 pts average and a team-high 5.3 boards per game in just 24 minutes. He played in all 25 games of the season with 9 starts and had a career high 19 pts vs Concordia University, Saint Paul. He was named top rebounder at the Minnesota State Pepsi Tip Off Classic grabbing 18 boards in two games including a career high 12 vs Minnesota State Mavericks. Ranked 11th in rebounding in the NSIC he was also fifth in field goal shooting at 50% and had a 41.2% average from 3-point range. Sherlock is described as an inside threat that can also hit the long ball, as well as an extremely hard worker who is keen to learn. Post- college Sherlock signed for Newcastle Eagles in 2006 after he was spotted at an open trials session where he was the outstanding player of the two-day camp. He made his professional debut for the Eagles on 29 September 2006, in a home game against title-rivals Sheffield Sharks, and went on to become a key figure in the team's successful Playoff-winning season, as well as picking up a runners-up medal in the BBL Trophy, in his rookie season. Overall, Sherlock played in 30 games during the season, where he averaged 14.8 minutes, 6.73 points and 4.13 rebounds per game. His second season at the club saw reduced minutes in light of a deeper roster and tougher competition. On 30 October 2007 it was announced that Sherlock had left the club by mutual consent. In four games he averaged just 8.84 minutes and 2.5 points per game. He made his debut for hometown club Derby Trailblazers in EBL Division One on 10 November 2007 against West Anglia Fury, coming back from a slight ankle sprain to post 12 points. After just four games Sherlock underwent surgery on his right knee and ankle to cure long-term problems.

The flora consists of many unique varieties of tropical plants. Blessed with a tropical climate and around 17,000 islands, Indonesia is a nation with the second largest biodiversity in the world. The flora of Indonesia reflects an intermingling of Asian, Australian and the native species. This is due to the geography of Indonesia, located between two continents. The archipelago consists of a variety of regions from the tropical rain forests of the northern lowlands and the seasonal forests of the southern lowlands through the hill and mountain vegetation, to subalpine shrub vegetation. Having the second longest shoreline in the world, Indonesia also has many regions of swamps and coastal vegetation. Combined together, these all give rise to a huge vegetational biodiversity. There are about 28,000 species of flowering plants in Indonesia, consisting 2500 different kinds of orchids, 6000 traditional medicinal plants used as Jamu., 122 species of bamboo, over 350 species of rattan and 400 species of Dipterocarpus, including ebony, sandalwood and teakwood. Indonesia is also home to some unusual species such as carnivorous plants. One exceptional species is known as Rafflesia arnoldi, named after Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and Dr. Thomas Arnold, who discovered the flower in the depths of Bengkulu, southwest Sumatra. This parasitic plant has a large flower, does not produce leaves and grow on a certain liana on the rain forest floor. Another unusual plant is Amorphophallus titanum from Sumatra. Numerous species of insect trapping pitcher plants (Nepenthes spp.) can also be found in Borneo, Sumatra, and other islands of the Indonesian archipelago.  Origin of Indonesian flora  The origin of flora in Indonesia is heavily affected by geographical and geological events in Asian continent and 8Australasian continent (now Australia). The present New Guinea island was connected with the present Australia continent, forming a supercontinent called the southern supercontinent Gondwana. This supercontinent began to break up 140 million years ago, and the New Guinea region (previously known as Sahul) moved towards the equator. As a result, animals from New Guinea travelled to Australian continent and vice versa, creating many different species living in different ecosystems. These activities still occur until the two regions separated completely. Asian continent influences, on the other hand, is the result of the reformation of the Laurasia supercontinent, which existed after the break-up of Rodinia around 1 billion years ago. Around 200 million years ago, the Laurasia supercontinent split completely, forming Laurentia (now America) and Eurasia continents. Although this occurred, the mainland of the Eurasia continent, including China, was not separated completely from the Indonesian archipelago. As a result, plants from the Eurasia mainland could propagate to the archipelago, and, under a different ecosystems, new forms of species were formed In the nineteenth century, Alfred Russel Wallace proposed the idea of the Wallace Line, which is a line that divides Indonesian archipelago into two regions, the Asian biogeographical region (Sundaland) and the Australasia biogeographical Region (Wallacea). The line runs through the Indonesian Archipelago, between Borneo and Sulawesi (Celebes); and between Bali and Lombok. The Indonesian archipelago, home of the Spice Islands, has been known since ancient time as the source of spices, such as clove, nutmeg, and pepper. The Maluku Islands were, until the late eighteenth century, the only source of economically significant spices. In the colonial time, clove and nutmeg were the most valuable commodities after gold and silver for the most Europeans. During the Dutch colonial era in Indonesia, the Dutch also created many plantages (plantations) of coffee, tea and sugar cane, mostly in Java. Along with the history of Indonesia the sailors from India, China and Europe have brought also new kinds of plant species to this archipelago. Plant species, which are not native to this archipelago, such as tea, coffee and rubber tree are then established.  Vegetation types  The Distribution of Indonesian vegetation Indonesia’s terrestrial flora can be collected into characteristic vegetation groups. The most important determinant is rainfall, followed by temperature which affects water availability. The distribution of Indonesian flora is dominated by the broadleaf evergreen forests. This is mostly seen in the regions where population density is still relatively low, such as Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi and West Papua. On Java and Bali the vegetation is dominated by cultivated plants. Swamp forests, mangrove, and Nypa fruticans forests are found along the coast. On the mountainous regions subalpine and alpine vegetation is dominant. In the lesser Sunda islands, where rainfall is not as plentiful as in other parts of Indonesia, grasslands are regularly seen.  Biodiversity  The flower of Amorphophallus titanum at Bogor Botanical Gardens According to the Conservation International, there are two biodiversity hotspots in Indonesia: Wallacea and Sundaland. The provinces of West Papua and Papua are also extremely biodiverse. Lorentz National Park, located in the province of Papua, was declared a World Heritage Site in 1999 by UNESCO.  Sundaland  Sundaland, which is located on the west part of the Indonesian archipelago, holds about 25,000 different species of plants. 15,000 of them are endemic to this region and cannot be found anywhere else. Scyphostegiaceae is a plant family represented by a single species, Scyphostegia borneensis, which is endemic to Borneo. Another 155 species of Dipterocarpus are also endemic to this island. Borneo also has more than 2,000 species of orchids. The forests in Sumatra include more than 100 species of Dipterocarpus, nearly a dozen of them are endemic to this island. The island Java has about 270 endemic orchid species. At least 117 plant genera are endemic to this biodiversity hotspot. 59 of them are found in Borneo and 17 in Sumatra. Unique plants from this region are similar to ones from the Asian continent, mentioning Rafflesia arnoldii, the pitcher plants and Javanese Edelweiss (Anaphalis javanica) as examples. Flowers of Eucalyptus deglupta  Wallacea  It is estimated, that there are about 10,000 species of plants in this biodiversity hotspot region. About 1,200 species and 12 genera are endemic. The island of Sulawesi has about 500 endemic plant species. The islands of Moluccas have about 300 endemic plant species and the Lesser Sunda Islands consist of at least 110 endemic plant species. Little is known about the flora of this region. Three of these unique species, Agathis, Pterocarpus indicus and Eucalyptus deglupta, are mentioned as examples.  West Papua and Papua  The flora of this region has somewhat the influence of the Australian continent. This region contain a continuous transect from snow cap mountains, lowland wetlands to tropical marine environment. This is the perfect place for such a huge number of diverse plant species. It has been estimated that Papua and west Papua may contain from 20,000 to 25,000 species of vascular plants. An astonishing 60-90% of them may be endemic to this region. This region has been poorly explored so the actual number of endemic species is unknown. Indonesia's national flowers Melati (Jasminum sambac), a small white flower with a sweet fragrance, is the national flower of Indonesia, together with Anggrek Bulan (Phalaenopsis amabilis) and Padma Raksasa Rafflesia (Rafflesia arnoldii). All three were chosen on World Environment Day on 5 June 1990 by President Soeharto. On the other occasion Bunga Bangkai (Titan arum) was also added as puspa langka together with Rafflesia. Each of Indonesian provinces also have their own floral emblems. National love flora and fauna day To build respect and love for the Indonesian flora and fauna, the Government has declared 5 November as the national love flora and fauna day. Annually there are postage stamps released with this motto. They show pictures of plants and animals, which are endemic or unique to a specific region or a province of Indonesia. Current issues Deforestation is a major problem in Indonesia. The current rate is a loss of 2 million hectares per year. As a highly populous country with the tendency of rapid industrialisation, the need of natural resources and land also increases. Illegally created wildfire causes heavy smog around Indonesia's neighbour countries. According to the Indonesian department of forestry, there are currently 174 plants endemic to Indonesia listed as endangered species. Maintaining the balance between the need of economical growth of the country and the preservation of its natural heritage is not an easy duty. Just like other developing nations, Indonesia is currently trying to keep this balance. Ecotourism might be one solution to this problem. Using the biodiversity, Indonesia might improve the economical status of its isolated regions.

Hillerman won an Emmy for the role in 1987. The character of Higgins appeared in crossover episodes of two other television shows: Simon & Simon in 1982, and Murder, She Wrote in 1986. Origin Although the character is English, actor John Hillerman was born in Texas and served in the U.S. Air Force. Hillerman practiced the English accent in onstage productions in Ohio before taking the accent to Hollywood. The character widely known as Jonathan Higgins began life as Simon Brimmer in the 1975 TV movie Ellery Queen: Too Many Suspects and the 1975–1976 TV series Ellery Queen. Brimmer was an arrogant and self-assured character who used these personality traits as a foil to Ellery Queen (Jim Hutton). Hillerman said that playing a snob came easily to him. Fictional character biography The character Higgins was born sometime in the year 1920. In the episode \\"Echoes of the Mind\\" he reveals that he is the second son of the Duke of Perth. a retired senior British Army officer, and Baron of Perth in his own right, though he rarely uses the title. He went to school at Eton College and Sandhurst Military College, but was sent down from the latter after another officer cadet allowed him to take the blame for a prank that had resulted in the serious injury of a third cadet. Higgins obeyed an honour code among the cadets by not revealing the true identity of the culprit at the cost of being himself being rejected by Sandhurst for an officer's commission. Unable to face his father, he enlisted into the ranks of the West Yorkshire Regiment and he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Higgins has three half brothers, portrayed on the show by Hillerman. The first was a Texan, Elmo Ziller. The second was an Irish priest, Father Paddy McGuinness. The third was Don Luis Mongueo. A fourth named Soo Ling is mentioned but never seen. The character served for 37 years in the British military in the Second World War, the Indochina War (assisting the French), New Guinea, India, and Kenya, among others. Higgins carried the discipline of his military background into his civilian life. Higgins earned the rank of sergeant major in the British Army, and was in MI6 of the British Secret Service. The character holds a 1947 doctorate in mathematics from University of Cambridge. This is revealed when he tells a pregnant woman (correctly, though misleadingly) that he is \\"a doctor\\".Magnum, P.I., Season 3, Episode 22, \\"The Big Blow\\" He owns two highly trained and extremely intelligent Doberman Pinschers, Zeus and Apollo (to whom he often refers as \\"The Lads\\"). Higgins is well versed in combat techniques, both armed and unarmed (kung fu) combat. He expresses fondness for older British Army weaponry such as the Sten and Sterling submachine guns, although he is more than capable of using modern weaponry such as the Heckler & Koch MP5. There is a small collection of weaponry (mostly pistols and shotguns) at the estate for him and Magnum to use as needed. Occasional episodes show Higgins utilizing less common weapons, such as a 19th-century brass cannon and a samurai sword. Like Magnum, he does not make a habit of carrying a gun all the time. In regard to his personal life, Higgins once was nearly engaged to be married; years later his old flame visits him in Hawaii. He described her as being built like the Prince Albert Memorial. Higgins is the estate manager for Robin Masters's beachfront estate on Oahu, called \\"Robin's Nest\\". The rich, eccentric (and perpetually travelling) Masters was a largely offstage character on the show, though frequently referred to. After Orson Welles (who voiced Robin Masters) died, the show's writers decided to have Thomas Magnum, a private investigator and Head of Security for Robin's Nest, begin to suspect Higgins is Robin Masters. This took some retconning, as Higgins had been shown alone in a room conversing on a speakerphone with Robin Masters. As well, there were numerous other examples of Masters being a different person from Higgins ... but Magnum came to suspect these were staged with the help of an actor hired by Higgins to portray \\"Masters\\". The idea that Higgins could secretly be Masters became a long running gag in the series after Thomas told his friends Theodore \\"T.C.\\" Calvin, and Orville \\"Rick\\" Wright about his idea. In the final episode of the series, Higgins tells Magnum that he really is Robin Masters. However, Higgins later recants at Rick's wedding.  Character  Higgins plays Magnum's foil. Higgins has been described as representing \\"the pomposity, elitism, and stuffiness of the Old Guard (literally and figuratively)\\". John Hillerman has stated, \\"Higgins in any situation thinks he's the only sane person around while everyone else is raving mad.\\" Despite this, all four main protagonists formed close friendships, although there were the constant squabbles. In one episode, a rabbi recounts an encounter with a young Higgins. He describes how in 1946 Higgins refused a standing order to fire on Jewish refugees trying to reach Palestine. When asked how he could disobey, Higgins replied, \\"I was obeying a higher law that does not permit me to shoot unarmed refugees looking for a home.\\" Higgins is known for his tendency to ramble when someone asks him a question. He usually manages to relate it to a story in either Korea or World War II, but sometimes other events. In one episode, when he is being robbed by people in costume, he says, \\"I believe I've been in a situation much like this ... actually, no, this is a first ... but I read about something like this once.\\" Crossover with Murder, She Wrote Higgins is revealed to be a fan of Jessica Fletcher in the crossover episode with Murder, She Wrote and helped her free Magnum from prison in the Murder, She Wrote episode \\"Magnum On Ice\\". \\"Magnum On Ice\\" is the conclusion of the Magnum P.I. episode \\"Novel Connection\\", which had a crossover with Murder, She Wrote. 2018 reboot For the 2018 reboot, Higgins was re-written as a woman, named Juliet Higgins, portrayed by Perdita Weeks. In the reboot, Higgins has a more active past in British military intelligence, having been a field operative (\\"the first woman to infiltrate the Russian Secret Police\\" according to her mentor and a Russian spy after Magnum). She was also \\"widowed\\" in the field when her fiance, a fellow operative, was murdered by a contract killer she later unmasked as her mentor. It is also implied that she may be related to Robin Masters; in the reboot, Magnum describes Masters as having been \\"embedded with the troops\\", making this the first instance that either Magnum or Higgins has actually met Masters. Unlike the original Higgins, Juliet is more taciturn and curt and does not ramble. She retains the \\"lads\\" (Zeus and Apollo, two highly trained Doberman Pinschers) of the original Higgins, but enjoys setting them on Magnum in retaliation for his using the \\"privileges\\" of Robin's Nest more than the original one. This Higgins is more involved in Magnum's cases than the original, to the point that she is considered a member of Magnum's squad: he requests that she formally partner up with him in the second season, and she eventually accepts. In episode 17 Juliet says she has trouble with her visa, Thomas asks her to marry him to get her green card. She refuses at first, but later in the episode when she finds out that her lawyer can’t do anything about she accepts Magnum’s proposal, although she breaks the engagement three episodes later. Robin agrees to let her become the owner of Robin's Nest, which allows her to stay in the country.

Established in 1942 surrounding Albro Lake, then several kilometres north of the town of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, NRS Albro Lake was divided into two locations; the primary receiving site was located on the grounds of NRS Albro Lake, and its primary transmitting site was located at NRS Newport Corner, 50 kilometres northwest (NRS Newport Corner being a sub-unit of NRS Albro Lake). NRS Albro Lake also had secondary transmitting capabilities for forwarding along transmissions it received. Its callsign was CFH and it was constructed for $6 million. It could receive from (and transmit to, through NRS Newport Corner) locations halfway across the world, stretching from Murmansk, Russia to the Falkland Islands. The facility was instrumental in helping allied navies during the Battle of the Atlantic in combating the U-boat threat. NRS Albro Lake was renamed HMCS Albro Lake on July 1, 1956. Dartmouth's growth during the post-war years degraded radio reception as the town became a city by the early 1960s. Unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968 resulted in HMCS Albro Lake closing. CFS Mill Cove opened in 1967 as the replacement receiving station. The site of NRS Albro Lake is now occupied by Highfield Park housing development.

A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage (2001) p. 679 Early development The word praecipe moved from the Roman Empire into the medieval latin of the English Chancery, and so reached English law. In the twelfth century, writs praecipe, addressed to sheriffs,G. O. Sayles, The Medieval Foundations of England (London 1966) p. 333 emerged as the swiftest way to bring legal disputes to the royal courts.J. R. Tanner ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol V (Cambridge 1926) p. 588 While the so-called possessory assizes, such as Novel Disseisin, had marked a great advance in royal justice, they proved too rigid for the full complexities of land law, and so had to be supplemented by more specialised praecipe writs, such as Praecipe for Dower, or Praecipe Quod Reddat.S. H. Steinberg ed., A New Dictionary of British History (London 1963) p. 123 and p. 284 The latter, one of the so-called writs of entry, was singled out in Magna Carta Ch 34 by the barons in an attempt (largely unsuccessful) to delimit more firmly private from royal jurisdiction.G. O. Sayles, The Medieval Foundations of England (London 1966) p. 401 North American usage In law in the United States a praecipe is a document that either (A) commands a defendant to appear and show cause why an act or thing should not be done;B. A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage (2001) p. 679 or (B) requests the clerk of court to issue a writ and to specify its contents, [though US Clerks are variously limited to handle minor precepts (typical status adjustments) in the name of the Court (i.e., a Clerk cannot issue any forceful or mandamus writ)].. The writ was often issued to amend or change a subsequent order or to correct an error that may have been missed earlier. Its appearance in American law is not surprising, as many of the English customs and traditions were passed on. In Canada Praecipe is used in place of a notice of motion as an application for a desk order that is granted in the court registry without a hearing before a judge. Indian Usage At the Bombay High Court and the City Civil & Sessions Court for Greater Bombay, a Praecipe is used in all communications between Advocates and the Court. It serves as a covering letter for the filing of documents with the registry and other registry work. Praecipes are also used in order to motion the Judge, either in court or in chambers in order to place a matter for early listing or in order to seek urgent ad-interim reliefs. Praecipes in India are usually in the form of a letter addressed to the Registrar of that particular court.

It is named in honor of the Benedictine monk Saint Anselm of Canterbury. The complex is under the care and oversight of the Benedictine Confederation and it's Abbot Primate. History The buildings were designed by Belgian Benedictine Abbot Hildebrand de Hemptinne and Fidelis von Stotzingen. Sant'Anselmo is built in a neo-romanic style, atop of Roman ruins which date from the 1st century BC to the 4th century AD. These remains are visible and visitable, by arrangement, under both the first courtyard and in the basement. The church is mainly known to the local Roman people because of the performance of Gregorian chant for Ora Media (mid-day prayer at 12:50 pm each day) and Vespers (evening prayer at 7:15 pm each day). Lauds (morning prayer) and Mass are chanted in Italian. The church was built by Francesco Vespignani between 1892 and 1896, on a land given by the Knights of Malta to the Benedictines. Vespignani built it according to the project of Abbot Hildebrand de Hemptinne. The church is made of three naves, divided by granite columns. The ceiling is a truss and the apse is covered by a mosaic. The crypt is made of 5 naves. The church has a basilica plan, and the apse mosaics depict the jeweled cross between angels and Saints Benedict and Anselm, the work of the German monk Radbodus Commandeur. The paschal candlestick is modern but in the Cosmatesque style. The lower level has now been converted to the use of the library for the University. Next to the entrance of the lower level library is a statue of St Benedict, with his arms raised in prayer - the posture in which he died. Church of Sant'Anselmo In the courtyard of the atrium, there is a bronze statue of St Anselm, made in the late 20th century by Swiss sculptor A. Wider from Widnau. From here, it is possible to see Santa Maria del Priorato of the Knights of Malta, which lies in an adjacent complex that is closed to the public. In the entrance to the monastery, reached from the atrium, is a Roman mosaic of Orpheus mosaic that was found when the college was built.Nyborg Sant’Anselmo is a triple institution: the place of academic studies (the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm) – originally for the Benedictines, but also open to external students; the college (collegio), where the monks, religious and priests who study both at the University and at the other Roman pontifical universities live; and the Curia of the Benedictine Abbot Primate, the highest representative and coordinator of the Benedictine Confederation. The Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm includes faculties of Philosophy, Theology, Monastic Studies, and the Institute of Historical Theology, as well as the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy. The Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm grants certificates and diplomas in various subjects, as well as Bachelor, Licentiate, and Doctoral degrees.

At its foot is the imposing crag of Castle Rock, on which rock climbers have developed some 60 named routes. Topography Seen from the west, Watson's Dodd is a noticeable shoulder on the Helvellyn ridge, north of Sticks Pass. The summit stands on the main ridge of the Helvellyn range at the point where the south-west ridge of Great Dodd and the north-west ridge of Stybarrow Dodd meet and merge. From this point a shoulder drops into the valley of the How Beck at Legburthwaite. This shoulder, part of the High Fells of St John's Common, is sharply defined by the deep valleys of Mill Gill to its north and Stanah Gill to its south. It slopes gently to around the 500 m contour, and then drops more steeply into the valley over a number of rocky crags. Just before reaching the valley, part of this shoulder rises again to the high, precipitous crag known as Castle Rock.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 Explorer map On the eastern side of the ridge the deep valley of Browndale Beck separates Great Dodd from Stybarrow Dodd, so that Watson's Dodd has no eastern flanks at all other than its triangular summit plateau. The highest point on Watson's Dodd has an elevation of 789 m, a prominence of only 11 m above the slight depression separating it from Stybarrow Dodd. Watson's Dodd stands on the main watershed between the Derwent river system to the west, and Ullswater (and the Eden river system) to the east. Streams on the west are now captured by a water leat and diverted into Thirlmere reservoir. Castle Rock Standing at the top of the Vale of St John's, the nearly vertical Castle Rock juts out from the hillside with rock faces on three sides. The castle-like profile is made still more picturesque by a garland of mixed woodland around the lower slopes. This rock has attracted the admiring views of visitors since the start of tourism to the Lakes. Thomas West in 1778 referred to the valley ‘nobly terminated by the castle-like rock of St. John’.Thomas West, A Guide to the Lakes, Kendal, 1778 — available online at Jonathan Otley in 1823 knew the rock as ‘the massive rock of Green Crag, sometimes called the Castle Rock of St. John's’.Jonathan Otley, A Concise Description of the English Lakes, Keswick, 1823 - available online at The Scottish lawyer and novelist Sir Walter Scott, wrote his romantic narrative- poem The Bridal of Triermain in 1812. In this, Castle Rock appears as the setting for the Enchanted Castle from which the hero, Sir Roland de Vaux of Triermain, must rescue the maiden, Gyneth. Triermain was the name of a fiefdom in the barony of Gilsland in north-east Cumberland; a pele-tower near Birdoswald still bears the name. The association with Walter Scott's poem has sometimes led Castle Rock to be called Castle Rock of Triermain, especially by rock climbers in order to distinguish it from another Castle Rock in Gloucestershire. Climbers have discovered and named over 60 routes up the rock. The precipitous North Crag (75 metres / 246 feet high) was first climbed by Jim Birkett on April Fools' Day, 1939, by a route called Overhanging Bastion. Since 2011 the North Crag has been considered dangerous because a large crack has opened up at the top creating the potential for a massive rockfall. South Crag (35 metres / 115 feet high) is less steep, sunnier and quicker-drying, and holds the less difficult routes. The summit of Castle Rock has an elevation of 339 m (1,112 ft), with a prominence of 29 m (95 ft) from the fellside behind it. Summit The summit of Watson's Dodd, seen from the cairn, with Great Dodd (left) and Stybarrow Dodd (right) The summit of Watson's Dodd is a grassy triangular plateau which slopes gently to the east and is bounded by paths on all three sides. Its highest point, at the western apex of the triangle, is marked by a small cairn. The view from the summit is ‘sumptuous’. Standing to the west of the main ridge, the summit gives a panoramic view from Blencathra and Skiddaw in the north, round to the Coniston group in the south. The view extends over Thirlmere to the central fells, and is bounded by the western and northwestern fells. On a clear day the hills of south-west Scotland are also visible. Ascents Routes to the top begin from the B5322 road, where parking is available at Legburthwaite or at Stanah village hall. There are no marked paths up the fellside. Keeping to the crest of the ridge (after avoiding the initial rocky crags, or after visiting Castle Rock if wished) leads unfailingly to the summit cairn. The summit may also be visited by following the well-used paths along the main Helvellyn ridge, though many ridge walkers appear to bypass the summit. Geology The rocks of Watson's Dodd are all part of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, formed on the margin of an ancient continent during a period of intense volcanic activity, roughly 450 million years ago in the Ordovician Period. Within that group, the bulk of the rocks forming the fell belong to the Birker Fell Andesite Formation. These rocks are among the earliest of the volcanic rocks of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, and are part of a thick succession of andesite sheets which now outcrop in a wide band around the western and northern sides of the Lake District. \\\\- may be viewed on the or on the BGS's iGeology smartphone app These sheets were formed by successive eruptions of mobile andesitic lava from shallow-sided volcanoes. Between the individual lava flows may be beds of volcaniclastic sandstone, sedimentary deposits formed from the erosion of the volcanic rocks. The geological map shows small deposits of this on the fellside, as well as some lapilli-tuff resulting from a more explosive eruption. A piece of welded ignimbrite of the Thirlmere Tuff Member, showing flattened lapilli - found on the path between Great Dodd and Stybarrow Dodd After the eruptions of the Birker Fell Formation the composition of the erupting magma changed from andesitic to dacitic, and as a result the nature of the volcanism became more explosive. In the area to the north of Sticks Pass the Birker Fell andesites are overlain by the Lincomb Tarns Tuff Formation. This formation is one of the most widespread of the volcanic rocks of the Lake District; it seems that the whole district was buried beneath at least 150 m of densely welded ignimbrite, a rock formed from pyroclastic flows of very hot gas and rock. This formation must represent a series of eruptions of truly exceptional magnitude, accompanying the formation of a volcanic caldera, probably in the area around where Helvellyn stands today. On Watson's Dodd this formation is represented by two members. The Tarn Crags Member makes up Castle Rock, as well as a thin layer higher up the fellside at about the 650 m contour. It is a coarse-grained dacitic lapilli-tuff. Above this thin layer are rocks of the Thirlmere Tuff Member, which covers the top of the fell. First is an area of volcaniclastic breccia, which forms a series of small rocky outcrops on the fellside, and above this is a thick sheet of welded rhyo-dacitic lapilli-tuff in which the individual pieces of semi-molten lava (the lapilli) were flattened under the weight of deposits above them. This rock weathers to a white or pink colour, but it is covered by the smooth grassy turf characteristic of Great Dodd, Watson's Dodd and Stybarrow Dodd, all of which are covered by the same sheet. Names Watson's Dodd. Dod or dodd is a dialect word of unknown origin, but is common in hill names in the Lake District and the Scottish Borders for bare rounded summits, either free standing or subsidiary shoulders to higher neighbours. The Watson whose name this fell commemorates is unknown. There may (or may not) be a connection with Watson's Park in the same parish of St John's. If so, since that name is first recorded in 1734, Watson must have lived no later than the early eighteenth century.

The linkspring is a rectangular metal frame (roughly the footprint of the mattress) with cross supports. A wire or polyester/nylon mesh held in place by a network of springs lies across the top of the linkspring. The linkspring design provides support and creates clearance underneath a daybed for storage. There are two categories of modern daybeds, indoor and outdoor.

Plot During the Mikhail Gorbachev years, Platon Makovsky and four buddies of his are university students who jump on the private capitalism movement. Fast-forward 20 years, Platon finds himself the richest man in Russia. But as such, he and his friends are drawn more and more into relations with suspect organizations. They also have to face ever more brutal attempts to subjugate them by the Kremlin. Makovsky attempts to compete with this ever- present political power, by becoming as \\"creating a Kremlin\\" himself. Background The film is based on \\"Bolshaya Paika\\" (\\"The Big Slice\\") - a novel by Yuli Dubov, depicting the real biography of Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky and his partners. Dubov was Berezovsky's partner himself, and a president of his LogoVAZ company. The novel is claimed to be historically precise in many aspects. The names of the characters were changed from their real life counterparts, though keeping resemblance (e.g. Boris Berezovsky, who changed his name to Platon Elenin in exile in 2004, to Platon Makovsky, Badri Patarkatsishvili to Lari Teishvili, etc.) In June 2009, Dubov and Berezovsky were convicted in absentia (at that time, they were both living in exile in England) in a Russian court for the events that served as the basis for the book to 9 and 13 years of imprisonment respectively. The book served as one of the pieces of evidence against them.

His editorial attacks on area politicians were so unrelenting that a state law was passed specifically to shut down his paper. The legal battle that followed led to a landmark Supreme Court decision affirming the unconstitutionality of prior restraint laws.  Early years  Morrison was born in Tabor, Iowa, the first of five children by Joshua L. Morrison and Martha Abigail Gardner. The Morrisons were a puritanical Christian family. Every morning, after breakfast, they held a family worship, and John and his siblings were all taught to abstain from alcohol, smoking and gambling. After graduating from Tabor College, Morrison went to work teaching school in Western, Nebraska. While in Western, he published the first Ripsaw newspaper. He is also believed to have published similar papers, or at least worked in the journalism field, in Missouri and Montana, as well as Crete, Friend and DeWitt, Nebraska. From 1889 to 1890, Morrison was in Kansas City, where he worked as a police reporter for the Kansas City Daily Times. He came to Duluth in 1893, and that fall he was hired as a reporter for the Duluth Evening Herald. After seven months at the Herald, he joined the paper's new organized labor department as an editor, attending and reporting on labor functions for two years. Morrison became a regularly elected honorary member of the Trades Assembly, and, in the spring of 1895, was asked to speak at an executive meeting about the boycott of the Imperial Mill's flour products. He spoke critically of B. C. Church, president of the mill. According to Morrison, that made Church “very angry, as autocrats usually are when a commoner criticizes them.” Church allegedly demanded Morrison be discharged from the Herald, threatening to cancel his advertising in the paper. Morrison's employment at the Herald was, indeed, swiftly terminated. Just as swiftly, Morrison was hired as editor of the labor department at the Duluth News Tribune. He held the position until News Tribune manager A. E. Chantler's contract expired in January 1896. The new manager, A. F. Hammond, quickly fired Morrison, refusing, according to Morrison, to give any reason. Morrison took an active part in Henry Truelsen's successful 1896 campaign for Duluth mayor. Truelsen's candidacy was opposed by both daily papers and corporate interests, which strongly backed conservative candidate Charles Allen. In 1896, Morrison also briefly published a paper called the Duluth Citizen. After Truelsen's election, however, Morrison left Duluth, returning to Kansas City. What he did there and how long he stayed is unknown, but his consistent listing in the Duluth city directory suggests it was a short move. Over the next 10 years, Morrison changed careers frequently and lived mostly in hotel rooms. The city directory listed him as a “correspondent” for the Herald in 1897. The next year he was listed as a travel agent, and, by 1900, he was a “correspondent” again, but no employer is mentioned. During the early 1900s, Morrison was listed in the directory as a reporter, travel agent, real estate man, broker, secretary of the Dividend Development Company, messenger for William Mies and, from 1908 to 1910, a “prospector.” Following that, his listing reads either “mining” or “mines and mining” through 1916. What exactly Morrison's involvement was with the mining industry throughout those years is unclear, although one account in the Duluth Herald reports he was “engaged in newspaper work for mining journals.” In 1916, Morrison returned to publishing with his first and only book, The Booster Book: West Duluth in 1916.  The Ripsaw  Morrison's Duluth Ripsaw debuted on March 24, 1917. Issues were published every other Saturday, although on more than one occasion Morrison was overwhelmed by the task of producing the paper by himself, and took three weeks to finish a new issue, working almost entirely by himself. “The Ripsaw is a genuine one-man sawmill,” he wrote in the July 13, 1918 editorial. “The entire work, snaking out dead- heads, filing the saw, piling the product, getting it to the market, even loading and billing it, falls on one man. It often takes 18 hours a day and seven days a week to do all that half way creditably, to say nothing of brilliantly.” Morrison's specialty was digging into the “unholy and undesirable alliance” between lawmakers and lawbreakers. During the Ripsaw's first year, Duluth Chief of Police Robert McKercher and City Auditor “King” Odin Halden were both ousted from their positions after being labeled crooked by Morrison.  Criminal libel  In 1924, Morrison took on state Sen. Mike Boylan, Cass County Probate Judge Bert Jamison and former Hibbing mayor Victor L. Power. Jamison and Power both quickly sought to have Morrison jailed for libel. Boylan's revenge came later. Morrison wrote that Jamison had acquired syphilis at a brothel, but numerous affidavits from hospitals and doctors indicated Jamison's 12 surgeries were due to glandular troubles caused by tuberculosis, not syphilis. Morrison was found guilty and sentenced to 90 days in the Cass County jail, but raised bail and returned to Duluth pending appeal. Alfred Lambert, the source of Morrison's story, was also tried for slander and criminal libel, and sentenced to 30 days in the county jail. Power sued Morrison during his 1924 campaign for Congress. Morrison had accused Power of taking money from undesirable clients, then abandoning them. He also quoted Mesabi Hotel employees who told him Power had one night “crawled into bed so beastly drunk ... that he used his couch as a privy or puking place entirely without the help of cathartic or emetic.” Power claimed Morrison's article was written for the sole purpose of injuring him politically. He told the Duluth News Tribune he was going against the advice of his campaign committee by bringing up the charges against Morrison before the election. He alleged the Ripsaw article was “instigated by the opposition camp,” and that Morrison was the advertising manager of his opponent. Furthermore, he suggested that Morrison was “preparing extra copies of his paper to be delivered to the opposition for special circulation.” Power vowed to have anyone who circulated the Ripsaw arrested, saying those who circulate the paper “are as liable to the same prosecution as the publisher.” Power lost the congressional election, and his trial against Morrison began on Dec. 3, 1924. State Rep. George Lommen was the first to take the witness stand on Power's behalf. Morrison had attacked Lommen in the past, accusing him of collecting bribes from the operators of slot machines, as well as declaring that he was such a flip-flopping “political chameleon,” he would probably end up a Communist. Lommen accused Morrison of bringing forth the libelous attacks because he and Power had not bought enough political advertising in the Ripsaw. Morrison's trial was the longest in Hibbing, Minnesota history at the time. In the end, after five hours of deliberating, the jury found Morrison guilty. He was sentenced to 90 days in the county workhouse. He immediately appealed. On June 1, 1925, Morrison was ordered to make a public apology to Power. Morrison told the court and Power that he was sorry if the Ripsaw “had cost Mayor Power the election.” The charges against Morrison were dropped and his sentence rescinded. Later that month, Morrison pleaded guilty to the charges of criminal libel brought by Jamison. Judge W. S. McClennehan reduced the sentence to a $100 fine, which so pleased Morrison that he attempted to make a speech thanking the judge. McClennehan pounded his fist on his desk and admonished Morrison. “I don’t think any more of you, sir, than I do this damn desk,” he shouted.  Minnesota Gag Law  In the summer of 1925, Sen. Boylan worked with Rep. Lommen to draft several bills that would allow the suppression of scandalous newspapers. Senator Freyling Stevens, a powerful lawyer, introduced the Senate version of what would become known as the “Minnesota Gag Law,” which made publishers of “malicious, scandalous and defamatory” newspapers guilty of creating a public nuisance, and allowed a single judge, without jury, to stop a newspaper or magazine from publishing, a practice known legally as \\"prior restraint\\", since it in effect declares the publisher to be guilty of libel even prior to the allegedly libellous material having ever appeared in print circulation, and suppresses its appearance. In the April 6, 1926, Ripsaw, Morrison attacked Minneapolis Mayor George Emerson Leach and Duluth Commissioner of Public Utilities W. Harlow Tischer. A temporary restraining order was quickly placed on the Ripsaw by State District Judge H. J. Grannis of Duluth. Morrison was set to appear in court on May 15, 1926, but he fell ill. Three days later he was rushed to St. Francis Hospital in Superior at around 1am. Nine hours later, he was pronounced dead. The cause was reported in the Herald to be an embolism, a blood clot on the brain. The Herald reported that Morrison “had been ill for 10 days, suffering from pleurisy following an attack of influenza, a general breakdown and attacks of syncope.”  Aftermath  Morrison's funeral at Bell Brothers Mortuary in West Duluth was well-attended. Mayor Samuel Snively and City Commissioner W. S. McCormick eulogized Morrison as a good man. His body was sent back to his birthplace, Tabor, Iowa. Morrison's wife, Nora, was 49 when he died. They had two children: John L. Jr., who died a few years after his father, and Mattie Bell, who went on to have a successful career in politics in the Chicago area. Tischer continued to insist the injunction against the Ripsaw be maintained, even after Morrison's death. Judge E. J. Kenney, however, allowed a continuation of the paper, but without its “head sawyer,” the paper ceased. In 1927, the gag law was used to shut down the Saturday Press, an anti-Semitic, anti-gangster scandal sheet in Minneapolis. This gave rise to Near v. Minnesota, a pivotal Supreme Court decision that struck down the Public Nuisance Law on June 1, 1931.  References  “Boylan threatens murder.” Oct. 25, 1924 Ripsaw. Friendly, Fred W.

It was constructed with funds raised by a committee of Atlanta citizens and then sold to the city of Atlanta. The structure was dedicated in a pre-inaugural visit from President William Howard Taft in 1909 during which he was served a possum dinner, and the dining hall in which this event took place was named in his honor. The public dedication of the Auditorium took place with the hosting of the inaugural Atlanta Music Festival in May 1909. The Auditorium and Armory also housed the 179th Field Artillery, who stored munitions there as well as using the space for drills. Over the years various concerts, theater productions, operas, balls, and professional wrestling matches were hosted at the auditorium, as were the 1922 to 1932 Southern Conference men's basketball tournaments. One additional event of note was the Gone with the Wind Ball, held in conjunction with the 1939 premiere of the film. The building originally had a red brick facade. After a 1940 fire the original architect, John Robert Dillon, redesigned the exterior and it was rebuilt with a marble facade. Until Woodruff Arts Center opened, the Municipal Auditorium was the home of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Prior to the GSU sale the building housed an Austin concert pipe organ, typical of such turn of the century municipal halls (Chattanooga's Soldiers and Sailor's Auditorium still has theirs). It was (poorly) located in the ceiling space above the stage. By around 1970 it was used only two weeks in the Spring when most of the Atlanta High Schools held their graduation ceremonies there. Exactly one piece was played, Elgar's \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\". Elton John had a performance there during this tim, wearing a red hotpants jumpsuit. On October 26, 1970 the auditorium hosted the first Muhammad Ali fight in over three years, against Jerry Quarry. Ali had been banned from boxing in over 50 locations due to his refusal to participate in the Vietnam War draft. Atlanta was the first city to offer him a venue to box, effectively breaking the ban. The building was sold in 1979 to Georgia State University which now uses the structure as their Alumni Hall. On September 17, 2010, Georgia State University renamed their Alumni Hall Dahlberg Hall, after alumnus A. W. \\"Bill\\" Dahlberg.

Life Anne was born in Norwich. She and her sister, Annabella [Bell] Plumptre were daughters of Robert Plumptre, became active in the Enfield circle, a local group of literati. Later she became involved in politics during the period of the French Revolution. She published her own fiction, travel writing and political enquiry, as well as many translations of letters, travel writing, drama, and other genres. Anne was the second daughter of Dr. Robert Plumptre, who became President of Queens' College, Cambridge. Her brother James Plumptre was known as a dramatist. She was well educated in foreign languages, particularly in German. She began writing articles in periodicals. The freethinking Alexander Geddes encouraged her. Her first book, a novel in two volumes, entitled Antoinette, was published anonymously, but was acknowledged in a second edition. Anne was one of the first to make German plays known in London, and in 1798 and 1799 translated many of the dramas of Kotzebue, following up this work with a Life and Literary Career of Kotzebue, translated from the German and published in 1801. From 1802 to 1805 she resided in France, and published her experiences in 1810 in the Narrative of a Three Years Residence in France (3 vols.) Lucy Brightwell states that she accompanied John Opie and Amelia Opie to Paris in August 1802. She became well known as a supporter of Napoleon; in 1810 she declared that she would welcome him if he invaded England, because he would do away with the aristocracy and give the country a better government. In 1814-15 she visited Ireland, and recorded her experiences in the Narrative of a Residence in Ireland, published in 1817. It was ridiculed by John Wilson Croker in the Quarterly Review. Her other contributions to literature consist mainly of translations of travels from the French and German. Helen Maria Williams, the poet, was a close friend. She died in Norwich on 20 October 1818, at the age of 58, after a \\"productive and for the most part successful literary career\\" (Shaffer).

Life and politics She was the youngest of three daughters. Her father, Presciliano Martinez Rangel, from Duval County, was orphaned at an early age and was able to attend school for only one year. Her mother, Herminia Lerma, moved with her parents from Starr County to Kingsville. Presciliano worked in farming, ranching, construction, and business. He became a merchant and owned an appliance store, a furniture store, a plumbing service, two barber shops, and a bar. He helped his wife build a successful dress shop located just off the main street of Kingsville, not restricted to the \\"Mexican side\\" of town. In 1947, when Rangel was a teenager, her parents were able to buy some land near Texas College of Arts and Industries and hoped to build a home. But the land was in the \\"Anglo- white\\" district and the neighbors organized against allowing a \\"Mexican\\" family to build in their neighborhood. Ultimately, the family was allowed to design and build the Spanish Colonial style house across from the college campus that Rangel called home until her dying day. Rangel and her sisters grew up in Kingsville, attending the Mexican Ward School for the elementary grades, and the town's only integrated high school. Rangel and her oldest sister decided to attend the Texas College of Arts and Industries, now Texas A&M; University–Kingsville. After graduating with degrees in education, Rangel began teaching in the neighboring community of Robstown. Then she and her oldest sister, Olga, decided to become teachers in an overseas program in Venezuela. This determination to be of service to society and fight for good causes impelled Rangel to return to Texas and attend St. Mary's University Law School. She went on to become one of the first Hispanic female law clerks. After her clerkship with U.S. District Judge Adrian Spears, she became one of the first Hispanic women assistant district attorneys in Texas by working in the District Attorney's office in Nueces County. She returned to Kingsville, where she opened her own law practice and was the only Hispanic woman attorney in the city.Rangel profile, University of Texas at Arlington, Center for Mexican American Studies website; accessed December 13, 2014. In 1974, Rangel began her life in politics by running for, and winning, the chairmanship of the Kleberg County Democratic Party. But she had more ambitious goals and decided to run for a seat in the Texas House of Representatives. She gathered her girlhood friends, family, and a few newcomers to Kingsville and worked hard to win the seat that would make her the only Hispanic woman in the legislature. In 1993, she closed her successful law practice in order to serve her district as a legislator full-time. Upon her death on March 17, 2003, the Mexican American Legislative Caucus of the Texas House issued a news release, which summarized her legislative career. In 1993, she secured $460 million for the South Texas Border Initiative. In the last legislative session, Representative Rangel passed a bill creating the first professional school in South Texas — Texas A&M; Health Science Center - Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy. In 1995, Speaker Pete Laney appointed Rangel Chair of the Texas House Committee on Higher Education. As the first Mexican-American to head the committee, Rangel led the charge to ensure educational opportunities for all children. Rangel joint-authored and sponsored legislation creating the TEXAS Grant I and Grant II Programs, which have allocated millions of dollars in financial support to low-income students. In response to the Hopwood v. Texas decision, which ended affirmative action at all state colleges and universities, Rangel pioneered landmark legislation in 1997 (House Bill 588) which requires state colleges and universities to admit automatically all students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school class. In 1994, Rangel was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame. GEMS television named her Woman of the Year in 1997. In 1998, Rangel became the first Mexican American to receive the Mirabeau B. Lamar Medal from the Association of Texas Colleges and Universities. In 2003, the Mexican American Legislative Foundation Inc., sponsored the inaugural Moreno/Rangel Legislative Leadership Program to encourage the involvement of young Hispanics in the political process. Named for Representatives Rangel and Paul C. Moreno of El Paso, then the dean of the Texas House, the program provides undergraduate and graduate students from across Texas an opportunity to gain first-hand political experience working in the legislature.

Billed as Michael Wadley, he gained notice for his work from critics who followed independent and underground films, but the films, primarily aimed at a specialized and counterculture audience, brought him no financial success. In 1969, Wadleigh undertook the monumental task of documenting the Woodstock Music Festival. He arrived on the site in Bethel, New York on August 15, with over a thousand reels of film and a crew of several camera operators. The finished product was said to have consisted of about 120 miles of footage which, over the next months, was edited down to 184 minutes. Warner Bros., the film's primary financial backer, released it on March 26, 1970. The film, which reportedly cost $600,000 to produce, earned over $50 million in the United States and more millions from foreign rentals, but due to a complicated arrangement with Warner Bros., Wadleigh received only a small percentage of the profits. Woodstock stands as a milestone in the documentary film field, receiving an Academy Award for Documentary Feature at the 1971 ceremony. Janis, a 1974 documentary about Janis Joplin, gave Wadleigh credit as cinematographer for his archive footage, but it would be eleven years after the release of Woodstock before he received his next and, last to date, directorial credit: Wolfen, a unique 1981 horror phantasmagoria, based on the novel The Wolfen by Whitley Strieber, was praised for its dreamlike nature and striking visual quality, but despite a top-notch star turn from Albert Finney, turned out to have been too offbeat for the general public to achieve financial success. Wadleigh also wrote the Wolfen screenplay and has a bit part as \\"Terrorist Informer\\". In August 1994, twenty-four years after its original showing, a 228-minutes \\"director's cut\\" of Woodstock was released, and in 1999, another Woodstock-based documentary, Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock gave Wadleigh another archive footage credit for cinematography.

Based on a true story, the plot centres on Bob and Barbara Jackson (in real life Bill and Ruth Search) and their teenage daughter Julie (in real life Gay Search, later a television reporter and newspaper journalist in the UK.) The Jacksons are friendly with their neighbours, Peter and Helen Kroger, until the couple are arrested and charged with espionage in 1961. It is revealed the Krogers actually are Morris and Lona Cohen, who during the 1950s and 1960s worked with fellow spy Gordon Lonsdale photographing and encoding as microdots various pieces of material which they then sent to their colleagues in Russia, as part of a Soviet espionage network known as the Portland Spy Ring that had penetrated Britain's Royal Navy. Productions The original West End production, starring Judi Dench and her husband, Michael Williams, as the Jacksons, opened on October 26, 1983 at the Lyric Theatre, where it ran for nearly a year. Dench won the Laurence Olivier Award as Best Actress for her performance. After five previews, the Broadway production opened on February 7, 1985 at the Royale Theatre, where it ran for 120 performances. The cast included Rosemary Harris, George N.

History  Gulyás herdsmen with Hungarian Grey cattle, lithograph by Sterio Károly (1821–1862) The breed probably arrived with the ninth-century Hungarian immigration from the east to the Hungarian lowlands. In the Middle Ages and early modern times the breed was used as a draught animal but from 1861 has been bred for early maturity and its beef quality, being herded live to the markets of Europe. Nowadays Hungarian Grey cattle are kept mainly as tourist attractions in the Hortobágy National Park and other Hungarian national parks. Small herds may be found in a few other places, e.g. Bocfölde, Western Hungary. These herds serve as gene banks, due to their reported resistance to cattle diseases which affect more highly bred cattle types. By 1975 there were only 300 cows left in two herds, but numbers have since increased. The rebound in the cattles numbers is partially due to cryoconservation efforts put forth by the Hungarian government.Solti, L., E.g. Crichton, N.m. Loskutoff, and S.

The colour ranges from silvery-white to ash-grey. As in other Podolic breeds, the calves are born wheat-coloured, and become grey at about three months old.

Based on the teachings of Theodor Ratisbonne and Alphonse Ratisbonne, the school is part of a worldwide network of schools founded by the Sisters of Sion. Other Sion Schools can be found in Australia, Canada, Brazil, Costa Rica, France, Turkey, and the United States. The Senior School is situated partially upon the site of the original convent, whilst the Junior School, a conversion of a large Victorian home, is located three roads away. The school's current Head Master is Dr Simon Orchard. The school motto is Consideration Always. History The Ratisbonne Brothers Marie Theodor Ratisbonne, born in 1802, was a French Jewish convert to the Catholic Church, born into a wealthy Jewish banking family in Strasbourg. His younger brother Marie-Alphonse Ratisbonne was born in 1814. Two of thirteen children, their father, Auguste Ratisbonne served as President of the Provincial Council of Alsace.Encyclopedia Judaica: \\"Ratisbonne Brothers\\", Volume 13, pp.1570–1571, Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem, 1972 Hailing from a background of great wealth and prosperity, the Ratisbonne family were notable members of society. The Ratisbonne family were assimilated into the secular society of France, but played an active role in the \\"regeneration\\" of the Jewish people, through education of the poor. Nonetheless, resultant of their assimilation to French society, religious practice did not play a significant part of the family's life. Despite his education at the Royal College of Strasbourg fostering a more academic rather than religious upbringing, Theodor was drawn to religion. Religion was \\"repugnant\\" to him, both his own religion \\"and all other religions\\" too. At the age of 22, following the conversion of many friends, including Emile Dreyfus, Alfred Mayer and Samson Liebermann to Christianity, Theodor spent two years under the guidance of a local Catholic catechist named Louise Humann, studying both Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament. Through his embrace of Christianity, Theodor joined a wave of conversions then taking place in the French Jewish community, triggered by a sense that the Jews could not achieve full integration in French society as long as they remained Jews.Berkowitz, Jay R. (2004). Rites and Passages: The Beginnings of Modern Jewish Culture in France, 1650–1860. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Philadelphia Press. p. 156. He had reached the conclusion that there was a fundamental incompatibility between Judaism and French citizenship. Until his conversion, he was active in the Societe d'Encouragement au Travail en Faveur des Israelites du Bas-Rhin (Society for the Advancement of the Israelites of the Lower Rhine). He later felt that this involvement in Jewish communal affairs was a preparatory step to his baptism. Theodor was subsequently baptized in 1826. In 1830, following his ordainment as a priest, he was rejected by his family, including by his brother Alphonse. Greatly upset by his brother's conversion, Alphonse developed a \\"profound hatred\\" for the Catholic Church. Following the death of their mother, Adelaide Cerfbeer, in 1808, Alphonse was raised by the wider family and his uncle chose him as the successor to his bank. After studying law in Paris, Alphonse joined the family bank and announced his engagement to his 16-year-old niece, Flore. Theodor was made a Knight of the Order of St. Sylvester in 1842 by Pope Gregory XVI. Much of his work was focused upon helping other Jews convert to Christianity. He saw his Jewish heritage as the basis for his faith as a Catholic. On 20 January 1842, during a pleasure trip to Rome in preparation for his marriage, Alphonse entered the Church of Sant'Andrea delle Fratte, in which he experienced a vision of the Virgin Mary, an event that led to his conversion to Catholicism: > “As I walked about the church… there seemed to be one chapel where all the > light was concentrated. Raising my eyes to the chapel, I saw standing on the > altar, tall, vibrant, majestic, full of beauty and mercy, the Blessed Virgin > Mary as she is represented on the Miraculous Medal of the Immaculate > Conception. > At this sight I fell on my knees on the spot where I had been standing; > several times I tried to raise my eyes to the Blessed Virgin, but her > radiance and my feeling of respect made me lower them; this did not prevent > me, however, from being very aware of the apparition. I fixed my eyes on her > hands, and in them I saw evidence of pardon and mercy. In the presence of > the Blessed Virgin Mary, although she did not utter a word, I understood the > horror of the state of my soul, the hideousness of sin, the beauty of the > Catholic religion; in a word, I understood everything.\\" Creation of the Congregation of Our Lady of Sion Upon his baptism, he added Marie to his name. Upon his arrival home, his fiancée rejected his newfound faith and Alphonse entered the Jesuits, being ordained in 1848. Theodor then established a school in 1843 for Jewish children in a Christian setting. Two Jewish sisters came to the school for spiritual advice and were converted, forming the nucleus of the congregation that was to come. In 1852, together the Ratisbonne brothers established the Congregation of the Fathers of Our Lady of Sion. In 1858, Alphonse opened an orphanage and vocational school down the thoroughfare of Via Dolorosa, in Jerusalem, Israel, establishing the Convent of the Sisters of Zion. He purchased many surrounding Arab houses and incorporated the Church of Ecce Homo. Arrival in Worthing Having taught in France and the Holy Land, in 1860, at the invitation of Cardinal Manning, the Sisters arrived in England and settled in Worthing, West Sussex, approximately 500m from the coastline. A school was opened in 1862. Built alongside the convent was the Church of St Mary of the Angels, Worthing, the design of which is attributable to Henry Clutton. Within the convent a chapel was constructed, which remains to this day as part of the school. The old convent floor is marbled, with a symmetrical mosaic pattern running down the hallway, culminating in a circular mosaic pattern. Through the corridor, the \\"Dutch garden\\" can be seen through the sash windows. Upon the site, the Sisters ran three schools; a convent, which became the present school; a \\"poor school\\" which provided free education for orphans under the care of the Sisters and local children whose parents could not afford to pay; and St Elizabeth's, a fee-paying school on Crescent Road for boys up until the age of eight and girls up until the school-leaving age. During the 20th century, the convent school was taught by the Sisters, but over the years an increasing number of lay teachers were employed. The last teaching nun retired in 1999. Every year, the school awards the \\"Sister Una\\" award to a member of the Upper Sixth Form whom it is felt best represents the values of Sion and its motto \\"consideration always\\". In preparation for the hundredth anniversary, in 1962, the school was dramatically expanded by the construction of a new senior school block. The original convent is now a Grade-II listed building, as too is the adjacent church. From 1983, under the stewardship of the first lay Headmaster Brian Sexton, the school began to admit boys into the Sixth Form and eventually expanded into all years. In 2000, Michael Scullion became Headmaster. Upon his retirement in 2015, the current Headmaster Dr Simon Orchard was appointed. The school celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2012. The School Today The school offers a Sixth Form free of charge for students who have attended from Year Seven. Entrance to the Sixth Form requires the minimum attainment of a 54 points from nine GCSEs. Class sizes at Our Lady of Sion School range from between 5 (In the Sixth Form) and 20. The school consistently performs well academically, achieving 43% Grade A*-A and 98% Grade A-C in A-level results in 2017. A 2016 review by the Independent Schools Inspectorate rated the school \\"excellent\\" for the quality of pupils' personal development and \\"good\\" for the quality of pupils' academic achievement. The Sionian is the official school newsletter and is released at the end of each academic term. Once a year there is also a school magazine written and edited entirely by the sixth form. Other Sion Schools Whilst all schools are independent of each other, they are linked through the shared values of the Ratisbonnes and maintain links with the Congregation of Sion. Many participate in an international exchange program, however Our Lady of Sion does not. * Our Lady of Sion College, Australia * Catholic College Sale, Australia * École Bilingue Notre Dame de Sion - St-Laurent, Canada * Colégio Nossa Senhora de Sion, Curitiba, Brazil * Colégio Nossa Senhora de Sion, Higienopolis, Brazil * Escola São Teodoro de Nossa Senhora de Sion, Brazil * Colégio Sion, Brazil * Colegio Nuestra Señora de Sion, San Jose, Costa Rica * Colegio Nuestra Señora de Sion, Turrialba, Costa Rica * Collège et Lycée Notre Dame de Sion, France * Notre-Dame de Sion in Paris, France * Notre-Dame de Sion in Saint Omer, France * Notre-Dame de Sion in Strasbourg, France * Notre- Dame de Sion in Marseille, France * Collège Notre Dame de Sion in Grenoble, France * Lycée Notre Dame de Sion Istanbul, Turkey * Notre Dame de Sion School of Kansas City, USA Old Sionians * Noah Huntley, actor * Roxanne McKee, actress * Alex Coomber, athlete * Nuala Quinn-Barton, film-producer * James Gregory, musician * William Brown, musician References External links * Our Lady of Sion School * Profile on the Independent Schools Council website Category:Independent schools in West Sussex Category:Buildings and structures in Worthing Category:Roman Catholic independent schools in the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton Category:Educational institutions established in 1862 Category:1862 establishments in England ","title":"Our Lady of Sion School"},{"id":"8069673","text":"Villa Ballester is a city located in the northern Greater Buenos Aires urban area and it is part of the General San Martín Partido in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.

Early life Eleanor was born in St. Charles, Illinois to newspaper editor Oscar Walter Johnson and his wife, Alina Vilhelmina Backberg (1885–1968). She had an older brother, Harold Theodore (1908–1968). In early 1912, Alina and her two children had been in Finland visiting her dying father. When they arrived back in England, they were informed that due to a coal strike, the ship they were supposed to sail on had cancelled its trip. It was only at the last minute that they were informed that Titanic had space available. They bought third class tickets to go to New York to get jobs and visit relatives. Aboard the Titanic Eighteen-month-old Eleanor boarded Titanic along with her mother and brother as third class passengers on April 10, 1912 at Southampton, England. They shared a cabin with Elin Braf and Helmina Nilsson. Shortly after the ship struck the iceberg at 11:40 p.m. on April 14, Alina and a cabin mate went out on deck and kicked around pieces of ice that had fallen off the iceberg until an officer told them to get back in their cabins as the ship would be on its way soon. Not long after, a steward who had waited on the Johnsons in the dining room and took a liking to them, knocked on their door and, with a group of fellow Swedes, escorted them to the boat deck and to Lifeboat No. 15. Alina was helped into the boat with Eleanor in her arms and called up to Braf to get in with Harold. Braf remained frozen on deck, so a crewman took Harold from her arms and tossed him into the boat, leaving Braf behind, despite Alina's calls to her. She would perish in the sinking, although Nilsson did escape the ship, possibly in Lifeboat 13.Miss Helmina Nilsson Alina and her children were picked up by the rescue ship and arrived in New York City on April 18. Eleanor admitted that she remembered very little about the night the ship sank, but she insisted that she recalled the screams of passengers and the sight of hands reaching up to her from a lifeboat below. In 1958, Eleanor and Harold attended the New York City premiere of A Night to Remember. Marriage and career In 1934, Eleanor married Delbert Shuman, an International Harvester engineer, and had a son, Earl. They moved to Elgin, Illinois and were married for forty-seven years before he died in 1981. Eleanor worked for the Elgin Watch Company, and later as a telephone operator until her retirement in 1962. Later life and death In 1994, Eleanor visited her son in Florida, and it was the first time she saw the Atlantic Ocean since 1912. Into her 80s, Eleanor remained active in Titanic-related activities. In August 1996, she joined fellow Titanic survivors Michel Navratil and Edith Brown on an expedition cruise to the site of Titanics wreck. She was the only survivor that director James Cameron met while filming Titanic, and as such, received royal treatment. She saw the movie three times including at a special screening with movie critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. She became an instant celebrity after the movie's release and she had to change her telephone number to an unlisted one after receiving several phone calls every day from people hoping to speak with her. She died in Elgin at the age of 87. Her death left six remaining Titanic survivors. References :* Geller, Judith B. Titanic: Women and Children First. 1st ed. W. W. Norton & Company, 1998.

It is the station church for the Thursday of the fifth week in Lent. History The church was founded in the early Middle Ages, probably in the 7th century. It is first mentioned in the Liber Pontificalis under Pope Hadrian I, using spolia from the ruins of an imperial building. The first priests who served the church were probably eastern Basilian monks who had fled from persecution during the iconoclast period. It is listed in the Catalogue of Turin as a papal chapel with eight clerics and in 1574 was granted to the Jesuits by Pope Gregory XIII, and it was used as the church of the next-door Collegium Germanicum in the Palazzo di Sant'Apollinare, which was later united with the Hungarian College to form the Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum. This remained a Jesuit institution until the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, when this church passed to the Lazarists. In the late 17th century, the church was in a poor state of repair. Its rebuilding was considered over a long period but wasn't carried out, probably due to the lack of funds. Despite this, in 1702 a chapel was redecorated and dedicated to St Francis Xavier, and a statue of the saint commissioned from Pierre Le Gros who carved the marble with extraordinary virtuosity (the statue was preserved when the church was eventually rebuilt some 40 years later and is still in situ).Gerhard Bissell, Reading (Si Vede) 1997 (in German) Only in 1742, Pope Benedict XIV commissioned Ferdinando Fuga to rebuild the church. Fuga added a new façade in the late 16th century style, with Baroque elements. It has two stories, with Ionic columns in the lower and Corinthian ones in the upper. The lower level has a central doorway flanked by windows. Above the door is a triangular tympanon. On the upper level is a large central window with a balcony, and two smaller windows to the sides. The façade is crowned by a double tympanon. Fuga also reconstructed the dome. The church as a whole was rededicated in 1748. Francesco Antonio Zaccaria, writer and archaeologist, who died in 1795, was buried in the Chapel of St Ignatius of Loyola here. In 1984 the church was elevated to minor basilica status. In 18 December 1990, the church was granted to the Opus Dei, and is now part of their Pontifical University of the Holy Cross. The new Chaplain of the Opus Dei settled in 1 September 1991. In 24 April 1990, when the Church had not yet been entrusted to Opus Dei, the notorious gangster Enrico De Pedis, boss of the so-called Banda della Magliana, was buried in the church's crypt, by authorization of Cardinal Ugo Poletti. The unusual interment has been linked to the case of Emanuela Orlandi's kidnapping\\"Chi l'ha visto?\\" and the tomb was opened for investigation in 2012.\\"Italian mafia boss's tomb opened in search for missing girl\\" The Guardian 15 May 2012 In 18 June 2012, the remains of De Pedis were transferred to the cemetery of Verano. Architecture The church has a single nave. Along the side are pilasters with Corinthian capitals holding the arches to the side chapels. In the barrel-vaulted ceiling is a fresco of The Glory of St Apollinaris, by Stefano Pozzi. The high altar was made on orders from Pope Benedict XIV, with stucco decorations by Bernardino Ludovisi and an early 17th-century altarpiece depicting St Apollinaris' Consecration as Bishop of Ravenna. The crypt contains relics. The elliptical Chapel of Graces, which is outside the church proper, is accessed through a doorway on the left. It contains a 1494 fresco of The Virgin, Queen of Apostles which, survived the Sack of Rome because the priests had covered it with lime and was then rediscovered in 1645 when two boys and a soldier took refuge in the church during an earthquake. A marble frame with golden stucco cherubs was added by Peter Anton von Verschaffelt.

The murder David DeWayne Johnson entered a warehouse and convinced the night watchman, 67-year-old Leon Brown, that he needed to use the telephone to get his car, a white Oldsmobile, out of a ditch nearby. Dudley Swann, the principal stockholder in Little Rock Crate and Basket identified Johnson as the driver of the white Oldsmobile. Swann had earlier asked Johnson to leave and come back the next day to get his car because he did not want the driver on the premises after dark. Brown was found later beaten to death with a 2x4 in a pool of blood. Johnson's fingerprints were found at the scene and Johnson was in possession of property stolen from the warehouse. Appeals Johnson appealed by claiming his lawyer was manic- depressive and incapable of defending an accused murderer. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the denial of Johnson's appeal. The court's March ruling acknowledged that Johnson's first lawyer might have been mentally ill during his trial, that he did not press hard to admit certain testimony and that he behaved unprofessionally during jury selection. \\"We nevertheless are convinced that the governing law requires that this conviction and sentence be upheld\\", the judges wrote. \\"We deal in specific facts, not abstractions, and petitioner has failed to show any reasonable likelihood that the outcome of this case would have been different even if his lawyer had conducted himself perfectly\\", the opinion said.

It is a remake of the 1986 film of the same name starring Rutger Hauer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and C. Thomas Howell. The Hitcher was directed by Dave Meyers and produced by Michael Bay’s production company Platinum Dunes. The film was released on January 19, 2007 in the US and on June 1, 2007 in the UK. Plot College students Jim (Zachary Knighton) and Grace (Sophia Bush) are driving across New Mexico to meet her friends for spring break. One night, they almost hit a hitchhiker (Sean Bean) who is standing in the middle of the road; Jim swerves and the car spins out of control to a stop. As the man approaches, Grace insists that someone else will stop to help him, and they take off. Later that night at a gas station, Jim meets the hitchhiker who introduces himself as John Ryder and he asks for a ride. Reluctantly, Jim agrees. While on the road, he becomes violent and attacks them, holding a knife to Grace's eye. He tells Jim the only way to save them both is to say \\"I want to die\\". Jim hits the brakes, causing John to hit his head on the windshield, and then Jim kicks him out of the car. Grace tells Jim she wants to go home but he persuades her to continue with their trip. The following day, they spot John in a family's car. Jim and Grace try to warn the family but crash their car. They are forced to continue on foot and eventually find the family's car on the side of the road; both the children and mother are already dead, with the father badly wounded. They take the car and stop at a nearby cafe for them, but the man dies. Suspected of having committed the murders, Jim and Grace are arrested and brought to the police station. John arrives shortly after and kills everyone at the station, while Jim and Grace flee. Lieutenant Esteridge pursues the couple, but John shows up and helps Jim and Grace escape the police, single-handedly taking out all of the police cruisers and a helicopter. Grace and Jim check in at a motel. Graces falls asleep but is later woken by John, who tries to rape her. She manages to fight him off and hides in the bathroom. John suddenly disappears so Grace leaves the motel to look for Jim, and finds him chained at the wrists and ankles between a truck and a trailer. Grace approaches the truck, which is being revved up by John, and demands that he stops. The police arrive and tell her to drop her gun, as John drives forward and splits Jim in half, killing him. John is apprehended by the police. The next morning, Esteridge tells Grace that the real John Ryder is missing and they do not know the true identity of the hitchhiker. He informs her the hitchhiker will be transported across the state to another prison. During the journey, the hitchhiker breaks free from his restraints and kills everyone in the van, causing the vehicle to crash, with Esteridge and Grace crashing close behind them. The hitchhiker shoots a pool of gasoline, igniting it, as Grace manages to escape from the car. Meanwhile, the hitchhiker shoots and kills Esteridge who is trapped in the car. Grace shoots the hitchhiker in the back and then in the chest. The hitchhiker asks her, \\"Feels good, doesn't it?\\" to which she replies \\"I don't feel a thing\\" before she shoots him in the head.

It separates Lemhi County, Idaho and Beaverhead County, Montana. The pass is in the Bitterroot Mountains and is traversed by Montana State Highway 43. The pass is named after Chief Joseph of the Wallowa band of the Nez Perce tribe who traversed the pass in 1877 during the Nez Perce War. West of the pass, the highway connects with US-93 at Lost Trail Pass, about west of the divide. Between the passes the Montana highway is actually in Idaho, for about . This is the northernmost pass on the continental divide between Idaho and Montana. Less than a mile north, the Continental Divide heads eastward into Montana, following the Ravalli-Beaverhead county line towards Butte. East of Chief Joseph Pass, Highway 43 descends to Wisdom away, passing the historic Big Hole National Battlefield, which commemorates that battle of 1877. In early September 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition either crossed this pass or the nearby Lost Trail Pass as they traveled westward into the Bitterroot Valley of present-day Ravalli County.

A of two in partner's suit indicates four-card support and a call of double promises three-card support; if partner's suit bid is doubled instead of overcalled, a redouble serves the same meaning as double. The convention was invented by Eric Rodwell in 1974.Rodwell, Eric. NewInBridge - The Topics Collection; Topic 00 - Support Doubles and Redoubles. First published September 15, 2010; revised September 1, 2012. For example, after 1 - (Pass) - 1 - (1) * Double shows three-card heart support * 2 shows four-card heart support * Pass or other bids: fewer than three hearts A support redouble applies when Right Hand Opponent makes a take-out double of the response of one of a major: 1 - (Pass) - 1 - (Double) * Redouble: three-card spade support * 2 shows four-card spade support * Pass or other bids: fewer than three spades The convention came as result of the scenario where in competitive auctions, the opening bidder would like to show his minimal three-card support for partner's suit on the possibility that partner has five or more cards in it. However, there would be a risk of a 4-3 fit, known as a ' which does not play as well as eight-card fits. Since the need to distinguish between three- and four-card support occurs more frequently than those cases where the opening bidder would like to make a penalty double over the opponent's one- level overcall, the meaning of the double (and redouble) was modified to convey the conventional meaning of three-card support. Usage Take the following auction: {class='wikitable' !width=\\"25%\\"|West !width=\\"25%\\"|North !width=\\"25%\\"|East !width=\\"25%\\"|South |- align=center Pass |1 |Pass |1 |- align=center 1 |Dbl |Pass |1NT |- align=center Pass |} Playing support doubles, North, the opener, has shown three-card support for South's 1 call. This is important because South might only have four hearts. Based on the South no trump bid, it can be assumed that South doesn't have five or more hearts. Hand in hand with the support double is the support redouble which also shows three card support. Examine this auction, which is similar to the one above. {class='wikitable' !width=\\"25%\\"|West !width=\\"25%\\"|North !width=\\"25%\\"|East !width=\\"25%\\"|South |- align=center Pass |1 |Pass |1 |- align=center Dbl |Rdbl |} North has shown three- card support for South's heart suit. South uses this information to form the next bid. Exceptions Support doubles are not used (except by special agreement) by partner of an overcaller. {class='wikitable' !width=\\"25%\\"|West !width=\\"25%\\"|North !width=\\"25%\\"|East !width=\\"25%\\"|South |- align=center 1 |1 |2 |Dbl |} The assumption is that the overcaller must surely have at least five cards in the suit he has bid. As such a simple raise is normally sufficient to show some points and support. In such a situation, a double by the partner of the overcaller would be treated as either a Rosenkranz double, a snapdragon double, a responsive double or a penalty double based on partnership agreement. At what level The above examples show the support double's use over one-level overcalls. Partnerships usually decide to play support doubles through 2 Hearts or 2 Spades. Here are several other less discussed examples but nonetheless valid examples of normal support doubles {class='wikitable' !width=\\"25%\\"|West !width=\\"25%\\"|North !width=\\"25%\\"|East !width=\\"25%\\"|South |- align=center Pass |1 |1 |1 |- align=center 2 |Dbl |- align=center |} Playing negative doubles or not, opener's double shows three spades. It is irrelevant that opener knows that partner has five spades (if playing negative doubles), the double shows three-card support. The principle is that you and your partner use the opponent's bidding to assist your bidding. Clarify right now if you have three- or four-card support unless you have something else very important to say. {class='wikitable' !width=\\"25%\\"|West !width=\\"25%\\"|North !width=\\"25%\\"|East !width=\\"25%\\"|South |- align=center 1 |1 |2 |2 |- align=center Dbl |||} In this case with a really competitive auction, someone is probably stretching their bid. West has opened and his partner has shown five clubs and 10 points yet South is showing a limit raise of Hearts. The double is still support. It is particularly important in this instance. BTW: The most likely culprit is South. Importance of nine-card fits There is a lot of literature for advancing players on the importance of determining eight- versus nine-card fits. Here is one example of its importance: As East, your hand is xxxxx, xx, void, KQxxxx The auction is {class='wikitable' !width=\\"25%\\"|West !width=\\"25%\\"|North !width=\\"25%\\"|East !width=\\"25%\\"|South |- align=center 1 |1 |1 |2 |- align=center 2 |} Without knowing RHO's next bid, if East knows there is a nine-card spade fit, East can bid 4 Spades even in an IMP game and expect a good chance to make it. However think about the same auction if partner doubles showing exactly three spades, your bid now becomes a guess. ACBL rules In American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) tournaments, support doubles must be indicated on the convention card and must be Alerted. Additionally, when opener makes a call other than a support double (including Pass) when the support double is an option, an Alert should be made if the partnership agreement is that opener's failure to double or to raise denies three-card or longer support for responder's suit (normally, one would expect only four-card or longer support to be denied by failure to raise responder's major suit). Per the \\"Alert Procedures\\" page on the ACBL website: \\"In general, when the use of conventions leads to unexpected understandings about suit length by negative inference, a natural call becomes Alertable.\\" While the ACBL does make an exception for agreements that \\"have become expected and are fairly common,\\" the fact that the ACBL continues to require an Alert for the support double itself argues against applying this exception; the requirement to Alert implies that the support double is not considered \\"expected... and fairly common\\" to date.American Contract Bridge League, \\"Alert Procedures\\". Most bridge clubs require a partnership to employ active ethics, and the partnership should disclose all relevant agreements to the opponents. Secret conventions are illegal.

Best management practices (BMPs) is a term used in the United States and Canada to describe a type of water pollution control. Historically the term has referred to auxiliary pollution controls in the fields of industrial wastewater control and municipal sewage control, while in stormwater management (both urban and rural) and wetland management, BMPs may refer to a principal control or treatment technique as well. Terminology Beginning in the 20th century, designers of industrial and municipal sewage pollution controls typically utilized engineered systems (e.g. filters, clarifiers, biological reactors) to provide the central components of pollution control systems, and used the term \\"BMPs\\" to describe the supporting functions for these systems, such as operator training and equipment maintenance. Stormwater management, as a specialized area within the field of environmental engineering, emerged later in the 20th century, and some practitioners have used the term BMP to describe both structural or engineered control devices and systems (e.g. retention ponds) to treat polluted stormwater, as well as operational or procedural practices (e.g. minimizing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides). Other practitioners prefer to use the term Stormwater control measure, due to the varied definitions of the term \\"BMP\\" and its use in non-stormwater practice.  U.S. Clean Water Act References to \\"BMP\\"  Congress referred to BMP in several sections of the U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) but did not define the term. *The 1977 CWA used the term in describing the areawide waste treatment planning programUnited States. Clean Water Act of 1977, Pub.L. 95-217, December 27, 1977. Sections 208 (b), (i) and (j), . and in procedures for controlling toxic pollutants associated with industrial discharges.CWA sec. 304(e), . The \\"Section 404\\" program, which covers dredge and fill permits, refers to BMPs in one of the enforcement exemptions.CWA sec. 404(f), . *References to stormwater BMPs first appear in the 1987 amendment to the CWA in describing the Nonpoint Source Management Demonstration Program.Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub.L. 100-4, February 4, 1987. CWA sec. 319(a),(b),(h),(l), & (m), . *Another stormwater BMP reference was added in 2001 with the authorization for a Wet Weather Watershed Pilot Project program.Wet Weather Water Quality Act of 2000, December 21, 2000. Added by the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763A–225), as enacted into law by section 1(a)(6) of Pub.L. 106–554 (114 Stat. 2763). Amended CWA sec.121(a)(2), .  EPA definitions  In implementing the CWA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defined BMP in the federal wastewater permit regulations, initially to refer to auxiliary procedures for industrial wastewater controls. :...schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the United States, BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. \\"EPA Administered Permit Programs: The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, . Later the Agency added a reference to stormwater management BMPs. :...each NPDES permit shall include conditions meeting the following requirements when applicable... (k) Best management practices (BMPs) to control or abate the discharge of pollutants when: ... (2) Authorized under section 402(p) of the CWA for the control of storm water discharges...EPA. .  Industrial wastewater BMPs  Industrial wastewater BMPs are considered an adjunct to engineered treatment systems. Typical BMPs include operator training, maintenance practices, and spill control procedures for treatment chemicals.For example: There are also many BMPs available which are specific to particular industrial processes, for example: * source reduction practices in metal finishing industries (e.g. substituting less toxic solvents or using water-based cleaners); * in the chemical industry, capturing equipment washdown waters for recycle/reuse at various process stages; * in the paper industry, using process control monitoring to optimize bleaching processes, and reduce the overall amount of bleach used.  Stormwater management BMPs  Stormwater management BMPs are control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of urban runoff caused through changes to land use. Generally BMPs focus on water quality problems caused by increased impervious surfaces from land development. BMPs are designed to reduce stormwater volume, peak flows, and/or nonpoint source pollution through evapotranspiration, infiltration, detention, and filtration or biological and chemical actions. BMPs also can improve receiving-water quality by extending the duration of outflows in comparison to inflow duration (known as hydrograph extension), which dilutes the stormwater discharged into a larger volume of upstream flow. Stormwater BMPs can be classified as \\"structural\\" (i.e., devices installed or constructed on a site such as silt fences, rock filter dams, fiber rolls (also called erosion control logs or excelsior wattles), sediment traps and numerous other proprietary products) or \\"non-structural\\" (procedures, such as modified landscaping practices, soil disturbing activity scheduling, or street sweeping). There are a variety of BMPs available; selection typically depends on site characteristics and pollutant removal objectives. EPA has published a series of stormwater BMP fact sheets for use by local governments, builders and property owners. Stormwater management BMPs can be also categorized into four basic types: # Storage practices: ponds; recovery; green infrastructure design. # Vegetative practices: buffers; channels; green roofs; wetlands; functional art; stormwater wetland park design; wetland park engineering & design. # Filtration/Infiltration practices: filtering; infiltration; rain gardens; porous pavement; civic infrastructure and design; functional stormwater design. # Water sensitive development: better site design; open space site design; low impact development.

He is the son of Norman Altman and Sophie Altman. Norman Altman, a graduate of Harvard Law School, who died in 1997, was a real estate lawyer and investor, and founded the Washington, DC law firm Krooth and Altman. Sophie Altman, a graduate of Yale Law School, worked in television broadcasting, and was a multiple Emmy award-winning producer. One of the television shows Sophie produced was the high school educational program, It's Academic, now in its 56th year. Robert is one of 4 children. Altman was raised in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C. and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School. He went to college at the University of Wisconsin and returned to D.C. to attend George Washington University Law School. Law office Altman practiced law for many years in Washington DC as a partner of Clark Clifford, former United States Secretary of Defense, in the law firm of Clifford and Warnke. Altman later opened his own law firm, the Law Offices of Robert Altman, where Clifford was of counsel. As a Washington lawyer, Altman represented major companies before federal regulatory agencies, before Congress, or in litigation. From 1978-82, Altman and Clifford represented a group of wealthy Arab businessmen, including members of the royal family from Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, in their efforts to acquire a multi-state bank holding company, Financial General Bankshares. The Arab investors used a British bank, Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), as their financial advisor in this transaction. Following the acquisition, Altman became President of Financial General, which was renamed First American Corporation. In 1980, he was the lawyer of Bert Lance, Jimmy Carter's adviser, during his trial regarding the financial management of the Calhoun First National Bank. Biografia de Robert A. Altman, Executives.technology ZeniMax Media Altman resumed his Washington legal practice after the trial. In May 1999, he cofounded ZeniMax Media with Bethesda Softworks founder Christopher Weaver, as a new parent company for Bethesda. Altman was brought in as CEO, with Weaver serving as CTO. Weaver was pushed out of an operational role in 2002, and filed a related lawsuit that was settled out of court. Personal life On January 29, 1984, Robert married former Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter. Together they have two children, James and Jessica Altman. They live in Potomac, Maryland. James Altman works at his father's ZeniMax subsidiary Bethesda Softworks as Director of Publishing Operations. In 2015, both Robert and his wife Lynda Carter endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. BCCI trial In 1991, it was alleged that BCCI, the financial adviser to the Arab shareholders and their “communications link”, had acquired by means of offshore loans that were in default, the shares of the Arab investors in First American. Questions were raised whether the Arab investors had falsely represented to bank regulators the true ownership of First American. During the ensuing investigations, Altman and Clifford testified at length before Congress, federal and state grand juries, and the Federal Reserve. Audits of First American by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller, and state banking agencies confirmed that the bank had been operated under Altman's management without any BCCI influence. In 1992, Clifford and Altman were charged in indictments by the New York District Attorney and the Department of Justice, as well as being named in a civil suit by the Federal Reserve. Clifford, then in poor health, was severed from the case as he was physically unable to go to trial. Altman maintained his innocence, refused offers of a plea to resolve the cases, and insisted on going to trial. In the summer of 1993, after a five-month trial, the court dismissed the central count in the indictment of bribery, saying no evidence had been presented by the government to support it. Altman declined to present a defense case, and was acquitted by the jury of all remaining charges. The Department of Justice dismissed the companion federal indictment. The civil suit by the Federal Reserve was settled, with Altman agreeing to be banned permanently from banking.

Cumbres Pass, elevation , is a mountain pass in the San Juan Mountains in Colorado, United States. The pass is traversed by State Highway 17 and the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. The highway has a moderate 5.8% approach on the north side and a gentler, 4% approach on the south side. It is rarely closed in winter and does not normally cause problems for vehicles, since the road is not a major through highway. Railroad The railroad line was built in the early 1880s by the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad as part of their San Juan Extension line from Alamosa, Colorado to Durango, Colorado. The railroad has a steep (for a railroad) 4% grade approaching from the west, so additional helper locomotives were usually run (and often still are) on trains from Chama to Cumbres Pass. The facilities at the pass were built by the railroad to support the turning of the helper locomotives for their return to Chama, and provide water to locomotives after the climb. Some of the structures at the pass, including the station building, were demolished when the highway was realigned. Regular passenger service was provided by the San Juan Express, running from Alamosa to Durango, and was discontinued in 1951, although numerous rail-fan specials operated over the line until the Fall of 1967. Freight service on the line ended in 1968 and since 1970 the railroad from Chama to Antonito has been owned and operated by the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad which operates trains over the pass during the tourist season. The original section house, car inspectors house, and part of the old snowshed remain on Cumbres Pass and are maintained by the Friends of the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad.

It is fast-growing and usually has nice red fall colors, much more reliably so than the more popular pin oak. It is still relatively obscure in the horticultural industry but is slowly gaining popularity due to its fast growth rate, ease of transplanting, good fall colors and ability to grow in wet soils. This species was for years erroneously called Quercus nuttallii, but it is now known as Quercus texana; this has created much confusion with Texas red oak which was known as Quercus texana but is now known as Quercus buckleyi.

Some species are known as cactus flies, while others have been called banana stalk flies and the family was earlier treated as subfamily of the Micropezidae which are often called stilt-legged flies. Neriids differ from micropezids in having no significant reduction of the fore legs. Neriids breed in rotting vegetation, such as decaying tree bark or rotting fruit. About 100 species are placed in 19 genera. Neriidae are found mainly in tropical regions, but two North American genera occur, each with one species, and one species of Telostylinus occurs in temperate regions of eastern Australia. Family characteristics Most species of Neriidae are slender, long-legged flies. Many exhibit striped patterns that appear to provide camouflage against tree bark. Many neriids are sexually dimorphic, with males having more elongated bodies, heads, antennae, and legs than females. In some species, the male fore-tibia is greatly thickened distally. Neriid flies are saprophagous. Larvae develop in rotting vegetable matter, including bark and fruit. Neriid adults tend to aggregate on rotting vegetable matter or damaged tree trunks. Neriid adults are also attracted to flowers or other sources of sugar. The upper face has a medial division and the antennae are porrect. The arista on the antenna arises at the tip (not dorsally, as in the Micropezidae). The fore legs are long with prominent coxae. In the Micropezidae, the fore legs are reduced. The fore femora (and sometimes all femora) bear ventral spines in males. The fore tibia of males may have rows of spines or tubercles. The third and fourth veins of the wing converge at the tip and the first vein is not setulose. Neriids have 1-5 frontal bristles, no ocellar bristles and some have reduced postvertical bristles. For terms see Morphology of Diptera Ecology and evolution of neriid flies Pair in copula Males of some species engage in spectacular combat for territory or access to females. The rivals elevate their bodies to an almost vertical posture, and pound each other with the ventral surfaces of their heads, strike each other with their forelegs, or try to place each other in a head-lock. Photos of mating and combat can be seen here. Research on the Australian neriid Telostylinus angusticollis has shown that adult body size and shape are extremely sensitive to larval diet: larvae reared in nutrient-rich substrates exhibit greater body size as adults, and males have more elongated bodies, compared to flies reared in nutrient-poor substrates. The expression of male secondary sexual traits is particularly sensitive to the protein content of the larval diet. Developmental plasticity in response to variation in larval diet quality has diversified among populations of Telostylinus angusticollis along the east coast of Australia. Research on Telostylinus angusticollis has also shown that a male's larval diet can influence the body size of his offspring. Males reared on a nutrient-rich larval diet produce larger offspring than their brothers reared on a nutrient-poor larval diet, and this paternal effect appears to be sensitive to the male's social environment. In addition, recent research on this species has led to the discovery of a new form of nonparental transgenerational effect, whereby a male's larval diet quality can influence the body size of offspring sired by a subsequent male that mates as much as two weeks later with the same female. This effect is a form of telegony. Female at left oviposits while a male stands by As in some tephritoid flies, neriid larvae in their final instar are capable of skipping. To skip, a maggot bends its body into a 'C', grasps its posterior end with its mouth-hooks, tightens the muscles in its body wall, and then releases its hold, causing its posterior end to recoil against the substrate. Although their skipping abilities are not as impressive as those of piophilid maggots, neriid maggots can skip distances > 20 cm.

It is dedicated to Saint Caesarius of Terracina, a 2nd-century deacon and martyr. History Origins In the 4th century, Emperor Valentinian was cured at the shrine of Caesarius at Terracina, the site of his martyrdom. The emperor then decided to move his relics to Rome. They were taken to a church on the Palatine Hill, and when they were later moved to a new church, that church got the name \\"in Palatio\\", \\"at the Palace\\". It is also known as San Cesareo de Appia. Excavations have revealed a Roman bath on the site from the 2nd or 3rd century, with a huge black and white mosaic depicting Neptune and marine creatures, along with foundations of what is thought to be the first church here, built in the 8th century. Medieval No written evidence exists for the church's origins; it is first mentioned in the written sources is 1192. In the Middle Ages, the church was part of a hospice and hospital for pilgrims, and had a column in front of it to demonstrate this. 17th century The present church is the result of reconstruction work undertaken in 1602/3, supervised by the great historian Cardinal Cesare Baronio, who was then titular here and whose house survives. The coat-of-arms of the reigning Pope Clement VIII, who was of the Aldobrandini family, was added to the coffered ceiling. The central panel of the latter depicts St Caesarius. Though they have now been lost to pollution, at this same period frescoes were added to the facade, which is the work of Giacomo della Porta. The Cosmatesque pulpit, the balustrades, the altar frontal and episcopal chair behind the altar (in pale blue, unusual in Cosmatesque work) may have been brought here at this time from San Giovanni in Laterano, when work was undertaken at this period in the transepts there, although possibly they came from other churches. The paintings between the windows are also 17th century, by Cavalier D'Arpino and Cesare Rosetti, and depict the martyrdoms of St Caesarius and of several saints named Hippolytus, a compliment to Pope Clement VIII, whose baptismal name was Ippolito. It was Cavalier D'Arpino who also produced the design for the rare motif in the mosaic, God the Father.A Handbook of Rome; by John Murray, 11th edition (1872), page 137. 20th century Another restoration occurred in the years 1955 to 1963.

The Church of Santi Domenico e Sisto (Saints Dominic and Sixtus) is one of the titular churchesSince 21 October 2003. in Rome, Italy in the care of the Roman Catholic Order of Preachers, better known as the Dominicans. It is located at no. 1 Largo Angelicum on the Quirinal Hill on the campus of the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum), of which it is the University Church. As a titular church it has been held by Cardinal José Tolentino Mendonça since 5 October 2019. History  Exterior  The first church at the site, Santa Maria a Magnanapoli, was built sometime before the year 1000. The present church was built at the order of Dominican Pope Pius V. Construction on the church began in 1569 and on a convent for Dominican nuns in 1575. The original plan was the work of Giacomo della Porta though during the long construction period that stretched until 1663 several other architects were involved. The lower part of the church was designed by Nicola Torriani, and the upper part by Torriani or Vincenzo della Greca. Della Greca constructed the Baroque travertine façade in 1646, with his brother Felice. The façade contains four statues. The two upper statues representing Saint Dominic and Saint Pope Sixtus II are by Marcantonio Canini. The two lower statues depict St. Thomas Aquinas and Saint Peter of Verona, were sculpted by Stefano Maderno.Gerhard Wiedmann, Roma barocca, 2002, p. 255, states \\"sopra le statue dei santi Tommaso e Pietro Martire di Stefano Maderno (1636).\\" The exterior double staircase built in 1654 is the design of architect Orazio Torriani.  Interior  In 1649 Gian Lorenzo Bernini made designs for this church including the high altar and the first chapel on the right upon entering. The altar of this chapel and the sculpture group Noli me tangere were executed by Bernini's pupil Antonio Raggi on the designs by Bernini. The ceiling painting of the Apotheosis of St Dominic was produced in 1674 by Domenico Maria Canuti, with trompe l'oeil framing by Enrico Haffner. The altarpiece in the third chapel on the south side, by Pier Francesco Mola, depicts St Dominic's Vision. In the second chapel on the north side is Francesco Allegrini's 1532 The Mystical Marriage of St Catherine. In the third chapel on the north side is the 1460 Madonna and Child by Benozzo Gozzoli, a pupil of Fra Angelico.  University church  The church has functioned as the university church for the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) since the Dominicans were able to re-acquire the convent complex from the Italian government in 1927 after its expropriation from the Order in 1870 due to the Laws of suppression of religious orders. The church is used to celebrate the solemn inauguration of each academic year, the feast of St. Thomas Aquinas and the official closing of the academic year. It closes during the university's summer break except for the feast of St. Dominic on 7 August. Other than during public functions, visits need to be arranged by prior appointment. Depictions in culture The church has been the subject of or appeared in numerous works of art. Antonio Canaletto made a pen and ink study with grey wash and black chalk, today in the collection of the British Museum, described as depicting \\"the Church of SS Domenico e Sisto, Rome; with a sweeping double staircase to the entrance, in the foreground a man bowing to two approaching ladies.\\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=713994&partid;=1 Accessed 6 April 2013 In 1906, American painter John Singer Sargent completed an oil painting of the exterior staircase and balustrade of the church.

The pass is named for the Devils Gate, a granitic formation located west of the summit of the pass. Location Bridgeport and the East Walker River lie to the east and south of Devil's Gate, and the West Walker River lies to the west and north. The Sierra Nevada rise up from the west and south of the pass, while to the northeast the Sweetwater Mountains spur off from the Sierra Nevada. The Little Walker Caldera lies southwest of the pass. Devil's Gate Pass is a few miles east of Sonora Junction, which is the junction of U.S. 395 with State Route 108. This segment of U.S. 395 connects Antelope Walker valley to Big Meadows (Bridgeport). State Route 108 terminates at Sonora Junction with the west bound road connecting to Sonora Pass and Sonora over the Sierra Nevada. The given coordinates are the location of the highest point of U.S. Route 395 through the pass (what Caltrans calls the summit of the pass). Visitor information Visitors to the area should acquire a Toiyabe National Forest service map before exploring beyond U.S. Route 395. Although most of the surrounding land is publicly owned and accessible via Burcham Flat Road (the correct spelling of Burcham is uncertain and varies, verbal communication to editor from Mono County records archivist) and Little Walker Road, the land on either side of U.S. Route 395 through the pass is privately owned. The forest service map highlights public and private lands in color. Flora A wide variety of flora can be found around the summit. Besides the dominant Artemisia tridentata (big sage) and Purshia tridentata (bitterbrush) noteworthy large plants include Juniperus occidentalis (western juniper), Pinus jeffreyi (Jeffrey pine), Cercocarpus ledifolius (curl leaf mountain mahogany), Amelanchier (service berry uncertain species) and Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen). Amelanchier and Populus tremuloides display bright yellow colors in the fall, attracting photographers. Many of these are exceptionally large and old for the species, with junipers up to 1500 years old (verbal revision of 1172 age of DGS-19 from Scotty Strachan), juniper snags up to 2200 years old (in tree ring lab at University of Nevada, Reno), Jeffreys over 400 years old having been verified (core sample taken and dated by Scotty Strachan, unpublished data). Too many other species are present in less conspicuous numbers to enumerate. Small wildflowers are abundant in the spring. Fauna The area west of the Devil's Gate is designated as a deer migration zone by the Mono County Planning commission. The Rocky Mountain mule deer cross US-395 near the pass regularly and there are deer crossing signs to warn drivers of the hazard. Numerous other animals have been spotted in the area around the pass including American badger, black bear, chipmunk, cougar, coyote, rabbit, rubber boa, sage grouse, and vole. Numerous song birds are present during the warmer months. Ravens and hawks can be seen flying overhead. History and land use John C. Fremont crossed the pass in Jan 1844. His party was surveying the western boundary of the Nevada Basin but due to cold weather they were forced to search for a route across the Sierra Nevada and the warmth of California's central valley. Due to difficult terrain and deep snow (weather estimates indicate snowfall was significantly below normal at the time), he was forced to abandon his cannon on Jan 29, 1844 after crossing the pass (from Fremont's log). It is unclear if the cannon has ever been found. The Mono County museum has on display what is claimed to be the cannon carriage, which was found a few miles away in 2011-2012. Various commercial activities have been attempted along the pass. Enough water to power a mill was noted by William H. Brewer in his journal entry for July 15, 1863. The remnants of a steam powered machine (probably a saw mill) can be found on private property near the gate along Saw Mill Creek (identified by the property owner and viewed by the editor). A stage stop and resort at Fales Hot spring 2 miles to the west was operated from about 1877 through 1952. In 1952 the main building was burned in a Butane filling accident. A newer resort was constructed in 1954 using the insurance money but most of it was subsequently torn down. The still standing restaurant has been converted into a private residence (verbal communication between editor and owner of the property). The gasoline station next to the resort remained open until at least the 1970s and was torn down around 1990. A small ski run was operated at Swaugger Creek, 4 miles to the east of the pass, in the 1930s. The Devil's Gate pack station catering to deer hunters was operated at the pass by the Virginia Lakes Pack Outfit from 1981 until 1999 (verbal communication to the editor from the Virginia Lakes Pack Outfit owner, 2013). Currently much of the private land is used as pasture (west side of pass) or for private homes (east side of pass).

The company owns id Software (developer of the Doom, Quake and Rage series), Arkane Studios (developer of Dishonored and Prey), MachineGames (developer of the Wolfenstein series), Tango Gameworks (developer of The Evil Within), publisher Bethesda Softworks with its Bethesda Game Studios (developer of The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series) and ZeniMax Online Studios (developer of The Elder Scrolls Online). On September 21, 2020, Microsoft announced they entered into an agreement to acquire ZeniMax Media and all of its subsidiaries for $7.5 billion.  History   1999–2007: Early history, SBS investment, Providence investment  ZeniMax was founded in 1999 by Bethesda Softworks founder Christopher Weaver and Robert A. Altman. It was established as a successor to Media Technology Limited, Bethesda's parent company at the time. Weaver brought Altman on board as CEO, contributing his stock in Bethesda Softworks so that the new shell company, named ZeniMax Media, would be able to obtain funding. Weaver served initially as chief technology officer of the company from 1999 to 2002, then moved to a non-operational role in 2002. Weaver filed a lawsuit against ZeniMax in 2002 for breach of contract, claiming he was owed US$1.2 million in severance pay. The suit was dismissed, with the court sanctioning Weaver, and finding that Weaver \\"acted willfully, wrongfully, and in bad faith.\\" In 2000, SBS Broadcasting acquired a 12.5% stake as part of the partnership between the two companies. Its chairman and CEO, Harry Sloan, became a ZeniMax board member a year prior to that. Sloan is a founding investor and board member of the company. Other original board members included Les Moonves as well as the now-deceased Robert Trump. The year 2000 also saw Terry McAuliffe,George Mitchell, Dean Devlin and Jon Feltheimer join ZeniMax as company advisors. In 2004, ZeniMax acquired the Fallout franchise from Interplay Entertainment. Bethesda's Todd Howard said in January 2007 that \\"We started work on Fallout 3 in late 2004 with a few people. We only had about 10 people on it until Oblivion wrapped (...)\\". Fallout 3 was released in October 2008. On August 1, 2007, ZeniMax announced the creation of ZeniMax Online Studios, a division headed by Matt Firor. In 2012, the company announced that it was developing The Elder Scrolls Online, ultimately releasing it on April 4, 2014. On October 30, 2007, ZeniMax announced that European broadcasting group ProSiebenSat.1 Media was intensifying its relationship with ZeniMax. It launched SevenGames.com, the international version of its German game platform, in December and work with ZeniMax to develop online games. ProSiebenSat.1 Media held a 9% stake in ZeniMax at the time through SBS Broadcasting, which it acquired the same year. SBS Broadcasting previously acquired a 12.5% stake in ZeniMax in October 2000 as part of the partnership between the two companies at the time. This included ZeniMax's e-Nexus Studios subsidiary, developing European entertainment portals and web sites for SBS, as well as other stock purchase agreements between SBS and ZeniMax. As of 2007, Weaver held a 33% stake in the company. In 2007, it was valued at $1.2 billion, when it raised $300 million from Providence Equity Partners in exchange for a 25% stake. As of 2020, Weaver owned 'a pittance of the stock'.  2007–present: Expansion, Oculus lawsuit, and Microsoft acquisition  ZeniMax's old logo By October 2007, ZeniMax employee count rose to 200 employees. In September 2009, ZeniMax acquired rights to the Prey video game franchise. In December 2009, ZeniMax acquired publishing rights to the id Software game Rage. The game was to be published by Electronic Arts. In 2010, Providence invested another $150 million for an undisclosed stake. In May 2016, it was valued at $2.5 billion. By January 2011, ZeniMax employed 400 people in its Rockville headquarters. On March 3, 2011, ZeniMax announced a partnership with the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts to support its Interactive Media Division with a comprehensive educational program of guest lectures and internships. In May 2014, ZeniMax sent a letter to Facebook and Oculus VR asserting that any contributions that John Carmack made to the Oculus Rift project are the intellectual property of ZeniMax, stating that \\"ZeniMax provided necessary VR technology and other valuable assistance to Palmer Luckey and other Oculus employees in 2012 and 2013 to make the Oculus Rift a viable VR product, superior to other VR market offerings.\\" On May 21, 2014, ZeniMax filed a lawsuit against Oculus. On June 25, 2014, Oculus filed an official response to the lawsuit. Oculus claimed ZeniMax was falsely claiming ownership to take advantage of the acquisition by Facebook. Oculus also claimed that the Oculus Rift did not share a single line of code or any technology with ZeniMax's code and technology. In August 2016, Prosieben sold its stake in ZeniMax for 30 million euros. On February 1, 2017, a Dallas, Texas jury awarded ZeniMax $500 million in their lawsuit against Oculus. The jury found that Oculus did not misappropriate ZeniMax trade secrets, but had violated ZeniMax's copyrights and trademarks in addition to violating a non-disclosure agreement. On September 21, 2020, Microsoft announced they entered into an agreement to acquire ZeniMax Media and all its subsidaries for $7.5 billion. The acquisition deal is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2021's fiscal year. The deal promises to return more than six times Providence Equity's investment in the company. Altman considered selling ZeniMax for several years and at one point was close to a deal with rival Electronic Arts.

It is one of the oldest surviving churches in the country. The church was erected by Catholicos Komitas to replace the original mausoleum built by Catholicos Sahak the Great in 395 AD that contained the remains of the martyred Saint Hripsime to whom the church is dedicated. The current structure was completed in 618 AD. It is known for its fine Armenian- style architecture of the classical period, which has influenced many other Armenian churches since. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with other nearby churches, including Etchmiadzin Cathedral, Armenia's mother church, in 2000. History A Hellenistic temple, similar to the Temple of Garni and dedicated to a pagan goddess, stood in the place of the church prior to the fourth century. During excavations in 1958 the foundation of a monumental stone building with Hellenistic ornaments was found under the supporting column. Hripsime, along with the abbess Gayane and 38 unnamed nuns, are traditionally considered the first Christian martyrs in Armenia's history. They were persecuted, tortured, and eventually killed by king Tiridates III of Armenia. According to the chronicler Agathangelos, after conversion to Christianity in 301, Tiridates and Gregory the Illuminator built a martyrium dedicated to Hripsime at the location of her martyrdom, which was half buried underground. Excavations around the church have uncovered remains of several tortured women buried in early Christian manner, which, according to Agop Jack Hacikyan et al., \\"seem to support the story of Agathangelos.\\" In 395 Patriarch Sahak Partev (Isaac the Parthian) rebuilt or built a new martyrium, which had been destroyed by Shapur II of the Sasanian Empire in the 360s. The current building was erected during the reign of Catholicos Komitas (615–628), according to an account of contemporary chronicler Sebeos and two inscriptions, one on the west facade and the other on the east apse. It replaced the earlier mausoleum of Hripsime. The church is suggested by scholars to have been completed in 618. The dome was probably restored in the 10th or 11th centuries, although some scholars have argued that it is the original 7th century construction. Painting of the church by Vardges Sureniants, 1879 The church was dilapidated and abandoned by the early 17th century. According to an inscription on the western façade, the church was renovated by Catholicos Philipos, in 1653. Under his commission an open narthex (gavit) was erected in front of the western entrance. A bell tower was built on the narthex in 1790 under the commission of Catholicos Ghukas I of Karin. In 1776 the church was fortified with a brick wall and towers on the corners by Catholicos Simeon I of Yerevan. In 1880 the eastern and southern walls were built of smoothly hewn stone. The church underwent considerable renovation in 1898. Its foundations were strengthened and the roof and dome were repaired in 1936. In 1958 plaster from was removed from the interior walls and the interior floor was lowered. The bell tower was renovated in 1987. Architecture Cross section of the church per Toros Toramanian St. Hripsime Church is a domed tetraconch enclosed in a rectangle, with two angular niches on the northern and southern side. German art historian Wilhelm Lübke wrote that the church is built on \\"a most complicated variation of the cruciform ground-plan.\\" ;Reception The monumental exterior of the church is \\"considered one of the great achievements of medieval Armenian architecture.\\" It has been described as a \\"gem of Armenian architecture\\" and \\"one of the most complex compositions in Armenian architecture.\\" Along with Saint Gayane Church, it stands as a \\"model of the austere beauty of early Armenian ecclesiastical architecture.\\" ;Imitations The church is not the earliest example of this architectural form, however, the form is widely known in architectural history as the \\"Hripsime-type\\" since the church is the best- known example of the form. It has also been variously named \\"Jvari-type\\" or \\"Jvari-Hripsime-type\\" for Jvari in Georgia. Notable churches with similar plans include the Surb Hovhannes (Saint John) Church of Avan (6th century), Surb Gevorg (Saint George) Church of Garnahovit (6th century), Church of the Holy Cross at Soradir (6th century), Targmanchats monastery of Aygeshat (7th century), Holy Cross Cathedral of Aghtamar (10th century), and Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) Church at Varagavank (11th century). The architectural form is also found in neighboring Georgia, where examples include the Ateni Sioni Church (7th century), Jvari monastery (7th century), and Martvili Monastery (10th century).

It is located on Via di Sant'Eustachio in the rione Sant'Eustachio, a block west of the Pantheon and via della Rotonda, and a block east of Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza and the Via della Dogana Vecchia. History A church at the site was founded by the 8th century. The church was recorded as a diaconia (a centre for helping the poor and the sick) at the end of the pontificate of Pope Gregory II (715-731). It is mentioned in some documents dating from the 10th and 11th centuries, where this church is called in platana (between the plane trees) referring to the tree planted in the garden of the martyr Eustace. However, tradition holds that the emperor Constantine I had previously built an oratory here. This church was called \\"ad Pantheon in regione nona e iuxta templum Agrippae\\" (at the Pantheon in the ninth region and next to the temple of Agrippa\\"). The church was restored and had a new campanile added at the end of the 12th century during the pontificate of Celestine III (1191–1198), who also deposited the putative relics of Eustace and his family in the church.Accurata, E Succinta Descrizione Topografica, E Istorica Di Roma, Volume 1, by Ridolfino Venturini, published by Carlo Barbellieni, Rome (1768); page 250.Eustace's wife was Theopista, and his two sons Agapius and Theopistus. In the 16th century, it was a favored praying-place for St Philip Neri. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was almost completely rebuilt, with only the campanile remaining from the old structure. The new design, in the Roman Baroque style, was produced by several architects : Cesare Corvara and Giovanni Battista Contini (1641–1723), who added chapels and the portico, Antonio Canevari (1681–1750), Nicola Salvi (1697–1751) and finally, from 1728, Giovanni Domenico Navone. The new high altar, in bronze and polychrome marble, was added by Nicola Salvi in 1739 and in 1749 Ferdinando Fuga put a baldachin over it. The choir and the sacristy were designed by Canevari and built by Giovanni Moscati. The church was elevated to minor basilica status in 1918. Facade Campanile and the pediment with a deer head with a cross between the antlers The facade was built under the direction of Cesare Corvara († 1703) with the collaboration of other architects. It consists of two sections, with the upper section standing back. The lower part is marked with four pilasters and two columns, all with Ionic capitals with in the middle of each capital a small head of a deer. The spirals of the volutes are connected by a small laurel wreath. On the right side of the facade a plaque was placed in memory of the flood of the Tiber River in 1495, whose waters reached up to the basilica. The top section is divided by four pilasters with on each side a large volute. In the middle is a large window with an arcuated cornice, flanked on each side by a niche adorned with shells. On top is a triangular pediment with in its middle a circular window surrounded with palm branches and surmounted by a crown. On top of the pediment stands a deer head with a cross between the antlers (done by the sculptor Paolo Morelli († 1719), in reference to the legend of Saint Eustace. An iron gate, made by Gian Battista Contini, closes off the porch. The square Romanesque campanile is situated on the back of the church at its left side. Construction was started in 1196 under the pontificate of Pope Celestine III. The top part can be dated back to the end of the 12th century, while the base is somewhat older and can be dated at ca. 1090. Interior The interior has a cruciform architectural plan and consists of a single nave. Its construction was carried out in mature Baroque style under the supervision of the architects Cesare Corvara and Antonio Canevari. The nave is marked on each side by three pilasters resting on a broad base. The pilasters are decked with fluted white marble and surmounted by composite capitals. The main altar The rib vault is stuccoed with flowers and leaves. The crossing is covered with a dome with a representation of the Holy Spirit in its middle. The main altar was commissioned by Cardinal Neri Corsini and designed by the architect Nicola Salvi. He made it into an elegant and refined synthesis of marble and gilded metal. The top of the altar rests on an urn in porphyry rosso antico, the costly stone of the ancients, that contains the putative relics of Saint Eustace. The altarpiece was painted in 1727 by Francesco Ferdinandi (1679–1740), also named \\"l'Imperiali\\". It represents the martyrdom of Saint Eustace and his family who were roasted to death inside a bronze statue of a bull or an ox, in the year AD 118. The gilded wooden baldachin (circa 1746) over the main altar is attributed to Ferdinando Fuga (1699–1781). The rear of the church is almost completely covered with the organ, made by Johann Conrad Werle in 1767. The gilded balustrade and the wooden front of the organ were executed in Rococo style by Bernardino Mammucari, Francesco Michetti and Carlo Pacilli. Above the organ stands a glass window representing \\"the Penitent Magdalene\\", realized in the last decade of the 19th century by Gabriel and Louis Gesta di Tolosa. The pulpit was executed in polychrome marble and dates from 1937. Right side \\"The Annunciation\\" by Ottavio Lioni * The Chapel of the Holy Family dates from 1854. The altarpiece by Pietro Gagliardi (1809–1890) represent the Holy Family in Jerusalem. On the right wall is a white marble funeral monument with the bust of Luigi Greppi († 1673), an illustrious member of the Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament. On the left side of the altar stands a small statue of Saint Raymond Nonnatus, who, according to his hagiography, was nominated Cardinal-Deacon of Sant' Eustachio by pope Gregory IX in 1239, but died en route to Rome. * The Chapel of the Annunciation : its decoration was finished in 1874. Above the 17th-century altar stand two columns of coralline breccia that support a broken pediment with a bass-relief in stucco representing the Virgin and Child. The altarpiece by Ottavio Leoni (or Lioni) (1578–1630) represents the Annunciation. * The Chapel of the Sacred Heart was restored between 1934 and 1937 by Corrado Mezzana (1890–1952), who also added the altarpiece representing the Sacred Heart of Jesus, on the left wall, the painting \\"The Last Supper\\" and on the right wall the painting \\"Christ on the Cross and Saint Longinus piercing his Heart\\". * The right transept contains the paintings made by Jacopo Zoboli (1682–1751) in 1737.

The airport is situated northwest of the village of Berlevåg and is owned and operated by Avinor. The airport has a runway aligned 06/24. Services are provided by Widerøe using Dash 8-100 aircraft to other communities in Finnmark. The airport served 5,921 passengers in the terminal (in 2016) and received the most subsidies per passenger of any Avinor airport. A further 8,948 landed and started at the airport without leaving the aircraft.STATISTICS Construction of the airport started in 1943 by the Luftwaffe who stationed a detachment of Jagdgeschwader 5 (JG 5) there. Civilian operations started 1970 and were first provided by Norving. The airport was upgraded as part of a national program to establish regional airports and from 1974 services were taken over by Widerøe using de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft. The current terminal building dates from 1988; Dash 8 aircraft were introduced in 1994. There have been local proposals to expand the airport, but Avinor does not wish to pursue these. History During the German occupation of Norway during World War II, the German Wehrmacht was dependent on supplies to the town of Kirkenes which had to be shipped past Varanger Peninsula. The convoys were the target of bombardments from the Soviet Air Force, stationed close by on the Kola Peninsula. Originally the convoys were protected by the German Jagdgeschwader 5 based at Alta Airport. With an increasing number of raids, the Luftwaffe decided to build two airfields on Varangerhalvøya, Berlevåg and Vardø Airport, SvartnesHafsten: 171 The Wehrmacht had become aware of the favorable location when two aircraft had performed an emergency landing at Storsletten in 1941. Construction at Berlevåg started in August 1943Hafsten: 317 and the airport received a mixed concrete and wooden runway.Hafsten: 318 The airfield received a detachment of fighter aircraft from JS5,Hafsten: 223 including the Focke- Wulf Fw 190.Hafsten: 226 A radar was installed on a hilltop close to the airport in 1944. The airport was demolished with the German retreat from Finnmark in 1944. The wooden runway was subsequently pillaged by locals to accumulate building materials for reconstruction.Dancke: 367 Use of the airport area as a civilian airport was launched by Varangfly director Odd Bentzen in 1964. After visiting Iceland he proposed a series of short and simple airports in Finnmark which could serve the airline's air ambulance service.Melling: 52 A different proposal was launched in 1966 by several of the larger airlines, including Scandinavian Airlines System, Braathens SAFE and Widerøe, to establish a network of short take-off and landing airports in rural areas; Berlevåg was one of six original proposals for Finnmark.Melling: 54 A county committee was established in 1966 to look into building small airfields in Finnmark, including Berlevåg.Melling: 64 In the following years the municipality made investments to allow the airfield to be used for air ambulance services. Part of the motivation was Berlevåg's poor port conditions, which often forced seaplanes to land at Kongsfjord.Melling: 75 Airside waiting area in the terminal Norving (previously Varangfly) started offering flights to the closed-down military airport in 1970 using their newly delivered Britten-Norman Islander.Melling: 66 The background was a landing at the airfield to transport a baby to Kirkenes Hospital. The Civil Aviation Administration stated that they were not opposed to building smaller ambulance airports, but that the state's priority was constructing a network of regional airports.Melling: 73 The service started off with a daily round trip ordered by the district physician; patients had priority, but the airline would transport other passengers as well. After a month a second daily round trip was introduced. State funding was allocated, allowing the airport to be upgraded. The regional airport opened on 1 August 1974, the same day as four other airports in Finnmark. Both Widerøe and Norving applied to operate the subsidized regional routes in Finnmark, which included the route to Berlevåg.Melling: 109 Widerøe was awarded the contract in 1973.Melling: 117 Because of the steadily more regular flights to Berlevåg, Norving applied to the government for permission to operate these as taxi routes. While the airline had been forced to operate its taxi service on the time specifications of the customer, taxi routes would allow the airline to operate feeder services with timetables. No such permission was granted.Melling: 97 Widerøe took over operations from 1 August 1974 using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. On 14 November 1980 the garage and workshop burned down; a new building was built and opened in 1982. The passenger terminal was expanded in 1988 with a new arrivals and departure hall. Widerøe introduced the Dash 8 in 1994. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997, in exchange for 2.2 million Norwegian krone (NOK) being paid to Berlevåg Municipality. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Plans In the mid 2000s, Berlevåg Mayor Erik Brøske launched plans for an expansion of the airport, including both an expansion of the runway to at least and the establishment of a helicopter base. The former was aimed at fish export to Asia while the latter was aimed at shuttle traffic to future oil fields in the Barents Sea. Avinor stated in 2012 that they saw no reason to look further into these plans. Berlevåg Airport is located in an open flat area and therefore is among the most well- suited sites for construction of a new primary airport in Finnmark. However, an expansion to or longer will result in an all-new runway having to be built. The air distance to Båtsfjord Airport is only 39 km, so some suggested a combined airport, but the road distance is 91 km, needing 1½ hour, and road is prone to snow storms in winter.– For mange småflyplasser i Finnmark? A 12 km tunnel would cut the distance to Båtsfjord by 30 km and make the road much more winter reliable, but that has been seen as too expensive. It could cost 1 billion NOK or more,Compare the 11 km tunnel om E134 costing 2 billion NOK. E134 Gvammen-Århus / Fakta compared with the 21 million (2013) annual subsidy of the airport. Avinor sees a problem in getting new aircraft of the size of the Dash 8-100 (39 seats) which can use the 800 meter runways, so they plan to use smaller planes with 19 seats when the Dash 8-100 retire. Facilities The terminal building is , of which is for the public, and has a capacity for 70 passengers per hour. The control tower is integrated into the terminal building. In addition there is a separate technical building with a garage. The airport lot covers an area of . Berlevåg Airport is located from the village center, which is connected via County Road 271. There is parking for ten cars at the airport. Taxis are available at the airport, but there is no bus service. The runway has an asphalted area of aligned 06–24. The tarmac has parking to two Dash 8-sized aircraft. SCAT-I, a Global Positioning System- based landing system is installed.INSTRUMENT APPROACH CHART - ICAO Airlines and destinations Widerøe Bombardier Dash-8 100 at Berlevåg Airport Berlevåg Airport is served by Widerøe with Dash 8-100 aircraft connecting the community with Tromsø, Kirkenes and other airports in Finnmark. The routes are operated on public service obligation with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. In 2016 the airport had 5,921 passengers, 1,865 aircraft movements and handled 3 tonnes of cargo, making it the second-least Avinor- operated airport. In 2007 there were 1,878 aircraft movements, consisting of 1,725 scheduled flights, 106 ambulance flights and 47 other flights. Of Avinor's 45 airports, Berlevåg has the largest per-passenger deficit, of NOK 3,216. Accidents and incidents On 11 March 1982 Widerøe Flight 933 crashed into the Barents Sea between Berlevåg and Mehamn Airport, after having made two intermediate stops since leaving Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. All fifteen people on board the Twin Otter were killed. The accident was caused by structural failure in the rudder and vertical stabilizer following severe clear-air turbulence. A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter, which resulted in four investigations—none which found any evidence of a collision.

It is one of the traditional stational churches of Lent. History The first church on the site was probably built in the 6th century, and a 10th-century inscription may be seen on a fluted column next to the entrance, but the first definite dedication is from a plaque on the church dating to 1128. The inscriptions found in S. Angelo, a valuable source illustrating the history of the Basilica, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.V. Forcella, Inscrizioni delle chese e d' altre edifici di Roma, dal secolo XI fino al secolo XVI Volume IV (Roma: Fratelli Bencini, 1874), pp. 115-139. Columns of the Temple of Speranza in the wall of the Church. It was constructed in and from the ruins of the Forum Holitorium and its temples, along with a jail (carcer) which a tradition (supported by Pliny's history of Rome) states was sited in the temples' ruins. However, the in Carcere (in jail) part of the name of the church was only changed to \\"in Carcere Tulliano\\" in the 14th century, owing to an erroneous identification. The prison was really that of Byzantine times (LPD i.515, n13; ii.295, n12). Spolia from all these ancient remains is still apparent in the church's construction, most particularly three columns from the Temple of Juno Sospita which are incorporated into both the 10th century and 1599 north façades of the church. The columns of the Temple of Janus, dedicated by Gaius Duilius after his naval victory at the Battle of Mylae in 260 BC,Tacitus. Annales. II.49. can still be seen as being incorporated into the wall of the church. The dedication to St Nicholas was made by the Greek population in the area. In the 11th century, it was known as the church of Petrus Leonis, referring to the converted Jewish family, the Pierleoni, who rebuilt the nearby Theatre of Marcellus as a fortress. One of their members, Pietro Pierleone, was an important cardinal in the 1120s and was elected Pope Anacletus II, though he was later branded a schismatic antipope.Mary Stroll, The Jewish Pope: Ideology and Politics in the Papal Schism of 1130 (New York: Brill Academic Pubs. 1987)., passim. The church was rebuilt in 1599, with a new facade by Giacomo della Porta (though the medieval campanile - originally a fortified tower, then adapted to a bell tower after being abandoned - was not altered). Stairs under the altar lead to the crypt and to the base of the former Roman temples. Beneath the high altar is also an ancient basalt bath tub containing martyrs' relics. Present The church is known for celebrations to the devotion of the Madonna; one is the Italian Our Lady of Pompeii, whose feast is celebrated here, and the other is the Mexican Our Lady of Guadalupe, a reproduction of whose miraculous painting, sent here from Mexico in 1773, is shown.

The nephew of John Macarthur and son-in-law of former New South Wales governor, Philip Gidley King, he was well-connected in the early colony of New South Wales.  First sojourn in New South Wales  Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur was born on 16 January 1788 at Plymouth, Devonshire, England. His father, James Macarthur, a draper, was the elder brother of John Macarthur. When his uncle John returned to New South Wales after resigning his commission to avoid being posted to Norfolk Island, he persuaded Hannibal to join him. Hannibal arrived at Sydney on 9 June 1805.Margaret Steven, \\"Macarthur, John (1766–1834)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur (1788–1861): accessed 15 September 2011. He left New South Wales in 1808 for England by way of China and the Philippines, where he unsuccessfully traded sandalwood for his uncle John, arriving home in 1810.  Return to New South Wales  Hannibal arrived back in Sydney in August 1812 per his uncle's ship, the Isabella with a cargo for sale in the colony and to help his uncle's wife, Elizabeth Macarthur in John's absence. He gained recognition while caring for his uncle's merino sheep during his absences, and by 1817 was able secure land for his own merino flocks, and run a trading store. He actively participated in the intrigues of the time and through his connections became prominent in the community and local politics. He joined the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1830, representing the conservatives in the nominated, and then part-elected Council for Parramatta until 1848. He also had a directorship in the newly created Bank of Australia, but at its collapse in 1843 Macarthur became insolvent, lost most of his property, and relocated to Ipswich, in the Moreton Bay District of the Colony of New South Wales (later the Colony of Queensland), where he was given a commission as police magistrate from 1 January 1852. Family His wife, Anna Maria Macarthur, 1826 In 1812 at St Marylebow, London, Hannibal Macarthur married Anna Maria King. Anna was born on 22 April 1793 on Norfolk Island, the daughter of Philip Gidley King, later governor of New South Wales, and his wife Anna Josepha (née Coombe). The couple had at least four daughters. One, Elizabeth (17 May 181527 November 1899), married Philip Gidley King, son of Philip Parker King. Another, Anna (7 December 181623 June 1852), married John Clements Wickham. A third, Catherine (14 June 181810 April 1894) married Patrick Leslie.C.G.

It is dedicated to Saint Sebastian, a late-third- century Christian martyr under the reign of Diocletian. According to legend, the church was built on the site of the saint's \\"first\\" martyrdom with arrows, which was unsuccessful.  History and excavation  The medieval church is accessed from the Via Bonaventura, from the Forum. It sits on a rectangular terrace, 110 by 150 metres, whose brick substructure dates back to the reign of the final Flavian Emperor, Domitian. Excavations carried out at the beginning of the twentieth century revealed the concrete foundation of a peripteral temple, 60 metres long and 40 metres wide. It may be the remains of the unidentifiable Temple of Divus Augustus, which was dedicated in the first century CE and rebuilt by Domitian after it was destroyed in a fire. It may also be the temple built by the emperor Elagabalus in the third century. The temple was replaced by a church and an attached monastery in the tenth century. It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Saint Sebastian, and Saint Zoticus, which can be read in an inscription that also contains the name of the founder of monastery, a physician named \\"Peter\\". Originally the church was known as Santa Maria in Pallara, after the Palladium, the ancient image of Athena from Troy which - along with some of the most sacred objects in pagan Rome - was allegedly kept in a pagan temple on the same site. In 1061, the church was given to the abbot of Montecassino. It was then dedicated to Saint Sebastian. The structure that stands today is the result of a rebuilding in 1624 by the Barberini family, during the rule of Pope Urban VIII. Detail of the fresco, with Jesus at the centre  Decoration  The exterior of the church is relatively unadorned, and the same goes for most of the interior. The apse is decorated with the frescoes that were preserved from the tenth century renovation. The style of the artwork is typical of that employed by medieval Roman workshops. The apse conch is decorated with two registers; the top register contains the figure of Jesus flanked by four saints, Sebastian being on the left. The lower register contains the Virgin Mary, flanked by angels and female saints. The lowest part of the apse was altered and repainted with the busts of Saint Sebastian, Saint Benedict, and Saint Zoticus.  Saint Sebastian  Saint Sebastian was a devout Christian who was educated in Milan. Because of his faithful military service and reliability, he was appointed as a leader of the praetorian guard. In this position, he was forced to conceal his Christian identity. In a community of Christians in Rome, Sebastian was responsible for converting several friends to Christianity, until they were all arrested and martyred; Sebastian was the final martyr. His sentence was one befitting a soldier of the praetorian guard, where he had to act as a target for bow-and-arrow practice. This did not kill him, and he was rescued by a woman named Irene, who nursed him back to health. When he was able, he confronted the emperor Diocletian about his sins, namely the persecution of Christians. The emperor ordered him to be beaten to death, and thrown into the Cloaca Maxima. Sebastian's body was removed by another pious woman, Lucina, and he was buried in the catacombs at a church which would later be called San Sebastiano fuori le mura. He is buried near the tombs of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. His story was recorded in the 5th century. The interior of the church  Titular church  On 5 March 1973, San Sebastiano al Palatino was established as a Cardinal titular church.

His best known and often quoted contribution to peace studies is the Call for Many Peaces published in 1998 and republished in 2006.A Call for Many Peaces, in: Dietrich/Echavarría/Koppensteiner (eds.): Key Texts of Peace Studies, Vienna, LIT Verlag, 2006. pages 282-305 Therein Wolfgang Dietrich dissolves the notion of a homogenous, universal peace in the plurality of the many peaces and thus establishes an approach, which is founded in respect towards the Other, without however deriving thereof the necessity of understanding this Otherness in all its facets or having to share opinions. Peace is thus thought in the sense of \\"many peaces\\" as a noun with a plural. He asserts that what peace means differs on closer inspection from culture to culture and the connotations and etymological interpretations of the concept of \\"peace\\" do not coincide in different languages, but are an expression of the plurality of worldviews and perceptions of the societies speaking those languages. Thus, peace no longer signifies an arrival in the utopian paradise at the end of all days, but implies a concretely livable societal process of conflict transformation. Since 2008 DietrichDietrich, Wolfgang: Variationen über die vielen Frieden; Vol.1:Deutungen; VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften Wiesbaden, 2008 distinguishes between the energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational understanding of peace. He advocates the so-called trans- rational approach, which combines the mechanistic understanding of modern peace with those cosmovisions which are energetically oriented towards the establishment and maintaining of harmonious relations between humans, nature and cosmos. From there he derives his culture-sensitive call for an elicitive approach to conflict transformation. Conflict work to him means facilitating the exploration and creation of new options by the conflicting parties instead of prescriptive conflict resolution by external experts. This approach inaugurated by Dietrich is didactically implemented and practically applied at the Innsbruck School of Peace Studies.University of Innsbruck - Peace Studies Selected bibliography *Elective Conflict Mapping, London, Palgrave Macmillan, 2018. *Variationen über die Frieden, Band 3: Elicitive Conflict Mapping.

On the general basis of the Chalcedonian christology and following the indications of the Scriptures as the only rule of faith, the Protestant (especially the Lutheran) scholastics at the close of the sixteenth and during the seventeenth century, built some additional features and developed new aspects of Christ's person. The propelling cause was the Lutheran doctrine of the real presence or omnipresence of Christ's body in the Lord's Supper, and the controversies growing out of it with the Zwinglians and Calvinists, and among the Lutherans themselves. These new features relate to the communion of the two natures, and to the states and the offices of Christ. The first was the production of the Lutheran Church, and was never adopted, but partly rejected, by the Reformed; the second and third were the joint doctrines of both, but with a very material difference in the understanding of the second.  Communicatio idiomatum  The communicatio idiomatum means the communication of attributes or properties (Gk. idiomata, Lat. proprietates) of one nature to the other, or to the whole person. It is derived from the unio personalis and the communio naturarum. Lutheran theologians distinguish three kinds or genera: (1) genus idiomaticum (or idiopoietikon), whereby the properties of one nature are transferred and applied to the whole person, for which are quoted such passages as Rom. i. 3 ; I Pet. iii. 18, iv. 1. (2) The genus apotelesmaticum (koinopoietikon), whereby the redemptory functions and actions which belong to the whole person (the apotelesmata) are predicated only of one or the other nature ( I Tim. ii. 5–6 ; Heb. i. 2 3 ). (3) The genus auchematicum, or maiestaticum, whereby the human nature is clothed with and magnified by the attributes of the divine nature (John iii. 13, v. 27 ; Matt. xxviii. 18, 20 ; Rom. ix. 5 ; Phil. ii. 10 ). Under this head the Lutheran Church claims a certain ubiquity or omnipresence for the body of Christ, on the ground of the personal union of the two natures; but as to the extent of this omnipresence there were two distinct schools which are both represented in Formula of Concord (1577). Brenz and the Swabian Lutherans maintained an absolute ubiquity of Christ's humanity from his very infancy, thus making the incarnation not only an assumption of the human nature, but also a deification of it, although the divine attributes were admitted to have been concealed during the state of humiliation. Martin Chemnitz and the Saxon divines called this view a monstrosity, and taught only a relative ubiquity, depending on Christ's will (hence called volipraesentia, or multivolipraesentia), who may be present with his whole person wherever he pleases to be or has promised to be. (4) A fourth kind would be the genus kenoticum (from kenosis), or tapeinoticum (from tapeinosis), Phil. ii. 7, 8 ; i.e., a communication of the properties of the human nature to the divine nature. But this is decidedly rejected by the old Lutherans as inconsistent with the unchangeableness of the divine nature, and as a \\"horrible and blasphemous\\" doctrine (Formula of Concord, p. 612), but is asserted by the modern Kenoticists. The Reformed divines adopted the communicatio idiomatum while disagreeing with the Lutheran formulation, especially regarding the genus maiestaticum (although they might approve the first two kinds, at least by way of what Zwingli termed allaiosis, or a rhetorical exchange of one part for another); and they decidedly rejected the third kind, because omnipresence, whether absolute or relative, is inconsistent with the necessary limitation of a human body, as well as with the Scripture facts of Christ's ascension to heaven, and promised return (see Black Rubric). The third genus can never be fully carried out, unless the humanity of Christ is also eternalized. The attributes, moreover, are not an outside appendix, but inherent qualities of the substance to which they belong, and inseparable from it. Hence a communication of attributes would imply a communication or mixture of natures. The divine and human natures can indeed hold free and intimate intercourse with each other; but the divine nature can never be transformed into the human, nor the human nature into the divine. Christ possessed all the attributes of both natures; but the natures, nevertheless, remain separate and distinct.  The twofold state of Christ  This is the state of humiliation and the state of exaltation. This doctrine is based upon . The state of humiliation embraces the supernatural conception, birth, circumcision, education, earthly life, passion, death, and burial of Christ; the state of exaltation includes the resurrection, ascension, and the sitting at the right hand of God. But here, again, the two confessions differ very considerably. First as to the descent into Hades. The Scholastic Lutherans (see: Lutheran High orthodoxy, 1600–1685) regarded it as a triumph over Hell, and made it the first stage of exaltation; while the Reformed divines viewed it as the last stage of the state of humiliation. It may be viewed as the turning-point from the one state to the other, and thus belonging to both. Secondly, the Lutheran Confessions of the Book of Concord refer the two states only to the human nature of Christ, regarding the divine as not susceptible of any humiliation or exaltation. The Reformed divines refer them to both natures; so that Christ's human nature was in a state of humiliation as compared with its future exaltation, and his divine nature was in the state of humiliation as to its external manifestation (ratione occultationis). With them, the incarnation itself is the beginning of the state of humiliation, while the Book of Concord excludes the incarnation from the humiliation. Finally, the Scholastic Lutherans regard the humiliation only as a partial concealment of the actual use (Gk. krypsis chreseos) of the divine attributes by the incarnate Logos.  The threefold offices of Christ  (a) The prophetical office (munus, or officium propheticum) includes teaching and the miracles of Christ. (b) The priestly office (munus sacerdotale) consists of the satisfaction made for the sins of the world by the death on the cross, and in the continued intercession of the exalted Savior for his people (redemptio et intercessio sacerdotalis). (c) The kingly office (munus regium), whereby Christ founded his kingdom, defends his Church against all enemies, and rules all things in heaven and on earth. The old divines distinguish between the reign of nature (regnum naturae sive potentiae), which embraces all things; the reign of grace (regnum gratiae), which relates to the Church militant on earth; and the reign of glory (regnum gloriae), which belongs to the Church triumphant in heaven. The threefold office or function of Christ was first presented by Eusebius of Caesarea. The theologians who followed Luther and Melanchthon down to the middle of the seventeenth century treat Christ's saving work under the two heads of king and priest. Calvin, in the first edition of his Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536), did the same, and it was not till the third edition (1559) and the Genevan Catechism that he fully presented the three offices.

Geography  Ballinteer is located approximately from the city centre. To the west is Rathfarnham, to the east is Sandyford and Stepaside, to the south are the Dublin Mountains, and to the north is Dundrum. Ballinteer is also bordered by the Marlay Park.  History  Ballinteer originally consisted of some housing groups off Ballinteer Avenue (Mayfield Terrace, Ballinteer Gardens, and Ballinteer Park), built between the 1920s and 1950s, and locally referred to as 'Old Ballinteer'. Ludford Estate was built in the late 1960s, followed by Ballinteer Drive, Grove, Crescent, Close. The latter four roads were originally called Lissadel Estate when built in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The sprawling estate of Broadford was built between the mid-1970s and early 1980s along with the ex-council estate Hillview. The most recent estate, Ballintyre, began construction in 2005 and was finished in mid-2008.  Amenities  Ballinteer has a range of shops and businesses including a mid- size supermarket located along Ballinteer Avenue. Also located here is a post office, two betting shops and two public houses. Every New Year's Day, the two public houses play a game of soccer in nearby Marley Park. Marlay Park is a large open parkland, with a craft centre near the old \\"big house\\"; the park hosts major concerts every year. Aside from St. Enda's, Dodder Park and Bushy Park (see above) and small green spaces, the area also hosts two golf clubs.  Transport  Dublin Bus routes 14, 14c, 16, 16c,16d , and 116 and Go-Ahead Ireland routes 75, 75a and 175 all serve Ballinteer.

Whalley MB, BS, MD, DPM, FRCP(E), FRC Psych was formerly the Crombie Ross Professor of Mental Health in the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK from 1992 to 2008. He is professor emeritus at the University of Aberdeen and from 2010 part-time professor of research at the University of the Highlands and Islands. Whalley is best known for follow-up studies of 757 Aberdeen City and Shire residents who took part at age 11 years in the Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1947. He has authored or co-authored more than 300 scientific publications (Google H-index = 67 in 2019), seven books and has contributed to many TV and radio programs mostly about the dementias of old age. Notably, he co-authored \\"A lifetime of Intelligence\\" with Deary & Starr (published by the American Psychological Association in 2009) and \\"Dementia\\" with John Breitner (Montreal) in 2002 and 2010. He was among the most highly cited academic staff members at the University of Aberdeen. Whalley's popular science account of \\"The Ageing Brain\\" (Phoenix Press, 2004, published in the USA and translated into Spanish, Italian and Japanese) describes some of his research findings on brain structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, nutrition, genetics and physical health and how these explain differences in individual rates of aging of some mental abilities while others are relatively preserved. His work \\"Understanding brain aging and dementia: a life course approach\\" was published in 2015 by Columbia University Press . He is currently Crombie Ross Professor emeritus at the University of Aberdeen (2008-2022)and research professor at the University of the Highlands & Islands (2010-2020). He has lectured widely in UK, USA, South Africa, Canada, and Australia mostly about dementia and severe forms of mental illness. He was a member of the senior clinical scientific staff at the MRC Brain Metabolism Unit, Edinburgh University(1978-1986), senior lecturer in psychiatry (Edinburgh University, 1986-1991) and honorary consultant psychiatrist Lothian Health Board (1978-1991). With George Fink in Edinburgh University Whalley investigated the role of oxytocin in severe mental illness and the benefits of ECT. He detected abnormalities of oxytocinergic function in schizoaffective mania, post-partum psychosis and how ECT modified oxytocin release. Whalley was born on 12 March 1946. He went to school at St Joseph's College, Blackpool (now St Mary's Catholic Academy), 1954–64, graduated in Medicine from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1969. Whalley trained in neuroendocrinology, geriatrics, neurology, and psychiatry in Oxford and then in Edinburgh where he studied epidemiology, psychometrics, and psychoneuroendocrinology before beginning cytogenetic-environment studies in early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (EOAD). In the University of Edinburgh with MRC support, he studied the epidemiology of EOAD in Scotland (1974–1988), found non-random urban \\"clusters\\" of EOAD and identified childhood environmental factors which increased risk and reduced survival after dementia onset. Using kinship analysis he showed ancestral genes could only partly explain some \\"clusters\\" and these genes were of small effect at a population level. Together with Ian Deary and John Starr, he began prospective studies of cognitive decline and vascular risk factors in 1300 healthy old people in Edinburgh (the Healthy Old People in Edinburgh HOPE studies). In 1997, with the assistance of the Scottish Council for Research in Education, he was granted access to a unique national archive of childhood IQ data (N~160,000) that could be used to estimate lifelong cognitive variation. No other country has ever IQ tested a total population sample in this way. In 1998, he devised a strategy to recruit 285 Aberdeen survivors all born in 1921 of the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932 (subjects by then aged 77) and next, from 1999, he recruited 506 survivors all born in 1936 from a second 1947 Survey (subjects by then aged 63–64 years). These groundbreaking studies were capitalized upon by Ian Deary in Edinburgh who followed up with much more intensive subsequent studies that formed \\"The Disconnected Mind Project\\" of adults by then aged 69 years and also born in 1936. Deary consolidated this research program into the internationally renowned Edinburgh University Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology. With the support from a Wellcome Professorial Senior Fellowship (2001–2006), Whalley extended his Aberdeen database and followed up these cohorts biennially over 5 years. He showed that dementia incidence is greater in those of lower childhood IQ, that lifetime variation in cognitive performance is linked to specific genetic factors, smoking, nutritional factors, childhood intelligence, and education. His research colleagues led by Dr. Roger Staff developed advanced statistical models of longitudinal changes in cognitive performance in Whalley's cohorts that include findings from longitudinal brain MRI studies and measures of information processing efficiency. With Deary and Starr, parallel follow-up studies were begun at Edinburgh University. He took early retirement from the University of Aberdeen in 2008 to focus exclusively on his research and after spending a period in the University of Southern California (curtailed by illness) he returned to Edinburgh where he has remained. In 2010 he was appointed until 2020 to the part-time staff of the University of the Highlands and Islands with the remit to develop a community-based dementia research program relevant to a rural community. Personal life: Whalley married his first wife Patricia MacCarthy and they have three daughters and six grandchildren. He then married Dr Helen Fox in 2011. They subsequently separated and now he is retired spending his time in either SE Spain or Scotland.

The airport features a asphalt runway aligned 06/24. Services are provided by Widerøe using their de Havilland Canada Dash 8 as a public service obligation. Owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor, the airport handled 121,021 passengers in 2014. Hovden opened on 1 July 1971 as a municipal airport having cost 5.9 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Until 1993 Widerøe served it using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter as a feeder service to Ålesund Airport, Vigra. The de Havilland Canada Dash 7 was used from 1985 to 1987. During the early years the airport had very poor regularity and was proposed closed. Terminal upgrades were carried out in 1988 and the runway extended in the early 2000s. Since the 2008 opening of the Eiksund Tunnel and the 2012 opening of the Kviven Tunnel, Hovden has significantly increased its catchment area and now covers a population of 60,000 in southern Sunnmøre and Nordfjord. This had led to a tripling of ridership. History The first aviation in Volda took place in 1935, when Gidsken Jakobsen demonstrated flights.Olsen-Hagen: 7 The first airport in Sunnmøre and Møre og Romsdal was Ålesund Airport, Vigra, which opened on 7 June 1958.Hjelle: 18 For the southern parts of Sunnmøre the airport incurred a travel time of two to three hours, including two ferries.Olsen-Hagen: 8 Møre og Romsdal Fylkesbåtar introduced a hovercraft service from Ørsta via Hareid to Ålesund and Vigra in April 1965. Travel time from Ørsta to the airport was 50 minutes. By the time of the fall storms the authorities withdrew the operating certificate due to safety concerns.Hjelle: 197 Following a 1962 government commission investigating the construction of new airports, Widerøe launched an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead. These could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population.Svanberg: 662–663 The airport in its surroundings. Ørsta is situated closest to the left in the images. Volda is not visible and is situated behind the hill to the left of the airport. The regional airports only received a simple terminal and an runway. The first such airports were opened in Helgeland in 1968. Planning in Ørsta and Volda commenced in February 1968, with the appointment of an inter-municipal commission. It concluded that a side on the shore of Hovdentjønna, a small lake, was a suitable site. It was estimated to cost NOK 1.5 million. The plans were approved by Parliament on 12 June 1969. In addition to Ørsta–Volda, these consisted of Førde Airport, Øyrane; Florø Airport and Sogndal Airport, Haukåsen.Olsen-Hagen: 9 Time until completion was set to two years and the responsibility was placed with the municipalities. The municipal councils approved the plans in early 1970 and an operating concession was granted by the government on 3 July. Construction was placed under the auspice of a committee with three representatives from each municipality and a representative from Møre og Romsdal County Municipality. The airport originally consisted of an runway and an apron measuring .Arnesen: 116 Navigation was provided by two radio beacons. Of the investment of NOK 5.3 million, the Ministry of Transport and Communications granted 2.97 million, the county 0.5 million and the remaining 1.8 million was loan. The terminal building Operating costs were covered by the two municipalities in the ratio of their population, initially nine sixteenth for Ørsta and seven sixteenths for Volda. The airport was run by an inter-municipal board and subordinate to the municipal engineer in Ørsta. The four airports opened on 1 July 1971.Olsen-Hagen: 10 Ørsta–Volda Airport was one of three airports in Møre og Romsdal to open within two years. Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget opened on 30 June 1970Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 183 and Molde Airport, Årø opened on 5 April 1972.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 184 This led to a dramatic reduction in services out of Vigra.Hjelle: 94 The original service from Hovden was a feeder service to Vigra operated by Widerøe with their 19-seat Twin Otters. In the first full year of operation the airport handled 8,835 passengers. During the first years the airport had notoriously poor regularity, and in the last quarter of 1972 half the flights were canceled. A contribution was the high runway visual range. There were discussions of closing Hovden and Sandane Airport, Anda and replacing them with an airport at Markane in Stryn, although this was never carried out. Eurocopter AS 350 of Airlift at Hovden Widerøe introduced the 50-passenger de Havilland Canada Dash 7 on some routes between 1985 and 1988. There were 18,138 passengers in 1985 and 24,150 two years later. This and the use of the Dash 7 caused the terminal to be upgraded in 1988. New navigational aids were installed in 1987, including a localizer and a new radio beacon, lowering the visual range to . Further improvements were made with the new runway lighting in 1989.Olsen-Hagen: 11 The Twin Otters were in 1993 replaced with Dash 8-100s. With this the flights to Ålesund were terminated and instead flights to Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Bergen Airport, Flesland were introduced. From 1997 Widerøe built a hangar at Hovden, allowing it to have a night stop there. This further helped regularity.Olsen-Hagen: 12 Ownership of the airport passed to the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) on 1 January 1997. The runway was extended in both directions in the early 2000s. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Hovden saw 51,000 passengers in 2008. With the opening of the Eiksund Tunnel that year Ulstein, Herøy and Hareid were all given a fixed link to the airport. This gave a large increase in use of the airport, hitting 100,000 passengers in 2011. The 2012 opening of the Kviv Tunnel brought the airport even closer to Nordfjord and Hovden started capturing patronage from Sandane Airport, Anda. This has been sufficient for Avinor to consider the closing of Anda. Combined these two road projects have tripled the airport's catchment area. Facilities Ørsta–Volda Airport is situated in Hovebygda in Ørsta, Norway. Its catchment area covers the southern parts of Sunnmøre and parts of Nordfjord. It has a reference elevation of 74 meters (243 ft) above mean sea level. The asphalt runway physically measures and is aligned 06/24. It has a takeoff run available (TORA) of on runway 06 and on runway 24, and a landing distance available (LDA) of . The airport is equipped with category 4 fire and rescue service. There are 16 Avinor employees at the airport, consisting of five in the aerodrome flight information service and nine in the ground services.Olsen- Hagen: 15 Airlines and destinations Widerøe de Havilland Canada Dash-8 103 at Ørsta–Volda Airport All services at the airport are operated by Widerøe with their fleet of de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100 aircraft. These are public service obligations subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. There are five daily flights to Oslo and two daily services to Sogndal, some of which continue to Bergen. There is a weekly flight to Florø. Operation of the airport ran at a deficit of NOK 22 million in 2012. In addition the routes are subsidized at a cost of NOK 279 per passenger.Larsen: 18 Hovden served 121,021 passengers, 6,294 aircraft movements and handled 2 tonnes of cargo. Ground transport Fram operates a local bus service between Ørsta and Volda every half-hour during the day and every hour during the evening. It stops at a bus stop seven minutes walk from the airport terminal. Paid parking, taxis and car rental are available at the airport. The airport is situated on the E39, five minutes driving from both Ørsta and Volda.

They currently play in the Bohemian Football League.  History  The first football team in Čáslav was founded in 1902 when the Septimáni school established the first football eleven named SK Stella (star) Čáslav. This sporting initiative was looked on sympathetically by a college professor and allowed them to play their matches on a military field. The situation rapidly changed and football soon became a favourite sport in Čáslav. In 1927 the football team became Čáslav SK. This continued throughout the 1930s and was renamed DSK Čáslav, but soon after disappeared from playing altogether. In 1943 Slavoj Čáslav was founded, which in 1949 merged with SK Čáslav to create a single club called SK Kosmos Čáslav. They soon occupied first league position in the autumn and progressed to the latter stages of the former regional competition. In 1950 they participated in the national league. There was a crisis in local football which lasted until 1960 and the team was relegated from the national championship. Over time, the situation began to improve and in the 1967–68 season the team was once again promoted a division. The seventies was a repetition of the club's crisis years of the fifties. The FC Zenit Čáslav used from 1989 to 2011 In 1989, they once again changed names to Aegis Čáslavska Záštitu Závodu Zenit s.r.o. and then again changed its name to FC Zenit Čáslav. A new element in the football club increased focus on youth, which along with other changes led to an improvement of players of the club. In 1998, Čáslav were promoted a division and again in the year 2003–04 to the Bohemian Football League, where they played for two seasons before winning another promotion, this time to the Czech 2. Liga in 2006. In the year 2008–09 Čáslav finished as second in the Czech 2. Liga and won the right to play in the Czech First League. However, they sold that right to 1. FC Slovácko. At present, Čáslav have twelve teams playing in each age category. In addition to the \\"A\\" team, there is also a \\"B\\" team playing 1A within the regional division. The 2012–13 season started poorly for Čáslav, winning one match and drawing two from the first seven, which prompted the sacking of manager Petr Vrabec. At the end of the season Čáslav were relegated, having spent a seven-year spell in the second division.

The species was first described by Michael Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in 1775. It is distributed throughout Europe from northern Scotland and middle Fennoscandia in the north and then south to central Spain, Sicily and Greece. In the east, the species ranges to Western Asia. In the Alps it rises to an altitude of 2000 meters. This species is extremely similar to the marbled minor (Oligia strigilis) and the rufous minor (Oligia versicolor) and specific identification usually requires close study of the genitalia.

With a wingspan of 24–27 mm, O. latruncula is usually the smallest of the three, although they all overlap in size. Well-marked specimens often have noticeably dark forewings, with a blackish basal area and a coppery brown, rather than whitish, subterminal band. However, melanism is very common in this species and all-dark specimens constitute 100% of the population in some areas. O. latruncula flies at night from May to August and is attracted to light and sugar. The larva feeds internally on the stems of various grasses including Calamagrostis and Dactylis, pupating in a cocoon among the roots. This species overwinters as a larva. # The flight season refers to the British Isles. This may vary in other parts of the range. References *Skinner, Bernard (1984).

HCP undertakes the restoration and rehabilitation of historic structures and public spaces in ways that can spur social, economic and cultural development. Individual projects go beyond technical restoration to address the questions of the social and environmental context, adaptive reuse, institutional sustainability and training. In several countries, local Aga Khan Cultural Service companies have been formed to implement projects under the supervision of the HCSP headquarters in Geneva. Role of the HCP The HCP works closely with all project stakeholders, including the community. The Programme is able to provide planning assistance to government and local conservation bodies. It provides technical expertise and can help to secure funding and resources by defining opportunities and approaches, preparing feasibility studies, and shaping proposals for submission to local investors and international agencies. It also participates in urban conservation and development efforts that focus on building clusters, public spaces between and around buildings, a district, or a historic town. These projects aim to restore and maintain the socioeconomic and cultural fabric of the designated area. The Programme also engages in restoring specific historic sites and buildings that include elements of urban landscape or single structures, for which appropriate new functions are developed to meet the social and economic needs of the respective communities. The Programme is concerned with the long-term viability of its conservation projects and does support associated cultural initiatives in this regard. All enabling development factors – community support, innovative institutional structures, and commercial potential – are harnessed, whenever possible, to make conservation sustainable. Funding sources HCP plans and executes projects with funding from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and other donors. Institutions, such as the Getty Grant Program, World Monuments Fund, the Ford Foundation, the Swiss, Swedish and Norwegian bilateral aid organisations, and the World Bank have sponsored or co-funded HCSP activities. HCSP establishes local service companies as partners in implementation and prepares them for autonomous operation as self-sustaining community organisations. Projects The Historic Cities Programme has been involved in nearly twenty distinct revitalisation projects in Afghanistan, the Northern Areas of Pakistan, Zanzibar, Samarkand, Cairo, Mostar (Bosnia), Mali and Syria. In all project locations, community participation, training of local professionals and local institution-building are essential components. *Restoration of the Great Mosque of Mopti, Mali *Restoration of the gardens of Humayun's Tomb in Delhi, India *Conservation of Forts in Hunza and Baltistan, Pakistan *Restoration and Conservation of old neighbourhoods of Kabul, Afghanistan *Conservation of the sixteenth century Bagh-e Babur (Babur's Gardens) in Kabul, Afghanistan *Repair and conservation of the late 18th century mausoleum of Timur Shah in Kabul, Afghanistan *Conservation of structures and upgrading of infrastructure in the old city of Herat, Afghanistan *Repairs to the shrine complex of Khoja Abdullah Ansari, dating from the Timurid period in Gozargah, Afghanistan *Restoration of structures and conservation planning in Old Stone Town, Zanzibar *Creation of the 30 hectare Al-Azhar Park from a garbage dump in Cairo, Egypt *Preparation of a new master plan for the Timurid city in Samarkand, Uzbekistan *Restoration of key monuments, historic buildings and open spaces in the old city of Mostar, Bosnia *Provision of technical assistance and training to the Directorate of Antiquities in Syria for the conservation and management of three major citadels in Aleppo, Masyaf and Qalat Salah ed-Din Awards and recognition *2007 Time Magazine: The Best of Asia Awards – Best Historic Restoration awarded for the restoration of Bagh-e Babur (Babur's Gardens) in Kabul, Afghanistan. *2006 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation – Award of Excellence for the restoration of the Shigar Fort Palace in Skardu, Northern Pakistan *2006 PATA GOLD Award for Heritage and Culture awarded for the Restoration and Re- Use of Shigar Fort Palace in Skardu, Northern Pakistan *2005 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Conservation Award of Merit for the conservation of Amburiq Mosque in Skardu, Baltistan, Pakistan *2005 Time Magazine Asia, Best of Asia Award for the Baltit Fort, Hunza Valley, Pakistan *2005 Travel +Leisure magazine Global Vision Innovation Award for Al-Azhar Park in Cairo, Egypt *2004 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Conservation – Award of Excellence for the restoration of the 700-year-old Baltit Fort in Northern Pakistan *2003 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Conservation – Award of Distinction for the restoration of the 300-year-old mausoleum of Syed Mir Muhammad in Khaplu, Baltistan, Pakistan *2002 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Conservation – Award of Distinction for the restoration of four 300-year-old wooden mosques in Pakistan's Hunza Valley *2000 Tourism for Tomorrow Awards: Global Winner – Karimabad and Baltit Project Development, Pakistan See also * Aga Khan Award for Architecture * Aga Khan Development Network * Islamic architecture References Sources * External links *Historic Cities Programme *ArchNet Digital Library – Historic Cities Support Programme *Aga Khan Trust for Culture *The Aga Khan Development Network Historic Cities Programme Category:Islamic culture ","title":"Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme"},{"id":"8071055","text":"A group of Chilean 'Damas de Rojo', volunteers on their local hospital and a clear example of social medicine. The field of social medicine seeks to implement social care through # understanding how social and economic conditions impact health, disease and the practice of medicine and # fostering conditions in which this understanding can lead to a healthier society. Social medicine as a scientific field gradually began in the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent increase in poverty and disease among workers raised concerns about the effect of social processes on the health of the poor. The field of social medicine is most commonly addressed today by public health efforts to understand what are known as social determinants of health. Scope The major emphasis on biomedical science in medical education, health care, and medical research has resulted into a gap with our understanding and acknowledgement of far more important social determinants of public health and individual disease: social-economic inequalities, war, illiteracy, detrimental life-styles (smoking, obesity), discrimination because of race, gender and religion. Farmer et al. (2006) gave the following explanation for this gap: 'The holy grail of modern medicine remains the search for a molecular basis of disease. While the practical yield of such circumscribed inquiry has been enormous, exclusive focus on molecular-level phenomena has contributed to the increasing \\"desocialization\\" of scientific inquiry: a tendency to ask only biological questions about what are in fact biosocial phenomena.' They further concluded that 'Biosocial understandings of medical phenomena are urgently needed'. Social care Social care traditionally takes a different look at issues of impairment and disability by adopting a holistic perspective on health. The social model was developed as a direct response to the medical model, the social model sees barriers (physical, attitudinal and behavioural) not just as a biomedical issue, but as caused in part by the society we live in – as a product of the physical, organizational and social worlds that lead to discrimination (Oliver 1996; French 1993; Oliver and Barnes 1993). Social care advocates equality of opportunities for vulnerable sections of society. History German physician Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902) laid foundations for this model. Other prominent figures in the history of social medicine, beginning from the 20th century, include Salvador Allende, Henry E. Sigerist, Thomas McKeown, Victor W. Sidel, Howard Waitzkin, and more recently Paul Farmer and Jim Yong Kim. In The Second Sickness, Howard Waitzkin traces the history of social medicine from Engels, through Virchow, through Allende. Waitzkin has sought to educate North Americans about the contributions of Latin American Social Medicine. In 1976, the British public health scientist and health care critic, Thomas McKeown, MD, published The role of medicine: Dream, mirage or nemesis?, wherein he summarized facts and arguments that supported what became known as the McKeown's thesis, i.e. that the growth of population can be attributed to a decline in mortality from infectious diseases, primarily thanks to better nutrition, later also to better hygiene, and only marginally and late to medical interventions such as antibiotics and vaccines. McKeown was heavily criticized for his controversial ideas, but is nowadays remembered as 'the founder of social medicine'.

It was penned by Rabbi Meir bar Yitzchak (Nehorai) of Orléans, who was a cantor (prayer leader) in Worms, Germany, (died ca. 1095). Akdamut consists of praise for God, His Torah, and His people. Akdamut is read in almost all Ashkenazi synagogues on the first day of Shavuot during the Torah reading. The original practice was for it to be recited after the reading of the first verse (Exodus 19:1), but in the past few centuries, the practice has developed in many congregations (mainly Eastern European ones) that the poem is read after the kohen has been called to the Torah reading, but before he recites the blessing. The reason for the original practice was that, from Biblical times to well into medieval times, each verse of the Torah reading in Hebrew would be followed by its interpretation into Aramaic, and therefore it would be appropriate, after the first Hebrew verse was read, for another reader to provide an Aramaic gloss including this \\"introduction\\". However, when the simultaneous Aramaic interpretation fell into disuse, the recitation of Akdamut remained between the first and second Hebrew verses, where it no longer seemed an appropriate interruption, so it was relocated to before the commencement of the Torah reading.Nulman, Macy, Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson) page 14; Salamon, Avrohom Yaakov, Akdamus Millin, with a new translation and commentary anthologized from the traditional Rabbinic literature (1978, Brooklyn, Mesorah Pub'ns) intro., pages xv–xvi. In most synagogues it is read responsively: the baal keriah (Torah reader) singing two verses, and the congregation responding with the next two verses. Although it is considered \\"Judaism's best-known and most beloved piyyut\\",Scherman, Nosson, The Complete ArtScroll Machzor: Shavuos (Ashkenaz ed. 1995, Brooklyn, Mesorah Pub'ns) page 266; Salamon, Avrohom Yaakov, Akdamus Millin, with a new translation and commentary anthologized from the traditional Rabbinic literature (1978, Brooklyn, Mesorah Pub'ns) intro., page xiii. there are some synagogues where it is not recited.Nathan Marcus Adler, the Chief Rabbi of the British Empire (from 1845 to his death 1890), opined that it was expendable from the liturgy. cf. Stern, Martin, Akdamut, Mail- Jewish, June 13, 2007. For this reason, apparently, it has not appeared in the \\"official\\" British siddur, the Authorised Daily Prayer Book of the United Hebrew Congregations, from the Singer edition (1890) down to the Jonathan Sacks edition (2007) – yet it does appear in the Hebrew-English siddur edited by the same Jonathan Sacks, The Koren Sacks Siddur, published by Koren of Jerusalem, 2009, page 792, as well as in American Orthodox and Conservative prayerbooks. Elbogen, Ismar, Jewish Liturgy: A comprehensive history (orig. 1913, English transl. 1993, Philadelphia, Jewish Publ'n Society) page 154, \\"These poems were never intelligible, but now, with the elimination of the [Aramaic] translation that they were intended to introduce, they have completely lost their significance and their right to exist.\\" It was also omitted, as were most piyutim, from Reform liturgy. Petuchowski, Jakob J., Prayerbook Reform in Europe (1968, NY, World Union for Progressive Judaism) page 117. It also does not appear in the Reconstructionist 1958 Festival Prayer Book.But it appears in the Conservative 1946 Sabbath and Festival Prayer Book (with a lyric translation). Its adoption into the regular liturgy took some time; it is not mentioned as part of the Shavuot liturgy until the first decade of the 15th century and the earliest prayerbook to contain it was published in 1557.Hoffman, Jeffrey, \\"Akdamut: History, Folklore, and Meaning\\", Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. 99, nr. 2 (spring 2009) page 170. Apparently it replaced an earlier piyyut, Arkin Moshe, which was a folkloric poem describing the excitement among the angels when God brought Moses up to Heaven to receive the Ten Commandments.Marx, Dalia, \\"Liturgy Composed on the Brink of Catastrophe: Examination of Akdamut Millin by R. Meir of Worms and R. Leo Baeck's Hirtenbrief for Kol Nidre Service of 1935\\", in Homolka, Walter, ed., Leo Baeck – Philosophical and Rabbinical Approaches (2007, Berlin, Frank & Timme) footnote 24 pages 93–94. That poem is still used in some congregations. Nulman, Macy, Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson) page 36; Munk, Elie, The World of Prayer (orig. 1935, English transl. 1961, NY, Feldheim) page 165. It is present in the first volume of the so-called Worms Mahzor, JNUL 4° 781/1 (Wurzburg, 1272), fol. 147v. It appears without an English translation in The Complete ArtScroll Machzor: Shavuos (Ashkenaz ed. 1995, Brooklyn, Mesorah Pub'ns) page 658. The adoption of Akdamut into the liturgy may have been assisted by a folktale that connected its composition with a miraculous event involving the defeat of an evil sorcerer monk who was using magic to kill countless Jews.Hoffman, Jeffrey, \\"Akdamut: History, Folklore, and Meaning\\", Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. 99, nr. 2 (spring 2009) pages 162–164; Munk, Elie, The World of Prayer (orig. 1935, Engl. transl. 1961, NY, Feldheim) page 165. Structure The entire poem is 90 verses long. The first 44 verses of Akdamut are arranged as a double alphabetic acrostic, two lines for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, followed by 46 verses with the initial letters spelling out the words, \\"Meir, son of Rabbi Isaac, may he grow in Torah and in good deeds. Amen. Be strong and have courage.\\" The language of Akdamut is terse and complicated, and is replete with references to Torah and Talmud. Each line has ten syllables and concludes with the syllable \\"ta\\" (תא), which is spelled with the last letter (taw) and first letter (aleph) of the Hebrew alphabet. The encoded message from the author is that a Jew never stops learning Torah — when one finishes, one must start anew again. This message was appropriately chosen for Shavuot, since this holiday commemorates the Jews accepting the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. The language of the poem is Aramaic, – \\"terse, difficult Aramaic\\" Scherman, Nosson, The Complete ArtScroll Machzor: Shavuos (Ashkenaz ed. 1995, Brooklyn, Mesorah Pub'ns) page 266; Salamon, Avrohom Yaakov, Akdamus Millin, with a new translation and commentary anthologized from the traditional Rabbinic literature (1978, Brooklyn, Mesorah Pub'ns) intro., page xiii.—or even \\"never intelligible\\".Elbogen, Ismar, Jewish Liturgy: A comprehensive history (orig. 1913, Engl. transl. 1993, Philadelphia, Jewish Publ'n Society) page 154. Some prayerbooks, especially those intended for use in Israel, provide a running translation from the now arcane Aramaic into Hebrew.Examples: Rosenstein, Hayim David, Siddur Shira Hadasha (orig. 1914, reprinted 1945, Jerusalem, Eshkol Publ'g, pages 547–550 (different pages in some other printings); Tal, Shlomo, Siddur Rinat Yisrael (Ashkenaz ed. 1977, Jerusalem, Israeli Ministry of Education) pages 580–587 (and similarly in the Rinat Yisrael mahzor for Shavuot); (these two Hebrew renderings differ from each other). In summary, the poem begins with the greatness of God, which exceeds all ability to describe it (verses 1–14), and then the myriads of various kinds of angels created by Him and attending Him (15–26). The various angels praise God according to their categories, some praise Him unceasingly, some at recurring times, some only once (27–42). The nations of the earth seek to acquire Israel to add to their own greatness but Israel replies that its loyalty is only to God, and this is the source of Israel's attributes and strength (43–74). In the future, Leviathan and Behemoth, two enormous creatures mentioned in Scripture, will be brought together, and killed and prepared by God as a banquet for the righteous in opulent furnishings (75–84). The narration concludes with a benediction and wish that the hearer might be privileged to attend this same banquet, and assures the audience that this will be so, if only they hearken to the words of the Torah (85–90). Musical considerations When Akdamut was first composed and introduced it was not accompanied by a specific melody. It is not chanted according to any system of accents used in Biblical cantillation.Nulman, Macy, Concise Encyclopedia of Jewish Music (1975, NY, McGraw-Hill) page 6. A number of different musical treatments have grown around it in various communities. Among these is a mode similar to that used for the Festival Kiddush, a melody similar to that used on Simchat Torah for the honoring of the \\"Bridegroom of the Torah\\" (who reads the concluding lines of Deuteronomy) – which, since the holidays share related concepts, seems very plausible, and there is also a melody of more recent vintage adopted from a German folksong.Nulman, Macy, Concepts of Jewish Music and Prayer (1985, NY, Cantorial Council of America) pages 44 and 54; Beer, Bernard, \\"Liturgical and Musical Aspects of Shavuot\\", Shavuot-to-Go 5769 (2009, NY, Yeshiva Univ. Center for the Jewish Future) page 5, https://www.scribd.com/doc/31159472/Untitled. Parallels in other works The reference in Akdamut to all the seas being ink and all the reeds pens is paralleled to verses in the Quran: \\"Were the sea ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would surely fail before the words of my Lord fail\\" (Sura 18, verse 109), and \\"Were the trees that are in the earth pens, were the sea ink with seven more seas to swell its tide, the words of God would not be spent\\" (Sura 31, verse 27). The third verse of Frederick M. Lehman's 1917 hymn \\"The Love of God\\" is based on this passage from Akdamut. Medieval Christian sermons use the same imagery.

The original version of the lament is alleged to have been written by Macpherson himself in prison on the eve of his execution. Early life Macpherson was the illegitimate son of a Highland laird, Macpherson of Invereshie, and a beautiful Tinker or gypsy girl that he met at a wedding. The gentleman acknowledged the child, and had him reared in his house. After the death of his father, who was killed while attempting to recover a \\"spread\\" of cattle taken from Badenoch by reivers – the boy was reclaimed by his mother's people. The gypsy woman frequently returned with him, to wait upon his relations and clansmen, who never failed to clothe him well, besides giving money to his mother. He grew up \\"in beauty, strength and stature rarely equaled.\\" Macpherson is reported as being a man of uncommon personal strength. He became an expert swordsman, and a renowned fiddler, and eventually became the leader of the gypsy band. The tinker-Gypsies then lived by buying and selling horses and seem to have been quite popular with the ordinary country folk. Outlaw career Though his prowess was debased as the exploits of a freebooter (pirate), it is certain, says one writer, that no act of cruelty, or robbery of the widow, the fatherless, or the distressed was ever perpetrated under his command. Indeed, it is alleged that a dispute with an aspiring and savage man of his tribe, who wished to rob a gentleman's house while his wife and two children lay on the bier for interment, was the cause of his being betrayed to the vengeance of the law. Thus he was betrayed by a man of his own tribe, and was the last person executed at Banff previous to the abolition of heritable jurisdictions. Macpherson had incurred the enmity of the rich lairds and farmers of the low country of Banff and Aberdeenshire, and especially of Duff of Braco, who organised a posse to catch him. \\"After holding the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray in fear for some years\\", says Chambers, \\"he was seized by Duff of Braco, ancestor of the Earl of Fife, and tried before the Sheriff of Banffshire (8 November 1700), along with certain Gypsies who had been taken in his company. Before ultimately being brought to trial, Macpherson was captured several times but always escaped from his enemies. In Aberdeen, his cousin, Donald, and a gypsy named Peter Brown, aided by the populace, rescued him from prison. Shortly afterwards, he was again captured, but was once more rescued, this time by the Laird of Grant. Capture and trial Macpherson's career of robbery had culminated in a \\"reign of terror\\" in the markets of Banff, Elgin and Forres. Apparently under protection of the Laird of Grant, he and his band of followers would come marching in with a piper at their head. Perhaps he became too powerful for comfort for he was hanged at Banff in 1700, for bearing arms at Keith market. At the Saint Rufus Fair in Keith Macpherson was attacked by Braco's men, and was captured after a fierce fight in which one of Jamie's crew was killed. According to the traditional account penned by Jamie himself, a woman dropped a blanket over him from a window, and he was disarmed before he could get free of it. Duff and a very strong escort then took him to Banff prison. It was still at that time a criminal offence merely to be an Egyptian (Gypsy) in Scotland, and it was under this statute that Macpherson was tried in November 1700. Macpherson and three others were brought to trial at Banff before Sheriff Nicholas Dunbar, Sheriff of Banffshire (who allegedly was a close friend of Duff's), on 8 November 1700, accused of: \\"Being ye mercats in yr ordinary manner of thieving and purse-cutting, or of the crimes of theft and masterful bangstree and oppression\\", and they were found \\"Fyllen, culpable, and convick\\" and sentenced \\"For sae muckle, as you, James Macpherson, are found guilty of being Egyptians and vagabonds and oppressors of his free lieges. Therefore, I adjudge and decern you to be taken to the cross of Banff to be hanged by the neck to the death\\". The actual procès-verbal of his trial is still extant; the following is the text of the death sentence: > \\"Forasmeikle as you James Macpherson, pannal [accused] are found guilty by > ane verdict of ane assyse, to be knoun, holden, and repute to be Egiptian > and a wagabond, and oppressor of his Magesties free lieges in ane bangstrie > manner, and going up and down the country armed, and keeping mercats in ane > hostile manner, and that you are a thief, and that you are of pessimae > famae. Therfor, the Sheriff-depute of Banff, and I in his name, adjudges and > discernes you the said James Macpherson to be taken to the Cross of Banff, > from the tolbooth thereof, where you now lye, and there upon ane gibbet to > be erected, to be hanged by the neck to the death by the hand of the common > executioner, upon Friday next, being the 16th day of November instant, being > a public weekly mercat day, betwixt the hours of two and three in the > afternoon....” Macpherson's Lament While under sentence of death in the jail, during the week between his trial and his execution, Macpherson is said to have composed the tune and the song now known as Macpherson's Lament or Macpherson's Rant. Sir Walter Scott says that Macpherson played it under the gallows, and, after playing the tune, he then offered his fiddle to anyone in his clan who would play it at his wake. When no one came forward to take the fiddle, he broke it – either across his knee or over the executioner's head – and then threw it into the crowd with the remark, \\"No one else shall play Jamie Macpherson's fiddle\\". The broken fiddle now lies in the Macpherson Clan museum near Newtonmore, Inverness-shire. He then was hanged or, according to some accounts, threw himself from the ladder, to hang by his own will. This was allegedly the last capital sentence executed in Scotland under Heritable Jurisdiction, taking place on 16 November 1700. The traditional accounts of Macpherson's immense prowess seem justified by his bones, which were found not very many years ago, and were allowed by all who saw them to be much stronger than the bones of ordinary men.Quarterly Review, Vol. 1, Number 1, February 1809, p. 30 He was assuredly no ordinary man, that he could so disport himself on the morning of his execution. It is universally believed in the North-East of Scotland that a reprieve was on its way to Banff at the time of the execution. The legend has it that Duff of Braco saw a lone rider coming from Turriff and correctly assumed that he carried a pardon for Jamie from the Lord of Grant. As the story goes, he then set about turning the village clock 15 minutes ahead and so hanging Macpherson before the pardon arrived. The magistrates allegedly were punished for this and the town clock was kept 15 minutes before the correct time for many years. Even to this day the town of Macduff has its west-facing town clock covered so the people of Banff can't see the correct time! A text (and there are many variations) of \\"Macpherson's Lament or Rant\\" follows: :I've spent my life in rioting, :Debauch'd my health and strength, :I squander'd fast, as pillage came, :And fell to shame at length. :Chorus: :Sae rantingly, sae wantonly, :Sae dauntingly gaed he; :He play'd a tune, and danc'd it roon' :Below the gallows-tree. :My father was a gentleman, :Of fame and honour high, :Oh mother, would you ne'er had borne :The son so doom'd to die. :Chorus :Ach, little did my mother think :When first she cradled me :That I would turn a roving boy :And die on the gallows tree :Chorus :Farewell, yon dungeons dark and strong, :The wretch's destinie! :Macpherson's time will not be long :On yonder gallows-tree. :Chorus :O what is Death but parting breath? :On many a bloody plain :I've dar'd his face, and in this place :I'll scorn him yet again. :Chorus :But vengeance I never did wreak, :When pow'r was in my hand, :And you, dear friends, no vengeance seek, :It is my last command. :Chorus :Forgive the man whose rage betray'd :Macpherson's worthless life; :When I am gone, be it not said, :My legacy was strife. :Chorus :It was by a woman's treacherous hand :That I was condemned tae dee :Aboon a ledge at a windae she stood :And a blanket she threw o'er me :Chorus :Untie these bands frae aff o' my hands :And gie tae me my sword :There's no a man in a' Scotland :But I'll brave him at his word :Chorus :There's some come here tae see me hang :And some tae buy my fiddle :But afore that I dae part wi' her :I'd brak' her through the middle :Chorus :He took his fiddle into both of his hands :And he brak' it o'er a stone :Said, Nae ither hands shall play on thee :When I am deid and gane :Chorus :Now farewell light, thou sunshine bright, \\" :And all beneath the sky! :May coward shame distain his name, :The wretch that dares not die! :Chorus :A reprieve was coming o'er the brig o' Banff :Tae set Macpherson free, :But they pit the clock a quarter afore :And they hanged him from a tree. :Chorus :Sae rantingly, sae wantonly, :Sae dauntingly gaed he; :He play'd a tune, and danc'd it roon' :And they hanged him from a tree.

One creation is extant as of 2013. The Blackett family can be traced back to the Blacketts/Blakheveds of Woodcroft, County Durham, some of whom became highly successful in the lead and coal mining industries in Northumberland and County Durham. The Blackett Baronetcy, of Newcastle in the County of Northumberland, was created in the Baronetage of England on 12 December 1673 for William Blackett, Member of Parliament for Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Blackett was succeeded by his elder son, Edward, the second Baronet who represented Ripon and Northumberland in the House of Commons and built Newby Hall. William's third younger son William was created a baronet in his own right in 1685 (see below). The second Baronet's eldest surviving son, Edward, the third Baronet, was a Captain in the Royal Navy. He died childless in 1756 and was succeeded by his nephew, Edward, the fourth Baronet, who was Member of Parliament for Northumberland and the son of John Blackett. The title thereafter descended from father to son until the death of Charles, the ninth Baronet, in 1968. Two of his younger brothers, George, the tenth Baronet, and Francis, the eleventh Baronet, both succeeded in the title. As of 2013 the title is held by the latter's eldest son, Hugh, the twelfth Baronet, who succeeded in 1995. Another member of the family to gain distinction was Henry Blackett (1867–1952), son of John Charles Blackett, fourth son of the fourth Baronet. He was an Admiral in the Royal Navy. The family seat was Matfen Hall, Matfen, Northumberland, now a hotel and country club. It is now the nearby Halton Castle, Northumberland. The Blackett Baronetcy, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the County of Northumberland, was created in the Baronetage of England on 23 January 1685 for William Blackett, third son of the first Baronet of the 1673 creation. He sat as Member of Parliament for Newcastle-upon-Tyne. On his death the title passed to his son, William, the second Baronet. He also represented Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the House of Commons. Blackett had no legitimate issue and the title became extinct on his death in 1728. His illegitimate daughter Elizabeth married Sir Walter Calverley-Blackett, 2nd Baronet, who assumed the additional surname of Blackett (see Calverley-Blackett baronets for more information on this title).

Blackett was the eldest surviving son of Sir Edward Blackett, 2nd Baronet, and his wife Mary, daughter of Sir John Yorke. He served in the Royal Navy and achieved the rank of Captain. Blackett married Mary, daughter of Reverend Thomas Jekyll. They had no children. He died in March 1756 and was buried in Ripon, Yorkshire. The baronetcy devolved on his nephew, Edward. Lady Blackett only survived her husband by nine months and died in November 1756. *Sir Edward Blackett, 4th Baronet (1719–1804) *Sir William Blackett, 5th Baronet (16 February 1759 – 27 October 1816). Blackett succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father, Sir Edward Blackett, 4th Baronet, in 1804, and was educated at Trinity College, Oxford. He was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1807/8. Blackett married Mary Anne Keene and their home was Matfen Hall, Matfen, Northumberland. He died at Westoe Lodge, Cambridge, and was succeeded by his son Edward. *Sir Edward Blackett, 6th Baronet DL JP (23 February 1805 – 23 November 1885). Blackett succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father Sir Edward Blackett, 5th Baronet, in 1816. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, and served in the army in the 1st Life Guards. He was also a Justice of the Peace, Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland (23 July 1831), and High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1833, and constructed the new mansion house at Matfen Hall, Matfen, Northumberland, in 1828. Blackett married four times; in 1830 to Julia Monck, the mother of all his children, in 1851 to Francis Vere (Lorane) Ord (d. 29 May 1874), widow of William Ord of Whitfield, in 1875 to Isabella Richardson and finally in 1880 to Alethea Rianette Scott. He died on 23 November 1885 at Matfen Hall, Matfen, and was succeeded by his son Edward. *Sir Edward William Blackett, 7th Baronet CB (22 March 1831 – 13 September 1909). Blackett was the son of Sir Edward Blackett, 6th Baronet. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1885. He was educated at Eton College and served in the Rifle Brigade in the Crimean War and was seriously injured at the Sebastopol Redan. He was promoted to Colonel in 1878, in which year he was Aide de Camp to HM Queen Victoria and was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath. He was also High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1889. Blackett married Julia Frances Somerville, daughter and co-heiress of Kenelm Somerville, 17th Lord Somerville. He was succeeded by his son Hugh. *Sir Hugh Douglas Blackett, 8th Baronet (24 March 1873 – 13 November 1960). Blackett was the eldest son of Colonel Sir Edward Blackett, 7th Baronet, by his wife the Hon. Julia (née Somerville). He was a Captain in the Northumberland Yeomanry and served as High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1914. He was also a Justice of the Peace for the county. Blackett married Helen Katharine, daughter of George William Lowther, in 1903, by whom he had several children. Lady Blackett died in January 1943. Blackett survived her by seventeen years and died in November 1960, aged 87.

Background Royal Orbit was a chestnut horse bred by film mogul Louis B. Mayer. He was sired by the imported British stallion Royal Charger out of Admiral's Belle, a daughter of the 1937 U.S. Triple Crown winner, War Admiral. Royal Orbit was purchased at the July Keeneland Sales by businessman Jacques Braunstein and raced by his widow, Halina Gregory Braunstein. He was trained by Reggie Cornell. Racing career Royal Orbit was a top two-year-old colt racing in California, notably winning the 1958 Los Feliz Stakes and finishing second to Tomy Lee in the Del Mar Futurity. The following year he was second to the Hall of Fame filly Silver Spoon in the Santa Anita Derby. In his only out-of-the-money finish in twenty career races, Royal Orbit ran fourth to winner Tomy Lee in the 1959 Kentucky Derby under jockey William Harmatz. However, Royal Orbit and Harmatz came back to win the 85th running of the Preakness Stakes and in the Belmont Stakes, the final leg of the Triple Crown series, he finished third to winner Sword Dancer. Stud record Retired at the end of the 1959 racing season, Royal Orbit stood in Kentucky and at the Maryland branch of E.P. Taylor's Windfields Farm. His offspring would meet with modest success, the best of which was multiple stakes winner, Quicken Tree. In 1971 he was sent to a breeding farm in Ireland. Two years later he was shipped to Argentina where he spent a year before going to Brazil in 1975.

In the Royal Navy he rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Commander. After his retirement he became a commentator for BBC Radio. He was one of its main commentators during the 1930s, covering amongst many other events the opening ceremony of the 1936 Summer Olympics and Neville Chamberlain's return from Munich in 1938. He is best remembered though for two gaffes. In 1937 he was to describe the Spithead Review from his old ship the battleship . Apparently he met some of his former colleagues before the broadcast and drank to the extent that his broadcast, still known today by his repeated phrase \\"the fleet's lit up\\", was so incoherent he was taken off air after a few minutes and suspended for a week by BBC Director-General Sir John Reith. At one point he told listeners “I’m sorry, I was telling some people to shut up talking.” http://uffish.net/archives/000327.html The BBC later explained that he was “tired and emotional”. Woodroofe's comically rambling commentary has regularly been rebroadcast. The phrase \\"lit up\\" can also be a euphemism for drunkenness, which may explain Woodrooffe's comment, \\"At the present moment, the whole fleet is lit up. When I say 'lit up', I mean lit up by fairy lamps.\\". Parts of Woodrooffe's commentary were used by the British rock band Public Service Broadcasting in their track Lit Up. Woodrooffe continued to work for the BBC though and in 1938 he was the main commentator at the FA Cup Final between Preston North End and Huddersfield Town, the first to be televised. After 29 minutes of extra time it was still 0-0 and Woodrooffe declared: \\"If there's a goal scored now, I'll eat my hat.\\" Seconds later Preston was awarded a penalty from which George Mutch scored. Woodrooffe kept his promise, appearing on the BBC programme Picture Page the following week and eating a hat shaped cake. Thomas Woodrooffe also wrote a number of books on naval history, including River of Golden Sand (1936), Best Stories of the Navy (1941) and Vantage at Sea: England's Emergence as An Oceanic Power (1958).

It is officially designated as a California Point of Historical Interest. Originally established in 1927 as a speakeasy, it converted into a successful restaurant after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. History The restaurant dates back to the Prohibition era when it was a speakeasy called Frank's Place. Owner Frank Torres built the club in 1927. Reportedly, illegal whisky was brought from ships, to the beach, and into vehicles for transport to San Francisco during Prohibition. A variety of people came to Frank's including the governor of California to Hollywood celebrities, such as actor Fatty Arbuckle. Haunting According to the restaurant's employees and guests, the \\"Blue Lady,\\" a female apparition dressed in blue, is reportedly seen in and around the restaurant. However, on a 2009 episode of paranormal TV series Ghost Hunters. When the TAPS team was asked to come in and investigate, they found an elaborate system of devices meant to scare people, which the staff calls \\"haunted effects\\". The Blue Lady was a woman who frequented the bar who always came dressed in blue. She was known as the \\"Blue Lady\\". The story goes that the lady was married and was having an affair with Torres' piano player named Charlie. One night, her estranged husband came in looking for her and caught them at the bar. he caused a scene and was tossed out by the bouncers. Later, that night, the lovers took a stroll down on the beach when a man, believed to be the husband ambushed them and stabbed his wife in the back. The next morning, she was found dead and her lover unconscious.

They are tree-dwelling, very small mice, mostly found in tropical rainforest.

They are generally gray or brown on the back and white underneath. The tail is only sparsely covered with hair, but has somewhat more at the end, giving the appearance of a pencil, thus the genus name. Chiropodomys gliroides is particularly common in bamboo forest. It is active at night, sleeps during the day in a nest in the bamboo, padded with leaves. It eats exclusively plants. A close connection between Chiropodomys and the genus Hapalomys (marmoset rats) is accepted. The Haeromys (pygmy tree mice) are also thought to be closely related. On the other hand, an earlier-posited connection with Crateromys (cloudrunners) is no longer considered probable. References * Ronald M. Nowak: Walker's Mammals of the World.

He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1968 for his work in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Cassin was born in Bayonne, France, to a French-Jewish merchant. He forged his career in law as a practitioner, professor, scholar, administrator, and promoter of human rights. Cassin occupied high posts in the judicial systems of France and Europe. Haim Cohn (1911 - 2002) Justice Haim Cohen“The distortion of justice, even if for a good cause, is a deep and contagious disease, which can consume every worthy part of the legal system.” Haim Cohn was born in Lübeck, Germany in 1911. He emigrated to Palestine in 1933 due to the rise of Nazism in Germany. After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, he was appointed as manager of the legislation department of the Ministry of Justice and later became State Attorney. In 1949, he was made CEO of the Ministry of Justice and Attorney General of Israel a year later. In 1952, he was chosen as the Minister of Justice, and in 1960, he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Israel. In addition to his civil service, he served as a representative of Israel in the United Nations Human Rights Council and as a member of the International Court of Justice in the Hague. Arthur Joseph Goldberg (1908 – 1990) “Law not served by power is an illusion, but power not ruled by law is a menace which our nuclear age cannot afford.” Arthur Goldberg was born in 1908 to Russian-Jewish parents on Chicago’s west side and was the youngest of 11 children. Goldberg graduated from Northwestern University School of Law in 1930. He later became a prominent labor attorney. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Goldberg as Secretary of Labor and successfully nominated him to the Supreme Court one year later. In 1965, Goldberg resigned from the bench to accept an appointment by President Lyndon B. Johnson to become the Ambassador to the United Nations. In that role, he helped draft UN Security Council Resolution 242* (1967) in the aftermath of the Six-Day War. *UN Security Council Resolution 242 has been the pivotal point of reference in all Arab-Israeli diplomacy since 1967. It established the basis of Israel’s legal right to defensible borders.

Hamilton Tiger-Cats defeated Winnipeg Blue Bombers 12-6 at Toronto's Varsity Stadium in a game which ended on a controversial pass incompletion. Pre-game background Winnipeg coach George Trafton prepared for the championship game amid rumours that he would return to coaching in the National Football League. Trafton was coaching for the Los Angeles Rams until he left for Winnipeg in 1951. The Grey Cup Parade on the morning of the game day featured 12 Miss Grey Cup contestants, 15 bands, 40 floats and 150,000 spectators. Game summary The ceremonial game kickoff was made by Lester B. Pearson who was national minister of External Affairs at that time, assisted by Miss Grey Cup, Joanne Baird of Regina, Saskatchewan. Hamilton had the only score of the first half, a short touchdown run by Ed Songin at 10:28, converted by Tip Logan, to cap a 53-yard drive in the first quarter. In the second quarter the Bombers' quarterback \\"Indian\\" Jack Jacobs engineered a 6 play, 92 yard drive which was snuffed out deep in Hamilton's end when Vito Ragazzo intercepted. One fan death was reported before half time, that of Timmins resident Roderick Osborne who collapsed in the stadium seating area. In the third quarter another Bomber drive faltered at the Hamilton 28 when Dick Brown intercepted a Jack Jacobs pass. Again the Bombers drove within scoring range but a field goal attempt by Bud Korchak produced no points. Finally the Bombers were able to capitalize on a 50-yard drive with a Gerry James run from the one yard line who touched down at 10:56, converted by Korchak. But the Ticats roared back. On the first play after the kickoff Lou Kusserow passed to Ralph Toohy for 21 yards. The Ticats lost a yard on the first down play, but on second down Songin made a short pass to Ragazzo. Bomber defender Geoff Crain went for the interception but missed, and Ragazzo had an open field for a 45-yard pass and run touchdown at 12:16, with Logan again providing the conversion point. With the score 12-6 and time running out in the fourth quarter, Jacobs put together yet another long drive of 98 yards to the Hamilton two-yard line. On the final play of the game he passed to an apparently wide-open Tom Casey, standing on the goal line. But as the ball reached his hands Hamiton's Kusserow hit Casey and he dropped the ball. Winnipeg fans claimed pass interference and Hamilton fans called it a very well timed tackle. Even examination of the game films has not succeeded in resolving the dispute. However, the officials called no penalty and Hamilton won the game.

He ruled the Budzhak Horde in what is now the southwestern corner of Ukraine (Budjak)along the Romanian border. Budjak is the southwesternmost corner of the Eurasian Steppe. He raided mostly along the eastern frontier of the Polish Commonwealth. Nominally a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, the Turks used him to pressure the Poles just as the Poles used the Zaporozhian Cossacks to pressure the Turks and Crimeans. His habit of acting independently caused problems. The Turks several times tried to move him east from Poland and eventually executed him. The most important event in his life was his conflict with the Crimean khan in 1628. Family He was the first and greatest leader of the Bujak Horde which seems to have formed up about the time he came to power. A connection to the Cantemirești of Moldavia is likely, but cannot be established exactly. He was associated with the Mansur clan which held the northwestern steppe-like corner of Crimea and had connections with the steppe nomads. He is sometimes described as a Crimean Tatar, but this is not accurate. He traced his ancestry to Edigu (died 1491) and his son Mansur who was executed by Barak Khan in 1427. His grandfather was Divey-Mirza who was captured at the Battle of Molodi and died in Russian captivity around 1575. His father was Araslanay-Mirza who married a daughter of khan Devlet I and died fighting for khan Gazi II in Hungary around 1595. He had several sons who were killed during his lifetime. Life Before Mehmed His early life and rise to power need more documentation. In 1606 he led 10,000 men to raid Podolia and was defeated by Crown hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski at the Battle of Udycz. In 1610 Janibek became Crimean khan and Shahin Giray fled to Khan Temir. Shahin was a successful raider until the Turks forced him out in 1614. The Russian Wikipedia (:ru:Кантемир-мурза) citing Novoselsky says that in 1610 he led 10,000 men to the Russian border where he took many captives and robbed the Russian envoys. This does not fit Gaivoronsky's account. In June 1612 he led a Turko-Tatar army to Moldavia where he captured Constantin Movilă. The period 1612-1617 needs more documentation. In 1617 the sultan sent an army north to force the Poles to limit Cossack raids. Instead of fighting they made the Treaty of Busza in which they agreed to halt raids by their Cossack and Tatar vassals. The freebooters ignored the treaty. Next year Khan-Temir and his sons raided Galicia, Cossacks raided the Turkish coast and in response the sultan sent Crimeans and Khan-Temir to raid Volhynia (Battle of Orynin (1618)). In 1620 the ruler of Moldavia switched from the Turks to the Poles, leading to the Polish-Ottoman War (1620-21). The Poles were defeated at the Battle of Cecora (1620). Stanisław Żółkiewski offered to retreat if he could hold Khan Temir hostage until he reached the Polish border. Khan Temir refused. He retreated anyway, his army was chewed up by Khan Temir’s men and Zolkiewski was killed. The Budjaks then raided the surrounding country. Next spring they raided Galicia. In 1621 the sultan led a large army north supported by Khan Temir and Crimean khan Janibek. The resulting Battle of Khotyn (1621) was a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides. During and after the battle Khan Temir raided the countryside. For his services he was made governor the Silistra Eyalet along the Black Sea coast. (In July 1623 he was removed for unauthorized raiding.) During the negotiations for the Treaty of Khotyn around October 1621 the Poles asked that Khan Temir be moved away from their border, something that the Turks were not strong enough to do. Politicians like Mere Hüseyin Pasha wanted Khan Temir out of the way. Under Mehmed III In 1623 Mehmed III Giray became Crimean khan. His first task was to move Khan Temir from the Polish border to stop his private raiding after the Turko-Polish peace. This is not in Gaivoronsky, but the Russian Wikipedia says that in June 1623, one month after Mehmed came to power, he led a raid deep into Galicia. Gaivoronsky notes that he was removed from his position in Silistra one month later. He led the Crimean army west and somehow talked Khan Temir into moving east to the Syut-Su river (location?The Russian Wikipedia has Molochna River, which may be the same place.). In 1624, when the Turks tried to remove Mehmed, he moved back to Budjak. In 1624 he led a raid into Polish territory and was defeated by Stanisław Koniecpolski. In 1624 or 1625 Shahin Giray lead a Crimean army east to bring him under control. Temir’s nobles convinced him that their position was untenable, so the Budjak Horde moved back east for the second time, after burning everything they could not carry. Starting in January 1626 a Crimean-Budjak army plundered some 200 villages in Volhynia and Galicia and withdrew before Koniecpolski and Stefan Chmielecki could bring up troops. Later, Khan Temir raided Podolia. In early 1627 khan Mehmed led 10000 Crimeans and Budjaks east to deal with some Besleney who had stopped paying tribute. Shahin Giray and Khan Temir stayed in Crimea. In the mountains Mehmed met his Circassian father-in-law. As he left some Budjak mirzas slipped away and murdered Mehmed’s father-in-law who in 1622 had killed Khan Temir’s uncle. Mehmed assumed that this could not have happened without Khan Temir’s consent, so he sent a messenger to Shahin ordering him to be arrested. Khan Temir learned of it and fled to the steppes. Shahin rounded up Temir’s relatives and threatened to kill them if Temir did not return. He refused and the threat was carried out. Mehmed and Shahin had now made a dangerous enemy. Khan Temir offered his services to the Turks. In 1628 the Turks again tried to remove Mehmed, now with Khan Temir’s help. In spring Shahin made a preemptive attack of Khan Temir. Khan Temir fell back to the Danube delta, lured Shahin’s army into the woods and killed most of them, only Shahin and a few friends escaping. In early May Shahin reached Crimea, followed by Khan Temir. Shahin and Mehmed fled to the ancient rock-fort of Chufut-Kale, which Khan Temir besieged. Four weeks later 4000 Zaporozhian Cossacks under Mykhailo Doroshenko burst into the peninsula. At first Khan Temir thought that they were merely raiding, but he was quickly disabused. On 31 may he was defeated by the Cossacks on the Alma River. Khan Temir fled to Kaffa. Since he had an order from the sultan telling Ottoman officials to help him, the gates of Kaffa were opened. The place soon filled with Budjak warriors, their families, yurts, carts and cattle. Mehmed besieged Kaffa. Khan Temir attacked, was defeated and barely got back through the gates. His son was captured and executed. Crimean forces rounded up the Budjak warriors who had not reached Kaffa. Turkish galleys landed at Kaffa, Mehmed was deserted by his men (30 June) and fled to the Cossacks. After Mehmed With Mehmed gone, Canibek Giray (Janibek) became khan for the second time (1628) with Khan Temir as a supporter. In late 1628 Mehmed tried to restore himself but was abandoned by his Cossack allies while Khan Temir guarded the entrance to Crimea at Perekop. In 1629 Mehmed tried again, and was defeated and killed by Khan Temir’s men. In 1628 Khan Temir attacked the leaders of the Shirin clan. This caused so much hostility that he thought it best to return to Budjak. Janibek was glad to see him go. In the fall of 1629 kalga Devlet Giray and Khan Temir attacked Galicia in revenge for Polish support of Mehmed. They were defeated by Stefan Chmielecki and lost half their men. The period 1629-1633 needs more documentation. The Russian Wikipedia, following Novoselsky (1948) has Khan Temir and kalga Devlet and 20,000 men raid Podolia in August 1629. In October the Poles defeated their main force, freed 10,000 captives and killed one of Temir's sons and captured another. In 1633 the Polish-Ottoman War (1633-34) broke out. In June about 1000 Budjaks raided Podolia and returned to Moldavia with their loot where Koniecpolski defeated them and Khan Temir’s son-in-law was captured. In September the Turkish commander marched north with much of the Budjak horde under Khan Temir. In October there was a battle which the Poles won. In 1634 the Russo-Polish Smolensk War ended, which freed up Polish troops. The sultan had never been happy with this war which was mostly started by a local governor. Peace was made and the Turks promised to remove the Budjak horde. In the summer of 1634 khan Janibek assembled an army on the Dnieper to get this done, but the sultan changed his mind and ordered Janibek to attack Persia. In 1635 khan Janibek was replaced by Inayet. In 1636 he was ordered to attack Persia. Since he could not make his nobles obey he expected that the Turks would remove him. He assumed that Khan Temir would attack from the north and the Turks would come by sea to Kaffa. He boldly determined to resist. He took Kaffa by surprise and in January 1637 led a large army against Budjak. Khan Temir was greatly outnumbered, so he told his men to make the best deal they could and fled south to Turkish Kiliya where he stored his treasures and then on to Istanbul. Inayet sent his brother south to retrieve the treasure and then led the Budjaks east for a third time. At the Dnieper crossing they revolted, killed Inayet’s brothers and returned to Budjak. In June 1637 a Turkish fleet arrived in Kaffa and Inayet decided to give up and go to Istanbul. On 1 July 1637 both Inayet and Khan Temir appeared before the sultan. Inayet was taken away and strangled. Khan Temir was exiled to a governorship in Anatolia. Khan Temir was accompanied to Istanbul by his youngest son. The young man killed a man in a drunken brawl. The Turks beheaded him and sent his headless corpse to Khan Temir. The father could not resist strong language, so the Turks sent men to his house and strangled him (10 July 1637).

Causes M5 is associated with characteristic chromosomal abnormalities, often involving chromosome 11, such as t(9;11), affecting the MLL (KMTA2) locus at 11q23; however MLL translocations are also found in other leukemia subtypes. The t(8;16) translocation in AMoL is associated with hemophagocytosis. Secondary leukaemia, which may include AML-M5, has been associated with exposure to epipodophyllotoxins, such as etoposide. Diagnosis In order to fulfill World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for AML-5, a patient must have greater than 20% blasts in the bone marrow, and of these, greater than 80% must be of the monocytic lineage. A further subclassification (M5a versus M5b) is made depending on whether the monocytic cells are predominantly monoblasts (>80%) (acute monoblastic leukemia) or a mixture of monoblasts and promonocytes (<80% blasts). Monoblasts can be distinguished by having a roughly circular nucleus, delicate lacy chromatin, and abundant, often basophilic cytoplasm. These cells may also have pseudopods. By contrast, promonocytes have a more convoluted nucleus, and their cytoplasm may contain metachromatic granules. Monoblasts are typically MPO-negative and promonocytes are MPO variable. Both monoblasts and promonocytes stain positive for non-specific esterase (NSE), however NSE may often be negative. Immunophenotypically, M5-AML variably express myeloid (CD13, CD33) and monocytic (CD11b, CD11c) markers. Cells may aberrantly express B-cell marker CD20 and the NK marker CD56. Monoblasts may be positive for CD34. Treatment AML-M5 is treated with intensive chemotherapy (such as anthracyclines) or with bone marrow transplantation.

Scrapers are popular in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California, usually associated with the hyphy music and lifestyle movement. An example of hyphy is shown in the E-40 lyrics \\"sittin' in my scraper watching Oakland gone wild\\". A scraper is a general description and can refer to a number of different model cars. Popular models include the Buick Regal and LeSabre, Pontiac Bonneville, Buick Century, Oldsmobile Delta 88, Buick Riviera, Buick Reatta, Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, Pontiac Grand Prix, Lexus SC, Chevrolet Caprice Classic, and Chevrolet Impalas, as well as full size conversion vans such as the GMC Vandura. Supercharged automobiles are particularly sought after due to their high performance. Similar to donks from the South, the cars are highly customized, with large custom rims, custom paint (two-tone is popular as of 2008) and custom interior to match the paint, loud audio (called slaps) and televisions. What makes Scrapers different from Donks is that Donks are typically fifth generation Chevrolet Impalas and Caprices, fourth generation Cadillac Coupe de Villes and third generation Monte Carlos. Donks are usually V8 engine, rear wheeled drive, full sized General Motors sedans and coupes of the 1970s and 1980s. Scrapers on the other hand, are typically late-1980s and 1990s midsized, front wheel drive, six cylinder General Motors sedans. The trend of customizing these cars were made popular by African American youth. Scraper cars have also inspired the scraper bike movement.

This notion is fundamental in Knowledge building theory. If knowledge is not realized for a community then we do not have knowledge building. Examples of KBCs are * Classrooms * Academic research teams * Modern management companies * Modern business R&D; groups * Wikipedia (Wikimedia Foundation and its volunteer editors) Theoretical background Knowledge Building is a theory developed by Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia that deals with the construction of knowledge. To build knowledge, learners should collaborate with one another and establish common goals, hold group discussions, and synthesize ideas in such a way that their knowledge of a topic advances from their current understanding. Knowledge building is outwardly focused on generating contributions that learners can give back to the community. Thus, the product of knowledge building should be an “artifact”—such as a publication, an illustrated model, or a theory—which other learners can then use to advance their own understanding of that subject. Among the most widely cited models characterizing the processes of collaborative knowledge building are those of Garrison, Anderson & Archer (2001) ;Garrison, D. R., Anderson, T., & Archer, W. (2001). Critical thinking, cognitive presence, and computer conferencing in distance education. American Journal of Distance Education, 15(1).

Principles A school culture that fosters KBCs supports research, innovation, and high expectations for student achievement and participation. The twelve KB principles are continuously emphasized for and by teachers, students, and the school environment as a whole. 12 Knowledge Building Principles (Adapted from Scardamalia, 2002)Scardamalia, M. (2002). Collective cognitive responsibility for the advancement of knowledge. Liberal education in a knowledge society, 67-98. *Real Ideas and Authentic Problems – students identify real problems to study *Improvable Ideas – ideas are improvable rather than accepted or rejected *Epistemic Agency – students plan and engage in the process *Collective Responsibility for Community Knowledge – all participants contribute to community goals *Democratizing Knowledge – all participants are empowered; no knowledge have/have-not lines *Idea Diversity – knowledge advancement depends on diversity of ideas, just as an ecosystem depends on biodiversity *KB Discourse – problems progressively identified and addressed and new conceptualizations built *Rise Above – by transcending trivialities and oversimplifications, students work towards more inclusive principles and higher level formulations of problems *Constructive Use of Authoritative Sources – critically evaluate authoritative sources, don't just find “the answer” *Pervasive KB – KB is a continuous process and can happen anywhere; it is not unique to the classroom *Symmetric Knowledge Advance – “to give knowledge is to get knowledge”; there is no one expert *Embedded and Transformative Assessment – integral to KB and helps to advance knowledge through identifying advances, problems, and gaps as work proceeds Use in classrooms The key focus for KBCs has been research on fostering KBCs in classrooms. Transforming a classroom into a KBC requires a significant shift in classroom norms and also in student and teacher identities. In this context, students define themselves through their personal learning goals and collaboratively pursue them. Students are viewed as intentional learners, working at the edge of each competence. Knowledge advances are not circumscribed by a teacher’s knowledge. Specific to a KBC is the objectification of knowledge artifacts. More precisely, if in a regular class, questions, ideas and discussions are personal and ethereal constructs, in a KBC classroom, they are public artifacts that have a permanent presence in a digital format, usually in the classroom database. For this reason, they can be analyzed, pointed at, talked about, and progressively refined over time. In order to be successful, the members of the knowledge building community should accomplish the following: *Focus work on making advances to what the community already knows *Embrace a general philosophy of inclusion *Share openly what they do not understand, \\"What I need to understand...\\" or \\"What I need to know...\\" *Respect each other's perspectives and tentative understandings *Express disagreement in a constructive fashion Successful knowledge building initiatives at an elementary school “demonstrated sustained advancement of knowledge building as a principle-based, school-wide innovation.”Zhang, J., Hong, H., Scardamalia, M., Teo, C., & Morley, E. A. (2011) Sustaining Knowledge Building as a Principle-Based Innovation at an Elementary School, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 20(2), 262-307. Rather than focusing on a particular procedure or pedagogical approach to KBC, this study emphasized using a principle-based approach. This approach “defines core values and principles, leaving teachers the challenge of engaging in reflective interpretation, using discretionary judgment, and making adaptive classroom decisions to accommodate their different contexts and possibilities.”Zhang, J., Hong, H., Scardamalia, M., Teo, C., & Morley, E. A. (2011) Sustaining Knowledge Building as a Principle-Based Innovation at an Elementary School, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 20(2), 262-307. The KBC model immerses students in collaborative efforts to extend knowledge of the classroom community rather than just individual learning. Students take ownership of their learning and knowledge building by completing the tasks of goal setting, long-term planning, and impromptu process control, rather than following predetermined scripts for learning set by the teacher. Understanding, integrating, and sharing information are all vital components of sustained KBC models.Zhang, J., & Sun, Y. (2011). Reading for idea advancement in a grade 4 Knowledge Building community. Instructional Science, 39(4), 429-452. Because learners at the post-secondary level are more cognitively mature than younger students, researchers have observed many successful implementations of KBCs in higher education. Stefano Cacciamani published a study in 2010 that explored how an instructor could make the shift from knowledge transition to knowledge construction. In the study, students enrolled in an online course initially modeled after a guided inquiry format, in which the teacher played a significant role in setting students' goals and monitoring their progress. This format eventually shifted to a self-organized inquiry model focused on knowledge construction, where students were expected to replace the teacher in setting class goals and monitoring their own progress. This fundamental change entailed the instructor’s concession of increasing responsibility to students. The study’s results indicate that students in the self-organized course engaged in critical thinking and displayed a greater effort to go beyond the given information than students in the guided inquiry course. To that effect, the authors concluded \\"...there is a suggestion in the early pilot work reported, that the self-organized inquiry approach favours a shift towards a knowledge construction perspective more so than the guided inquiry approach.\\"Cacciamani, S. (2010). Towards a knowledge building community: from guided to self-organized inquiry. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology/La revue canadienne de l’apprentissage et de la technologie, 36(1). Participants in a 2012 study by Philip used Knowledge Forum, an online environment designed to support knowledge building, to read, post, and respond to notes over the course of one semester.Philip, D. (2012). Pilgrims' Progress: The Journey towards a Knowledge Building Community in a University Undergraduate Class. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology, 38(1), n1. The author identified several likely indicators of the presence of a KBC, including: *A high level of overall activity (at least 50% of students read 60 or more postings) *Universal participation (online participation comprised 40% of the students’ final grades) *The presence of reciprocal strong ties among students that indicate the potential for the transfer of complex information and “collective responsibility for the development of the community” Limitations Despite some promising results, efforts to implement KBCs in classrooms have also seen unintended consequences. Disparities in participation and maladaptive strategies aimed at reducing individual workload can lessen the effectiveness of KBCs for the community as a whole. Student relationships have a significant effect on participation patterns, and individual feelings of autonomy, relatedness, and intrinsic motivation all influence behaviors in KBCs.Xie, K., & Ke, F. (2011). The role of students' motivation in peer‐moderated asynchronous online discussions. British Journal of Educational Technology,42(6), 916-930. Diversity among peers, response lags, and deadlines can be negative influences on collaboration causing stress, frustration, and difficulties in negotiating meaning and consensus.Robertson, O. A. (2007). Students' perceptions of online asynchronous discussion and group learning in graduate distance education courses, 1-185. Without effective guidance from teachers, students tend to focus on individualistic contributions related to their areas of personal interest rather than developing a shared understanding or pursuing a common line of inquiry.Robertson, O. A. (2007). Students' perceptions of online asynchronous discussion and group learning in graduate distance education courses, 1-185. The collaborative technology itself could also be problematic. The tool of choice may be difficult to use and thus pose a slow learning curve for collaborators. In a review of fifty studies, Hew, Cheung, & Ng (2010) identified a series of \\"design quirks\\" common to these tools that frustrate students, such as the inaccessibility of other posts and features while in composition mode and the inability to edit and delete messages after posting.Hew, K. F., Cheung, W. S., & Ng, C. S. L. (2010). Student contribution in asynchronous online discussion: A review of the research and empirical exploration. Instructional Science, 38(6), 571-606. Unforeseen glitches in the technology can also add strain to the collaborative process. Computer support Scardamalia, Bereiter, and their team at the Center for Applied Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto developed a networked software system called Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments, or CSILE, in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the system was re-engineered and released for commercial use as Knowledge Forum™. This software provides support for cognitive processes involved in knowledge building, making these visible to both the instructors and the students. Discussions, comments, knowledge artifacts, and knowledge advances are all visible and improvable within Knowledge Forum. The software also includes tools that can be used for formative (self-)assessment of the quantity of activity of students and the connections between them. Knowledge Forum has been used as a tool to support knowledge building communities in K-12Zhang, J., Hong, H., Scardamalia, M., Teo, C., & Morley, E. A.

With the rapid growth of social networking software, a wide range of Web 2.0 tools with the capability to support community knowledge building have become available. Blogs, micro-blogs, wikis, and virtual worlds are just some of the Web 2.0 tools that have been implemented in K-12, higher education, and corporate settings. Likewise, learning management systems commonly contain tools for discussion that have been used as the platform for KBCs, though the alignment of these tools with the requirements of community knowledge building has been questioned.Onrubia, J., & Engel, A.

These tools allow \\"evolving documents\\" to be refined repeatedly by multiple collaborators, and come equipped with built-in chat functionality, commenting, and reviewing tools for facilitating knowledge construction through suggestion-making.Heimbuch, S., Uhde, K., & Bodemer, D.

Early life Correia was born in Lisbon in February 1949, and raised in Mafra, her mother's home town. Her father was an anti-fascist who was arrested before her birth by the Salazar regime. At the University of Lisbon, she studied Romance Philology. During these years, she began publishing poetry in literary supplements of the time, such as the Juvenil do Diário de Lisboa under the aegis of Mário Castrim. Career After a period working as a high school teacher, Hélia Correia undertook postgraduate studies in Classical Theatre. Her literary career started in earnest in the 1981 with the publication of her debut work titled O Separar das Águas. She quickly achieved great commercial success and critical renown, with critics lauding her innovative writing which remained linked to the best literary traditions. They saw influences of Camilo Castelo Branco and Emily Brontë, as well as connections to ancient Greek drama. Several of her novels, including O Número dos Vivos (1982) and Montedemo (1983), could be considered works of magical realism. Correia accepted this saying she could not ignore the importance of South American magical realism. Some critics have noted that her earlier works were influenced by French Feminist thought. Maria Teresa Horta has described Correia's works as \\"visceral\\" and \\"primordial\\". From the 1990s, she began to create theatrical works. She reinterpreted ancient Greek myths from the view point of female heroines, such as Antigone in Perdition, Helen of Troy in Hatred, and Medea in Boundless.

She was educated at Overstone Girls' School in Northampton and joined the WAAF in 1939. In 1946 Peter Ustinov hired her as technical assistant on his film School for Secrets. She became his personal assistant for the next eight years. In 1960 she co-wrote the screenplay for the film School for Scoundrels starring Ian Carmichael, Terry-Thomas, and Alastair Sim. During her next job as an Assistant Editor for London Vogue, Moyes also translated Jean Anouilh’s 1940 play Léocadia as Time Remembered. In London (1955), the major roles were taken by Paul Scofield, Margaret Rutherford, and Mary Ure. The 1957 Broadway production – starring Richard Burton, Helen Hayes, and Susan Strasberg — received several Tony awards. The success of Time Remembered enabled Moyes to leave Vogue and start writing mysteries. Personal life She married photographer John Moyes in 1951; they divorced in 1959. She later married James Haszard, a linguist at the International Monetary Fund in The Hague. Death She died at her home on the island of Virgin Gorda (British Virgin Islands) on 2 August 2000, aged 77, from undisclosed causes.

It was partly excavated by the American archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. Achilleion is a large site that is practically untouched by archaeologists which Gimbutas claims to be filled entirely with Neolithic debris and hundreds of Neolithic mounds. An excavation was planned because the dig was expected to have a high yield of artifacts and if successful would possibly provide proof of an earlier age of European Neolithic settlement then was previously known. Excavation was started because it was expected that they would find significant numbers of preceramic Neolithic remains. The work started by Marija Gimbutas was stopped because the dig failed to yield any significant findings, but Gimbutas claims that the dig was interrupted by the political unrest caused by the Cyprus conflict. Achilleion is located in modern-day Greece, in an area now known as Thessaly. Thessaly lies in northern Greece, just south of Macedonia. Thessaly is best known as a vacation spot, but it was also believed to be filled with artifacts that could give scientists important clues to past civilizations. Excavation The excavation was funded by UCLA in 1973 and 1974 during the months of August and September. The dig was also supported by the National Science Foundation and the Samuel H. Kress foundation. The dig team consisted of Marija Gimbutas leading the excavation along with 40 other students and scholars. While the excavation was still in progress, there were four test pits dug each about 5 meters deep. Some useful things were recovered from the site; samples of preserved fauna, pottery, and 3 houses were discovered. Unfortunately, Gimbutas overlooked important details when reporting on her excavation, “No geologic, geomorphologic, sedimentologic, or pedologic study was carried out- a serious failing” (McPherron).

The campus spans approximately one mile (1.6 km) of the north side of the Charles River basin directly opposite the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. The campus includes dozens of buildings representing diverse architectural styles and shifting campus priorities over MIT's history. MIT's architectural history can be broadly split into four eras: the Boston campus, the new Cambridge campus before World War II, the \\"Cold War\\" development, and post-Cold War buildings. Each era was marked by distinct builds representing neoclassical, modernist, brutalist, and deconstructivist styles which alternatively represent a commitment to utilitarian minimalism and embellished exuberance. Campus organization The geographical organization of the MIT campus is much easier to understand by referring to the MIT map, in online interactive, or downloadable printable form. There is also an MIT Accessibility Campus Map available for download, which is useful for mobility-impaired visitors. Buildings 1–10 (excepting 9) were the original main campus, with Building 10, the location of the Great Dome, designed to be the ceremonial main entrance. The actual street entrance leads from 77 Massachusetts Avenue into the lobby of Building 7, at the western end of the \\"Infinite Corridor\\", which forms the east-west axis of the main group of buildings. Buildings 1–8 are arranged symmetrically around Building 10, with odd-numbered buildings to the west and even-numbered buildings to the east. In general, higher numbers are assigned to buildings as distance from the center of campus increases. The east side of main campus has \\"the 6s\\", several connecting buildings that end with the digit 6 (buildings 6, 16, 26, 36, 56 and 66, with building 46 across the street from 36). The \\"30s\\" series buildings run along Vassar Street on the north side of main campus. Buildings that are East of Ames Street are prefixed with an E (e.g. E52, the Sloan Building); those West of Massachusetts Avenue generally start with a W (e.g., W20, the Stratton Student Center). Buildings North of the Grand Junction Railroad tracks paralleling Vassar Street are prefixed with N, while those northerly structures that are also West of Massachusetts Avenue are designated with NW. Two buildings at the far west end of campus are designated \\"WW15\\" and \\"WW25\\". The prefix NE is used for buildings north of Main Street, even for structures actually located due north of other buildings designated with N. Buildings that are far from the main campus are prefixed OC, for off campus. There are no buildings prefixed with S, since the campus is bordered at its southern edge by the Charles River. To identify a particular room within a building, the room number is simply appended to the building number, using a \\"-\\" (e.g. Room 26–100, a large first-floor auditorium in Building 26). The floor number is indicated in the usual way, by the leading digit(s) of the room number, with a leading digit 0 indicating a basement location and 00 for sub-basement. The practice of identifying buildings by number is a long- standing tradition at MIT. Although sometimes ridiculed as evidence of an \\"engineering mindset\\", and referred to as \\"a system that disorients outsiders\\", this system is somewhat logical, and allows members of the MIT community to quickly locate a room they may never have seen before. This numbering system contrasts with the building identification at other nearby colleges. For example, at Harvard University, knowing the location of \\"Maxwell-Dworkin\\" will not help in locating \\"Claverson\\" or \\"Larsen\\"—no matter how many years of experience one may have, one either knows these locations or has no idea where they may be. Under the MIT numbering scheme, community members will know approximately where Building NW95 must be, even if they have never been near there. Most MIT buildings do have names, which can be found on many maps, or carved near the entrance, molded into a bronze plaque, or lettered onto a glass window. Many buildings are popularly known by name (e.g. \\"Kresge Auditorium\\"), even as individual rooms are identified by number (e.g. W16-100). Some locations have dual designations in common use (e.g. \\"Huntington Hall\\", also known as \\"10–250\\", which is an auditorium located on the second floor, under the Great Dome in Building 10). Building names can also be obtained from either the interactive online or downloadable MIT map. There are numerous minor refinements, tweaks, and exceptions in the room numbering and naming, providing plenty of material for a trivia contest, or for sussing out would-be impostors. The student-written MIT guide, How To Get Around MIT (HowToGAMIT) devotes almost 4 pages of small print to details of MIT geography. Boston Tech (1865–1910) The original Rogers Building, MIT's first home A 1905 map of MIT's Boston campus Boston's Back Bay neighborhood was recovered from filled-in marshland along the Charles River over several decades. The City of Boston reserved several lots for churches, museums, and other community buildings. A lot bounded on the north and south by Newbury and Boylston streets, and to the east and west by Berkeley and Clarendon streets, was awarded to the Boston Society of Natural History and to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. William G. Preston designed three buildings to occupy the site, although the original plan for an \\"MIT Museum\\" was never built. The Natural History Society building, completed in 1862, occupied the easternmost third, facing Berkeley Street. The MIT building, later called the Rogers Building, occupied the center and faced Boylston Street. The building was not opened until 1865 owing to delays because of the Civil War. The five-story Rogers building featured a \\"grand tetra-style Corinthian portico\\" modeled on the Duke of Wellington's remodeled Apsley House. MIT quickly outgrew this space as new schools, departments, and laboratories were founded. In 1886, the five-story (original) Walker Memorial building housing the Physics and Chemistry departments was built in the space to the west of the Rogers building. This original Walker Memorial building, designed by Carl Fehmer, consisted of a more subdued, industrial arcade motif compared to the surrounding fashionable buildings. As Jarzombek suggests, \\"the choice of this style, even for such a prominent urban space, was clearly MIT's and a testament to its desire to promote the ideals of scientific professionalism.\\" More annexes, given utilitarian names \\"Engineering Buildings A, B, and C\\" were designed in the same industrial manner, and built between 1889 and 1900 on a site south of the Trinity Church.One of MIT's engineering buildings became Grundmann Studios in 1893. cf. \\"Copley Hall, Proposed Temporary Walker Memorial.\\" The Tech (MIT), December 30, 1907 After MIT's move to Cambridge in 1916, the original Rogers and Walker buildings were eventually torn down in 1939 to make way for the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company building. Their sibling structure, the Natural History Society building, has survived to the present day by hosting a succession of retail stores after its original tenant moved to the current location of the Museum of Science Boston in 1951. The city block that originally contained the Engineering Annexes is now the site where the John Hancock Tower stands. Thus, very few physical traces from MIT when it was \\"Boston Tech\\" remain in place in their original locations. The names of Rogers and Walker were both re-applied to new MIT buildings (Building 7 and Building 50, respectively) erected across the Charles River in Cambridge, in 1939 and 1916, respectively. The New Technology (1910–1940) MIT Cambridge campus map from 1916 when it moved there from Boston Impetus By the turn of the century, demands for new space for laboratories, offices, housing, and student unions were outstripping the land available in the now-fashionable Back Bay neighborhood, where real estate prices had risen rapidly. Other institutes of technology in Chicago and Pittsburgh, state universities founded under the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, and private universities like Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, and Stanford were closing the gap on MIT's early lead on laboratory-based education, with large and modern laboratories placed amongst large, park-like campuses. MIT repeatedly resisted overtures from Harvard President Charles William Eliot to merge the schools, and after President Richard C. Maclaurin was elected in 1909, he began to search for sites to relocate the Institute. A site in Cambridge, recovered from the Charles River and set amongst dirty factories and tenement housing, was ultimately selected for the construction of a new campus. Thomas Coleman du Pont, a graduate of MIT's Chemistry department, donated $500,000 to be used towards the purchase of the land under a promise from President Maclaurin that the first building constructed would be for Chemistry. The site abutted Massachusetts Avenue (which crossed the river on the Harvard Bridge) along which were many newly built neo-classical structures like Langdell Hall, Christian Science Center Church, and Symphony Hall on the Boston side, with which MIT's new Cambridge campus would have to compete. In Maclaurin's words, \\"We have a glorious site and glorious opportunities, but our task of design is not made more easy by the great expectations of Boston\\". Initial proposals The Great Dome under construction in 1916. Early proposals for the campus came from Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge; Stephen Child; Constant-Désiré Despradelle; and John Ripley Freeman. Shepley's and Child's plans incorporated Georgian Revival styled, L-shaped, brick buildings set on symmetric grass avenues or quads, much like the recently completed Harvard Medical School, but were inappropriately sized for the industrial research that would occur within. Despradelle's Beaux-Arts proposal would have partitioned the campus into separate zones for academic, research, and residential activities, but its World's-Fair-like layout provided insufficient space for laboratories. His later iterations solved the laboratory space problems, but provided uncomfortable proximity and insufficient space for the residences as well as being enormously expensive. After Despradelle's sudden death in 1912, Freeman's \\"Study No. 7\\" was thrust to the fore. His proposal, based on Taylorism, was \\"one-fifth architecture and four-fifths a problem of industrial engineering.\\" He proposed connecting all departmental buildings to prevent the emergence of academic fiefdoms, to provide protection from bad weather, and to enable efficiencies of scale by building a massive, one million square-foot building incorporating the administrative, teaching, and research functions. The proposed five-story building resembled a large \\"E\\" with the base aligned to the river, with \\"cloistered\\" courtyards and a pedimented Doric exterior. Freeman also rejected using masonry walls, and proposed using reinforced concrete, a relatively new material that was then thought to be both expensive and unconventional. President Maclaurin and MIT's executive committee sought to hire an established architect, rather than an ambitious engineer, to design the campus and briefly retained Cass Gilbert before conflicts with a determined Freeman drove him off. Bosworth's design Under the advice of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Maclaurin chose Rockefeller's personal architect, MIT graduate William Welles Bosworth, to lead the next round of designs. In no small part, he was chosen because of his willingness to work for clients with strong personal convictions. Bosworth was trained in the Beaux-Arts style and was influenced by the City Beautiful movement which was at its height at the time.\\"Bosworth likely wrote that if any style \\"has the right to our allegiance, it is the Graeco-Roman, the origin of our early American tradition.\\" Bosworth's proposal retained many elements of the previous proposals: a large, multi-armed building with room for future expansion and a large central court, but also successfully integrated the dormitories into the rest of the complex. The campus would be oriented around two major east-west cross axes connecting the western academic half of campus with the residential eastern half of campus. Each half of campus would in turn be oriented around separate north-south axes, the western oriented its open green space towards the river and Boston while the eastern oriented its track and tennis courts northward into Cambridge. Bosworth's design was drawn so as to admit large amounts of light through exceptionally large windows on the first and second floors, many internal windows—not only on office doors but above door-level, and skylights over huge stairwells. However, later revisions began to incorporate more elements originally found in Freeman's designs such as double-loaded corridors and \\"open-grid, concrete structure with crossbeams supported by pairs of columns in the middle.\\" Not all of Bosworth's design was built. His plan for future expansion, which extended the neo-classical corridors in a grid fashion further north, was followed for Building 7 but not for later additions. Interior pedestrian circulation follows parts of the grid pattern, but thru access is not possible on all floors. North-south movement is possible through buildings 7, 9, 33, and 35; and 8, 26, and 36. East-west movement is possible through buildings 9, 13, 12, 16, and 56; and 35, 37, 39, 38, 34, 36, and 32. The construction of MIT.nano broke the previous north- south passage from building 4 to 12, 24, and 34. There are also semi-grid-like tunnels from building 14 north and east to buildings 18, 54, and 16/56. The exterior appearance of new buildings beyond 7 and 11 is completely different than the original set. The original plan included dormitory quads on either side of Walker Memorial, which explains why it was surrounded by empty land when it was first constructed. Only the East Campus dorm was built in this area, and as larger parallels rather than a quad. Academic buildings and tennis courts now occupy most of this land, and all newer dorms other than Eastgate were actually built or purchased west of Massachusetts Avenue. Maclaurin Buildings and Great Dome (1916) Killian Court, Building 10, and The Great Dome The Maclaurin Buildings comprise Buildings 3, 4, and 10, and form a large U-shaped structure enclosing the section of Killian Court farthest from the Charles River. This is the outdoors area where formal Commencement (graduation) ceremonies occur every June, and is the classic view of MIT featured in many publicity photos. The buildings were built in 1913 to 1916 and were designed in the Neoclassical style by William Welles Bosworth. They were named in honor of MIT president Richard C. Maclaurin, who was instrumental in organizing MIT's move from Boston to \\"The New Technology\\" campus in Cambridge. The facade of Building 10 is dominated by a colonnade of 10 monumental columns of the classic Ionic order. The Brass Rat, MIT's class ring, features the Building 10 facade on the shank of each ring, including a portrayal of the Great Dome. The Great Dome, which sits atop Building 10, is modeled on McKim, Mead, and White's Low Memorial Library at Columbia University, which is in turn an imitation of the Pantheon in Rome. The Dome was originally planned to be a cavernous assembly hall, but budget limitations threatened to prevent construction of the Dome altogether. A smaller library - now the Barker Engineering Library - and lecture hall (10–250) instead filled the space. Architectural historian Mark Jarzombek later described the library space as a \\"capacious oculus [admitting] light into its center, and its perimeter surrounded by a row of Corinthian columns. Four curved topped aedicules [add] a counter-punctual element. More baroque in flavor that what one normally might have expected from Bosworth, the building seems in fact to be an inside-out quotation from Christopher Wren's St. Paul's Cathedral.\\" Bosworth noted that the columns of the Pantheon's porch are not placed along a straight line, but bow out a bit toward the central axis. This is a classical optical illusion also used in the Parthenon of Athens to make the line of columns appear straight. Bosworth replicated this technique at MIT; to observe it, one has to lie down and sight along the front of the steps. Based on its psychological and numerical centrality to the main campus of the Institute, members of the MIT community sometimes humorously refer to the Great Dome as \\"The Center of the Universe\\". Killian Court (1916) Bosworth's plan was notable for rejecting the prevailing conventions of separated buildings and retreat from the urban area, as was found in other new American campuses. The Great Court, renamed Killian Court in 1974 after President James Rhyne Killian, faces the river and the Boston skyline. Killian Court was originally hard-paved, but was converted into a park-like area of grass and trees in the late 1920s. Today, Killian Court is the site of the annual Commencement ceremony. Walker Memorial (1916) Francis Amasa Walker Memorial Walker Memorial was dedicated to former MIT president (and general) Francis Amasa Walker, a staunch advocate for student life. The Memorial was to have been designed in a \\"relaxed classical style with a generous convex portico overlooking the Charles River\\". However, cost overruns forced the scale of many planned buildings to be altered. A gymnasium, which had previously been separate from the Memorial, was integrated into the top floor of the combined structure. Today, the gymnasium is used for dance and martial arts classes, informal basketball games, and for the administration of midterm and final exams for large classes. Morss Hall, the ground floor dining area, was formerly used (in the recent past, as of 2004) as a dining hall, but is no longer regularly used as such. It remains open for special campus events, including banquets and formal dances. The walls of this double-height full- floor space are decorated with classical allegorical murals painted by Edwin Howland Blashfield (1869, Civil Engineering), who was one of the best-known American artists and muralists of his time. Completed in 1923 and in 1930, the 5 large panels symbolically portray the role of education in society, and the immense power of science and engineering for both good and evil. Walker Memorial has also contained the administrative offices for many MIT student organizations. Among these organizations is W1MX, the MIT amateur radio society, which has installed several reconfigurable antennas visible on the roof, as well as on the nearby Green Building tower. MIT's Class A broadcast radio station, WMBR (Walker Memorial Basement Radio) has its studios in the basement, with an FM transmitter located atop the Eastgate tower. The Muddy Charles Pub, administered by the MIT Graduate Student Council, is located on the first floor and has been serving MIT affiliates since 1968. Over time, the Walker Memorial building interior has shown the effects of nearly a century of continuous use without major renovation. There were plans to make it the headquarters of the Music and Theater Arts Department, and to install new theatrical and performance spaces to accommodate a growing number of activities. , funds were being raised and an architect had been selected, but no start or completion date had been projected. In March 2017, MIT announced a new Theater Arts Building (Building W97) located at 345 Vassar Street at the far western end of campus. Since the intent of the new building was to consolidate Music and Theater Arts into a single location, the future plans for the Walker Memorial building are unclear. Senior House (1916) Entrance on Amherst Street Senior House is an L-shaped building, designed by William Welles Bosworth. The Doric portico over the entrance was added in the 1990s. It was used from its construction as a dormitory for undergraduates, until conversion to graduate housing in fall 2017. From the 1960s to 2017, the dorm had a counterculture that included student-painted murals, tolerance for drug use, acceptance of people who didn't fit into mainstream culture (including LGBT students), a tire swing, a red-white-and blue skull logo, the nickname \\"Haus\\", and the motto \\"Sport death, only life can kill you\\". The annual Steer Roast festival featured loud music, pit roast of a cow, and mud wrestling. Former residents include Roger Dingledine, developer of Tor. In 2016, MIT cited data that 21.1% of Senior House residents failed to graduate, compared to the campus average of 7.7%, and a confidential survey found a higher incidence of drug use than other dorms. The administration began a turnaround project that closed the dorm to freshmen and increased tutoring, mental health, and addiction services. After continued evidence of drug dealing in the building, the administration cancelled the 2017 Steer Roast, and in July announced conversion to graduate housing. Students protested and some faculty supported the move. The murals were covered and remaining undergraduates assigned to other dorms. Gray House (1917) Gray House The Gray House is named after Paul Edward Gray, the fourteenth president of MIT (1980–1990). This residence for the MIT president is located adjacent to Senior House, and cradles inside the elbow of the L-shaped dormitory. The President's House was the last part of the original Bosworth campus to be constructed, and consists of a three-story structure with a simple, rectangular floor plan that incorporates a ballroom on the top floor. Rogers Building (1937) Building 7 atrium The Rogers Building, named for MIT founder William Barton Rogers, is the second building of that name, the original having been demolished on its Back Bay site some years after MIT moved to Cambridge. Located at 77 Massachusetts Avenue, it is the official address of the entire Institute and serves as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor, the main pedestrian path connecting east campus with west campus. The Rogers Building was not a part of the original campus, but was built as a part of MIT's extension of the original Bosworth plan along Massachusetts Avenue. It was designed by Bosworth and Harry J. Carlson. The spacious lobby (called Lobby 7 after its building number) is an impressive vestibule topped by a small dome that rejects the neoclassical tradition of reducing scale between the interior and exterior, with the result that the \\"inner space remains at the less intimate urban scale.\\" The glass oculus at the top was blacked out during World War II but was restored during a renovation in 2000. The School of Architecture and Planning is housed around the dome and the lobby court. Wartime and post-war buildings (1940–1960) Alumni Pool (1940) The Alumni Pool (Building 57) was designed by Lawrence B. Anderson (M.Arch 1930) and Herbert L. Beckwith (B.Arch 1926, M.Arch 1927). The building was one of the first significant examples of modernist, International Style design in the United States by a US trained architect. In 2000, during the building of the adjoining Stata Center, the building was restored and most of the elegant modernist detailing was replaced by clumsy updates. The sophisticated color palette of the interior floor and walls disappeared. Its walled-in garden to the south was removed altogether and replaced by a more open landscaping. Nonetheless, the building still retains much of its early modernist sensibility, unornamented surfaces and simple functional design.Lawrence B. Anderson – The Tech Building 20 (1942–1996) Building 20 time capsule to be opened in 2053. Until then, it is on display in the Stata Center, which replaced the older structure. Building 20 was erected hastily during World War II as a temporary building to house part of the now- historic Radiation Laboratory. Over the course of fifty-five years, its \\"temporary\\" nature allowed research groups to have more space, and to make more creative use of that space, than was possible in more respectable buildings. Professor Jerome Y. Lettvin once quipped, \\"You might regard it as the womb of the Institute. It is kind of messy, but by God it is procreative!\\" Building 20 was always regarded as \\"temporary\\", and thus never received a formal name over its half-century of existence. The structure was removed in 1996–98 to make way for the Stata Center. Some of its previous occupants moved into the Stata Center upon its completion, while other \\"Building 20 refugees\\" moved to Building N51/N52 or dispersed to other locations on campus. Westgate (1945 and 1963) Westgate was first established to provide student housing for the large numbers of veterans returning to study after World War II. The demand for housing was unprecedented both in quantity as well as in quality; students often were married and many had children to care for. A temporary community persisted for over a decade before the decision was made to create more-permanent housing for married students. In its current incarnation, completed in 1963, Westgate consists of several low-rise buildings associated with a high-rise tower. Rockwell Cage (1947) The Rockwell Cage (W33) was designed by Herbert L. Beckwith and opened in 1947. The large structure was originally used by the military for indoor drills, and then declared as surplus. The structure was obtained by then-Athletic Director Ivan J. Geiger before the opening of the DuPont Athletic Center. Geiger was also key in transforming the Cage into MIT's basketball venue. Rockwell Cage was named for Dr. John Rockwell, MIT class of 1896. He was a top athlete while a student, and returned in 1927 as the president of the Advisory Council for Athletics. Rockwell is currently the official venue for MIT basketball and volleyball, although the space, which spans three and a half basketball courts, is also used for collegiate and non-collegiate tournaments in other sports (such as gymnastics), as well as recreational badminton. In the fall of 2006 and 2007, the Rockwell Cage was the venue for the Northeast regional matches in the NCAA Division III Women's Volleyball Championships. The Rockwell Cage is part of the larger, interconnected Department of Athletics, Physical Education, and Recreation (DAPER) Complex, Rockwell is in the center of the complex, and is connected to the DuPont Athletic Center, Zesiger Center, and the Johnson Athletic Center. Baker House (1949) Detail of Baker House facade onto the Charles River Alvar Aalto, a Finnish architect, designed Baker House. It has an undulating shape which allows most rooms a view of the Charles River, and gives many of the rooms a wedge-shaped layout. Baker House has six floors, with rooms for 1–4 people, and features a largely brick interior with wooden furniture and trim. The basement level contains Baker Dining, one of the five residential dining halls on campus. Aalto also designed the furniture, much of which was intended to fit in specific rooms in order to maximize the limited space. Several of these furniture pieces were given various animal names. Each resident has a large, wheeled wardrobe (no closets in the brick rooms) called an \\"elephant\\" and thigh-high rolling case of drawers called an \\"armadillo,\\" which fits neatly under the desks. Occupants of the largest singles, called \\"couches\\" because they are large enough to accommodate such furniture, also have free-standing sets of shelving called \\"giraffes.\\" The giraffe is so-named because the piece consists of a pole, which is pressed into the floor and ceiling and thus is position-adjustable, adorned with several shelves that protrude in one direction and only rise to waist height, creating a giraffe-like shape. Many residents choose to flip their giraffes upside-down in order to have more floor space. Hayden Memorial Library (1950) The Charles Hayden Memorial Library building is located adjacent to Building 2 along Memorial Drive. Built in response to the Lewis Committee findings, it originally housed all of the humanities faculty, although growth of these departments has since required more space. The building features large 2-story bay-windows overlooking both the Charles River to the south and Eastman Court to the north, as well as high ceilings in the library spaces. MIT Chapel (1955) MIT Chapel Eero Saarinen, a Finnish architect, designed the non-denominational MIT Chapel. The chapel exterior consists of a plain brick cylinder tall, topped with an aluminum bell tower by sculptor Theodore Roszak. The building is encircled by a shallow moat, that defines it as an island of serenity. Reflections from the water bounce up into the interior of the chapel through hidden windows. On the interior, Saarinen created undulating walls that focus on the chapel's altar. The sculptor Harry Bertoia designed the suspended metallic screen behind the altar. Kresge Auditorium (1955) Exterior of Kresge Auditorium looking west The Auditorium was intended as a type of university meeting hall, those words being, in fact, inscribed over the entrance. Its domed roof is exactly one-eighth of a sphere. DuPont Athletic Center (1903) and Gymnasium (1959) The DuPont Athletic Center and DuPont Gymnasium, Buildings W32 and W31, respectively, are located at the east end of the interconnected Main DAPER Complex. Building W31, the gymnasium, was originally built in 1903 as a State Armory,Staff (November 19, 1903) \\"New State Armory\\" Cambridge Chronicle but was acquired by MIT in 1957\\"1957 Acts, Chapter 364\\" Massachusetts State Archive and converted to a gymnasium in an early example of \\"adaptive re-use\\" on the MIT campus. The buildings are named for David Flett DuPont, who contributed a million dollars toward the improvement of athletic facilities, whose bequest also facilitated the building of twelve outdoor tennis courts.General Information: DuPont Athletic Center. . Retrieved October 24, 2008. DuPont, as the two buildings are collectively known, was the third athletic building constructed on campus, and the second component of what is now the DAPER Complex The Athletic Center (W32) is connected to and immediately west of the Gymnasium (W31), and adjacent on the other side to the Rockwell Cage and the Zesiger Center. W32 houses MIT's fencing, pistol, and rifle teams, while W31 is home to gymnastics, volleyball, and wrestling (although they may compete in the Rockwell Cage). The T-club Lounge is located at the DuPont Athletic Center and is the main venue for DAPER exercise classes. Building W31 is also home to MIT's Venture Mentoring Service, founded in 2000, and located on the 3rd floor.General Information: MIT Venture Mentoring Service. . Retrieved September 12, 2016. Second Century Fund (1960–1990) The Second Century Convocation (1961), commemorated the 100th anniversary of MIT's founding charter, and spearheaded a major fund-raising and construction drive. The period between 1960 and 1990 was marked by a drastic increase in the size of the campus, and nearly continuous construction activity, tapering off somewhat in the late 70s and 80s. Over the years, MIT has made an effort to bring noted architects to campus for particular commissions. McCormick Hall (1963) McCormick Hall Although women had been enrolling at MIT since the 1880s, they constituted a tiny minority of the total undergraduate population and lived in a town house across the river. In 1959, MIT released a report, The Woman at MIT, which outlined the need to expand residential and social opportunities for female students. In 1960, Katharine Dexter McCormick '04 pledged $1.5 million towards the construction of an on-campus female dormitory. Professor Herbert L. Beckwith was named architect of the project and he proposed a pair of towers on a riverside plot between Memorial Drive and the Kresge Court.McCormick History. . Retrieved 2011-04-20. Construction required the relocation of a Catholic nursing order, busy parking lot, and existing student housing. Building was broken into two phases: the West Wing was completed in 1963 and the East Wing was completed in 1968. The towers are connected by public spaces like a dining hall, dance studio, and music room at the ground floor. The building has attracted some criticism for its inefficient use of space, but it was renovated in the late 1990s.The building sits on but its only houses 250 students in a prime location close to the academic buildings. Hermann Building (1965) The Grover M. Hermann Building (E53) houses Dewey Library and the Department of Political Science. As the Sloan School of Management expanded like other departments after the war, it quickly faced a shortage of space in its original building at 50 Memorial Drive (E52) which was only acquired in 1952. Professor Eduardo F. Catalano prepared a Sloan Campus Plan incorporating a plaza connecting a new academic building, Building E52, and parking. Grover Hermann of the Martin Marietta Company contributed funds for the four-story building set on a plinth. The building has been criticized by its inhabitants for its lack of natural light and \\"fortress architecture.\\" Eastgate (1967) Eastgate Apartments Eastgate (E55) tower was completed and first occupied in August 1967. The building hosts family housing (students with spouses/partners and/or children) as well as a day care center. The tower is topped by a radio antenna mast for MIT's Class A broadcast radio station, WMBR (Walker Memorial Basement Radio, 88.1 FM). Stratton Student Center (1968) Stratton Student Center in 2017 Walker Memorial had originally served as the home for many student activity groups for several decades, but the growing post-war student population required the construction of a new and larger building. The first proposals originated in 1955 after the opening of Kresge Auditorium and Chapel had firmly planted MIT's presence on the other side of Massachusetts Avenue. Saarinen was again retained to design the new structure, but was dropped after his proposal met with resistance from faculty and donors. Professor Eduardo F. Catalano replaced Saarinen in 1961 and proposed a structure that would house meeting and practice rooms as well as commercial areas like a post office, tailor, barbershop, book store, and bowling alley. The proposed building was a monumentally imposing structure representing a high form of brutalism and included large glass windows, balconies, and terraced staircases. The building was approved in 1963 and dedicated to outgoing President Julius A. Stratton in 1965. Although initially well received, the complex design of the interior, a lack of storage space, heavy use by students, and austere exterior led to a major renovation in the late 1980s.Dackiw and Mein cited three major problems with the Student Center's present design: unclear traffic flow and arrangement; \\"dark and unwelcoming\\"parts of the interior; and overused and underused spaces. Mein said he would like to change the entrance \\"dramatically. The central area needs more light and more obvious activity\\" A strip of stores and offices was on the site of this building until it burnt down in 1961. WGBH's first offices and studios were there, as well as many businesses that catered to MIT students. Buildings designed by I. M. Pei I. M. Pei & Partners designed a number of MIT buildings, and produced a master plan for the southeast corner of the central campus. Pei was a graduate of MIT's Department of Architecture (BArch 1940). Green Building (1964) By the late 1950s, many smaller but rapidly expanding departments were outgrowing their spaces. Professor Robert R. Shrock solicited Cecil H. Green '23, the founder of Texas Instruments, for a new building to house the geology and meteorology departments in a new Center for Earth Sciences. As Bosworth's plans for residential life on East Campus had not been fully realized, many departments had aspirations for utilizing the open space in Eastman Court. Pei and Hideo Sasaki proposed siting a tall building in East Campus and breaking MIT's architectural tradition of \\"horizontality\\" The tower has some functional purpose, since its roof supports meteorological instruments and radio communications equipment, plus a white spherical radome enclosing long- distance weather radar apparatus. The tower rises 21 stories to , breaking Cambridge's previous restriction on building height. However, the footprint of every floor measures only 60 by 120 feet (18 by 36m), which research groups quickly outgrew, forcing some of them to disperse elsewhere on campus. The isolated prominence of the building and its relative proximity to the open river basin also increased wind loads at its base, which prevented people from entering or leaving the building through the hinged main doors on windy days. Revolving doors were installed at the ground floor entries to ameliorate this problem somewhat. It is incorrectly by Benjamin P. Gleitzman. The Tech, September 8, 2006. Interview with curators Bill Arning and Patricia Fuller. rumored that Alexander Calder's Big Sail, situated in front of the building, was meant to deflect these winds. The sculpture is situated too far from the building entryway to have much effect on wind velocities there. The Green Building remains the only academic tower on campus, and faculty insistence as well as logistical realities have continued MIT's previous \\"horizontal continuity\\". Dreyfus Building (1970) The Camille Edouard Dreyfus Building (Building 18) houses the Chemistry Department. The linear building parallels Eastman Laboratory (Building 6) to the west, and architecturally evokes a horizontal version of the Green Building tower which rises to its east. The floorplan deviates from MIT's traditional central corridor scheme by placing the laboratory and office space away from the windows by means of exterior corridors. The interior space consists of a research community of graduate students working in laboratory modules at the center, and faculty offices, lobbies, and teaching areas at each end of the building. A major renovation to the building was completed in 2003. The surrounding courtyard area is known as Eastman Court. A dozen Adirondack chairs were installed in the court in 2017. Landau Building (1976) The Landau Building (Building 66), named in honor of chemical engineer Ralph Landau, houses the Chemical Engineering Department. It is shaped as a 30-60-90 triangle, with the sharpest point directed toward Ames Street. The unusual shape has earned the building a nickname, \\"The Triangle Building,\\" deviating from the usual practice of referring to campus buildings by number. Wiesner Building (1985) The Wiesner building (Building E15) houses the MIT Media Lab and the List Visual Arts Center and is named in honor of former MIT president Jerome Wiesner and his wife Laya. The building is very box-like, a motif that is consistently repeated in both the interior and exterior design evoking a sense of boxes packed within each other. The building is notable for the level of collaboration between the architect and artists. It stands apart from the surrounding neighborhood with its flat, gridded skin make of white, modular metal panels. The building's exterior was designed by Kenneth Noland is meant as a metaphor of technology through the grids of graph paper and number matrices while also quoting the corridor-like morphology of the rest of the MIT campus. Scott Burton, Alan Shields, and Richard Fleischner also collaborated extensively in the final design of the internal atria and external landscaping. McDermott Court McDermott Court in 2008 McDermott Court is located between the Chemistry, Earth Sciences, the Alumni Houses and the Walker Memorial. Students held at peace rally in the court on September 20, 2001, days after the September 11 attacks. Alexander Calder's La Grande Voile (The Big Sail) (1965) is installed in the court.

Tang Hall (1973) Tang Hall Tang Hall (W84) is organized into small apartment suites on each floor, occupied by unmarried graduate students. The building structure is unusual at MIT, in that it is made of modular reinforced concrete structural elements, prefabricated off-site. On the campus, this method has usually been reserved for free- standing parking garage structures. Whitaker College (1982) Whitaker College Whitaker College (Building E25) houses the College of Health Sciences and Technology as well as MIT Medical. Howard W. Johnson Athletic Center (1981) The Howard W. Johnson Athletic Center, named for MIT's 12th president, is located at the west end of the interconnected DAPER Complex, immediately adjacent to the Zesiger Center. with Johnson simply referring to one section of the complex. The Johnson Center houses MIT's varsity fencing, ice hockey, tennis, and track & field teams. The first floor includes a seasonal ice rink, team locker-room and equipment facilities, and athletic trainers' offices and workspace. The ice rink doubles, in the off-season, as an arena which hosts, among other events, the Career Fair and the annual Spring Weekend Concert. The second floor connects to the Zesiger Center's DAPER offices and pool gallery. The third floor consists of an indoor track and field space, including a small weights area, which often must be shared by MIT's spring athletic teams early in the season, as the Cambridge weather tends to be too cold and/or snowy to practice outside. During finals week, the (ice-free) ice rink and indoor track are utilized to administer final exams for large classes requiring the ample space. Evolving Campus (1990–present) A major building effort has been underway for several years in the wake of a $2 billion development campaign. For these commissions, MIT brought in leading architects (many of which had no prior connection to MIT) to propose dramatic new buildings to contrast the earlier, more \\"mundane\\" buildings. The new buildings have created a good deal of debate, particularly in a city like Boston, which is not known for its contemporary architecture. Critics have both hailed and assailed the prominence of \\"starchitecture\\" on campus. Koch Biology Building (1994) The Koch Biology Building (also Building 68) is a building named after David H. Koch who donated $100 million to MIT for cancer research. It houses research laboratories from the Department of Biology and has 8 floors. The building was completed in 1994 and is designed by Goody Clancy & Associates. Tang Center for Management Education (1995) Tang Center Building E51 Central Utilities Plant (1995) William R. Dickson Cogeneration Facility Much of the energy for the MIT campus comes from a Central Utilities Plant (Building 42). Located between Albany and Vassar Streets, this cogeneration facility includes a 21 megawatt ABB GT10A Combustion Turbine Generator and a heat recovery system and produces electricity, steam heat, and chilled water for more than 100 campus buildings. MIT plans to replace the existing turbine, which is nearing the end of its useful life, with two new 22 megawatt units by 2020. Since the cogeneration plant came on line in 1995, MIT estimates it has used one third less fuel than it would have using conventional sources for electricity and steam. The plant is also capable of powering portions of the campus in an emergency.Cogeneration: A bridge to the future Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center (2002) The Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center The Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center (Z-Center) was designed by Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo & Associates, (2002). It features an Olympic-class, 50-meter by 25-yard, swimming pool, plus a separate 8-lane, 25-yard teaching pool, two levels of weight and aerobic equipment, the multi-purpose Muckley MAC Court, the Folger, Steinman and Jules squash courts, and offices for DAPER staff. It is the home of MIT's water polo, swimming & diving, and squash teams. The Zesiger Center is connected to the Johnson Athletic Center, the Rockwell Cage, and the DuPont Athletic Center as part of the Main DAPER Complex. while Johnson, Rockwell, and DuPont refer to areas within the complex. Simmons Hall (2002) Simmons Hall After the alcohol-related death of an MIT freshman living in an off-campus fraternity in 1998, the MIT administration settled the resulting lawsuit under the stipulation that all freshmen be required to live on campus. This resulted in a need for beds for 300 freshmen who previously would have lived in off-campus fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups. Steven Holl and Associates were chosen to lead the design for a new \\"porous\\" dormitory in 1999. Simmons Hall opened in August 2002 for student occupancy. Simmons Hall has been nicknamed \\"The Sponge\\", because the architect consciously modeled the shape and internal structure on a sea sponge. The building has 350 student rooms, 5,538 2-foot square windows, and is constructed of 291 customized precast, steel-reinforced Perfcon panels. Stata Center (2004) Ray and Maria Stata Center The architecture of the Ray and Maria Stata Center (Building 32) is some of the most recognizable on MIT's campus. Designed by architect Frank Gehry, the building is built in a Deconstructivist style - it is composed of an eclectic combination of shapes constructed using a range of materials from brick to glass to a variety of architectural metals. The building houses several auditoriums, classrooms, and offices for the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department (Course 6). In particular, the upper floors house research labs and offices of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), as well as the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy (Course 24). The ground floor of the building offers additional features such as the Forbes Cafe, art installations associated with the MIT Museum, and a campus childcare center; it is also directly connected to the Wang Fitness Center and Alumni Pool (Building 57). Brain and Cognitive Sciences Building (2006) Building 46 Building 46, which houses the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science, and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. Officer Sean Collier Memorial (2015) This memorial to MIT Police Officer Sean Collier, who was killed in the line of duty on 18 April 2013 in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, was unveiled in early 2015. It was constructed on the site of a small landscaped bed between the Ray and Maria Stata Center and the David H. Koch Institute. MIT.nano (2018) MIT.nano The new MIT.nano building, replacing the previous Building 12, is intended as a multi-disciplinary research node in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Hockfield Court Hockfield Court in 2018 In 2019, the North Court was renamed Hockfield Court after MIT's 16th President Susan Hockfield. Mark Di Suvero's Aesop's Fables, II (2005) is installed in the court. Landscaping As MIT's riverfront site was a marshland filled-in by dredging from the bottom of the Charles, it was largely free from either natural flora or previous occupants. In 1892, the Cambridge Park Commission had commissioned Frederick Law Olmsted to lay out a picturesque driveway and park along the Charles River that would feature tree-lined promenades and a central mall. Bosworth's plan would integrate this Memorial Drive (Cambridge) into the campus by using courtyards enclosed and overlooked by the academic buildings. Killian (née Great) Court, the ceremonial main entrance, was originally planned by Mabel Keyes Babcock '08 to be a French-style gravel-covered court centered on a large statue of Minerva. However, as automobile and trolley traffic along Massachusetts Avenue made the western buildings the de facto entrance to MIT, the Great Court was replaced by \\"street-edge plantings of low privet hedges, a line of oak trees, lawns and base plantings to create a visual transition from the ground level over the English basement to the first floor of the new buildings.\\" The New England Hurricane of 1938 and Dutch Elm Disease required that many of the original trees in Killian be replaced by pin oaks. Temporary buildings constructed during and immediately after World War II occupied many vacant lots around MIT, but the 1960 Campus Master Plan included Hideo Sasaki as a landscape architect. The Landscape Master Plan called for \\"tree-lined and landscaped streets and pathways; well-defined open spaces, each reflecting the designs and functions of the buildings in each campus sector; and a variety of tree species to safeguard the campus against the blights that strike monocultures.\\" Artwork The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has hundreds of sculptures and other art-related publicly viewable installations scattered across its campus. The MIT art collection includes major works by Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore, Alexander Calder (La Grande Voile (The Big Sail)), Jacques Lipchitz, Dan Flavin, Dan Graham, Sarah Sze, Tony Smith, Theodore Roszak, Harry Bertoia, Jean-Robert Ipousteguy, Auguste Rodin, Anish Kapoor, Mark di Suvero, Louise Nevelson, Sol Lewitt, Frank Stella, Cai Guo-Qiang, and others. Many smaller works of art are visible in offices and hallways, and even residences, under the Student Loan Art Program. The MIT List Visual Arts Center oversees the more than 1,500 works catalogued in the MIT Permanent Art Collection, which can be browsed online. A self-guided walking tour map of major on-campus art is available from MIT information desks or online, and live guided tours are offered sometimes to the general public. For a number of recent \\"Public Art Commissions on the MIT Campus\\", a brochure can be downloaded describing the artwork in detail. In May 2011, the general public was invited to a weekend FAST (Festival of Art, Science, and Technology) tour of temporary art installations, as part of the MIT 150 celebration of the 150th anniversary of MIT's founding charter. The event was well-attended and popular, inviting the possibility of more such events in the future. Although not part of the MIT campus, the nearby MBTA subway stop at Kendall Station is the site of the three-piece Kendall Band. This artwork is an interactive sound sculpture which was designed and built by Paul Matisse, grandson of French artist Henri Matisse, and stepson of surrealist artist Marcel Duchamp. The sound sculpture proved so popular that it was frequently worn out or broken, disappointing visitors. In 2010, it was adopted by the \\"Kendall Band Preservation Society\\", a group of MIT students and staff who have redesigned and rebuilt some of the broken mechanisms (with the approval of the artist) that made the sculpture operate.Hao, Ziwei.

In the Coeur d'Alene Mountains of the Bitterroot Range, the pass is on the border between Idaho and Montana, traversed by Interstate 90 (formerly U.S. Route 10) at an elevation of above sea level. Lookout Pass is the eastern border of northern Idaho's Silver Valley, and has the distinction of being \\"Exit 0\\" on Interstate 90 in Montana. Established in 1935, Lookout Pass Ski and Recreation Area is on the eastbound side of the highway, straddling the border. The state border line is the ridge line of the mountains and at the pass runs briefly east-west, with Idaho on the north side and Montana the south. The pass separates the communities of Mullan in Shoshone County, Idaho, and Saltese in Mineral County, Montana. It is the highest point on Interstate 90 between Seattle and Missoula. The pass is also a time zone border, with northern Idaho on Pacific Time and Montana on Mountain Time. Eastbound on I-90, its elevation is not surpassed until beyond Deer Lodge. The pass was formerly traversed by the Northern Pacific Railway and the right-of-way is still intact and used as a rail trail.

He was the second husband of Dame Agatha Christie. Life and work Born Edgar Mallowan in Wandsworth on 6 May 1904,Index of Births England and Wales, 1837-1915 he was the son of Frederick Mallowan and his wife Marguerite (née Duvivier), whose mother was mezzo-soprano Marthe Duvivier. He was educated at Rokeby School and Lancing College (where he was a contemporary of Evelyn Waugh) and studied classics at New College, Oxford. He first worked as an apprentice to Leonard Woolley at the archaeological site of Ur (1925–1931), which was thought to be the capital of Mesopotamian civilization. It was at the Ur site, in 1930, that he first met Agatha Christie, the famous author, whom he married the same year. In 1932, after a short time working at Nineveh with Reginald Campbell Thompson, Mallowan became a field director for a series of expeditions jointly run by the British Museum and the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. His excavations included the prehistoric village at Tell Arpachiyah, and the sites at Chagar Bazar and Tell Brak in the Upper Khabur area (Syria). He was also the first to excavate archaeological sites in the Balikh Valley, to the west of the Khabur basin. Following the outbreak of the Second World War he served with the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in North Africa, being based for part of 1943 at the ancient city of Sabratha. He was commissioned as a pilot officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 11 February 1941, promoted flying officer on 18 August 1941, flight lieutenant on 1 April 1943. At some point he also held the rank of wing commander, for when he resigned his commission on 10 February 1954, he was permitted to retain that rank in retirement. After the war, in 1947, he was appointed Professor of Western Asiatic Archaeology at the University of London, a position which he held until elected a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1962. In 1947, he also became director of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq (1947–1961) and directed the resumption of its work at Nimrud (previously excavated by A. H. Layard), which he published in Nimrud and its Remains (2 volumes, 1966). Mallowan gave an account of his work in Twenty-five Years of Mesopotamian Discovery (1956) and his wife Agatha Christie described his work in Syria in Come, Tell Me How You Live (1946). Max's first wife, Lady Mallowan, known to millions as Agatha Christie, died in 1976; the following year, Mallowan married Barbara Hastings Parker, an archaeologist, who had been his epigraphist at Nimrud and Secretary of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. Honours Mallowan was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1960 Queen's Birthday Honours, and knighted in 1968. He and Dame Agatha Christie were among a number of married couples each of whom held knightly honours in their own right. Death He died on 19 August 1978, aged 74, in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, and was interred alongside his first wife, Dame Agatha, in the churchyard of St Mary's, Cholsey.

She then continued her studies at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Bucharest. She received her Ph.D. in 1977 with thesis On Intertwining Dilations written under the direction of Ciprian Foias. Ceaușescu then worked as a researcher at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy in Bucharest. Her field of specialization was functional analysis. Allegedly, her parents were unhappy with their daughter's choice of doing research in mathematics, so the Institute was disbanded in 1975. She moved on to work for Institutul pentru Creație Științifică și Tehnică (INCREST, Institute for Scientific and Technical Creativity), where she eventually started and headed a new department of mathematics. In 1976, Ceaușescu received the Simion Stoilow Prize for her outstanding contributions to the mathematical sciences. She was married in 1980 to Mircea Oprean, an engineer and professor at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest.

It is thought to arise from an outgrowth of immature cartilage cells (chondroblasts) from secondary ossification centers, originating from the epiphyseal plate or some remnant of it. Chondroblastoma is very uncommon, accounting for only 1-2% of all bone tumors. It affects mostly children and young adults with most patients being in the second decade of life, or less than 20 years of age. Chondroblastoma shows a predilection towards the male sex, with a ratio of male to female patients of 2:1. The most commonly affected site is the femur, followed by the humerus and tibia. Less commonly affected sites include the talus and calcaneus of the foot and flat bones. Signs and Symptoms The most common symptom is mild to severe pain that is gradually progressive in the affected region and may be initially attributed to a minor injury or sports-related injury. Pain may be present for several weeks, months, or years. Other symptoms in order of most common to least commonly observed include swelling, a limp (when affected bone is in the lower extremity), joint stiffness, and a soft tissue mass. Physical findings include localized tenderness and a decreased range of motion in the involved bone and nearby joint, muscle atrophy, a palpable mass, soft tissue swelling, and joint effusion in the affected area. Less commonly, pathological fractures can be found, especially in cases involving the foot. In cases involving the temporal bone, tinnitus, dizziness, and hearing loss have been reported. In a publication by Turcotte et al. it was found that the average duration of symptoms for patients with chondroblastoma was about 20 months, ranging from 5 weeks to 16 years. Risk Factors Currently, the genetic or environmental factors that predispose an individual for chondroblastoma are not well known or understood. Chondroblastoma affects males more often than females at a ratio of 2:1 in most clinical reports. Furthermore, it is most often observed in young patients that are skeletally immature, with most cases diagnosed in the second decade of life. Approximately 92% of patients presenting with chondroblastoma are younger than 30 years. There is no indication of a racial predilection for chondroblastoma. Pathogenesis The etiology of chondroblastoma is uncertain, as there is no specific characteristic abnormality or chromosomal breaking point observed, despite cytogenetic abnormalities being highly specific for some tumors. Romeo et al has noted that chondroblastoma arising in long bones mainly affects the epiphyses, while in other locations it is close to ossification centers. Additionally, rare prevalence of chondroblastoma in intra-membranous ossification suggests a close relationship with growth plate cartilage. In chondroblastoma, growth signaling molecules may be present due to the pre-pubertal signaling network as well as cartilage growth. Sex hormones are thought to be linked to this process because of the spatial relationship of chondroblastoma with the growth plate and its typical occurrence before growth plate fusion. Both Indian Hedgehog/Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (IHh/PtHrP) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways, important for development of the epiphyseal growth plate, are active in chondroblastoma leading to greater proliferation among the cells in the proliferating/pre-hypertrophic zone (cellular-rich area) versus the hypertrophic/calcifying zone (matrix-rich area). These findings suggest that chondroblastoma is derived from a mesenchymal cell undergoing chondrogenesis via active growth-plate signaling pathways (see Endochondral ossification). The highly heterogeneous nature of the tumor makes classification particularly difficult especially considering the origins of chondroblastoma. There are two opposing views on the nature of chondroblastoma, one favoring an osseous origin and the other favoring a cartilaginous origin. The work of Aigner et al suggests that chondroblastoma should be reclassified as a bone-forming neoplasm versus a cartilaginous neoplasm due to the presence of osteoid matrix, type I collagen, and absence of true cartilage matrix (collagen II). However, Edel et al found that collagen II, a marker for mature chondrocytes, was expressed in chondroblastoma, supporting the chondroid nature of the neoplasm. The results of Romeo and colleagues favor the view of Edel et al of chondroblastoma being cartilaginous in nature but recognize that any definitive determinations regarding the origin of this neoplasm are not possible because of the plasticity of mesenchymal cells when set into different microenvironments and static approaches used in literature. Romeo et al have observed chondroblastoma neoplasms to be composed of mesenchymal cells that have completed normal chondrogenesis along with the production of osteoid and collagen I that could be the result of transdifferentiation of chondrocytes towards osteoblasts.  Diagnosis   Imaging Studies  A variety of imaging studies can be used to diagnose chondroblastoma, with radiographs being the most common. Laboratory studies are not considered useful. Classical chondroblastoma (appearing on long bones) appears as a well-defined eccentric oval or round lytic lesion that usually involves the adjacent bone cortex without periosteal reaction. A sclerotic margin can be seen in some cases. For long bone chondroblastomas the tumor is typically contained to the epiphysis or apophysis but may extend through the epiphyseal plate. Chondroblastomas are usually located in the medullary portion of bones and can, in some cases, include the metaphysis. However, true metaphyseal chondroblastomas are rare and are typically the result of an extension from a neighboring epiphyseal legion. Most lesions are less than 4 cm. A mottled appearance on the radiograph is not atypical and indicates areas of calcification which is commonly associated with skeletally immature patients. Additionally, one-third of all cases involve aneurysmal bone cysts which are thought to be the result of stress, trauma or hemorrhage. In cases involving older patients or flat bones, typical radiographic presentation is not as common and may mimic aggressive processes. Other imaging techniques involve computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scans, which may be helpful in determining the anatomical boundaries, associated edema, or biological activity of the chondroblastoma, respectively. MRI studies may show extensive oedema around the lesion and show variable T2 signal intensity.  Histological Findings  Chondroid differentiation is a common feature of chondroblastoma. A typical histological appearance consists of a combination of oval mononuclear and multi-nucleated osteoclast-type giant cells. However this is not a prerequisite for diagnosis, as cells with epithelioid characteristics have been observed in lesions of the skull and facial bones. A \\"chicken-wire\\" appearance is characteristic of chondroblastoma cells and is the result of dystrophic calcification that may surround individual cells. Although, calcification may not be present and is not a prerequisite for diagnosis. Mitotic figures can be observed in chondroblastoma tissue but are not considered atypical in nature, and therefore, should not be viewed as a sign of a more serious pathology. There is no correlation between mitotic activity and location of the lesion. Furthermore, the presence of atypical cells is rare and is not associated with malignant chondroblastoma. There are no discernible histological differences observed when comparing the aggressive form of chondroblastoma that can cause recurrence or metastases with its less aggressive, benign, counterpart.  Differential Diagnosis  Chondromyxoid fibromas can share characteristics with chondroblastomas with regards to histologic and radiographic findings. However they more commonly originate from the metaphysis, lack calcification and have a different histologic organization pattern. Other differential diagnoses for chondroblastoma consist of giant cell tumors, bone cysts, eosinophilic granulomas, clear cell chondrosarcomas, and enchondromas (this list is not exhaustive).  Treatment  Chondroblastoma has not been known to spontaneously heal and the standard treatment is surgical curettage of the lesion with bone grafting. To prevent recurrence or complications it is important to excise the entire tumor following strict oncologic criteria. However, in skeletally immature patients intraoperative fluoroscopy may be helpful to avoid destruction of the epiphyseal plate. In patients who are near the end of skeletal growth, complete curettage of the growth plate is an option. In addition to curettage, electric or chemical cauterization (via phenol) can be used as well as cryotherapy and wide or marginal resection. Depending on the size of the subsequent defect, autograft or allograft bone grafts are the preferred filling materials. Other options include substituting polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or fat implantation in place of the bone graft. The work of Ramappa et al suggests that packing with PMMA may be a more optimal choice because the heat of polymerization of the cement is thought to kill any remaining lesion. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy are not commonly used. Radiotherapy has been implemented in chondroblastoma cases that are at increased risk of being more aggressive and are suspected of malignant transformation. Furthermore, radiofrequency ablation has been used, but is typically most successful for small chondroblastoma lesions (approximately 1.5 cm). Treatment with radiofrequency ablation is highly dependent on size and location due to the increased risk of larger, weight-bearing lesions being at an increased risk for articular collapse and recurrence. Overall, the success and method of treatment is highly dependent upon the location and size of the chondroblastoma.  Prognosis  Although not specific to one mode of management, lesion size, patient sex, or follow-up, the recurrence rate for chondroblastoma is relatively high, and has been shown in select studies to be dependent upon the anatomical location, method of treatment, and biological aggressiveness of the initial lesion. The rate of recurrence is highly variable, ranging between 5% and 40%, as study results are generally inconclusive. However, local recurrence for long bone lesions is around 10%, with chondroblastoma in flat bones having higher recurrence and more complications. Recurrences are more common in cases involving an open epiphyseal plate where they can be attributed to inadequate curettage to avoid damage. Lesions of the proximal femur are particularly problematic because of difficulties accessing the femoral head for complete excision. Chondroblastoma may recur in the soft tissue surrounding the initial lesion, especially in the case of incomplete curettage. Recurrences have been shown to occur between 5 months and 7 years after initial treatment and are generally treated with repeat curettage and excision of affected soft-tissue. No histological differences have been seen between recurrent and non-recurrent chondroblastomas. Rarely, more aggressive chondroblastomas can metastasize. The most common location for metastases is the lung, with some cases also involving secondary bone sites, soft tissue, skin, or the liver. The prevalence of metastatic chondroblastoma, however, is quite low and is believed to be less than 1%. There is no relationship established between metastasis and previous surgery, non-surgical treatment, anatomical location, or patient age. Survival of patients with metastatic lesions is better when the metastases are surgically resectable, as chemotherapy has been shown to have little to no benefit. Prognosis is bleak for patients with malignant chondroblastomas that are resistant to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. However, patients with resectable metastases have survived for several years following diagnosis. While recurrence is the most common complication of chondroblastoma other issues include post-surgery infection, degenerative joint disease, pathological fractures, failure of bone grafts, pre-mature epiphyseal closure, functional impairment, and malignant transformation. Complications are less common in patients presenting with chondroblastoma in accessible areas. Overall, patients with more classical chondroblastoma (appearing in long bones, typical presentation) have better prognoses than patients with atypical chondroblastoma (flat bones, skull, etc.).  History  Chondroblastoma was first described in 1927 as a cartilage-containing giant cell tumor by Kolodny but later characterized by Codman in 1931. Codman believed chondroblastoma to be an \\"epiphyseal chondromatous giant cell tumor\\" in the proximal humerus. This view was changed later by a comprehensive review completed by Jaffe and Lichtenstein in 1942 of similar tumors in other locations than the proximal humerus. They re-defined the tumor as a benign chondroblastoma of the bone that is separate from giant cell tumors. However, chondroblastoma of the proximal humerus is still sometimes referred to as Codman’s Tumor. References De Mattos, Camilia B.

It was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in December 2001 by Aprilia's president, Ivano Beggio, and their race boss, Jan Witteveen. The Cube is powered by a 990 cc inline-3 four-stroke engine (to conform to MotoGP rules of that time). The engine was developed with large F1-derived input from Cosworth, bringing many features not previously seen in motorcycle development - this includes pneumatic valves, traction control and ride-by-wire. On the bike's first outing in 2002 it showed promise and claimed the top speed in the early races. The highly innovative engine and control system was poorly matched with the chassis which was too stiff and unforgiving. Through the 2002 season a handful of updates were made and in 2003 a 3-2-1 exhaust system was added to effectively de-tune the engine. This was coupled with a change to a 6 injector fuel system and a host of calibration changes which transformed the feel of the bike. At this point Aprilia took over the engine development programme themselves and did not take any further development updates from Cosworth. Despite early promise the bike was not a success; the innovation shown in the 2002 season with traction control and drive by wire is only now being perfected. The engine design and development was carried out by a small team at Cosworth Racing in Northampton and went from CAD to track in 8 months. The engine was considered the most powerful at that time, producing about . A testbed that never was raced produced at one point, before Aprilia bowed out of MotoGP in 2004.

He wrote for the Star Tribune in Minneapolis for three decades, and now writes an occasional column for The Christian Science Monitor. He is the father of U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar. Life and career Klobuchar was born in Ely, Minnesota, the son of Mary (Pucel) and Michael Klobuchar. His grandparents were all from Slovenia, the surname Klobučar means 'hatter' in Slovenian. He earned an Associate of Arts degree from Ely Junior College (now Vermilion Community College) in 1948, a Bachelor of Arts cum laude from the University of Minnesota in 1950. He married Rose Heuberger August 7, 1954 and had two children, Amy and Beth. He served in the United States Army from 1950 to 1952. He worked as a wire editor for the Bismarck Tribune in North Dakota in 1950 as a legislative reporter from 1952 to 1953. Worked as a staff writer for the Associated Press in Minneapolis from 1953 to 1961 and with the Minneapolis Tribune from 1961 to 1965. He became a columnist for the Minneapolis Star starting in 1965.Who's Who in America, 1976–77, Marquis Who's Who, p.1743 Klobuchar was an alcoholic who frequently missed family gatherings during his children's youth, spent much time away due to his drinking, and was repeatedly arrested for driving under the influence. Klobuchar and his wife divorced around 1975. He initiated the divorce, calling himself another \\"middle-aged man with wanderlust\\". The divorce took a serious toll on the family, eventually causing Beth to drop out of high school, leave home early, and struggle with personal issues for a while. Amy's relationship with her father did not fully recover until the 1990s, when he quit drinking. Klobuchar and his ex-wife reconciled as best friends a few years after the divorce, and he never regretted the impact the divorce had on the family.

NTFS-3G often uses the FUSE file system interface, so it can run unmodified on many different operating systems. It is runnable on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenSolaris, illumos, BeOS, QNX, WinCE, Nucleus, VxWorks, Haiku, MorphOS, Minix, macOSNTFS-3G for Mac OS X (\\"Catacombae\\") and OpenBSD. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It is a partial fork of ntfsprogs and is under active maintenance and development. NTFS-3G was introduced by one of the senior Linux NTFS developers, Szabolcs Szakacsits, in July 2006. The first stable version was released on February 21, 2007, as version 1.0. The developers of NTFS-3G later formed a company, Tuxera Inc., to further develop the code. NTFS-3G is now the free \\"community edition\\", while Tuxera NTFS is the proprietary version. Features NTFS-3G supports all operations for writing files: files of any size can be created, modified, renamed, moved, or deleted on NTFS partitions. Transparent compression is supported, as well as system-level encryption.NTFS-3G FAQ Support to modify access control lists and permissions is available.NTFS-3G: NTFS Driver with Ownership and permissions NTFS partitions are mounted using the Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) interface. NTFS-3G supports hard links, symbolic links, and junctions. With the help of NTFS reparse point plugins, it can be made to read chunk-deduplicated files, system-compressed files, and OneDrive files. NTFS-3G provides complete support and translation of NTFS access control list (ACL) to POSIX ACL permissions. A \\"usermap\\" utility is included to record the mapping from UIDs to Windows NT SIDs. NTFS-3G supports partial NTFS journaling, so if an unexpected computer failure leaves the file system in an inconsistent state, the volume can be repaired. As of 2009, a volume having an unclean journal file is recovered and mounted by default. The ‘norecover’ mount option can be used to disable this behavior. Performance Benchmarks show that the driver's performance via FUSE is comparable to that of other filesystems' drivers in-kernel,Comparing NTFS-3G to ZFS-FUSE for FUSE Performance provided that the CPU is powerful enough. On embedded or old systems, the high processor usage can severely limit performance. Tuxera sells optimized versions of the driver that claims to have improved CPU utilization for embedded systems and MacOS.Performance at Tuxera The slowness of NTFS-3G (and FUSE in general) on embedded systems is attributed to the frequent context switching associated with FUSE calls. Some open-source methods provided to reduce this overhead include: * The underlying FUSE layer has an option called to use larger blocks when writing. Using a larger block means fewer context switches. This is in fact a solution recommended by Tuxera. A patch is available to use an even larger block. * There is also a Linux kernel option called to reduce the writes on file access. * Synology Inc. uses a modified NTFS-3G on their NAS systems. It replaces the ntfs-3g inode caching with a different mechanism with unsure benefit. (It also includes an alternative Security Identifier translation for the NAS.) History * NTFS-3G forked from the Linux-NTFS project on October 31, 2006. * On February 21, 2007, Szabolcs Szakacsits announced \\"the release of the first open-source, freely available, stable read/write NTFS driver, NTFS-3G 1.0.\\" * On October 5, 2009, NTFS-3G for Mac was brought under the auspices of Tuxera Ltd. and a proprietary version called Tuxera NTFS for Mac was made available.NTFS-3G for Mac OS X is now Tuxera NTFS for Mac * On April 12, 2011, it was announced that Ntfsprogs project was merged with NTFS-3G.Release: NTFS-3G + NTFSPROGS 2011.4.12 * NTFS-3g added TRIM support in version 2015.3.14.

Flummerfelt, J.C.L. on 11-06-2004, accessed 25 April 2019. JCL) is the title of an advanced graduate degree with canonical effects in the Roman Catholic Church offered by pontifical universities and ecclesiastical faculties of canon law. Licentiate is the title of a person who holds an academic degree called a licence. The licentiate of canon law is the ordinary way for forming future canonists, according to Veritatis gaudium.Canon Law Institutions Must Offer Diploma in Marriage and Procedural Law, Zenit.org, access 25 April 2019. Academic program Licentiate programs in canon law involve a study of the whole corpus of canon law in the Roman Catholic Church, understood in terms of its theological, philosophical, and historical background, and the method and practice of scholarly scientific research. Consequently, experts in canon law have a comprehensive understanding of the nature of law specifically in the life of the church. First cycle The usual prerequisites for a licence in canon law are that a candidate must have the Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree (STB), Master of Divinity degree (MDiv), Master of Arts (MA) degree in Roman Catholic theology, or Juris Doctor (JD) degree and a bachelor's degree in canon law (JCB) or its relative equivalent. Candidates with a heavy concentration of theological and philosophical coursework during undergraduate studies may be exempted from further academic prerequisites. Second cycle In order for a candidate to obtain the licentiate of canon law, he or she must complete a six-semester (two years year-round, three years with summer break), program of canonical studies, pass a comprehensive oral examination before a jury of faculty members, and write a thesis on a particular theme that demonstrates the student's ability to function professionally in the field. Uses of the degree in the Catholic Church The licence in canon law is required for a person to teach canon law in a pontifical university or Catholic seminary. The licence is also the prerequisite to the doctorate in the same field (JCD). Furthermore, the degree is a prerequisite for several officers of Catholic ecclesiastical courts: judges (including the judicial vicar), the Promoter of Justice, and the Defender of the Bond all must at least possess this degree. Pontifical faculties Notable faculties which offer the licence in canon law include: the Pontifical Lateran University (Lateranum, also known as \\"The Pope's University\\"), the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum); the Pontifical Gregorian University (Gregorianum), the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross (Santa Croce), the Pontifical Urban University (Urbanianum), the University of Navarra in Pamplona, the Catholic University of America, Saint Paul University in Canada, the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines, the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, the Institut Catholique de Paris, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster in Germany, and the Faculty of Canon Law \\"S. Pio X\\" in Venice of Studium Generale Marcianum.

In adults, blood cells are formed in the bone marrow, by a process that is known as haematopoiesis. In CMML, there are increased numbers of monocytes and immature blood cells (blasts) in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, as well as abnormal looking cells (dysplasia) in at least one type of blood cell. CMML shows characteristics of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); a disorder that produces abnormal looking blood cells, and a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN); a disorder characterised by the overproduction of blood cells. For this reason, CMML was reclassified as a MDS/MPN overlap disorder in 2002. For a diagnosis of CMML, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that the blood monocyte count must be >1x109/L, no Philadelphia chromosome or mutations in the PDGFRA or PDGFRB gene should be present, the blast count must be <20% and dysplasia of at least one lineage of myeloid blood cell should be present. Azacitidine is a drug used to treat CMML and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency. Stem cell transplant is also used to treat CMML, and involves the transplantation of donor haematopoietic stem cells into the recipient. Blood transfusion and erythropoietin are used to treat disease associated anaemia.  Signs and symptoms  One of the most common signs of CMML is splenomegaly, found in approximately half of cases. Other less frequent signs and symptoms consist of anaemia, fever, weight loss, night sweats, infection, bleeding, synovitis, lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and peritoneal effusion.  Cause  Although the cause of CMML is unknown, environmental carcinogens, ionising radiation and cytotoxic agents may have a role in causing disease. Approximately one third of cases of MDS with a monocyte count of >10% and <1x109/L will progress to CMML.  Pathogenesis  With a high rate of Ras mutation in CMML, deregulation of this signalling pathway has been linked to the pathogenesis of the disease. Tumour necrosis factor, GM-CSF, interleukin-3, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 may have a role in hyperproliferative CMML cells. These cytokines can stimulate the growth of CMML in vitro. Hypermethylation of cytosine residues (usually in the promoter regions of genes) occurs in many malignancies to regulate gene expression. One commonly hypermethylated gene in CMML is p15INK4b, a gene involved in cell cycle regulation.  Genetic mutations  Clonal genetic abnormalities are common in CMML but they are not specific for diagnosis of the disease. The most common found are the 8+, −7/del (7q) and structural 12p abnormalities. KRAS and NRAS are mutated in 25–40% of the cases of CMML. The Jak2 V617F mutation is found in 10% of cases. Mutations in transcription factors such as RUNX1, CEBPA, NPM1 and WT1 have been found in up to 30% of cases. Mutations of CBL are found in approximately 5–18% of cases. Mutations in the TET2 gene are found in approximately 40–50% of CMML. Inactivating mutations in one of the two parental GATA2 genes lead to a reduction, i.e. a haploinsufficiency, in the cellular levels of the gene's product, the GATA2 transcription factor, and thereby to a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease, GATA2 deficiency. This disease is associated with a highly variable set of disorders including the myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and CMML. GATA2-deficiency-induced CMML, like other types of CMML, is commonly preceded by monocytosis.  Diagnosis  Blood films display a range of abnormalities. A monocyte count of >1x109/L is essential for a diagnosis of CMML. Other features may include; leukocytosis (50% of cases); left shift and dysplasia of monocytes and granulocytes; presence of metamyelocytes, myelocytes and promonocytes; monocytes with hypersegmented/abnormal shaped nuclei, increased cytoplasmic basophilia and/or the presence of cytoplasmic granules; eosinophilia (in cases of CMML with eosinophilia); and spherocytosis (in cases of direct Coombs test, DCT, positive haemolytic anaemia). Platelet counts may be reduced, increased or normal. Haemoglobin levels are usually reduced with normocytic and normochromic red blood cells. Autoantibodies and cold agglutinins may be present and 10% of CMML is DCT positive. Bone marrow aspirates will display hypercellularity with increased counts of granulocytic and monocytic cells. Bone marrow core biopsies may show a predominance of myelocytic and monocytic cells, abnormal localisation of immature precursors and dysplastic megakaryocytes. Monocytic nodules are a common feature in biopsies. The phenotypical characteristics of CMML are; CD11b, CD11c, CD14, CD33, CD45 and CD64 seen in 100% of cases; CD13 found in 95% of cases; CD4 found in 76% of cases; HLA-DR found in 71% of cases; CD56 found in 53% of cases; CD2 found in 34% of cases; CD16 found in 29% of cases; CD10 found in 28% of cases; CD23 and CD7 found in 9% of cases; and CD117 found in 5% of cases.  Classification  Haematopoiesis. The two lineages of myeloid and lymphoid cells are formed from haematopoietic stem cells. Leukemia subtypes are categorised into single clinical entities so that they can be diagnosed and treated appropriately. Leukaemias are subdivided into lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms, depending on which bone marrow cells are cancerous. The myeloid neoplasms contain acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). MPNs are characterised by increased production of myeloid blood cells, with a higher than normal number of mature cells. Unlike MPNs, MDSs have a dysfunctional production of myeloid cells with a reduced number of mature cells. Many of the cells produced in MDS are abnormal looking, known as dysplasia. CMML shows characteristics of both groups and thus is a difficult disease to categorise. FAB classification The French-American-British (FAB) classification system was published in 1976 to classify the leukaemias. It placed CMML into the category of MDS, along with the refractory anaemia, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts, refractory anaemia with excess blasts and refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation. The system does have clinical utility; however factors such as cytogenetic status are not within the remit of the classification. For this reason, many disease entities in these groups show a great deal of heterogeneity. WHO classification In 2001, the WHO Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms was published, classifying CMML into a new group of diseases, the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), reflecting the disease's neoplastic nature. Other diseases in this category are juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, atypical CML; BCR-ABL1 negative and MDS/MPD unclassifiable. These MDS/MPN overlap syndromes have effective production of some lineages of blood cells, but show ineffective proliferation of other lineages. The 2008 revision of the classification moved cases of CMML with PDGFR gene translocations to a new group, myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia with abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1. Diagnostic criteria FAB criteria The FAB criteria for diagnosis are as follows: *Monocyte count >1x109/L *0–19% blasts in bone marrow *<5% blasts in peripheral blood The FAB also arbitrarily categorises CMML into myelodysplastic-like and myeloproliferative-like groups. A white blood count of 13x109 is used as a cut-off to differentiate the two. WHO criteria The WHO criteria for diagnosis are as follows: *Persistent peripheral blood monocytosis with counts >1x109/L *No Philadelphia chromosome or BCR-ABL1 fusion gene *No rearrangement of PDGFRA or PDGFRB gene *<20% myeloblasts, monoblasts and promonocytes in peripheral blood or bone marrow *Dysplasia in one or more of the myeloid lineages; if myelodysplasia is absent or minimal then a diagnosis of CMML can be made if other requirements are met and: **A molecular genetic abnormality is present in haematopoietic cells, or **Monocytosis present for ≥3 months and other causes of monocytosis have been ruled out WHO defined CMML has two main subsets, CMML-1 and CMML-2. CMML-1 is diagnosed if myeloblasts, monoblasts and promonocytes are <5% of peripheral blood and <10% of bone marrow. CMML-2 is diagnosed if: *Myeloblasts, monoblasts or promonocytes are 5-19% in blood, or *Myeloblasts, monoblasts or promonocytes are 10-19% in bone marrow, or *Auer rods are present CMML-1 and CMML-2 can be additionally grouped as CMML-1 or CMML-2 with eosinophilia. These are diagnosed if the above criteria are met and the blood eosinophil count is >1.5x109/L. Presence of two or more phenotypic abnormalities can aid a diagnosis of CMML in the absence of identifying cytogenetic or dysplastic features. These can include the expression of CD56 and/or CD2, or under- expression of HLA-DR.  Prognosis   Factors affecting prognosis  CMML-2 has a reduced overall survival as compared with CMML-1, with median survivals of 15 and 20 months, respectively. Myeloproliferative CMML (>13x109 monocytes/L) has a reduced survival compared with myelodysplastic CMML. A platelet count of <100 x109/L reduces overall survival. A haemoglobin level of <10g/dL has a reduced overall survival. Some cytogenetic abnormalities have implications on the prognosis of CMML. Normal karyotypes or the single loss of the Y chromosome have low risk prognoses. Trisomy 8, chromosome 7 abnormalities and complex karyotypes comprise a high risk group. Other cytogenetic abnormalities have intermediate prognoses. Somatic mutations in genes such as ASXL1 and EZH2 are associated with a poor prognosis. CMML has a 20–30% chance of transformation to AML, a lower rate than other similar diseases. The CMML-2 subtype is associated with increased risk of transformation and ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations also increase the risk of transition to AML.  Scoring systems  IPSS The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was developed in the mid-1990s to assess the prognosis of MDS patients. This system stratifies cases into 2 groups; a lower-risk group (sub divided into low and intermediate-1) and a higher risk (subdivided into intermediate-2 and high). It uses the blast percentage, number of cytopenias and bone marrow cytogenetics data to place cases of CMML into these groups. Due to the scoring system being developed for MDS, the more myeloproliferative cases of CMML (WBC >13x109) are excluded from the scoring system. Although the IPSS scoring system is used clinically, there is a high variability in each group. For this reason, new modalities for assessing prognosis in MDS (and CMML) are being developed.  MD Anderson Prognostic Scoring System  A new method developed using data from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center found that a haemoglobin level of <12g/dL, total circulating lymphocyte count of >2.5 x 109/L, >0% immature myeloid cells, >10% bone marrow blasts causes a reduced overall survival. This data allows cases of CMML to be stratified into low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2 and high risk groups. These groups have median survival times of 24, 15, 8 and 5 months respectively. The Düsseldorf score The Düsseldorf score stratifies cases using four categories, giving one point for each; bone marrow blasts ≥5%, LDH >200U/L, haemoglobin ≤9g/dL and a platelet count ≤100,000/uL. A score of 0 indicates a low risk group' 1-2 indicates an intermediate risk group and 3-4 indicates a high risk group. The cumulative 2 year survival of scores 0, 1-2 and 3-4 is 91%, 52% and 9%; and risk of AML transformation is 0%, 19% and 54% respectively.  Treatment  The treatment of CMML remains challenging due to the lack of clinical trials investigating the disease as its own clinical entity. It is often grouped with MDS in clinical trials, and for this reason the treatment of CMML is very similar to that of MDS. Most cases are dealt with as supportive rather than curative because most therapies do not effectively increase survival. Indications for treatment include the presence of B symptoms, symptomatic organ involvement, increasing blood counts, hyperleukocytosis, leukostasis and/or worsening cytopenias. Blood transfusions and erythropoietin administration are used to raise hemoglobin levels in cases with anemia. Azacitidine is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CMML and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for high risk non-proliferative CMML with 10–19% marrow blasts. It is a cytidine analogue that causes hypomethylation of DNA by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine is a similar drug to azacitidine and is approved by the FDA for treatments of all subtypes of MDS, including CMML. Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy that is used in the myeloproliferative form of CMML to reduce cell numbers. Decitabine/cedazuridine (Inqovi) is a fixed-dosed combination medication for the treatment of adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) that was approved for use in the United States in July 2020. Haematopoietic stem cell transplant remains the only curative treatment for CMML. However, due to the late age of onset and presence of other illnesses, this form of treatment is often not possible.  Epidemiology  There have been few individual epidemiological studies of CMML, due to the difficulty in the disease classification. CMML has an estimated incidence of less than 1 per 100,000 persons per year. The median age of diagnosis is 65–75. CMML has a propensity for males rather than females, at a ratio of 1.5–3:1.

Courtright (September 19, 1891 – August 1979) was an American football, basketball, and baseball player, coach of football, basketball, golf, and wrestling, and college athletics administrator. Courtright attended the University of Oklahoma where he played halfback for the football team from 1911 to 1913 and also competed in baseball, basketball and track. He was the head football coach at Pittsburg State University (1915–1917), the University of Nevada, Reno (1919–1923), and Colorado School of Mines (1924–1926). Courtright was also an assistant football coach (1927–1936), head golf coach (1929–1944) and head wrestling coach (1942–1944) at the University of Michigan. University of Oklahoma Courtright was a multi-sport athlete at the University of Oklahoma competing in football, baseball, basketball and track. He played halfback for Bennie Owen's Oklahoma Sooners football team from 1911 to 1913. In November 1911, he helped Oklahoma break a nine-game losing streak to Kansas with a long run that set up a field goal for the game's only points in a 3–0 win. He was also reported to be one of the \\"Sooner stars\\" in a 14–6 win over Missouri in 1911. In November 1912, he scored all six of the Sooners' points on two field goals in the fourth quarter of a 6–5 win over Kansas. One Oklahoma newspaper noted: > \\"Oklahoma owes her victory to the educated toe of Raymond Courtright, who > left a sick bed that he might give his team the advantage of his kicking in > a pinch. For ten days he has not been in a football suit until Saturday.\\" And as a senior in 1913, he scored one of the Sooners' two touchdowns in a 14–3 win over Colorado in a game played in five inches of mud in front of a crowd of 5,000 at Oklahoma City. He was reportedly selected as an All- Southwestern halfback for three consecutive years. In 1919, one sports writer noted that Courtright was \\"considered the best halfback ever developed at Oklahoma.\\" Courtright was also a pitcher for Oklahoma's baseball team. He once pitched a no-hitter against Missouri, and on another occasion he pitched 20 innings in a 1–1 game against Oklahoma A&M.; He also received varsity letters for basketball and track (as a hurdler). He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Oklahoma in 1914. Early years as coach After graduating from Oklahoma, Courtright started his coaching career either at Oklahoma Preparatory, or at Atlanta Union Preparatory School. In 1915, he was hired by Kansas State Normal School at Pittsburg (now known as Pittsburg State University). He served as the head football coach at Pittsburg for three seasons from 1915 to 1917, compiling a record of 15–11–2. Courtright also served as the athletic director at Pittsburg. University of Nevada, Reno In April 1919, Courtright was hired by the University of Nevada, Reno as its director of athletics and head coach of the football, basketball, baseball and track teams. Courtright was Nevada's football coach for five years from 1919 to 1923. During his years at Nevada, Courtright was \\"affectionately known as 'Corky'.\\" In his first year as Nevada's coach, Courtright led the team to an 8–1–1 record, doubling the highest season win total of any prior Nevada football team. The only loss came in the first game of the season, a 13–7 loss to the California freshman team. Courtright's 1919 Nevada team outscored its opponents 450 to 32, including scores of 132–0 over Pacific, 102–0 over the Mare Island Marines, and 56–0 over UC Davis. At the time, Courtright called the 1919 Nevada team \\"the best team I ever had,\\" and others called it the \\"best team that ever played on Mackay Field.\\" At the end of the 1919 season, the Reno Evening Gazette wrote: > \\"It was a good move when the students and regents decided last spring to go > east and get one of the best men to come to Nevada and build up a football > team. In selecting a coach they also demanded an all-round man, who could > coach basket ball, track, baseball and put into operation a regular system > of physical culture for all the students as well. Coach Courtright fitted > the requirements and the football season proves the wisdom of the selection > ...\\" In 1920, Courtright's team finished with a record of 7–3–1 with wins over both the Utah Utes (14–7) and Utah State Aggies (21–0), and losses to California (79–7), USC (38–7), and Santa Clara (27–21). Courtright never reached the same level of success after the 1920 season, finishing 4–3–1 in 1921, 5–3–1 in 1922 and 2–3–3 in 1923. However, his most notable game at Nevada was a scoreless tie with California on November 3, 1923. The 1923 California team was known as the \\"Wonder Team.\\" It had gone through three full seasons without a loss, and had outscored its opponents 151 to 0 in the first seven games of the 1923 season. Nevada had only 15 men on its football team in 1923 and was considered to be a decided underdog. When Courtright returned to the Nevada campus in 1961, he was shown souvenirs of his time at the school. Ty Cobb, then a sports columnist, accompanied Courtright and wrote: \\"Courtright chuckled when he saw a huge framed layout of newspaper headlines from 1923 -- when Nevada tied the great California 'Wonder Team.' 'Yep, that WAS quite a game,' he chortled.\\" Courtright compiled a record of 26–13–7 while at Nevada, and his teams outscored opponents by a combined total of 993 to 464. Shortly before his resignation in 1924, the Nevada State Journal credited Courtright with having \\"brought the Nevada eleven from the class of a second rate team to its present rank among the best of the western college football squads.\\" Courtright was also the head basketball coach at Nevada and led the basketball team to championships of the California-Nevada Basketball League in both 1920 and 1921.(\\"The climax of his work in Nevada came during the past season when the Wolf pack held California to a 0 to 0 tie.\\") Courtright's teams finished with records of 6–2 and 10–3 in 1920 and 1921, but suffered losing seasons in 1922 and 1923. In four seasons as Nevada's basketball coach, Courtright compiled a record of 25 wins and 29 losses. Colorado School of Mines In March 1924, Courtright was hired away from Nevada by the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado. At the time, the School of Mines had an enrollment of 450 students. Courtright was given a three-year contract at an advanced salary with a promise of a raise after the first season. Courtright stated that he regretted leaving Nevada but could not turn down the offer made by the Colorado school. He was the head football coach at the Colorado School of Mines from 1924 to 1926 and compiled a record of 7–17–1. University of Michigan In September 1927, Courtright was hired as an assistant football coach at the University of Michigan. He served in that capacity from 1927 to 1936. Courtright was also the head golf coach at Michigan from 1929 to 1944.(This account indicates that Courtright was Michigan's golf coach starting in 1929.)(University of Michigan records indicate that Thomas Trueblood was listed officially as the head golf coach until 1935. However, Trueblood had retired to professor emeritus status in 1926 at age 70. By the time Trueblood \\"officially\\" retired and was given the title of \\"coach emeritus\\" in 1935, he was nearly 80. As some sources list Courtright as the head coach starting in 1929, it is unclear what the precise division of responsibilities were between Courtright and Trueblood from 1929 to 1935.) His teams won two NCAA National Championships (1934–1935), and he coached two NCAA individual champions, Johnny Fischer (1932) and Chuck Kocsis (1936). His 1943 Michigan golf team was also the runner up in the NCAA National Championship. In 1942, he was also appointed as the head coach of Michigan's wrestling team while regular coach Cliff Keen was serving in the military. In addition to the NCAA golf championship, Courtright's teams won eight Big Ten Conference golf championships and one Big Ten wrestling championship. In August 1944, Courtright reported that he had received notice from the University of Michigan that his coaching position was being terminated, effective November 1, 1944, for economic reasons. Fresno State In May 1946, Courtright was hired by Fresno State College (now known as California State University, Fresno) as an assistant football coach. Fresno State's head football coach, Jimmy Bradshaw, had been Courtright's top ground gainer when Courtright was the head coach at Nevada. The Fresno State Bulldogs finished with an 8–4 record in 1946.

Home to about 1000 people, it was founded in the early 1920s by Benjamin Franklin Burdett and his son, Arthur. The site of the neighborhood is located where some of the bloodiest battles of the American Civil War took place during the Atlanta Campaign. Location Brookwood Hills is located near the heart of Atlanta, only a few miles away from the skyscrapers of its major business districts. It is connected by three entrances to Peachtree Road, and has no other outlet. Brookwood Hills is bordered roughly by Peachtree on the west, Interstate 85 on the south, the Norfolk Southern and MARTA tracks (just south of Peachtree Creek) to the north, and Clear Creek to the east. The Brookwood neighborhood, for which Brookwood Hills was named, is located immediately southwest of the southern tip of Brookwood Hills. This is in turn immediately north of the major freeway interchange called the \\"Brookwood split\\", which joins I-75 to the northwest and I-85 to the northeast into the Downtown Connector to the south. Because of the recent rapid growth of metro Atlanta, developers have made constant attempts to build whatever they can near, or inside the neighborhood. Examples of these are: *Building a MARTA station inside of the neighborhood. (stopped) *An industrial park on the other side of Clear Creek. *Extending W. Peachtree into and through the neighborhood. (stopped) *Highrise apartments in residents' backyards.(mostly stopped) Because of these pressures of being a big-city community, the Brookwood Hills Community Club (BWHCC) was created. (This is the reason so many of the above projects were halted). The BWHCC also owns the park and pool in the center of Brookwood Hills. History and development Brookwood Hills was the creation of the Burdett family. Benjamin first created the neighborhood on the Battlefield of Peachtree Creek owned by himself and local Thomas Collier. The streets were built in accordance to the hilly terrain, instead of grid form, as was popular at the time. Mr. Burdett planted oak saplings during Brookwood Hills' founding, which now stand tall and are the trademark quality of the neighborhood. The area developed by Benjamin and Arthur Burdett is now registered as the Brookwood Hills Historic District. In November 2011 the City of Atlanta began a project to repair damaged sidewalks and curbs in front of approximately 50 homes in the neighborhood.Jeremiah McWilliams, \\"Atlanta to fix sidewalks in Brookwood Hills neighborhood\\", Atlanta Journal-Constitution, October 20, 2011 Brookwood Hills Community Club The hub of the community is the Brookwood Hills Community Club, which includes a park, pool, two pavilions, tennis courts, and basketball goals. Many neighborhood sponsored events like the Fourth of July parade and the annual Easter egg hunt take place here. Brookwood Hills Bullfrogs The Brookwood Hills pool hosts its own swim team. Their mascot is a bullfrog. This team competes in the Atlanta Swim Association summer league. They start practices in late April, and compete through the end of June or beginning of July. Every year, they compete at Georgia Tech for ASA championships. In 2013, Brookwood Hills won the entire meet.

The Recreational Dive Planner (or RDP) is a decompression table in which no-stop time underwater is calculated. The RDP was developed by DSAT and was the first dive table developed exclusively for no-stop recreational diving. There are four types of RDPs: the original table version first introduced in 1988 along with a circular slide rule version called The Wheel, followed by the eRDP, an electronic version introduced in 2005 and the eRDPML, an electronic multi- level version introduced in 2008. RDPs are almost always used in conjunction with dive log books to record and monitor pressure depth and residual nitrogen levels. The low price and convenience of many modern dive computers mean that many recreational divers only use tables such as the RDP for a short time during training before moving on to use a diving computer. Dive computers are also used as they calculate no-decompression limits based on the whole dive whereas the RDP is much more conservative and assumes a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth. Although this is much more conservative, dive computers provide much more dive time and therefore are the more popular option with most divers.

It was released as a single on March 24, 1992 in advance of its host album, Last Rights (1992). The B-side \\"Lahuman8\\" was created at the request of the Québécois contemporary dance group La La La Human Steps. Content The song \\"Inquisition\\" acts as the midpoint of Skinny Puppy's 1992 album Last Rights. Even though it is a pounding, aggressive, mechanical industrial dance song that John Bush of AllMusic described as \\"heart-stopping\\" and as the pinnacle of its album, it still functions as a break from the surrounding chaos and sorrow of Last Rights. Jon Selzer of Melody Maker wrote that the song has the \\"utopian laments\\" that made defined Skinny Puppy's best work. Originally bearing the demo title \\"Catbowl\\", \\"Inquisition\\" takes a break from the addiction-focused lyrics of the rest of Last Rights and returns to the topic of torture and animal cruelty that the band explored on its 1988 album, VIVIsectVI. Like many other Skinny Puppy songs, \\"Inquisition\\" employs samples. The single Three version of \\"Inquisition\\" exist, two of which appear on its single release. The extended mix lengthens the song from five minutes to seven and begins with a brief atmospheric introduction. The many layers of the track are introduced one by one, and its first third features two rhythmic stops not found on the album version. After the first chorus, a percussion breakdown is followed by a period of synthesizer emphasis. The extended mix contains multiple protracted instrumental segments where the various parts are given more time to develop. Notably, the passages of high-speed bass drums are completely absent in this version, with the song instead winding down through gradually stripping away electronic layers. The single mix of \\"Inquisition\\", which also appears on the 1999 compilation The Singles Collect, shortens the song's introduction and removes many (but not all) of the kick drum segments in its latter half. \\"Lahuman8\\" was commissioned by the Canadian dance group La La La Human Steps after Skinny Puppy released its sixth album, Too Dark Park, in 1990. Fellow industrial band Einstürzende Neubauten was also recruited for the effort. The song itself is a dark, synthesizer-heavy piece with distant, distorted vocals and an unsettling tone. It concludes with a rising wall of noise. \\"Lahuman8\\" also appeared on Skinny Puppy's 1999 compilation B-Sides Collect. After viewing the performance in which the dance group employed \\"Lahuman8\\", Lewis Segal of the Los Angeles Times described the show's musical compositions as \\"assaultive\\". The dub mix of \\"Mirror Saw\\" is a stripped down version of the original song with a greater focus on its percussion and percussive samples. It is a minimal, instrumental track that eschews much of the album version's melancholy peacefulness in exchange for sparse and mechanical aggression. The last third of the song introduces loud live drumming that drowns out many of the electronic sounds. Track listing Personnel Credits adapted from liner notes.

Resigning from the Federal Government in 1993, Moureaux's coalition defeated the incumbent mayor of Molenbeek at the 1994 council elections. A key part of Moureaux's campaign, then and since, was the involvement of ethnic minorities in the campaign, of Ecolo being the first Belgian of Moroccan origin elected in Molenbeek. In 2004, as a senator, Moureaux submitted the law granting the right of foreigners to vote in municipal elections. However, Moureaux's attempts at revitalizing the municipality were not successful. An example was the withdrawal of BBDO in June 2011 from the town. In an open letter addressed to Moureaux, ten employees of this American advertising agency cited over 150 attacks on their staff by locals as principal reason for their departure.

She was one of the four attendants of Mary Queen of Scots known as the Four Marys. She was a sister at the Convent of Saint Pierre les Dames in Reims at the time of her death. Sent to France Mary Seton was the daughter of George Seton, 6th Lord Seton, and his second wife Marie Pieris or Pierres, a daughter of René Pierres, of Plessis Baudouin, and Antoinette d'Hommes. Marie Pierres was a lady-in-waiting to Mary of Guise, the wife of King James V of Scotland.Marguerite Wood, Foreign Correspondence of Marie of Lorraine: Balcarres Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1923), pp, 245-7. The French Pierres family claimed to have descended from the Percy family of Northumberland.Nicolas Viton de Saint Allais, Nobiliare universel de France, vol. 1 (Paris, 1814), pp. 147, 150. As a child, Mary Seton became a lady-in- waiting to the young Mary, Queen of Scots, along with three other girls of similar age and of a similar standing in Scots society. They were famously known as \\"The Four Marys\\": she and Mary Beaton, Mary Fleming and Mary Livingston. The Four Marys accompanied Queen Mary in France, where she later married the Dauphin, Francis II of France. Mary Seton was the only one of the four not to marry, and continued in service with Mary, in Scotland and during her captivity in England. Scotland again When Queen Mary returned to Scotland, after her ceremonial entry at Edinburgh in September 1561, she went to Linlithgow Palace, while the four Marys, accompanied by the Queen's uncle, the Grand Prior of Malta, François de Lorraine (1534-1563), went to the house of Mary Seton's brother George Seton, 7th Lord Seton, Seton Palace, for dinner.Calendar State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth: 1561-1562, vol. 4 (London, 1866), no. 488 fn. 6, no. 631: CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (London, 1898), p. 552 no. 1018. After their defeat by the Confederate lords at the battle of Carberry Hill on 15 June 1567, Mary Seton accompanied the captive queen back to Edinburgh. Seton assisted the queen's escape from the island fortress of Lochleven Castle by standing at a window dressed in the queen's clothes while she fled to the mainland in a small boat. The Queen came to England following the battle of Langside. In England Mistress Mary Seton's role and talent as the Queen's hairdresser was described in detail by Sir Francis Knollys, Mary's keeper at Carlisle Castle in his letter to William Cecil of 28 June 1568. Mary had told Knollys that Mary Seton was the finest 'busker' of a woman's head and hair in any country. Knollys wrote that; > \\"Yesterday, and this daye she dyd sett sotche a curled heare uppon the > Queen, that was said to be a perewyke that showed very delycately: and every > other day lightly ... (word lost) she hathe a newe devyce of head dressyng, > withowte any coste, and yett setteth forthe a woman gaylye well.\\"Calendar of > State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 447-8 no. 720. At first Mary Seton was given a room to herself with two beds, one for her maid or 'gentlewoman' Janet Spittell. She also had a manservant called John Dumfries.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 565-6 no. 732, 'Johne Dumfries', 'Janet Spittell.' In March 1569 the Earl of Shrewsbury noted that Queen Mary would sit and sew in his wife Bess of Hardwick's chamber at Tutbury Castle accompanied by Mary Seton and Lady Livingston.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 632 no. 1022. In August 1570, Mary's mother, Mary Pieris, Lady Seton, who was at Blair Castle with the Countess of Atholl, heard her daughter was ill, and wrote from Dunkeld to Queen Mary to ask if she could come home.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 313-5. The messenger carrying the letters, John Moon, was captured, and Mary Pieris was imprisoned in Edinburgh, for writing to the exiled queen. In October, Queen Elizabeth heard that Mary Pieris had been arrested and would be banished from Scotland for writing to her daughter and Queen Mary, and took action that Regent Lennox should be advised that she thought it no great cause. Pieris had already been released, before Elizabeth's intervention, promising not to write to Queen Mary again.Calendar of State Papers Scotlandvol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), p. 410 no. 543: A Diurnal of Remarkable Occurents in Scotland (Bannatyne Club, 1833), pp. 185-6. When Queen Mary was moved to Sheffield Castle in September 1571, Mary Seton stayed in attendance, but her servant John Dumfries was excluded and kept in the town. Janet Spittle was sent back to Scotland.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), p . 691 no. 930. Mary Seton then had an older woman as her servant, Janet Lindsay, and as they were tired of each other by April 1577, she was allowed back to Scotland.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 227-8 no. 249: Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1791), pp. 52-3. At Sheffield in November 1581, Robert Beale questioned Mary Seton about Queen Mary's recent illness, which had a quick onset. Seton said that she had not seen the Queen as ill before, her side gave her evil pains especially in the thigh and leg. The Queen lacked appetite, was losing sleep, and in Seton's opinion could not long continue.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), p. 91 no. 85. The master of Mary's household in England, Andrew Beaton, wished to marry Mary Seton, but as she had made a vow of celibacy, Andrew travelled to Paris to obtain a dispensation. He died during his return journey.Duncan, (1905), p.369. The Convent of Saint-Pierre in Reims Sometime around 1585 she retired from the Scottish Queen's household in England to the Convent of Saint-Pierre at Reims in France where the abbess was Renée de Guise, the sister of Mary of Guise and aunt of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary wrote a letter to Mary, Countess of Shrewsbury on 22 February 1608, mentioning that her right arm was paralysed, and the letter was in French because she had forgotten the little English she knew after twenty years, as a 'poor recluse in a monastery.' She wrote that she had sent other letters to the Countess and Lady Arbella Stuart.Dynfnallt Owen, ed., HMC 58, Manuscripts Marquess of Bath, vol. 5 (London, HMSO, 1980), p. 133-4, French. She wrote to the Countess of Roxburghe, a companion of Anne of Denmark, in September 1614.George Seton, A history of the family of Seton during eight centuries, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1896), p. 150, note of a copy BL MS 28,747. Mary Seton died at the Convent in 1615. Little else is known about her last years at Saint Pierre les Dames other than what was written by James Maitland, the expatriate Catholic son of William Maitland of Lethington. Maitland visited the convent and found Seton to be living in poverty and suffering from failing health. He complained to her family, to whom he was remotely related, and to Queen Mary's son James VI of Scotland, but there is no evidence of a response. The bequests in her will show that she was wealthy.Duncan (1905), p.369. In popular culture In the 2013-17 CW television series Reign, the character, Greer of Kinross, played by Celina Sinden is loosely based on Mary Seton. In the 2018 film Mary, Queen of Scots, Mary Seton is played by actress Izuka Hoyle.

Summit; also referred to as Siskiyou Pass) is a summit (high point) on Interstate 5 (I-5) in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is distinct from Siskiyou Pass, which is a nearby, historical mountain pass. Siskiyou Summit is situated in the Siskiyou Mountains, approximately north of the California border. At , it is the highest point on Interstate 5. When the highway was rebuilt on its current alignment, road cutting lowered the elevation of the summit by . Geography The Siskiyou Mountains form the watershed boundary between the Klamath and Rogue Rivers and are also a rough natural separator between Oregon and California. The summit on Interstate 5 is about north of Yreka, California, and east of the historical Siskiyou Pass, the most used mountain pass in the state. The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail crosses the highway here on the way to Mexico from Canada. Climate Weather station at the summit of the old road. The road over Siskiyou Summit is typically closed to traffic for many days during winter due to severe weather conditions. At times, it can be closed during winter even when the weather is fine. Regardless, weather data is important to those involved in transportation over the summit. Average monthly temperatures and rainfall are given in the table below. Snow generally falls during the months of November through April, typically peaking with four such days in December. The wind speed over the course of a year varies from an average of in May to episodes of . The average number of rainy days per month varies from 11 in December to only two in June, August and September. History The Hudson’s Bay Company carved a route from Oregon to California during their hunt for furs and pelts following Native American trails. HBC developed the Siskiyou Trail in 1827, which included crossing Siskiyou Summit. In the 1830s, Ewing Young, using horses and mules, led hundreds of cattle over the Siskiyou Trail, necessitating its widening; this process, which took three months to complete, linked the Shasta Valley in California with the Rogue Valley in Oregon. Scientists and cartographers of the United States Exploring Expedition carried out studies along this trail in 1841, while miners of the California Gold Rush traversed the trail to reach the gold fields. In the 1860s, the trail was widened so that stagecoaches could easily traverse it. The first telegraph line was added in 1864. Only in the 1960s did it become the modern highway now designated Interstate 5. Road The summit “towering 4310 ft straight up and straight down with curves thrown in for variety”, has enough space for parking two lanes of rigs on both flanks of the road. Since the gradient is about 6%, it is a preferred place for truckers to park, refuel, check the condition of their vehicles, and rest. The road down from the summit on the north side is steep and winding. During winter, reaching the summit can be a challenge due to snow and ice on the pavement. Since 2008, with the closure of the Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad rail link between Medford, Oregon and Weed, California the highway has seen greater use by truckers to carry timber and finished products. In order to reduce reliance on this hazardous mountain road and to reduce the expense of highway transport, proposals have been made to reopen the rail link.

The north side has the steepest grade of any continuously paved road in Colorado (9%), but the pass does not close often in winter because snowplows clear the route regularly during this season. It has a few switchbacks and tight spots, but other than that, most travelers will find it an easy, scenic route. Technically speaking, the current highway does not traverse the true Slumgullion Pass, which lies just off the highway on the ridge between Cebolla Creek and the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River, at an elevation of about . As a result of a realignment several decades ago (evident by comparing USGS topographic maps of different vintages), the road now takes a shorter but somewhat higher route as it travels east and south from this spot toward Spring Creek Pass. The road sign at the high point refers to Slumgullion Summit rather than Slumgullion Pass in order to reflect this. This is analogous to the usage of the terms Donner Summit and Cajon Summit in California. However, in all three cases, the more familiar but slightly inaccurate name is routinely used.  Slumgullion Slide  Slumgullion Pass is named for the nearby Slumgullion Earthflow, a gigantic landslide whose yellowish soil reminded early settlers and miners of slumgullion stew. The Slumgullion Slide began about 700 years ago when weak volcanic tuff and breccia on the southern flank of Mesa Seco slumped several miles down the steep mountainside. Approximately 300 years ago, a second earthflow started from the top of the mountain and is still active, moving as much as twenty feet (six meters) per year. Trees growing on the newer slide are tipped at odd angles. The first flow was so large and cataclysmic that it blocked the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River and created Lake San Cristobal, Colorado's second largest natural lake.

It was screened within the official selection of Venice Film Festival (1953). It is a drama about young relationships told in flashbacks by a group of women. Since its release, Secrets of Women, while not regarded as one of Bergman's strongest efforts, has nonetheless received positive reviews from film critics. Plot While waiting at a table for the arrival of their husbands who happen to be the Lobelius brothers, three women, Rakel, Karin and Marta, begin talking and share secrets. Rakel tells of her marriage with Eugen, and her simultaneous affair with Kaj. One day, Kaj and Eugen returned home from a shooting excursion. Rakel, professing to be disgusted by Kaj, revealed they have cheated on Eugen. Rakel told Eugen she was not looking for his forgiveness; Eugen said he intended to expel Rakel from the house, with her possessions and an allowance. Rakel replied she is not Eugen's property. Eugen stormed out with a rifle, and Rakel chased after him, fearing he would commit suicide. When Eugen threatened to kill himself, Rakel asked an elderly neighbour to talk sense into him. Rakel tells the women at the table she has come to think of Eugen as her child and is resolved to take care of him. Encouraged by Rakel's candor, Marta tells of her own story, her affair with Eugen's brother Martin, a painter. Marta learned she is pregnant, and after an appointment with a gynecologist, returned home to tell Martin. There, Martin was being visited by his brothers to inform him of their father's death. One of the brothers, Fredrik, the head of the family firm, said he was disturbed by the fact that Martin would not attend their father's funeral, and said Martin would not be given a job at the firm. When the family left, Marta tried to tell Martin of her pregnancy, but he refused to hear the news she wanted to tell him. On a date that night, he discussed his intentions that they part ways, and asked what she had wanted to say, but she said she was kidding about having news. They separated without Marta informing him of their expected child, and she gave birth without him. Back at the table, Marta's sister Maj professes to like the story, but dislikes the fact that Marta and Martin reconciled, which Marta attributes to their love for each other. Karin says her story is not so much a story as a comedic episode: She accompanied her husband Fredrik to receive the crown prince at an event, and did not warn Fredrik that he had shaving cream in his ear the entire time. After leaving the event, the couple entered an elevator, which malfunctioned and became stuck, trapping Fredrik and Karin inside. After the commotion, Karin was amused to see Fredrik's crushed top hat. While waiting, Fredrik asked Karin if she has ever been unfaithful, and Karin casually and quickly replied yes. She then accused him of having an affair with a woman named Diana, and said her own confession was a lie. Fredrik said he ended the affair with Diana quickly, claiming Diana was a madwoman. Karin then admitted that her claim to have cheated was somewhat true, and that she had embellished her story about Diana. They made love in the elevator, then quickly got dressed as the elevator started moving up to rescuers. After the women have told their stories, Marta learns Maj is planning to run away with her lover, Henrik, oldest brother Paul and his wife Annette's son who is supposed to arrive with his father and uncles, but who secretly arrived earlier. Marta says she will force Maj not to leave, but Maj replies she is not a child. The men arrive as Henrik and Maj take off on a boat. Paul tells Marta to let them go, since they will return soon enough after gaining wisdom by spending the summer doing \\"something they think is forbidden.\\" Cast Release and reception In 2018, The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray in Region A, along with 38 other Bergman films, in the set Ingmar Bergman's Cinema. Secrets of Women holds a 100% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on six critics.

The pass is traversed by State Highway 149 and the Colorado Trail. Somewhat unusually for a pass on the Continental Divide, it is not the highest point on the highway in the vicinity; heading north from the pass, the road climbs over the considerably higher Slumgullion Summit before descending toward Lake City. Water Diversion Around 1910, the Tabor Ditch was constructed to divert water from tributaries of Cebolla Creek in the Gunnison River basin over the continental divide at Spring Creek Pass into Big Spring Creek in the Rio Grande basin. This 0.5 mile (0.8 km) ditch was originally constructed to divert water for irrigation, but it is now owned by the Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

David M. Cheney. Retrieved January 4, 2017.\\"Metropolitan Archdiocese of Torino\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016. The diocese of Turin was founded in the 4th century, and elevated to the dignity of an archdiocese on 21 May 1515 by Pope Leo X. As a metropolitan church, it has as suffragans: Acqui, Alba, Aosta, Asti, Cuneo, Fossano, Ivrea, Mondovì, Pinerolo, Saluzzo and Susa.Diocesi di Torino, Diocesi: Storia; retrieved: 9 July 2018. Its mother church is the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist. Since 2010 the Archbishop of Turin has been Cesare Nosiglia. History The earliest bishop of Turin whose name has survived was St Maximus. Fedele Savio, in fact, argues that Maximus was the first bishop of Turin.Savio, pp. 285-286: Ma niuna memoria essendo rimasta di vescovi anteriori a S. Massimo e l'episcopato di questo Santo non potendosi protrarre molto in su nel secolo IV, noi incliniamo a credere che l'episcopato di Torino fosse instituto insieme con quello di Novara nel 398, oppure verso questo tempo. Maximus, many of whose homilies are extant, died between 408 and 423.Savio, pp. 283-294, at p. 293. Semeria, pp. 24-26. Bishop Ursicinus (569-609) underwent captivity and loss of his property at the hands of the Franks. Pope Gregory I complained to Bishop Syagrius of Autun that someone else was made bishop in place of Ursicinus, in violation of Canon Law, and Ursicinus' diocese was taken away from him.Savio, pp. 225-226. Kehr, p. 81, no. 1. J. P. Migne, Patrologia Latina Vol 77, p. 1045 no 115. It has been inferred that the Diocese of Moriana (Maurienne) was detached from that of Turin on this occasion. Duke Garibold of Turin, who had assassinated the Lombard King Godebert in 662, was murdered in an act of revenge, in the Baptistry of S. Giovanni il Battisto in the Cathedral of Turin.Rondolino, p. 10, citing Paul the Deacon at p. 23 note 10. Semeria, p. 50. Other bishops were: Claudius of Turin (817-27), a copious and controversial writer, famous for his opposition to the veneration of images; Regimirus (of uncertain date, in the 9th century), who established a rule of common life among his canons; Amulo (880-98), who incurred the ill-will of the Turinese and was driven out by them; Gezo (1000), who founded the monastery of San Solutore in Turin; Landulf (1037), who founded the Abbey of Cavour and repaired the damage inflicted on his Church by the Saracen incursions; Cunibert of Turin (1046–1080), to whom St Peter Damian wrote a letter (Epistolae IV.iii) exhorting him to repress the laxity of his clergy in matters of clerical celibacy; Boso (1122–c.1127), who resigned as a cardinal to become bishop. In 1074 Bishop Cunibert of Turin (1046–1080) was summoned by Pope Gregory VII to attend a synod which was announced for 30 November in that year. One of the matters to be treated was the controversy between Cunibert and Abbot Benedict of S. Michele di Chiusa. The controversy had already involved Pope Alexander II, according to William of Chiusa, the biographer of Abbot Benedict: Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores Tomus XII (Hannover: Hahn 1856), p. 204. The Bishop claimed that the monastery was situated on allodial property of the diocese, and therefore the bishop had the right to install the abbot and collect the decima tax. On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (venire contempsit); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.Semeria, pp. 80-83. Kehr, pp. 82-84, nos. 7-13. Two episcopal 'elections' In 1243, Bishop Hugo (Uguccione) de Cagnola (1231–1243) abdicated the bishopric of Turin and became a Cistercian. Before he retired to a monastery (the house of the Cistercians in Genoa) though, he was required to administer his diocese until a successor was elected. On 15 November 1243, Pope Innocent IV ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.Savio, p. 372. Élie Berger, Les registres d'Innocent IV, Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228. On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675. An episcopal election The episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301–1319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document. Bishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of Pope John XXII.Chiuso, pp. 448-453. The bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated. Creation of the archdiocese On 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the Fifth Lateran Council, Pope Leo X removed the diocese of Turin from metropolitan obedience of Milan, and made Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of Mondovì and Ivrea as its suffragans, other sees being added later.Semeria, p. 265. On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop Giovanni Francesco della Rovere, notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060. In the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the Waldensian sectSemeria, pp. 161-164. and of Calvinism. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, John Calvin himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee. The Council of Trent called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism. Archbishop Girolamo della Rovere, in 1566, engaged in a public disputation with the Protestants of the Piedmont and was victorious, which was greeted with great satisfaction by the Duke. In 1567, he conducted a visitation of the valley of the Stura, and preached to and conversed with many Protestants who had come into Piedmont from France, again with some success.Semeria, p. 287. During his episcopacy, Duke Emanuele Filiberto brought to Turin from his castle in Chambéry the Holy Shroud, the personal property of his family, and, on 29 December 1590, the body of St Maurice, the martyr.Semeria, pp. 338-341. At the conclusion of the wars between France and Savoy with the Peace of Cateau Cambresis and the French withdrawal, in 1563 the permanent principal residence of the Dukes of Savoy became the city of Turin. The university was moved from Mondovì, where it had retreated during the French occupation. A Jesuit college was opened in Turin in 1567 with an annual subsidy from the Duke, and the Jesuit Collegio dei Nobili in 1572. In 1577, Archbishop della Rovere began the construction of the church Santi Martiri for the Jesuits in Turin.Semeria, p. 288-289. Cardinal Gerolamo della Rovere (1564-1592) had the rare honor of dying while in Conclave in Rome to elect a successor to Pope Innocent IX (Facchinetti). He died on 25 January 1592.G. Cappelletti, Le chiese d'Italia XIV (Venezia: Stabilimento nazionale 1858), pp. 68-69. From 1713 to 1727, owing to difficulties with the Holy See, the See of Turin remained vacant. After 1848, Archbishop Luigi Fransoni (1832–62) became notable for his opposition to the Piedmontese government's reform program led by Count Camillo Cavour, first as Minister of Agriculture, then as Minister of Finance, and finally in 1852, as Prime Minister of Savoy. At the same time the Risorgimento and the operations of Giuseppe Garibaldi had brought about a revolution in Rome, which drove Pope Pius IX into exile. Piedmontese policy called for a reform of the rights of the Church, especially of the regular clergy. Fransoni's vocal reaction to these events and policies helped to stimulate the already widespread anticlericalism in Italy,Manuel Borutta, \\"Anti-Catholicism and the Culture War in Risorgimento Italy,\\" in: and he found himself forced to leave Turin and Italy in 1852 for exile under French protection. Cathedral and Chapter Cathedral of Turin The circumstances of the founding of the original cathedral of Turin are obscure. It is conjectured that the building was the work of the first Bishop, Maximus, which would place the date around the beginning of the 5th century.Rondolino, pp. 9-10. It was constituted of three interconnected churches, San Salvatore, San Giovanni Battista, and Santa Maria. Bishop Guido Canale (1319–1348) found it necessary to completely reconstruct the Chapel of San Michele in the Cathedral, which he endowed.Semeria, p. 195. With the old cathedral in a state of collapse, Bishop Domenico della Rovere (1482–1501) had the cathedral rebuilt in the 1490s, to designs by Meo (Amadeo) del Caprina da Settignano of Florence. Demolition began in May 1491. Cardinal della Rovere visited Turin in 1496 to inspect the progress of the works. The new cathedral was consecrated on 21 September 1505 by Bishop Giovanni Ludovico della Rovere. The existence of a college of Canons in Turin is very old. A diploma of Emperor Henry III of 1047 attributes them to Bishop Regimir in the mid-ninth century.Savio, p. 320. Semeria, pp. 406-407. Colleges of Canons were being created at cathedrals in accordance with the French Council of Aquisgranda (816) and the Roman council of Pope Eugene II (826). The Cathedral Chapter consisted of five dignities and twenty Canons and twenty prebends. The dignities were: the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Treasurer, the Archpriest, and the Primicerius (Cantor). In addition there were five officials called Trinitatis.Ughelli, p. 1021. The earliest known Provost was Walpert in 890.Bosio, p. 1775, who labels Walpert a 'diacono cardinale'. The earliest known Archdeacon was Ansprand, who signed a document in 863.Bosio, p. 1784. The earliest known Archpriest was Erchempert, Sanctae Taurinensis Ecclesiae Archipresbyter Cardinalis.Bosio, p. 1800. The earliest known Primicerius (Cantor) was Adalwert, who signed a document in 890 Sancte Taurinensis Ecclesie Diaconus Cardinalis Cantor.Bosio, p. 1805. The Provost and Primicerius subscribe a document of Bishop Milo in 1185.Chiuso, p. 435. The office of Treasurer was established by a bull of Pope Sixtus IV of 15 January 1472.Bosio, p. 1794. In 1690 there were twenty-nine Canons.Ritzler- Sefrin, V, p. 370 note 1. In 1744, there were six dignities and twenty Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 395 note 1. In addition to the Cathedral Chapter, there were seven Collegiate Churches in the diocese, which had Chapters of Canons. At Carmagnola there was a Chapter of an Archpriest and nine Canons. At Chieri, at S. Maria della Scala there were an Archpriest, a Cantor, and ten Canons. In Courgnè there was a Provost and six Canons. In Giaveno, at San Lorenzo, there was a Provost and eight Canons. In Moncalieri, at Santa Maria della Scala, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost and six Canons. At Santa Maria di Rivoli, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost, an Archpriest, a Cantor, and five Canons. At Savigliano, at S. Andrea, founded in 1028, which was in charge of four parishes, there was a college of Canons Regular; Pope Clement XII secularized the Canons, who were thereafter sixteen in number (of whom one was the Penitentiary), presided over by an Abbot, an Archpriest and a Primicerius.Cappelletti, pp. 72-73 Seminary The seminary of the diocese of Turin was established by Cardinal Girolamo della Rovere on 4 June 1567, in accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent. Since 1988, the seminary has been located in a building that once belonged to the Suore Fedele Compagne di Gesu. The old building became the Minor Seminary in 1992.Diocesi di Torino, Seminari; retrieved: 07-14-2018. Synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. John Paul II, Constitutio Apostolica de Synodis Dioecesanis Agendis (March 19, 1997): Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), pp. 706-727. The Diocese di Torino maintains a list of diocesan synods on its website.Diocesi di Torino, Sinodi; retrieved: 13 July 2018. The list is derived ultimately from Antonio Bosio's notes to Josephus Franciscus Myranesius' De Episcopis et Archiepiscopis Taurinensibus in: Savio, pp. 281-282, warns of Myranesio's habit of falsifying documents, charters, and inscriptions. The earliest known diocesan synod is that of Bishop Boso, who also attended a provincial synod in Milan in December 1125; no records survive.Savio, p. 356. Schwartz, p. 134. Another synod was held by Bishop Giovanni Arborio on 26 October 1246. Bishop Goffredo di Montanaro presided at a diocesan synod which was held in S. Salvatore de Domno on Wednesday, 14 May 1270.The text is published by Bosio, pp. 1728-1735. The contents are standard synodal regulations, especially for the conduct of the clergy and the proper administration of the sacraments. Bishop Goffredo presided over a second synod on 16 May 1276 in S. Salvatore de Domno; its acts survive.Bosio, pp. 1735-1736. It established a fixed time for a synod to meet, on the Tuesday before Rogation Days (Quatuor Temporum), and forbade persons from ordering their tombs in any other place than where their ancestors were buried. The synod also adapted several canons from a synod at Lyon concerning usury. It was required of all clergy to read the constitutions of the synod in their churches on three successive Sundays after the synod. Synods also took place in 1332, 1335, 1339, 1351, 1368, 1403, 1428, 1448, 1465, 1467, 1469, and 1500. In 1502 a collection of twelve Constitutions of synods was published.Bosio, pp. 1736-1737. There were synods in 1514, 1575,Semeria, p. 288, provides details. 1597, 1606, 1608, 1610, 1614, 1624, and 1633. A diocesan synod was held by Archbishop Giulio Cesare Bergera (1643-1660) in 1647. On 28 May 1670 Archbishop Michele Beggiamo (1662-1689) held a diocesan synod.Synodus Dioecesana Taurinensis habita in Ecclesia Metropolitana ab. lII.mo ac Rev.mo Domino Michaele Beyamo Archiep.

A synod was held by Archbishop Gian Francesco Arborio di Gattinara (1727-1743) on 1–3 May 1729. Archbishop Giambattista Roero di Pralormo (1744-1766) held his first diocesan synod on 21 and 22 April 1755. Archbishop Vittorio Maria Costa d'Arignano (1778-1796) held a diocesan synod on 20–22 August 1788. Archbishop Lorenzo Gastaldi held several synods, in 1873, 1874, 1875, 1878, and 1880. There was then a lapse of more than a century, until Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini held one in 1994, and another in 1997.

Still Creek's path lies mainly through the industrial area which contributes to its high level of pollution, although through dedicated work of local volunteers the creek is slowly recovering.\\"Wild in the City\\" by Dan Hilborn, from BurnabyNow.com In 2006, the City of Burnaby approved a plan to reduce the amount of flooding in the Still Creek watershed (the low-lying area of Gilmore Avenue is heavily flooded every year) while improving fish and wildlife habitat. There is considerable vegetation along the creek banks that serves as a habitat for great blue heron, red-tailed hawk, belted kingfisher, and even an occasional pheasant, as well as aquatic songbirds such as red-winged blackbird. Beavers have always maintained their presence while river otters are more recent inhabitants. Coastal cutthroat trout are gradually returning. In November 2012, for the first time in almost 80 years, numerous full-sized salmon have been observed returning to spawn in many parts of Still Creek. Course Still Creek arises in western Burnaby, just north of Central Park. From there it flows northwest into Vancouver, and then north. For years, the entire stretch from Central Park to 29th Avenue has been culverted as part of the City of Vancouver's storm sewer system. Across the street from the 29th Avenue Station, the creek emerges into the open, and runs north along the bottom of the Renfrew Ravine. After running under the intersection of 22nd Avenue and Renfrew Street, the creek runs through the park beside the Renfrew Community Centre. It then is culverted again for several blocks, emerging just before the Grandview Highway, where it turns east, towards Burnaby. From Renfrew Street in Vancouver to Gilmore in Burnaby, Still Creek has been channelized for most of its length, and culverted for the rest. East of Gilmore, the creek has been left in a mostly natural channel, and for the last kilometre or so before Burnaby Lake, the land on either side of the creek has been protected from development. Tributaries Still Creek is the main stream draining the western half of the Brunette watershed. As such, it has many tributaries. The following are the most significant: *Chubb Creek - Shortened by development, Chubb Creek currently begins at the Lougheed Highway, just east of Boundary Road in Burnaby, and runs southeast, under Gilmore at Gilmore Station, and enters Still Creek underground a couple hundred metres further southeast. *Guichon Creek - Guichon Creek arises in the hills south of the Still Creek valley, and runs north, across the campus of the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), entering Still Creek just west of Willingdon Avenue. *Beecher Creek - Beecher Creek arises in North Burnaby, and flows south, through a ravine, under the Lougheed Highway, and enters Still Creek west of Holdom. *Spring Brook - Spring Brook runs north east of Boundary Road and joins Still Creek just west of Gilmore Station.

It is based upon the 1977 science fiction short story of the same name by Alice Sheldon (under the alias Raccoona Sheldon), credited in the film as James Tiptree, Jr. Many of the scenes in Sam Hamm's script are expansions of single lines in this epistolary story. Director Joe Dante read the story in the 1980s and had wanted to make a film version ever since. He presented the story as straight horror, eschewing his usual humor and without using his usual company of stock actors. Jason Priestley and Elliott Gould were the stars. When interviewed while shooting the film in Vancouver, the director summarized it: Plot When a virus overcomes the male population of the world and turns them into murderous psychopaths, a mother and daughter escape across a country where their safety is in question. Over the summer, a series of femicides break out all over the world, which comes to the notice of Anne Alstein (Kerry Norton), whose husband Alan (Jason Priestley) is working alongside Barney (Elliott Gould) on the solution to an insect problem in the rain forest. The two have a daughter, Amy (Brenna O'Brien). Their friend/epidemiologist Bella Sartiano (Linda Darlow) leaves for Jacksonville, Florida, where a large group of femicides took place. She interviews an infected U.S. Army soldier, Private William Holicky (Steve Lawlor), who savagely murdered a stripper at a club. The aggression is linked to sexual arousal, and many of the infected men use extremist religious rhetoric to justify the murders. Bella discovers that tens of thousands of similar murders are happening elsewhere in the world, but is attacked and killed by the infected mayor. Before her death, Bella informed Barney of the epidemic. Barney and Alan head to Washington D.C. to brief officials on whether the cause of the condition is natural or bioterrorism. The only way to avoid it is chemical castration, with the alternative being actual castration. The reception is skeptical and indignant; one general bluntly declares he will oppose this drastic solution, thereby ensuring his troops will turn on female personnel and civilians once they become infected. Barney takes the shot but Alan refuses, stating he'll be fine with pills, until he begins to have dreams of killing Anne. On the plane ride home, Alan witnesses two murders and realizes that every man on the plane is infected, himself included. He calls his wife and daughter to say goodbye, telling them that he won't be himself. In September, Anne and Amy have continued on to Canada with other women. The two encounter the infected Alan, who sexually assaults his daughter until Anne shoots him in the legs. At Alan's struggling insistence, they escape, but Amy, not understanding the situation, returns to Alan, and Anne arrives too late to save her. It is presumed that she was forced to kill Alan. Having gone unconscious, Anne wakes up in a hospital where a rash of murders are being inflicted on the female patients. Barney and Anne escape, and Anne wears a \\"man\\" disguise to hide herself from the infected males. She overhears a conversation between two men, revealing that the area's female population has been wiped out. It is implied that the adult men turn on the less-masculine boys next, killing them off as well. Forced to live out in a simple camping tent during a harsh winter, Barney soon falls ill. Barney encourages Anne to survive no matter what, as mankind still has a chance with a female survivor. Over the winter, Barney dies peacefully. Anne tries to escape hunters who discover her; as she flees, the source of the epidemic is discovered. Bright aliens formed of light are the culprits, using alien technology to create the femicide epidemic. They kill the hunters that pursued Anne, apparently to take some of their brain matter, and she escapes into the woods. By December, all female life on Earth is presumed to have been exterminated, leaving the infected men to slowly die off. Production The film was shot using a digital camera for the first time. The director chose this experimental technique especially to give the film a different look. Jason Priestley explained his interpretation of the motivation of the scientist Alan, stating: Release The film was screened at the 24th Turin Film Festival. The DVD was released on June 12, 2007. Reception Michael Gingold of Fangoria magazine, awarded the film three skulls for its \\"stinging mix of sociopolitical commentary and traditional horror mayhem\\". The political message was seen as a link between religious fervor and misogyny with special reference to Muslim fundamentalism. The effect of violent horror movies upon men within the story was thought to be witty self-reference though the overall tone was considered \\"deadly serious\\". The lead actor, Jason Priestley, was thought to have been weaker than the role required while the performances of Kerry Norton, as Alan's wife Anne, and Brenna O'Brien, as her daughter Amy, were thought sympathetic and more effective. Peter Brown of iF magazine felt that the presentation of the main feature was too rushed and would have been better at 1.5 to 2 hours rather than the 58 minutes allowed by the 1 hour format. Also the denouement was revealed too soon and so suspense was lacking in the second half. He thought that the DVD extras were interesting, providing Joe Dante's account of the conversion from the short story and details of the effects used for the aliens in the story. Overall, his rating for this DVD was C.

Furuseth started his career in the local club Eik-Tønsberg, before he played for Brann, Örebro, Hammarby, Stabæk, Viborg and FC Midtjylland. Furuseth announced his retirement from football in August 2008, but made a comeback five months later in Lyn. He later had spell with Swedish clubs Assyriska and Hammarby, before he returned to Norway where he has been playing and coaching at amateur level. Career Furuseth was born in Tønsberg, and played for the local team IL Flint during his youth. He played four matches for the Norwegian under-15 team in 1994, and one match for the under-16 the next year. Furuseth transferred to the Norwegian First Division side Eik-Tønsberg in 1996. He played his first matches for Eik in 1997, and played a total of 68 league-games for the club.Petter Furuseth on Playerhistory.com After Eik was relegated in 2000, Furuseth transferred to SK Brann. He made his debut in Tippeligaen against Moss on 16 April 2001, and scored a total of 10 goals in 26 games in his first season at Brann. Furuseth stayed in Brann for three seasons, before he moved to Sweden and Örebro SK. During the first half of the 2004 season, Olsen was a great attraction in the Allsvenskan, and it did not take long until he caught the eye of Hammarby. In September 2004, a Örebro in heavy debts was forced to sell him to league rivals Hammarby IF. In Stockholm, Furuseth Olsen was transformed from striker to right winger, and was awarded \\"Player of the year 2006\\" by the Hammarby- fans. In October 2006, Furuseth Olsen made it clear that if he were to leave Hammarby and Sweden, he would return to Norway to gain a spot on the Norway national team. He transferred to Stabæk Fotball ahead of the 2007-season, but because of a conflict with Daniel Nannskog and the other players, he only played 4 matches for Stabæk and signed for the Danish Viborg in June 2007. The following winter, Furuseth transferred to FC Midtjylland, but after three rounds of the 2008–09-season he asked to be released the contract and decided to retire. Furuseth decided to make comeback in January 2009, and signed a two-year contract with Lyn. He was transferred from FC Midtjylland, still formally his employer, for an undisclosed fee. Furuseth played only two matches for Lyn in Tippeligaen during the first half of the season, and he was loaned out to Assyriska so that Lyn, a club with mayor economic difficulties, could save some wage-expenses. On 10 March 2010, his contract with Lyn was terminated by mutual consent, and Furuseth moved back to Hammarby. Furuseth moved back to Norway again, and was signed by Moss as a playing assistant coach in February 2012, where he was working under the command of Tor Thodesen, the coach who signed Furuseth from Eik-Tønsberg to Brann in 2000. Furuseth left Moss in August 2012, citing personal reasons, and joined his old club Eik in the Third Division two weeks later, where he was a part of the coaching staff. Ahead of the 2013 season, Furuseth joined Husøy & Foynland IF as a player-coach.

Le Quien contemplated issuing this work as early as 1722, and had made a contract with the printer Simart (Revue de l'Orient latin, 1894, II, 190). In editing it, he used the notes of the Benedictine Abel-Louis de Sainte-Marthe, who had projected an \\"Orbis Christianus\\", and had obligingly handed him over his notes on the Orient and Africa. The \\"Oriens Christianus\\", as projected by Le Quien, was to comprise not only the hierarchy of the four Greek and Latin patriarchates of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, and that of the Jacobite, Melkite, Nestorian, Maronite, and Armenian patriarchates, but also the Greek and Latin texts of the various Notitiae episcopatuum, a catalogue of the Eastern and African monasteries, and also the hierarchy of the African Church. The last three parts of this gigantic project were set aside by Le Quien's literary heirs. His notes on Christian Africa and its monasteries have never been used at least in their entirety. * \\"Abrégé de l'histoire de Boulogne-sur- Mer et ses comtes\\" in Desmolets, \\"Mémoires de littérature\\", X (Paris, 1749), 36-112.

II (1905), available online at http://www.onlinebiographies.info/va/v2/moncure-rcl.htm  Early years  Born at the family estate \\"Clermont\\" in Stafford County, Virginia, in 1805 to one of the First Families of Virginia, Richard Cassius Lee Moncure was the great grandson of Rev. John Moncure, a Scottish Huguenot immigrant and longtime rector of Overwharton parish and friend of George Washington, George Mason and other founding fathers.Representative Men of the South, p. 435 available at https://books.google.com/books?id=CA8yAQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA435&lpg;=PA435&dq; His father and grandfather were both named John Moncure and active in the affairs of what was renamed Aquia Parish. His mother Alice Peachy Gaskins (1774-1860) bore ten children, of whom Richard Cassius Lee was the seventh child and fourth son. He received his early education in the local schools and read extensively.  Career  After his admission to the bar in 1825, Moncure practiced in Fredericksburg and surrounding counties. In 1849, he entered politics and won election to the legislature, which was then engaged in extensive revision of the state's legal code. He was appointed to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to replace Francis Taliaferro Brooke in 1851, but when the Virginia Constitution was changed that year, popular election to that court became required. Moncure was one of the five judges elected under that new Constitution. Although some questioned the validity of the wartime Constitution of 1864 (by delegates from Union-controlled areas, including Moncure's home Stafford County), Moncure also won election as one of three Court of Appeals judges elected under that constitution, and his fellows selected him as that Court's President in 1865. Active on the vestry of St. George's Episcopal Church (Fredericksburg, Virginia) and in the Diocese of Virginia for four decades, Moncure held seven slaves during the 1850 census and 14 slaves during the 1860 census. Before the American Civil War, Moncure was a relative moderate on the appellate court, vehemently dissenting from the decisions in 'Bailey v. Poindexter's Executor,' 55 Va. 132, 14 Gratton 132 (1858) and 'Williamson v. Coalter,' 14 Gratton 394 (1858),Moncure Conway, Autobiography pp. 38-39 available at google books both of which postdated the Dred Scott decision and declared testamentary manumissions void because a majority of Moncure's colleagues decided slaves were legally incapable of choosing freedom (although even preceding generations of Virginia judges, including John Marshall had used similar choice language in their wills). His tenure of office was temporarily suspended, however, during the Reconstruction period, from 1866 to 1869, when Major General John Schofield enforced a federal law prohibiting men with a record of service to the Confederate States of America to hold public office. Virginia also adopted a new state Constitution in 1869 (with voter ratification) which unlike the 1851 Constitution prohibited slavery. It also re-instituted election of judges by the state legislature. Thus legislators again elected Judge Moncure to a twelve-year term in 1870, and his fellows again selected him as the Court's President.John Randolph Tucker, Reminiscences of Virginia Judges and Jurists, vol. 95, p.5, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg09AAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA5&lpg;=PA5&dq;  Family  He married Mary Washington Conway (1807-1890) on December 29, 1825, and that year also bought Glencairne Farm, at which the couple lived the rest of their lives. They had thirteen children, eleven surviving to adulthood. At least three of their sons served as Confederate officers (John Conway Moncure, Thomas Gascoigne Moncure and Walter Peyton Moncure) the eldest of whom became Speaker of the Louisiana house and judge in Shreveport, Louisiana.Louise Peaquet du Bellet, Some Prominent Virginia Families (2005) p. 443 His grandson Richard Henry Lee Chichester also became a justice of the Virginia Supreme Court.

Served as Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport in the Flemish Government from 2004 until 2009, he was also Minister for relations with the Brussels-Capital Region and the Brussels Parliament (). Political career Volksunie (1987–1998) Anciaux was born into a political family. His father was chairman of the Volksunie (VU), a nationalist party, from 1979 until 1985. Bert first held office as a councilman in the City of Brussels in 1987, and in 1991 became a member of the provincial council of Flemish Brabant. He became chairman of the Volksunie in 1992, serving until 1998. From 1995 to 1999 he sat in the Belgian Senate. Volksunie-iD21 (1998–2001) Following the 1998 White Marches provoked by the publication of official reports on the Affaire Dutroux, Anciaux founded the think-tank, later political group, iD21, which aimed to confront the corruption and incompetence which the Dutroux affair had brought to light. In the 1999 Belgian general election, the combined Volksunie-iD21 list gained 8% of the vote, up from around 5% in 1995. Anciaux was elected to the European Parliament. Spirit / Flemish Progressives (2001–2009) With the collapse of the Volksunie in 2001, split between left and right factions led by Anciaux and Geert Bourgeois which became Spirit and New-Flemish Alliance (NV-A) respectively. A number of iD21 members joined Agalev, the Flemish green party, rather than Spirit. At this time, Anciaux acquired the nickname \\"The Whiner\\" as he broke out in tears every so often. In 2002 Anciaux stepped down as Minister for Culture in the Flemish government. Following the 2003 Federal election, where Anciaux and Spirit ran in a cartel with Socialist Party Different (SP.a), he was appointed Federal transport minister. In July 2004, he resigned this post and returned to his present position as Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport in Flanders. SP.A (2009–present) In 2008 he left his party and has expressed the desire to launch a new \\"Social Project\\". He then joined the Flemish social-democratic party SP.a.

Some manufacturers want to capture online markets for their brands but do not want to create conflicts with their other distribution channels. The Census Bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce reported that online sales in 2005 grew 24.6 percent over 2004 to reach 86.3 billion.U.S. Dept of Commerce 2004 Report By comparison, total retail sales in 2005 grew 7.2 percent from 2004. These numbers made the online marketplace attractive to manufacturers, but raised the question of how to participate without harming existing channel relationships. According to Forrester Research and Gartner from 2007, despite the rapid growth of online commerce, an estimated 90 percent of manufacturers did not sell their products online. Of these, 66 percent identified channel conflict as their single biggest issue. However, results from a survey show that click-and-mortar businesses have an 80% greater chance of sustaining a business model during a three-year period than those operating just in one of the two channels. E-commerce is the most popular second distribution channel because of its low overhead expenses and communication costs. This advantage is also a disadvantage, since consumers can also communicate less expensively and more easily with one another in the online marketplace. Therefore, price and product differentiation is more challenging in online markets.Marmorstein, H., Rossomme, J., Sarel, D., (2003) \\"Unleashing the power of yield management in the internet era\\", California Management Review, vol. 45, No 3, pp 1-22 Channel conflict can also occur when there has been over production. This results in a surplus of products. Newer versions of products, changes in trends, insolvency of wholesalers and retailers and the distribution of damaged goods also affect channel conflict. In this connection, a company's stock clearance strategy is important. To avoid a channel conflict in a click- and-mortar business, it is necessary to ensure that both traditional and online channels are fully integrated. This reduces possible confusion with customers while providing the business benefits of a dual channel.Simons, L.P.A., Bouwman, H., (2006) \\"Designing a marketing channel mix\\", International Journal of Information Technology and Management, vol. 5, No 4, pp 229-248 Kaplan, S., Sawnhey, M., (2000) \\"E-Hubs: the new B2B marketplaces\\", Harvard BusinessMarkides, C., D. Charitou, C., (2004) \\"Competing with dual business models: A contingency approach\\", Academy of Management Executive, vol.18, No3, pp 22-36Kaplan, S., Sawnhey, M., (2000) \\"E-Hubs: the new B2B marketplaces\\", Harvard Business Review, May–June, pp. 97-103Chiang, W.K., Chhajed, D., Hess, J.D., (2002) \\"Direct Marketing, Indirect Profits: A Strategic Analysis of Dual-Channel Supply-Chain Design\\", Management Science, vol 00, No. 00, pp. 1–20 Manufacturers today sell their products through a broad array of channels. Since most manufacturers sell through several channels simultaneously, channels sometimes find themselves competing to reach the same set of customers. When this happens, channel conflict is virtually guaranteed. In turn, such conflict almost invariably finds its way back to the manufacturer. This can also be termed as a situation when a producer or supplier bypasses the normal channel of distribution and sells directly to the end user. Selling over the Internet while maintaining a physical distribution network is an example of channel conflict. :Channel conflict comes in many forms. Some are mild, merely the necessary friction of a competitive business environment. Some are actually positive for the manufacturer, forcing out-of- date or uneconomic players to adapt or decline. Other conflicts, however, can undermine the manufacturer's business model. Such high-risk conflicts generally occur when one channel targets customer segments already served by an existing channel. This leads to such a deterioration of channel economics that the threatened channel either retaliates against the manufacturer or simply stops selling its product. The result is disintermediation, in which the manufacturer suffers. :The two main disintermediation causes are finance and internet.  Finance  Elimination of financial intermediaries (banks, brokers) between the suppliers of funds (savers/investors) and the users of funds (borrowers/investees). Disintermediation occurs when inflation rates are high but bank interest rates are stagnant and the bank depositors can get better returns by investing in mutual funds or in securities. Internet  Elimination (by the online sources) of the traditional intermediary between the seller and the buyer (such as an agent, broker, or reseller), or between the source and the recipient of information (such as an agency, official, or gate keeper).  Type of channel conflicts  There are two types of channel conflicts.  Vertical channel conflicts  Vertical conflict occurs when a manufacturer's action disrupts the supply chain. For example, a manufacturer who normally distributes its products through retail would cause a vertical channel conflict if they start doing direct mail and advertise directly to consumers.  Horizontal channel conflicts  Horizontal conflict occurs among firms at the same level of the channel. For example, two franchises who open two restaurants across the street from each other would be in a horizontal conflict or when one firm in a distribution channel offers lower prices than the members of the distribution channel and therefore attract more customers.  So what do the manufacturers have to do?  Resource dependence theoryResource dependence theory (e.g., Hillman et al. 2009; Pfeffer 1987; Pfeffer and Salancik 1978; Ulrich and Barney 1984) emphasizes the need for organizations to formulate strategies to enhance their power positions and reduce their environmental dependence in order to achieve sustainable competitiveness.the findings of a research about power-dependence and reseller influence on SME's continued use of online direct sales channels illustrate that, to reduce the negative impact of power-dependence imbalance, SMEs should strive to reshape and strengthen their power-dependence position relative to their resellers. For instance, SMEs can strengthen their power- dependence position by providing differentiated service support to better cater to resellers’ needs and by reinforcing their unique values to create mutual dependence between an SME and its resellers.Frazier, G. 1983. “On the measurement of interfirm power in channels of distribution.” Journal of Marketing Research 20(2): 158–166.Skinner, S. J., and J. P. Guiltinan. 1985. “Extra-network linkages, dependence, and power.” Social Forces 64:702–7131985. SMEs may also strive to improve their power-dependence position through the improvement of their power among other suppliers of the resellers. Research on power imbalance and power use suggests that a reseller's tolerance level toward a supplier is greatly determined by the supplier's relative power position relative to the reseller's alternative suppliersMollenkopf, D. A., E. Rabinovich, T.M. Laseter, and K. K. Boyer. 2007. “Managing Internet product returns: A focus on effective service operations.” Decision Sciences 38(2):215–250. On the other hand, recent studies have shown that we have to use retailers in order to provide an integrated journey for customer to decision, because at the evaluate stage of Consumer Decision Journey, consumers didn't start with search engines; rather, they went directly to Amazon.com and other retail sites that, with their rich and expanding array of product-comparison information, consumer and expert ratings, and visuals, were becoming the most important influencers.Edelman, D.

The remaining versions based on the original are located at Magic Kingdom Park, Tokyo Disneyland and at Disneyland Park in Disneyland Paris. The walk-through attraction is centered on a giant treehouse where everyone can hear and see various scenes based on the Disney film Swiss Family Robinson. History Tokyo Disneyland The Swiss Family Treehouse opened November 18, 1962, in Adventureland at Disneyland, two years after the Disney film Swiss Family Robinson (1960). Imagineer Bill Martin worked out the treehouse's design; Disney animator Wolfgang Reitherman, who designed the treehouse for the movie, contributed. At tall and wide, constructed of concrete and reinforced steel, the attraction weighed 150 tons. The tree species was humorously dubbed \\"Disneyodendron semperflorens grandis -- large, everblooming Disney tree.\\" John Mills, who played Father Robinson in the movie, and his daughter Hayley appeared at the attraction's opening. The attraction was a walk-through rather than a ride, in which visitors walked up 68 steps in the trunk of the tree through various \\"rooms\\" designed on the theme of the movie, with items and structures made to appear salvaged from a 19th-century shipwreck and desert island finds. When it opened, the attraction required a C ticket. The attraction originally opened with reddish brown leaves. However, the red leaves faded very easily in the sun and were eventually switched to green leaves sometime during the early 1960s. When the Magic Kingdom opened at Walt Disney World Resort on October 1, 1971, the Swiss Family Treehouse was one of the original attractions of Adventureland. The tree, while intended to look real, is actually made up of steel, concrete, and stucco, stretching tall and wide. Similarly, when Euro Disneyland (now Disneyland Paris) opened on April 12, 1992, it featured a version of the attraction located in Adventureland, named La Cabane des Robinson. Tokyo Disneyland also has a Swiss Family Treehouse which opened in 1993, ten years after the park's debut. In March 1999, the original attraction at Disneyland was closed.

History 1950-1975 The Maria Clara Awards was established in 1950 by The Manila Times. However, it was criticized for being judged only by movie outsiders. In response, a group of writers established the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Awards (FAMAS Awards) in 1952. In 1975, the first Metropolitan Film Festival was held in commemoration of the third anniversary of the continuation of Martial Law. 1975-1990 From 1952 to 1976, the FAMAS was the sole award-giving body for film in the Philippines. On May 1, 1976, a group of nine film critics and writers formed the Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino (English: Filipino Film Critics), an organization aiming at giving recognition to Filipino film achievements through the eyes of a film critic. The MPP formed the Gawad Urian Awards, the first award-giving body to contest the long-reigning FAMAS Awards. The Gawad Urian gave a Philippine equivalent to the New York Film Critics Circle Awards. This organization was also created after the first tie in lead categories was recorded in 21st FAMAS Awards in 1973. It was in the Best Actress category, in which both Boots Anson-Roa and Vilma Santos won. In 1977, the Metropolitan Film Festival was changed to its current name, Metro Manila Film Festival. During the commercialist era of movies in the 1980s, more award-giving bodies have sprung up to honor film achievements. In 1981, President Ferdinand Marcos passed Executive Order 640-A, which established the Film Academy of the Philippines, the Philippines' official counterpart of the United States' Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The FAP handed out the first Luna Awards (then called the FAP Award until 2005) in 1983 to honor film achievements in 1982. In addition, the Catholic Church also established the Catholic Mass Media Awards. In 1985, the Philippine Movie Press Club initiated the Star Awards for Movies and Television, which is currently the Philippines' Golden Globes' counterpart. Under the auspices of First Lady Imelda Marcos, the first Filipino international film festival was held in 1982: the Manila International Film Festival. This prestigious festival opened at the Manila Film Center. Grand Slam During the 1980s, the term grand slam became popular. The Philippine grand slam is an unofficial moniker given to an actor or actress who had won the following awards: FAMAS Awards, Gawad Urian, CMMA and FAP Awards (became Luna Awards in 2005) in one year. CMMA though stopped giving acting awards by 1990 while Star Awards started giving their awards in 1985. The moniker was first earned by actress Vilma Santos in 1983 when she won the FAMAS, Gawad Urian, CMMA and FAP Awards for her performance in the Ishmael Bernal film Relasyon. 1990-present The number of film award-giving bodies in the Philippines grew beginning in the 1990s. Several university scholars and teachers formed their own awards, beginning with the Young Critics Circle in 1990, with members coming from various disciplines of the country's top universities.http://yccfilmdesk.wordpress.com/2014/02/08/porno-named-young- critics-circles-best-film-of-2013/ Gawad Pasado and Gawad Tanglaw followed suit in 1998 and 2002, respectively. In 2003, several members of the PMPC formed a breakaway group called the Entertainment Press Society and started handing out awards - the Golden Screen Awards - in 2004.

After his arrest in 1977, Fratianno become an informant and entered the Witness Protection Program in 1980. He admitted to having killed five people. Later in life, he became a writer. Early life Fratianno was born in Naples, Italy, in 1913, later immigrating with his family to the United States, settling near Cleveland, Ohio. He was first arrested at the age of 19, on suspicion of rape, but was not charged. Two years later, he was acquitted of robbery charges, but in 1937, was convicted of robbery and spent more than seven years in an Ohio state prison. Fratianno earned his nickname \\"Weasel\\" as a boy when from running from the police in the Little Italy section of Cleveland. A chase witness shouted \\"Look at that weasel run!\\" and the police quickly attached the nickname to his criminal record, falsely believing it was his alias. He was paroled in 1945, and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he associated with underworld figure Mickey Cohen. In 1951, he was arrested but later released in connection with the gangland-style slaying of two mobsters believed to have plotted to kill Cohen. In 1954, Fratianno was convicted of attempted extortion; he served 6 years and 3 months, mostly at San Quentin State Prison. In 1968, he pleaded guilty to charges stemming from phony pay agreements with drivers at a trucking company he owned, and in 1971 he entered another guilty plea, this time for extortion. Fratianno married Jean in 1975, whom he had met in an airport in 1966. International connections Fratianno was known to have global connections. One such connection was with Australian organised crime figures. In 1976, Australian criminal Murray Riley met with Fratianno in San Francisco, allegedly, to organize drug shipments.Bob Bottom (1984). Without Fear or Favour (pp. 74–75). Victoria, Australia: Sun Books. The same year, Sydney businessman Bela Csidei also met with Fratianno in San Francisco.Bob Bottom (1984). Without Fear or Favour (p.75).

Fratianno also associated with Australian/Hungarian transport magnate and managing director of Thomas Nationwide Transport, Peter Abeles.Tony Reeves (2007). Mr Sin: The Abe Saffron Dossier (pp. 83–85). NSW, Australia: Allen & Unwin. Through Fratianno's connections with Teamsters and Longshoremen's unions, particularly with Rudy Tham, a San Francisco Teamsters leader, Abeles was able to use his company to smuggle drugs in and out of the U.S., as well as reduce industrial tensions on the waterfront.John Pilger (1992).

In 1975, the boss of the Los Angeles family, Dominic Brooklier, was sent to prison, and Louis Tom Dragna was made acting boss. He accepted the position on the condition that he run the family together with Fratianno. Fratianno accepted the proposal with the understanding that he would carry the majority of the responsibility.Demaris, Ovid. The Last Mafioso: The Treacherous World of Jimmy Fratianno. Bantam Books, 1981, p.284 Soon after, he was approached by Dragna in regards to having Frank Bompensiero murdered.Demaris, Ovid. The Last Mafioso: The Treacherous World of Jimmy Fratianno. Bantam Books, 1981, p.295 Bompensiero was one of the few made men that Fratianno trusted, as they were old friends, and he was infuriated that the Los Angeles family would give him such a 'contract'. At this point Fratianno felt that he was tricked into becoming Acting Boss, a position which required him to be transferred from the Chicago Outfit back to the Los Angeles family. Because of his close relationship with Bompensiero, it was assumed that Fratianno could easily lay a trap and murder him. Fratianno stalled until the contract was given to other mob associates.Demaris, Ovid. The Last Mafioso: The Treacherous World of Jimmy Fratianno. Bantam Books, 1981, p.298 Brooklier returned from prison in October 1976 after serving 16 months.Demaris, Ovid. The Last Mafioso: The Treacherous World of Jimmy Fratianno. Bantam Books, 1981, p.361 After a transition period he called Fratianno to a meeting some time before February 11, 1977 and announced he was ready to resume his position as Boss. Fratianno was once again a soldier. Last stages of Mafia career Some time between February 11 and May 16, 1977, Brooklier summoned Fratianno to a meeting and confronted him about a rumor that Fratianno was running a separate 'crew' in the Los Angeles territory and saying, \\"Jimmy, you've got a bad mouth, like [Bompensiero]...\\"Demaris, Ovid. The Last Mafioso: The Treacherous World of Jimmy Fratianno. Bantam Books, 1981, p.375 In June 1977, Fratianno learned that Brooklier had started a rumor that he had never made Fratianno Acting Boss and that Fratianno was misrepresenting himself. Fratianno began to suspect that Brooklier was trying to poison his reputation within the Mafia thus laying the groundwork for a sanctioned hit, or execution, of himself.Demaris, Ovid. The Last Mafioso: The Treacherous World of Jimmy Fratianno. Bantam Books, 1981, p.391 Then at the wake for Tony Delsanter, Fratianno learned that the Cleveland family had a connection in the FBI, a clerk, that was feeding them documents about Mafia informants. James Licavoli told him that the Cleveland family had the code numbers for two informants and that the FBI clerk was working on getting their names.Demaris, Ovid. The Last Mafioso: The Treacherous World of Jimmy Fratianno. Bantam Books, 1981, p.395 Government witness and later life On October 6, 1977, Danny Greene was killed by a car bomb in Ohio, and Ray Ferritto was arrested for the murder. Ferritto implicated Fratianno in the planning of the murder, and Fratianno was indicted for charges related to the bombing. Fearing for his safety, Fratianno agreed to become a government witness against the Mafia. In return for his testimony, he pleaded guilty to the murder charges and received a five-year prison sentence, of which he served 21 months. In 1980, after testifying for the government that led to the racketeering convictions of five reputed Mafia figures, Fratianno entered the federal Witness Protection Program. Fratianno claimed that the Mafia had a $100,000 contract on his life.

Neither painting survived.  First version  In his Vita di Leonardo (1568), Vasari reports that, as a very young man, Leonardo represented the head of Medusa on a wooden shield after a request by his father, Ser Piero da Vinci: Although art historians have doubted the veracity of this anecdote, Leonardo's shield (long since lost) has been said to inspire several early 17th-century painters who may have seen it in the collection of Ferdinand I de Medici. Rubens and Caravaggio are known to have painted their own versions of the subject, but their indebtedness to Leonardo's painting (assuming they had seen it) is uncertain and potentially unknowable.  Uffizi painting  Medusa's Head, a Flemish painter, ca. 1600, Uffizi Gallery. In 1782, Leonardo's biographer Luigi Lanzi, while making a search for his paintings in the Uffizi, discovered a depiction of Medusa's head which he erroneously attributed to Leonardo, based on Vasari's description of Leonardo's second version of the subject: Lanzi summed up his opinion on the newly discovered painting in his description of the Florentine gallery: In the period of Romanticism, the reputed Leonardo garnered much praise. Its full-page engravings, first produced in Florence in 1828, spread across Europe, making the painting one of the most popular in Leonardo's corpus of works. In 1851, Jean Baptiste Gustave Planche proclaimed: \\"I do not hesitate to say that in the Medusa of the Uffizi there is the germ of what we admire in the Gioconda of the Louvre\\". As late as 1868, Walter Pater (in The Renaissance) singled out Medusa as one of the most arresting works by Leonardo. In the 20th century, Bernard Berenson and other leading critics argued against Leonardo's authorship of the Uffizi painting. It is now believed to be a work of an anonymous Flemish painter, active ca. 1600. References *Turner, Almond Richard. Inventing Leonardo.

His Charlottesville home, the Judge William J. Robertson House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Robertson prosecuted the trial of John S. Mosby, who was accused of shooting another student. Mosby claimed self-defense, but was convicted and sent to jail. Afterward, Robertson became a friend and mentor to Mosby, who kept a portrait of Robertson on the wall of his home. In 1859, Robertson was elected to the Court of Appeals on which he served until 1865,\\"Judge William Joseph Robertson,\\" in 97 Va. v (1900). when Virginia's post-war governor declined to reappoint him to the reorganized court. In 1860, on the death of Peter V. Daniel, some Virginians lobbied for President James Buchanan to select Robertson for the United States Supreme Court. Returning to private practice, he was attorney in many important cases involving the interests of Virginia and her citizens following the war. Most famous among these was his representation of the Lee family in the Arlington estate case. He also was known as an accomplished railroad lawyer, serving as general counsel for the Norfolk & Western and as a board member of the Chesapeake & Ohio railroads. Judge Robertson was a charter memberCharter of the Virginia State Bar Association, Acts of Assembly 1889-1890, c. 376, published in Report of the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Virginia State Bar Association (1893) (available on Google Books) and the first president of the Virginia Bar Association, whose first annual meeting was held at White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia on August 24 and 25, 1889. In his presidential address, Robertson recommended the merger of law and equity in Virginia civil procedure,. His ideas \\"fell like a thunderbolt on some of his hearers,\\" reported the editor of the Virginia Law Journal, who concluded, \\"I doubt they will recover their serenity in a year.\\" The merger of law and equity in Virginia was accomplished, only partially, more than 100 years after his death.Bryson, W.

Family History and Education Raphael Meldola was descended from an old, Sephardi family originating in the 13th century from Toledo, Spain, and numbering many rabbis and scholars through the generations. His father was a rabbi and also professor of oriental studies at the University of Paris. His grandfather was a haham (senior rabbi) in Pisa. Raphael received a thorough university training, both in theological and in secular studies, and displayed such remarkable talents that when only 15 years old, he was permitted to take his seat in the rabbinical college in Livorno. He received his semicha (rabbinical degree) in 1796 from Rabbi Chaim Yosef David Azulai (commonly referred to as the 'Hida'), and in 1803 became a dayan (rabbinic judge). Rabbinic career In 1805, Meldola was elected haham of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews of Great Britain. He arrived there following a long journey from Livorno on the eve of Rosh Hashana. In his first days, Meldola immediately and energetically embarked on a number of goals. Among them was improved collaboration and cooperation between Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, and he persuaded the two communities to set up a joint board for shechita (ritual slaughtering). Another area he soon took up was to counteract the activities of missionaries. He looked as well to ensure the dignity and proper execution of synagogue prayers—and he introduced what has become one of the most distinctive and appreciated qualities of the Spanish and Portuguese service: its choir. \\"As an Italian,\\" notes one biographer, \\"Meldola had been fond of music and had been the first person to introduce a choir into the London synagogue.\\" Richard Barnett, \\"Haham Meldola and Hazan de Sola,\\" https://www.jstor.org/stable/29777989?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Strong in his beliefs and passionate in his expression of them, Meldola was remembered as \\"kind-hearted man, ever ready to lend a willing ear to tales of distress and to do his utmost to procure assistance.\\" James Picciotto His name will ever be indissolubly associated with that of Bevis Marks Synagogue. Publications Possessed of a remarkably virile mind, Meldola was a dominant factor in the British Jewry of his generation. He was the author of Qorban Minhah (1791) on the duties of the High Priest; Kuppat Hatanim (1796), an instruction manual to bridesgrooms; and Derekh Emunah, published by his son after his death. He left 10 manuscript works, including an exposition of Jewish doctrine, rites, and beliefs. His scholarship attracted around him a circle that included some of the great men of his day, among them Benjamin Disraeli and Isaac D'Israeli; and it is noteworthy that he opposed the policy which produced the famous rupture between the latter and the mahamad. He also maintained a correspondence with many of the most prominent Christian clergymen and scholars of his time; and his acquaintance with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Canon of Windsor led to his being received by King George III. Family Life Meldola married Stella Bollaffi (Abulafia), with whom he had five sons and two daughters. One daughter, Rica, married Hazan David Aaron de Sola who would later succeed Meldola at Bevis Marks. Other descendants include Rabbi Abraham de Sola of the Spanish & Portuguese Synagogue in Montreal; Rabbi Abraham Pereira Mendes, minister of Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island; Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes, minister of Congregation Shearith Israel in New York; Rabbi Frederick de Sola Mendes, minister at the West End Synagogue; Rabbi David de Sola Pool, also a minister at Shearith Israel; and the chemist Raphael Meldola.

Plot Digging to America is a story set in Baltimore, Maryland about two very different families’ experiences with adoption and their relationships with each other. Sami and Ziba Yazdan, an Iranian-American family, and Brad and Bitsy Dickinson-Donaldson, an all- American suburban family, meet at the airport on the day their infant daughters arrive from Korea to begin life in America. The two families become friends and begin a tradition of celebrating the arrival of their adopted daughters each year. The differences between the two families are apparent from the beginning, especially in the way each couple decides to raise their daughters. Brad and Bitsy choose not to Americanize their daughter, Jin-Ho; they keep her Korean name and teach her about Korean culture as she grows up. Sami and Ziba, on the other hand, choose to raise their daughter Susan like other American children. Through the efforts of Bitsy, the two families begin a tradition of celebrating their daughters’ arrival in America with an Arrival Party each year. The celebration becomes a mix of American, Korean, and Iranian culture with the different food and people present. The story continues to progress through the early childhood of Jin-Ho and Susan, displaying the differences in how they are raised and the impact it has on them as they grow older. At times, the relationship between the two families is strained because of their contrasting opinions of some issues, but they remain good friends throughout the entire story. As the lives of the two families continue to become closer, a new and separate relationship starts to flourish between Bitsy's widowed father, Dave, and Sami's widowed mother, Maryam. Dave has recently lost his wife to cancer and is in need of a companion to help him recover from the loss. Maryam, who has been widowed for many years, is at first reluctant to change her life of privacy for Dave, but she eventually gives in and accepts his proposal of marriage. But the next day, Maryam realizes that Dave is too much of a threat to the orderly boundaries of her life, and she retracts her acceptance, upsetting Dave and many family members. Maryam is continuing to struggle with her efforts to integrate herself with all the Americans around her.....  Characters  Jin- Ho Dickinson-Donaldson – the daughter of Brad and Bitsy, adopted from Korea at six months of age. Jin Ho is a complex character who maintains a dynamic personality throughout the book. Susan Yazdan – the daughter of Sami and Ziba, adopted from Korea at six months of age. Susan may be seen as “bossy” to Jin Ho, but she is clearly the apple of her parents’ eye. Bitsy Donaldson – the mother of Jin-Ho and Xiu-Mei, wife of Brad, and daughter of Connie and Dave. She is a very determined and opinionated woman, proactive about life and her relationships with people. Ziba Yazdan – the mother of Susan and wife of Sami. Ziba immigrated to the United States from Iran in high school and works as an interior designer. Ziba is very self-aware, always concerned about others and about her self-image. Brad Donaldson – the father of Jin-Ho and Xiu-Mei, husband of Bitsy, and son of Pat and Lou. Brad is loving husband who seems to believe Bitsy can do no wrong. Sami Yazdan – the father of Susan, husband of Ziba, and son of Maryam. Sami was born in the United States. He is a quiet but opinionated man who really has a heart for his family. Maryam – The mother of Sami and grandmother of Susan. Maryam is still very in touch with the Iranian culture. Her quiet confidence is sometimes portrayed as snotty. Maryam and Dave's “love” relationship is one of the most complex relationships in the novel. Dave – the father of Bitsy, grandfather of Jin-Ho and Xiu-Mei, and husband of the late Connie. He is a warm-hearted and jolly man who falls in love with Maryam. Lou – the father of Brad and husband of Pat. Pat – the mother of Brad and wife of Lou. Xiu-Mei – the younger daughter of Bitsy and Brad, adopted from China. She worries her parents sick with her pacifier addiction. Her stubborn ways prove to be a challenge for Brad and Bitsy. Farah – the cousin of Maryam who lives in Vermont with her husband. She keeps in touch with her Iranian relatives, but manages to live an extravagant and exciting life that Maryam throws herself into once a year. Themes Belonging Michiko Kakutani in her New York Times book review: \\"In Ms. Tyler's new novel, Digging to America, belonging is a question not only of family but of being an American too: whether an immigrant can ever feel completely at home in the States, or whether he or she will always feel like an outsider; whether identity is a matter of will and choice or inherited culture and history...Ms. Tyler...delineates Maryam's efforts to come to terms with her new life in America with sympathy and wit, carefully tracking Maryam's ambivalent feelings toward Americans: the indignation she feels when condescending strangers praise her for having \\"an excellent vocabulary\\"; her impatience with trendy, multicultural liberals who willfully try to adopt foreigners' foods and traditions; and her anger at her son Sami when he mocks Americans for being self-absorbed, self-righteous and so instantaneously chummy.\\"Kakutani Michiko (May 19, 2006) “Books of the Times: Belonging to a Family, Belonging in America” The New York Times. Both the Donaldsons and the Yazdans adopt daughters from Korea; however, they take very different approaches to raising them. The Yazdans do more to make Susan feel like she is American than the Donaldsons do for Jin-Ho. The Yazdans change Sooki’s name to Susan, allow her to wear jeans, and style her hair in an American way. The Donaldsons keep Jin-Ho’s name the same, often dress her in Korean clothes and keep her hair the same as when she first arrived in America. Maryam struggles with the feeling that she doesn’t belong in America even though she’s been there for many years. She moved to America as a teenager and is now a U.S. citizen, but she is reluctant to call herself an American. She has distanced herself from the fast-paced American lifestyle. She does not own an answering machine or a cell phone. She says she danced the usual “Immigration Tango”, she was happy to become a U.S. citizen but sad to no longer be an Iranian citizen. Parenting Another theme in this novel is parenting. Bitsy and Ziba have very different parenting techniques, which often creates tension between them. Kakutani again: \\"Bitsy is... big-hearted but bossy, well-meaning but self-righteous,[and] insists on getting Jin-Ho a traditional Korean outfit, preaches the virtues of cloth diapers and the dangers of soft drinks, and burbles on about Maryam's Iranian recipes while criticizing the Yazdans' child-rearing decisions.\\" Bitsy and Brad choose to maintain much about what makes Jin-Ho Korean, and, while Sami and Ziba do not forget this piece of who Susan is, they do not focus on it as much. Bitsy does not agree with Ziba's decision to work a few days a week, leaving Susan with Maryam. When Ziba announces that Susan is attending preschool, Bitsy says that Susan is too young. While at first Ziba appreciates these critiques and finds everything Bitsy knows about parenting impressive, she soon tires of it. When Brad and Bitsy adopt their second child Xiu-Mei, Bitsy's strict parenting style diminishes and she is no longer as critical of the way Ziba raises Susan. Public/Private Boundaries Another theme in the novel is the boundary between what parts of family life are shared and what parts should be kept private. The Yazdans keep more of their family life private than the Donaldsons do. From the very beginning of the book, the differences are clear. The Yazdans have a very small group of people to greet the baby at the airport, while the Donaldsons invite all of their extended family. Some things that most families would do in the privacy of their homes become a public affair for the Donaldons. Toilet training Jin-Ho, for example, is something most would keep private, but Bitsy actually throws a party to celebrate the event. When Dave proposes to Maryam, he does so in front of both of their families. He feels this is appropriate, but Maryam is horrified by the public proposal. Personal perspective In Digging to America, Tyler has perhaps relied more on her personal life than in any other of her novels. Ms. Tyler was married for more than three decades to the Iranian-born child psychiatrist Taghi Modarressi who died of lymphoma in 1997.Encyclopedia Iranica (July 20, 2004) \\"Modarresi, Taqi, (1931–1997) Persian novelist and psychiatrist,\\"Rivera, John (April 25, 1997) \\"Dr. Taghi Modarressi, 65, Child Psychiatrist,\\" obituary in The Baltimore Sun, Baltimore, Maryland. Tyler herself expounds that \\"for 44 years, his very large and complicated family has been giving me a close look at what it means to be foreign — to view America from the outside, to attempt to 'dig' one's way inside.\\"Garner, Dwight (June 11, 2006) , \\"Inside the List,\\" The New York Times. During the novel we learn that Maryam, during the Shah's reign, was a politically active student at the University of Tehran. After she was arrested for distributing leaflets on campus, her relatives worried that her behavior was endangering the family. It was decided that she should get married and move abroad. It is noteworthy that Tyler's husband, Taghi Modaressi, also left Iran in the late 1950s to escape persecution by the Shah's secret police.Bail, Paul (1998) Anne Tyler: A Critical Companion Westport, Connecticut:Greenwood Press The friction in the novel between Maryam and her daughter-in-law's parents in a large part devolves from their strong positive feelings toward the Shah. Finally, both Maryam and Dave are adjusting to lives without their spouses, who both died of cancer. They share their memories of how difficult living with their spouses in the final years were. One cannot help but recall that Tyler's own husband died of cancer just 9 years before this novel was released. Awards New York Times Bestseller, A New York Times Notable Book, 2008 All-Iowa Reads selection Reception In a mixed review, Tine Jordan of Entertainment Weekly wrote \\"for all of Tyler's writerly gifts — and she has many — it's hard to enjoy Digging to America: the characters are just that unlikeable.\\" The Daily Telegraph praised the book, calling it \\"...a comedy that is not so much brilliant as luminous – its observant sharpness sweetened by a generous understanding of human fallibility. So sure is her tone, so graceful her style, that the reader absorbs without literary indigestion a narrative constructed almost entirely of grand set-pieces of domestic comedy.\\" Ron Charles of The Washington Post wrote \\"With her 17th novel, Tyler has delivered something startlingly fresh while retaining everything we love about her work.\\" Michiko Kakutani wrote in her New York Times book review column, Digging to America \\"is arguably her most ambitious novel yet: a novel that not only provides an intimate portrait of a Baltimore family (or, in this case, two Baltimore families), as almost all of her books do, but also unfolds gently to look at what it means to be an American.\\" Liesl Schillinger, in her New York Times review, notes how much Tyler has shifted her focus with this novel: \\"There can hardly be a more American 20th-century writer than Anne Tyler. Anyone who has grown up with her books...has by now become familiar with her unflashy mastery of the national idiom, her dour whimsy, her tapestries of suffocating families and the rogue siblings and spouses who try, and usually fail, to become unknitted from their tight weave....But in \\"Digging to America,\\" Tyler's characters face the future, not the past, so she doesn't let the freight of personal history freeze their forward motion, although it sometimes slows them down....Tyler has begun to shift her focus as she wrestles with the question of how an individual moves forward. With the map she's sketching, she's no longer in search of buried treasure; she's in search of the road ahead.\\"Schillinger, Liesl (May 21, 2006) “The Accidental Friendship,” New York Times.

He attended Hampden-Sydney College, and took a walking tour of Spain when he was 18.http://doughoregan.blogspot.com/2006/10/historical-and-geneological.html Thompson married three times. He married his first wife, Susanna Caroline Tapscott (1802-1853), in Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia on January 15, 1828. They had eight children, including six daughters who survived both their parents. One son Lucas Powell Thompson (1830-1854) barely survived his mother, and their only other son, John Baker Thompson (1834-1862), died at the Battle of Shiloh. After his first wife's death, Thompson married Arabella Stuart White (1820-1858, the daughter of the court clerk in Romney, Hampshire County (then in Virginia and on his judicial circuit, after the Civil War in West Virginia) in 1855. After her death, he married Catharine S. Carrington (1825-1893) in Halifax, Virginia on August 5, 1860, and she survived him. Although one modern blogger claims Judge Thompson had no slaves until this third marriage with one of the First Families of Virginia, U.S. census records show he owned 18 slaves in the 1850 census,1850 U.S. Federal Cernsus, Slave Schedule for District 2, Augusta County, Virginia and a decade earlier had owned 13 slaves.1840 U.S. Federal Census for Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia Career After finishing his education, and perhaps reading law with his elder brother James Powell Thompson (1792-1882, who moved to Tennessee), Thompson moved to Amherst County, Virginia and practiced law, as well as served several terms in the Virginia House of Delegates, two alongside William M. Waller and later with Samuel M. Garland. Voters of Albemarle, Amherst, Nelson, Fluvanna and Goochland counties elected Thompson as one of their four delegates to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830, alongside James Pleasants, William F. Gordon and Thomas Massie Jr. Following that Constitution's ratification, the Virginia General Assembly elected Thompson as a county judge in Staunton, Virginia and he succeeded Archibald Stuart in 1831. He served on that court for many years, and was re-elected to that post by the legislature. After the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850, the county court was reconstituted as the 11th circuit court, and Thompson also elected to that position (and re-elected many times). Before the conflict, Judge Thompson operated a private law school (1839-1849), mostly at the mansion, \\"Hilltop\\", he built in Staunton in 1842. He remained in office during the American Civil War, although he despised Abraham Lincoln. His son John Baker Thompson (1834-1862) died at the Battle of Shiloh. His nephew John Lucas Thompson (1833-1866) captained Company C of the 16th Tennessee Infantry and barely survived the war. During the war's final days, Judge Thompson recommended a Peace Commission, and signed the oath of allegiance afterward, reputedly on the recommendation of Gen. Robert E. Lee. After the war, Governor Francis Pierpont nominated Judge Thompson, who had opposed succession, to the Court of Appeals, but Judge Thompson was already ill when the General Assembly elected him to that position on February 22, 1866. Death and legacy Judge Thompson died at his Staunton home on April 21, 1866 before assuming that office.\\"Death of Judge Lucas P.

The cathedral is the church for the Tromsø Domkirkens parish and it is the headquarters for the Tromsø domprosti (arch-deanery) and the Diocese of Nord- Hålogaland. This cathedral is notable since it is the only Norwegian cathedral made of wood. The yellow, wooden cathedral was built in a long church format and in the Gothic Revival style in 1861 by the architect Christian Heinrich Grosch. The church tower and main entrance are on the west front. It is probably the northernmost Protestant cathedral in the world. With over 600 seats, it is one of Norway's biggest wooden churches. It originally held about 984 seats, but many benches and seats have been removed over the years to make room for tables in the back of the church. History The structure was completed in 1861 after the diocese was established in 1844. Christian Heinrich Grosch was the architect. It was built using a cog joint method. It is situated in the middle of the city of Tromsø (on the island of Tromsøya) on a site where in all likelihood there has been a church since the 13th century. The first church in Tromsø was built in 1252 by King Haakon IV as a royal chapel. It belonged to the king, therefore, not the Catholic Church. This church is mentioned several times in the Middle Ages as \\"St. Mary's near the Heathens\\" (Sanctae Mariae juxta Pagano). Not much is known about the previous churches on the site, but it is known that in 1711 a new church was built on this site. That church was replaced in 1803. That church was moved out of the city in 1860 to make way for the building of the present cathedral. The 1803 church building was relocated to an area a few hundred metres south of the city boundary and then in the early 1970s it was moved again to the site of the present Elverhøy Church further up the hills in the city. This church is still there and contains a number of pieces of art that have adorned the churches in Tromsø from the Middle Ages, the oldest of which is a figure of the Madonna, possibly of the 15th century. The present cathedral was consecrated on 1 December 1861 by the Bishop Carl Peter Essendrop. In 1862, the bell tower was completed and the bell was installed. All of the interior decorations and art were not completed until the 1880s. The cathedral cost about 10,000 Speciedalers to build. Interior The cathedral interior is dominated by the altar with a copy of the painting Resurrection by the noted artist Adolph Tidemand. Under the picture is a quote from the Gospel of John.

The eastern branch includes the Central Asia - Center (CAC) 1, 2, 4 and 5 pipelines, which start from the south-eastern gas fields of Turkmenistan. The western branch consists of the CAC-3 pipeline and a project to build a new parallel Caspian pipeline. The western branch runs from the Caspian Sea coast of Turkmenistan to north. The branches meet in western Kazakhstan. From there the pipelines run to north where they are connected to the Russian natural gas pipeline system. History The system was built between 1960 and 1988. Construction began after discovery of Turkmenistan's Dzharkak field in the Amu Darya Basin, and the first section of the pipeline was completed in 1960. CAC-1 and 2 were commissioned in 1969 and CAC-4 was commissioned in 1973. In 1976, two parallel lines were laid between Shatlyk compressor station and Khiva. CAC-5 was commissioned in 1985 and in 1986-88 the Dauletabad–Khiva line was connected. The western branch (CAC-3) was constructed in 1972-1975. In 2003, the late President of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyazov proposed to renovate existing systems and construct a new parallel pipeline to the western branch. On 12 May 2007, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan signed a memorandum for renovation and expansion of the western branch of the pipeline. On 20 December 2007, Russia, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan finalized agreement on construction of the Caspian Coastal Pipeline parallel to the existing CAC-3 pipeline (known as Bekdash–Europe pipeline or Okarem–Beineu pipeline). Technical features Almost all Uzbek and Turkmen natural gas is delivered through the CAC pipeline system, mainly through the eastern branch due to location of production sites and poor technical condition of the western branch. CAC-1, 2, 4 and 5 pipelines are supplied from gas fields in the South-East of Turkmenistan, mainly from the Dauletabad gas field. The eastern branch starts from the Dauletabad field and continues through the Shatlyk gas field east of Tejen to Khiva, Uzbekistan. From there the pipeline system transports gas north-west along Amu Darya to the Kungrad compressor station in Uzbekistan. From Kungrad, most of the gas is carried via Kazakhstan to the Alexandrov Gay gas metering station in Russia. At Alexandrov Gay CAC pipelines meet with Soyuz and Orenburg–Novopskov pipelines. From there two lines run northwest to Moscow, and two others proceed across the Volga river to the North Caucasus-Moscow transmission system. The diameter of most pipelines varies from . Current capacity of the system is 44 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year. An agreement is in place to increase capacity to 55 bcm per year by 2010 and through modernization there is potential to increase capacity to 90 bcm per year. The western branch originates at Okarem near the Turkmenistan–Iran border and runs north. It is supplied by gas from fields scattered along the Caspian coast between Okarem and Balkanabat. It continues via Uzen in Kazakhstan to the Beyneu compressor station, where it meets the eastern branch of the CAC. South of Hazar, the western system consists of diameter pipeline, and between Hazar and Beyneau diameter pipeline. Caspian coastal pipeline On 20 December 2007, Russia, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan agreed to construct a new Caspian pipeline parallel to the existing CAC-3 pipeline. The pipeline is planned be built between Belek compressor station in Turkmenistan and Alexandrov Gay compressor station. Capacity of the new pipeline will be 20–30 bcm per year and it would be supplied from the planned East–West pipeline. Construction of the pipeline was to start in the second half of 2009. However, the project was mothballed.

Social Security Death Index [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2006.Ancestry.com. Texas Death Index, 1903–2000 [database on- line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2006. Orville O. Nix (obituary), Dallas Morning News, Jan. 19, 1972, p. D3. was a witness to the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. His filming of the shooting, which only captured the last few seconds of it, is considered to be nearly as important as the film by Abraham Zapruder.Warren Commission Report, pp. 96–97, 109–110. Background Nix was born in Texas, the son of Myrtle (née Mabra) and James Allan Nix. He was reported to have only a fourth grade education and later worked as an air conditioning engineer working for the General Services Administration in Dallas. He was married to Ella Louise Robison in 1938 with whom he had one son, Orville, Jr. JFK assassination On November 22, 1963, Nix walked from his office in the Terminal Annex building located on the south side of Dealey Plaza to the northwest corner of the intersection of Main Street and Houston Street with his Keystone Auto-Zoom Model K-810 8 mm movie camera. Nix filmed the presidential limousine and motorcade as it entered the Plaza, then quickly moved 20 to 60 feet west of Houston Street to the south curb of Main Street. There, he ended up capturing the last part of the assassination with the grassy knoll in the background. Shortly after the motorcade had left Dealey Plaza, he filmed people running from Main Street to Elm Street. Nix's film is much darker than the other films shot that day, as he used Type A indoor film, and did not have the proper filter to correct this. The Nix film was obtained as a result of a notice that the FBI gave to film processing plants in the Dallas area, that the FBI would be interested in obtaining or knowing about any film they processed relating to the assassination. When Nix heard about this from his processor, he delivered the film to the FBI office in Dallas on December 1, 1963. It was returned to him three days later. United Press International (UPI) purchased the copyright for $5,000 and took possession of the original version of Nix’s film on December 6, 1963. Reese Schonfeld, a UPI executive and later the founding president of CNN, stewarded the film for UPI. UPI distributed frame enlargements to its news subscribers the following day. The film’s original rendition was examined by the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978. When UPI returned the copyright and all its copies to the Nix family in 1992, the film’s original version was missing. In 2002, the Nix family assigned the film’s copyright to the Dallas County Historical Foundation,David Flick, \\"Family donates JFK film, copyright to museum\\", Dallas Morning News, Nov. 20, 2000.U.S. Copyright Office, copyright assignment, document #V3466D144, recorded 5 March 2001. which operates the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. Nix was interviewed in 1966 by investigator Mark Lane for his documentary Rush to Judgment. In a filmed interview undertaken by Lane, he also stated that the film he received back may not have been identical to the one that he shot.Rush to Judgement documentary He told Lane that at the time of the assassination, he believed that the shots had come from behind the stockade fence on the grassy knoll, but was later told that conclusive proof existed that shots only came from the Texas School Book Depository and that he was convinced by this. He was also interviewed by CBS News in 1967 for a television documentary on the Kennedy assassination. In 2015, Nix's granddaughter, Gayle Nix-Jackson, initiated a lawsuit against the US government for the return of the original film or compensation seeking $10m. Ms Nix Jackson said that \\"it was incomprehensible authorities would lose an important piece of historical evidence. I can understand little clerical issues. I don't understand the loss of evidence like this.\\" In 2017 Jackson's lawsuit was \\"dismissed without prejudice\\" from proceeding in that court type venue, then Jackson filed a similar lawsuit in a different court type venue. Death On January 17, 1972, Nix died in Dallas at the age of 60. He is buried in Edgewood Cemetery in Lancaster, Texas.

He served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia and as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Early and family life Born on June 17, 1806, in Oak Ridge, Nelson County, Virginia, Rives graduated from Hampden–Sydney College in 1825 and from the University of Virginia in 1829. Career He was a planter in Albemarle County, Virginia from 1829 to 1871. Albemarle County voters elected him as one of their (part time) representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates several times, as well as failed to re-elect him numerous times.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Virginia State Library 1978) p. 371, 384, 400, 448 Albemarle County voters elected him to the Virginia Senate in 1857, and he served one term.Leonard pp. 467, 473 Following the American Civil War, Rives became Rector of the University of Virginia from 1865 to 1866. He was a Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia from 1866 to 1869. Politics Rives was initially a Democrat, but opposed the sub-treasury policy of President Martin Van Buren. Thus, Rives joined the Whig, party in 1844.Virginia Biographical Encyclopedia 1915, online In 1870, Rives ran for the United States House of Representatives as a Republican, but lost to Richard Thomas Walker Duke. Duke's son recalled of this campaign that Rives \\"had 'ratted' and became a 'scalawag' republican.\\" Nonetheless, Rives had obtained a pardon for his opponent, to remove Duke's disability from seeking office, without charging Rives's usual fee of up to $500. Federal judicial service Rives was nominated by President Ulysses S. Grant on February 3, 1871, to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, to a new seat authorized by 16 Stat. 403. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 6, 1871, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on August 1, 1882, due to his retirement. Notable case In 1878, Judge Rives took the then-controversial view that the exclusion of blacks from jury service in Virginia state courts was a violation of the Equal Protection rights of two criminal defendants, granting their petitions for habeas corpus relief.Ex parte Reynolds, 20 F.Cas. 586 (C.C.Va. 1878). The Virginia General Assembly passed a resolution denouncing the Reynolds decision, and demanding an appeal. The Supreme Court agreed in principle with Rives, in three decisions issued on March 1, 1880, but overruled his reasoning in Virginia v. Rivesordering him to return jurisdiction over the petitioners to the Commonwealth.Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313 (1879). However, in Ex parte Virginia the court confirmed federal authority to enforce African Americans' rights to serve on juries, and in Strauder v. West Virginia the court declared states could not limit jury service to white men.encyclopediavirginia.org/Ex_Parte Virginia 1880 Over 100 years later, the Supreme Court ruled that even the use of peremptory challenges where exclusion was made on the basis of race was unconstitutional, in Batson. Death Rives died on September 17, 1885, in Charlottesville, Virginia. He was interred beside his wife and namesake son in Monticello Memorial Park, Albemarle County, Virginia.According to the 1880 U.S. Federal Census for District 12 of Charlottesville, Albemarle County, his household (dwelling 240) consisted of himself, his wife, daughter J.B. Coleman and 22 year old granddaughter P.S. Coleman, 20 year old nephew T.K.W. Morris (listed as a student), as well as a 30 year old black female cook and 15 year old black male servant. Family, residence and property Rives was the great- uncle of Alexander Brown, author of several books on the early history of Virginia and of The Cabells and their Kin (1895). He lived in Charlottesville until 1833; then at \\"Carlton\\" on Monticello until 1873, and spent his final years at \\"Eastbourne Terrace\\" in Charlottesville.Encyclopedia of Virginia Biography (1915) The 1860 federal census indicates that Rives owned real estate worth $60,000 and personal property (including enslaved persons) worth $94,496.1860 U.S. Federal Census for St. Anne's Parish, Albemarle County, Virginia dwelling 1186, family 1171.

The slave schedule for the 1850 Federal Census indicates Rives owned 69 slaves, and the slave schedule for the 1860 federal census enumerates 65 slaves. Papers Some of Rives' papers before 1875 are held by the University of Virginia library. Estate The Rives family estate where Rives was born, Oak Ridge in Nelson County, was sold in 1867, but remains today as an event and wedding venue.

The manual consists of two parts, part one is the user's guide and part two is the set of steps themselves. DIRKS is an eight-step process in which all aspects, or as many as possible, of a business are studied in order to achieve a complete records management practice. In addition to these eight steps DIRKS includes several templates and questionnaires to guide one through the DIRKS methodology. DIRKS was replaced in 2007 at the Australian Commonwealth level, but continues to be in use at state level in New South Wales as a non-tool to assist the public sector in complying with the State Records Authority of New South Wales State Records Act 1998. Steps of the DIRKS methodology * Step A: Preliminary investigation; Before a preliminary investigation occurs DIRKS suggests a pre- preliminary investigation is performed where it is established if there is a need for a records management program at the organisation and is there support for a record keeping system to be put in place. If so the preliminary investigation can take place. There are four components to the DIRKS preliminary investigation. # Determine the scope of the preliminary investigation # Collect Information # Document the research of the investigation # Report to Senior Management * Step B: Analysis of business activity; The purpose of Step B is to create a set of advisory statements from which an analysis of the organisation's business activities can be determined. DIRKS suggests a set of systematic approaches to analyse an organization in a systematic way in order to reveal various business activities, how they are completed and who completes them. * Step C: Identification of recordkeeping requirements; Step C has two main objectives. The first is to determine an organisation's requirements in creation and retention of records of its business activities. The second objective is to document the determined requirements in a clear manner that can be used as a reference in the future. * Step D: Assessment of existing systems; The main objective of Step D is to assess the existing recordkeeping systems and any other related information management systems that have the capacity to capture and maintain records. This assessment is to identify weaknesses and strengths within the existing system. * Step E: Identification of strategies for recordkeeping; The main objective of Step E is to determine which policies, procedures, standards and various other tools will help the organisation achieve its recordkeeping goals. With these strategies established a model for both record management and recordkeeping can be created. * Step F: Design of a recordkeeping system; The objective in Step F is to use the information gained in steps A through E a plan can be developed that fulfills the requirements set out in Step C. The design should repair any faults found in Step D and include a full plan for integrating the new recordkeeping system * Step G: Implementation of a recordkeeping system; The objective of Step G is put the recordkeeping system that was designed in Step F in place. * Step H: Post-implementation review. The objective of Step H is to measure the effectiveness of the installed system and to make sure that in practice in fulfills all requirements as established and documented throughout the DIRKS manual.

Joynes (November 8, 1817-March 15, 1874) was a Virginia lawyer, businessman, politician and judge, who served in the Virginia House of Delegates and Virginia Court of Appeals. Early and family life Joynes was born at a house known as Montpelier in Accomack County, Virginia on November 8, 1817 to the former Anne Belle Satchell (1792-1862) and her husband Thomas Robinson Joynes (1789-1858), a prominent planter and politician who served in the Virginia House of Delegates during the War of 1812 (during which he married), for years as the clerk of the county court and as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829.https://history.house.virginia.gov/members/1842 His paternal ancestors had emigrated more than a century earlier, and his grandfather Col. Levin Joyce (1753-1794) had led the county militia to serve under General George Washington. The Joynes family included younger brothers, Dr. Levin Smith Joynes (1815-1881), Thomas R. Joynes Jr. (1829-1868) and Edward Southey Joynes (1834-1917), as well as sisters Mary Stockley Joynes Scarburgh (1815-1885), Louisa Ann Joynes Dennis (1822-1852) and Charlotte Bell Joynes (1825-1843). After a private education suitable to his class, William Joynes traveled to Pennsylvania and received a degree from Washington College. He later returned to Virginia for studies at the University of Virginia School of Law. William T. Joynes married Margaret Feild May, and they had a daughter, Anna (b. 1841) and sons Thomas R. Joynes (b. 1846) and John Joynes (b. 1850).1850 U.S. Federal Census for South Ward, Petersburg (Independent City), Virginia, Family No. 936, p. 103 of 110 In 1840, William T.

Joynes also owned 6 slaves in Accomack County.1860 U.S. Federal Census Slave Schedule for St. George Parish, Accomack County, Virginia, p. 22 of 44 Meanwhile, his widowed mother moved to Granville County, North Carolina, where she died at his doctor brother's home in 1862. Career After admission to the Virginia bar, Joynes settled in Petersburg in 1839 to practice law. He became a law partner of John Fitzhugh May (1784-1856) who later became a judge, and married one of his four daughters (another daughter married lawyer and later Congressman Thomas Bayly of Accomack County). Joynes also served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia for a time. Petersburg, situated on the south bank of the Appomattox River grew into Virginia's third largest city by 1860 (the only larger cities were the state capital at Richmond about 20 miles away and the key railroad and canal terminus at Wheeling on the Ohio River). A key factor was the building of the Petersburg Railroad, which would link Petersburg with Weldon, North Carolina (another railroad, with terminus joined after the American Civil War, linked Petersburg and Richmond). Joynes became President of the Petersburg and Weldon Railroad and a business associate of former slave-trader and Congressman Francis E. Rives, who funded several railroads in southern Virginia and adjacent North Carolina. In 1863, during the American Civil War, Joynes remained in Petersburg and was elected judge of the First Judicial District in the Confederate establishment. His railroad became very important for supplying Richmond, as well as for supplying Confederate troops. Petersburg refused for nearly a year to succumb to Federal forces despite the long Siege of Petersburg (June 15, 1864-April 2, 1865) and Battle of the Crater. Shortly before the siege began, in May 1864, Joynes' eldest son, Thomas R. Joynes (or possibly his brother of the same name back in Accomack County) joined the local Washington Battery of artillery, but survived the conflict. His brother Dr. Levin Joynes served as a Confederate surgeon and his youngest brother Edward with the local defense force in Accomack County, which Union forces soon occupied (although his pardon application mentioned only his teaching job at the College of William and Mary, which closed during the war, and a clerical position in Richmond). However, by the war's end, the Petersburg Railroad was nearly destroyed, as were most railroads leading into Richmond. Joynes managed to secure funding to rebuild the railroad within a year, perhaps helped by his brother in law, George R. Dennis who had served as a Union Army Colonel before beginning his political career on Maryland's Eastern Shore. In the fall of 1865, Petersburg and neighboring Dinwiddie County voters elected Joynes and R.P. Atkinson to the Virginia House of Delegates.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Virginia State Library 1978) p. 500 During the following session in 1866, following the deposition of Confederate-aligned Virginia judges, Governor Francis Pierpont (before his return to Wheeling in what had become the new state of West Virginia) nominated Joynes, Alexander Rives and Lucas P. Thompson to the Virginia Court of Appeals. When the Virginia General Assembly elected all three to 12-year terms (although Thompson died before taking office), Rives ended his legislative service. However, during Congressional Reconstruction, General John Schofield deposed all the Virginia appellate judges and replaced them with dedicated Union men, to some consternation. Judge Joynes resumed his appellate duties as Congressional Reconstruction ended (with the adoption in 1869 of a new state constitution formally abolishing slavery and re-admission to the Union), but only for about two years. After suffering a stroke, Joynes resigned from the court in 1873 for reasons of ill health and died the following year. Legislators elected Wood Boulden as his successor. Death and legacy Joynes died at his Petersburg home on March 15, 1874, survived by his widow, daughter Anna and son Thomas R. Joynes. The latter had become a lawyer and moved back into the family home after his divorce. In 1880, the Joynes household (sans the judge) also employed three Black women as servants.1880 U.S. Federal Census for District 91, Petersburg, Dinwiddie County, Virginia, family no. 183, p. 19 of 51.

The supporting cast features Boris Karloff, Cecil Kellaway, Ward Bond, Howard Da Silva, Katherine DeMille (the director's daughter), C. Aubrey Smith and Mike Mazurki. Released by Paramount Pictures, the film depicts the violent struggles between American colonists and Native Americans on the western frontier in the mid-18th century during the 1763 Pontiac's Rebellion, primarily around Fort Pitt (modern-day Pittsburgh). The film is characterized by DeMille's lavish style, including colourful costumes and sets, thousands of extras, violence, and sensationalism. Plot In London in 1763, Abigail \\"Abby\\" Hale (Paulette Goddard) is tried for the death of a Royal Navy officer which occurred when she tried to save her sick brother from the press gang. The judge condemns her to be hanged, then offers her the \\"king's mercy\\": transportation to the British colonies in North America and a term of \\"not less than 14 years as an indentured slave (resp. bondslave), to be sold at auction\\". She chooses the latter. Aboard ship as they near Norfolk, Abby incurs the anger of trader Martin Garth (Howard Da Silva), who then insists upon the auction being held there and then. There is a bitter bidding war between Garth and Captain Christopher Holden (Gary Cooper), which Holden wins, for an exorbitant sum. Holden, still in plainclothes, will be later identified as officer of the Virginia Regiment by his then worn silver trimmed, blue/red uniform (which cuff flaps are mistakenly shown with four buttonholes instead of the originally three). A friend reminds Holden he is engaged. He sets Abby free, but afterward, his fiancee Diana informs him that she has married his brother. Meanwhile, Garth bribes the slave dealer into saying that Holden was only jesting and never bought her, and destroys the bill of freedom. Garth takes Abby to the western frontier, where he is selling guns to the Indians towards the end of the French and Indian War. Holden's friend John Fraser (Ward Bond) shows him something he got from an Indian who tried to kill him. Holden and Abby's paths cross, but Garth convinces Holden that Abby came to him of her own accord. Later, Garth makes it clear he is attracted to Abby. However, his Indian wife Hannah, daughter of Chief Guyasuta, shows up with an important message. Garth hastily departs for a meeting. At the meeting are George Washington, Colonel of the Virginia Regiment, his subordinate Holden, colonial governor Sir William, and others. They are deeply concerned about a possible native uprising. Holden fears that Pontiac will unite the tribes to wage war. Holden suggests sending someone to take \\"peace belts\\" to the Indians; Garth recommends Holden, and Holden accepts. However, when Holden and his two companions are ambushed, he realizes that he needs to deal with Garth. When he comes for Garth, he is reunited with Abby, and their mutual misunderstanding is cleared up before they flee together to Fort Pitt. When Garth comes for Abby, Holden provokes him into a duel. However, Garth has a bill of sale for Abby, so the governor awards her to him. Before Garth can do anything, he is summoned by Guyasuta. He takes Abby along. When a nearby settlement is wiped out, the governor prepares Fort Pitt for a siege. Holden walks unarmed into Guyasuta's camp and, by trickery, manages to save Abby from being tortured to death. They escape and, seeing the aftermath of the slaughtering of innocent settlers, head off to warn Fort Pitt against Indian treachery. However, Garth convinces the authorities that Holden is an untrustworthy deserter; Holden is sentenced to death and Abby is returned to Garth. She makes a bargain with Garth: she will willingly go with him in return for him arranging Holden's escape. He agrees, but plots Holden's death in the escape attempt. Hannah, having been told by Garth that he is abandoning her for Abby, warns Holden, takes his place and is fatally shot. With no more food left, the acting British commander decides to accept Guyasuta's false promise to let them go unharmed. Fortunately, reinforcements arrive just in time, and the Indians flee. When the relief force enters the fort, however, the besieged see that the soldiers in the wagons are dead. Holden was unable to obtain reinforcements from the nearest British unit because it had suffered grievous casualties, but he was able to get a token force of mostly drummers and bagpipers of the famed Black Watch ... and corpses. Afterward, Holden kills Garth in a shootout, leaving him and Abby free to marry, ending her slavery. Cast Production Development DeMille was inspired to create the film after reading The Judas Tree by Neil Swanson. The novel described how white men and women who had been convicted in England were sent to 18th-century America to be sold as slaves. DeMille bought the rights to the novel and hired Swanson to write a new book that would be titled Unconquered: A Novel of the Pontiac Conspiracy, using the film script in development as his source. The film script was written by Charles Bennett, Jesse Lasky Jr., and Fredric M. Frank; DeMille also paid two experts to research \\"the birth of freedom, and the beginning of the death of slavery, in colonial America\\", paying $100,000 for their services. However, DeMille was more interested in the romanticization of American colonial conquest and the demonization of Native Americans who stood in the way of it than with full historical accuracy. The script is littered with stereotypical clichés about massacre- happy Indians; for example, Paulette Goddard's character proclaims: \\"The Indians will always burn, torture, and kill to get back the wilderness\\". DeMille spent months polishing the dialogue, but both Cooper and Goddard were dissatisfied with their lines. For Cooper, Lasky dutifully rewrote one scene several times, but Cooper refused to say two of the speeches. Budget The production cost $4.3 million, and ran $394,000 over budget as well as nine days over its shooting schedule. Actor salaries came in at $1 million, the largest salary outlay in DeMille's career to date. Cooper received $300,000, twice his usual fee, including a percentage of the profits, and Goddard earned $112,000. Casting Unconquered was the last of four films which Cooper made with DeMille. DeMille had originally wanted to cast the English actress Deborah Kerr in the role of Alice Hale, but could not meet her salary demand. The cast included 25 name players, and 4,325 costumed extras were also employed. Thirteen stunt performers were employed in the production. The majority of actors cast as Native American characters were all Caucasian. DeMille asked Boris Karloff to study the Seneca language before playing Chief Guyasuta. The only Indians in the cast, playing bit parts, were Chief John Big Tree, Rodd Redwing, Jay Silverheels, and Chief Thundercloud. Iron Eyes Cody (an Italian-American actor) was also credited as an Indian language consultant. DeMille did the voice-over narration. Filming Most of the filming was done on Hollywood sound stages, with some outdoor scenes filmed in western Pennsylvania and river scenes filmed on the Snake River in Idaho. The waterfall scene, in which Cooper's and Goddard's characters escape the Indians by riding a canoe down the rapids and then jumping off to grab an overhanging tree branch as the canoe careens down the falls, was filmed at two different locations—one a river with only rapids and the other a river with only falls. The two rivers were matted together in post-production to appear as one body of water; artists also matte-painted an overhanging tree branch into each frame. Stunt performers Ted Mapes and Lila Finn handled the canoe riding and jumping-off scenes on the rapids, while Mapes and Polly Burson were the stunt doubles who land on a rocky ledge under the waterfall, which was filmed on a soundstage. Cooper and Goddard were then filmed riding the canoe and jumping off on a soundstage backed by a rear-projection screen. For the climactic attack on Fort Pitt, DeMille sought to create a spectacular, brutal battle that had never been filmed before and that would wow theatergoers. The scene, which cost $300,000 to stage, involved nearly 800 extras, along with \\"three hundred pounds of dynamite, fifty pounds of flash powder, fifty flintlocks, and three hundred fireballs\\". Goddard refused to stand in the scene while fireballs were being hurled, which infuriated DeMille, who shouted, \\"Get her out of here! Get her out before I kill her!\\" The director would not speak to Goddard again for years. Cooper's character uses authentic 18th-century pistols from DeMille's private collection. Release The film was released on October 3, 1947. A month before release, Paramount arranged for Cooper, Da Silva, and Karloff to promote the film on its 15-minute radio show, \\"Paramount Star Interviews\\", which was syndicated across the U.S. Box office Unconquered earned estimated domestic rentals of $5.3 million, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1947. However, due to the film's bloated budget, the film lost more than $1 million. The film was released on DVD by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment in 2007. Critical reception Critics generally panned the screenplay for its clichéd dialogue and situations, but admitted to liking the film anyway. Time called the film \\"a huge, high-colored chunk of hokum; but the most old-fashioned thing about it is its exuberance, a quality which 66-year-old Director DeMille preserves almost single-handed from the old days when even the people who laughed at movies couldn't help liking them\\". Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, agreed that \\"Unconquered is a picture worth seeing, if for nothing else but laughs\\". But he added that while the film uses \\"the oldest dime-store clichés\\"—including \\"Indian fights, tavern brawling and a canoe going over a waterfall\\"—it exerts a \\"magnetic pull\\" under DeMille's direction. Crowther also noted that the film contains all of the usual DeMille touches, including \\"Paulette Goddard as the red-headed, flashing-eyed slave, exhibited in numerous situations, from a bathtub to an Indian torture stake\\". Mountain Xpress called the film \\"preposterous in the way that only a Cecil B. DeMille movie can be\\". Yet its reviewer gave the film 4 ½ out of 5 stars, calling it \\"massively entertaining\\". He elaborated: > The bad guys are very bad, the good guys very credulous, the hero very smart > and honorable. It is a \\"perfect\\" DeMille picture. Everything you expect is > here—including a bathtub scene (in a barrel) for a very fetching Paulette > Goddard. It's all bigger than it needs to be. It's very Hollywood—even to > the constant misunderstandings between Cooper and Goddard—not to mention the > casting of Boris Karloff as the chief of the Senecas. And we also get > DeMille's adopted daughter Katherine DeMille as Karloff's daughter. There's > excitement, danger, romance, adventure, comedy, you name it. It's not a > great film, but it's one hell of a movie. Critics also praised the acting and cinematography. Variety, which derided the \\"frequently inept script\\", praised the actors' performances, noting that this was \\"a great tribute to the cast because that dialog and those situations try the best of troupers\\". According to film critic Emanuel Levy, the \\"sex appeal\\" of Cooper and Goddard, he gallantly clad in American colonial costumes and she in the garb of a red-haired slave, ensured its popularity at the box office. Levy also called the Technicolor cinematography by Ray Rennahan \\"impressive in an eye-popping manner\\". Accolades The film was nominated for a 1947 Academy Award for Best Special Effects.

Jernigan Library of Texas A&M; University–Kingsville, was established to preserve and to make available to the public documentary materials about the history and natural history of South Texas. The Archives are located on the third floor of James C. Jernigan Library, 1050 University Blvd, Kingsville, TX 78363. History Although the South Texas Archives were not officially created until 1981, the systematic accumulation of historical documents was started by Professor John E. Conner when he joined the Department of History shortly after the creation of the South Texas State Teachers College. In 1925, the year that STSTC opened its doors to students, John E. Conner chairman of the Department of History and Dean of the School, began receiving \\"family treasures\\" from area residents who were interested in preserving their past and treasures for future historians. As a historian with a keen interest in the history of Texas he gladly received these items and stored them where he could, starting a museum. By the late 1940s the collection had grown to such an extent that Dr. Conner was given additional space. An area known as \\"The Forum\\"—an open-air, gathering arena where students had heard many speeches and held their graduations—was walled in and the space became the first John E. Conner Museum. There was no heating, no air conditioning, no plumbing, and a leaking roof. But there was space for the growing collection and there was an interest in preserving the past. In 1964, when Dr. Conner retired from Texas College of Arts & Industries (renamed in 1929), the Department of History assumed responsibility for the growing collection of historical artifacts and documents. Various historians managed the Museum until Ms. Jimmie Picquet was named director and administrator in 1972. Under her direction the Museum was relocated into a remodeled building on the main street of the campus. In 1981 she asked the University to officially create the South Texas Archives, a division of the John Conner Museum. The mission of the new Archives is to preserve the documentary history, of rural, agricultural south Texas and northern Mexico and make it available for research. It was designated a Regional Historical Records Depository by the State Library and Archives and the official Archives for the Texas A&I; University. It became the archival home of the South Texas Historical Association which publishes the Journal of South Texas. In 1995 the South Texas Archives was made a division of the James C. Jernigan Library at Texas A&M; University-Kingsville (renamed in 1993), given academic status and expanded its mission so that it became the South Texas Archives a Special Collections and included the rare book collection of the Library. In 2009, the South Texas Archives relocated from Lila Baugh Hall (since demolished) to the James C. Jernigan Library. Current Holdings Today the South Texas Archives and Special Collections is actively involved in the collection and preservation of documents that provide information about the history, folklore, politics, culture, and natural history of South Texas. It includes 1\\\\. Personal and family papers, in English and Spanish, consisting of correspondence, diaries, legal and financial documents; 2\\\\. Organizational records consisting of correspondence, reports, minutes, financial and legal papers, photographs, printed materials and other documentation produced by a group or corporate activity; 3\\\\.

Edith remembered clearly when the ship struck the iceberg at 11:40 p.m. on 14 April 1912. In a series of interviews in her later years and a biography, A Lifetime on the Titanic, published in 1995, she gave a vivid account of its final moments, although some details have been called into question. > Father appeared a few minutes later. He told us, 'You'd better put on your > life jackets and something warm, it's cold on deck. It's just a precaution. > We've struck an iceberg, it's nothing much.

I kept > wondering if my father had gotten off the ship, that's all I could think of. > – 1995 Her father did not survive and his body, if recovered, was never identified. Her last memory of him was that he was dressed in an Edwardian dinner jacket while smoking a cigar and sipping brandy on the deck as she and her mother were being lowered in the lifeboat. Upon arrival in New York City, they stayed at the Junior League House before traveling to Seattle to live with her aunt, Josephine Acton. They soon returned to Cape Town where she lived with relatives after her mother remarried and moved to Rhodesia. Marriage and children In May 1917 at age 20, Edith met Frederick Thankful Haisman and they were married six weeks later on 30 June. Their first child, a boy, was born in August 1918, and would be followed by nine more children. They lived in South Africa and Australia before settling in Southampton. Frederick died in 1977. He was survived by four sons, two daughters, and more than 30 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In 1977 he and Edith celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary at Rhinefield House in the New Forest. Memorials On 15 April 1995, Edith aged 98 was present with fellow survivor, Eva Hart, age 90, at the opening of a memorial garden at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London where a granite monument commemorating the 83rd anniversary of the sinking was erected. In August 1996, at age 99 she joined fellow survivor Michel Marcel Navratil on a cruise to the location of the Titanic's wreck where attempts were made to bring a large portion of its hull to the surface. Before leaving the site, she threw a rose into the ocean where her father had died 84 years earlier. There is also a road named after her in Freemantle, Southampton, England. In 1991, George Tullock of RMS Titanic Inc. he presented her with her father's pocket watch which had been retrieved from the sea bed. She had last seen it on 15 April 1912 when he waved goodbye to his wife and daughter as they left aboard lifeboat 14. They never saw him again and he presumably went down with the ship. The watch was loaned to Haisman \\"for life\\"; when she died four years later it was reclaimed by RMS Titanic Inc. Death Edith died on 20 January 1997 in a Southampton nursing home at age 100. By her bed stood a photograph of her father in a straw boater, stiff collar and bow tie. She remains one of the longest-lived Titanic survivors. Mary Davies Wilburn holds the record, having died in 1987, at age 104.

Although they were called The Seven Little Eatons, in fact only five of the siblings embarked on a career in showbiz. Doris Eaton Travis in 1922 Early days  The Eatons were born to Mary and Charles Eaton between 1894 and 1910 in Norfolk, Virginia, and began their careers in show business in 1911, when three of the children, Doris, Mary, and Pearl, were hired to appear in a production of Maurice Maeterlinck's fantasy play The Blue Bird at the Shubert Belasco Theatre in Washington. After The Blue Bird closed, the sisters, younger brother Joe and cousin Avery, began appearing regularly in various plays and melodramas for the Poli stock company. Doris Eaton Travis, in her memoirs, noted that \\"the local stock managers at the Poli theatres knew that if you needed three or four or more children, you could call Mama Eaton and get them all in one place.\\" The Eaton girls sometimes portrayed male roles; brother Joe sometimes portrayed female characters and was billed as \\"Josephine.\\" They quickly gained reputations as professional, reliable and versatile actors, and were rarely out of work. The Ziegfeld Follies, theatre and film As their careers flourished, the Eatons moved to New York and, gradually, began performing in adult roles in musical theatre productions and silent films. They had a special connection to the Ziegfeld Follies: between 1918 and 1922, at least one Eaton was a member of the Follies cast. In the 1930s, with the advent of talkies, the decline of the Follies and the advent of the Great Depression, the careers of the Eaton siblings declined. Several struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction; others went on to careers in the United States military and the Arthur Murray chain of dance schools. Memoirs  Doris Eaton Travis, at an advanced age, she still performed annually on Broadway in benefits for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. She wrote a memoir about her family, entitled The Days We Danced (2003) with her brother Charles, who died in 2004.

While she was never a performer herself, she was perhaps somewhat responsible for the Eaton family's entrance into show business: she brought her three sisters to audition for their first show, The Blue Bird. She became, somewhat reluctantly, the \\"second mother\\" to the performing children of the family, and was compelled by her parents to leave school to look after them. :Evelyn married Bob Mills in 1916; they had three children, Edwin, Warren and Evelynne (also credited as Evelyn Eaton, 1924 - 1964). All three children had successful careers as juvenile actors on Broadway. Doris Eaton Travis, in her memoirs, notes that Evelyn was a very aggressive stage mother, and eventually ended up alienating her children. Evelyn was the last person ever to sign a contract with Flo Ziegfeld, on behalf of her daughter, who played the character of Kim as a child in a 1932 revival of Show Boat. The younger Evelyn Eaton is also notable for hosting Hour Glass, the oldest surviving television variety show and the first to fill a full hour time slot.\\"Commercial Television: First Show is Fuzzy, Funny Life Magazine (May 27, 1946) * Joseph Eaton (1905–1998) began his career at the age of five in Mrs. Wiggs and the Cabbage Patch.

Joe performed in the 1921 edition of the Ziegfeld Follies, replacing his younger brother Charlie. However, unlike the other Eaton siblings, he did not pursue show business as an adult. :He attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he performed with the Mask and Wig Society. After college, he worked with RKO Studios, joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, and worked as an Arthur Murray dance instructor.

The West Philadelphia Elevated, also known as the High Line or Philadelphia High Line, is a railroad viaduct in the western part of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The structure spans the railway lines of 30th Street Station, parallel to the main track of the station, in a north-south direction. The long approach made of brick arches is the longest brick bridge and probably even the longest brick building in the United States. The viaduct was built in 1903 by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and is now part of the Harrisburg Subdivision of CSX Transportation.  History  The High Line serves to bypass the area around 30th Street Station. At the turn of the century, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) carried out a number of upgrades on its route network. These were aimed at improving the handling of freight traffic, so that passenger and freight trains could be run on separate lines as much as possible. In the metropolitan area of Philadelphia, the route of the Northeast Corridor around Broad Street Station proved to be a bottleneck. The terminus station was located on the east side of the Schuylkill River and was connected via a wye on the west side of the river to the main line running there. In the area of these tracks there were also a railroad yard, various industrial plants, and from 1903, the West Philadelphia Station for through north-south trains. (West Philadelphia Station was replaced by 30th Street Station in 1933.) Connections to other railroad lines were nearby. On the north side, these included the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line to Harrisburg, the entrance to the 37th Street Yard, and the Junction Railroad connection to the PRR competitor Reading. On the south side, these included the line to West Chester and the connection to the Port of Philadelphia in the south of the city. With the West Philadelphia Elevated, two through tracks for freight traffic in north-south direction could be carried over these railway facilities. This would allow freight trains coming from New York City or Harrisburg to travel south to Baltimore and Washington, DC without stopping. Likewise, the Junction Railroad and the entrance to the port were connected to the viaduct. The construction was approved on December 24, 1902 by the city administration. The construction work was completed by the end of 1904.PRR CHRONOLOGY 1904 March 2005 Edition (PDF; 63 kB). (accessed December 31, 2008)  Description  The viaduct on the map near 30th Street Station. The viaduct extends over a total length of in the north-south direction and can be reached at both ends via railroad embankments. It makes a gentle left turn, which is required by the layout of the tracks around 30th Street Station around and ultimately by the Schuylkill itself. The southern approach lies between the tracks of the Northeast Corridor and the Schuylkill. Arsenal Interlocking, which marks the merger of the two lines, is located there. From the east, the Harrisburg Subdivision comes from the port and has just crossed the Schuylkill on the Arsenal Bridge, and from the southwest is the connecting track from the northeast corridor, which also serves as access from the parallel CSX Philadelphia Subdivision. The viaduct starts just after the merge of the two lines, about directly southwest of 30th Street Station. The High Line initially runs in a northeasterly direction. It crosses the main tracks of the Northeast Corridor at an acute angle, then passes immediately to the east of the Penn Medicine SEPTA station and over the South Street bridge. After about , the viaduct turns north and crosses Walnut Street, Chestnut Street, Ludlow Street, Market Street, and John F. Kennedy Boulevard in succession. The route runs along 31st Street in this area, following the alignment of the street grid. Then, it goes about west past the train sheds of 30th Street Station. The upper platform level of the tower station is crossed at its extreme western end. The ramp with brick arches on the north end. Next it begins a long left turn, which runs above the northern tracks of 30th Street Station. About after crossing the Spring Garden Street bridge, the viaduct connects to a long ramp that ends at 34th Street. This area is just southeast of Zoo Interlocking, the wye between the Northeast Corridor and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line. The ramp at the north end leads down to the middle of the track. However, at this point there are no more rail connections since about 1995.Mike Brotzman: Zoo Tower, 2008. (accessed January 1, 2009) The route heads northwest for about through a tunnel and leads to CSX's Trenton Subdivision, which in turn leads to Jersey City.  Changes in use  The West Philadelphia Elevated was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad to accommodate freight traffic along the Northeast Corridor. Freight trains were routed along the secondary tracks next to the main line itself, the most important of which was the connection to the port at the southern end. This did not change after the merger of the PRR and the New York Central Railroad into Penn Central in 1968, and Conrail's acquisition of the line in 1976 after Penn Central's bankruptcy. With the expansion of the Northeast Corridor for the Acela Express in the early 1990s, the freight traffic was then almost completely shifted to the parallel lines of the former PRR competitors Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B & O) and Reading, which at that time both belonged to CSX. From those lines, however, there has never been direct access to the Port of Philadelphia, so trains for the port continued to use the Junction Railroad and the High Line. The connections to the Northeast Corridor were dismantled. At the south end, a new connecting curve to CSX's Philadelphia subdivision was built, so that the viaduct together with the Junction Railroad forms a parallel route to the former B & O in the city of Philadelphia. Additionally, this provides rail access to the port.  Construction and appearance  The viaduct consists of two sections. The much larger part is a steel construction with 136 sections and the same number of columns. The section north of Spring Garden Street, on the other hand, consists of an arched bridge with 30 brick arches, that extends halfway up to 34th Street. The viaduct has a double track design and was probably electrified around 1930.Southeast Corner - 31st and Chestnut – This photograph from April 2, 1930 shows related work. The catenary wire is installed, but the wires of the overhead line are still missing. The western track is no longer passable since at least the late 1990s.According to this CSX track diagram, which dates from 1997-1998, this line was a single track at the time.  Steel construction  One of the steel sections. The basic construction of the two steel sections is a series of supporting frames (\\"portals\\") along the route, upon which a longitudinal beam pair rests for each of the two tracks. The frames are about high and are alternately spaced at about and apart, with the pairs closer together connected by diagonal rods for stiffening in the longitudinal direction and by beams in the transverse direction. Various longer spans along the route. However, local conditions required deviations from this scheme in some places. Where, for example, steel supports were not possible due to intersecting roads, a series of natural stone pillars were built. The associated spans often have excess length and are then either designed as a deck truss or (for larger passage heights) as a half-through plate girder bridge. The longest such section has a span of . Several of these long spans are related to the 1903 track layouts, but the track layout has changed completely since the Philadelphia improvements in the 1930s. Therefore, these spans do not always correspond with the modern conditions, so that their arrangement from today's point of view sometimes seems quite arbitrary. The crossing of the Northeast Corridor at the southern end. Other exceptions are the two crossings of the tracks below at the ends of the viaduct. Since the change in alignment of the tracks below, the viaduct crosses them at a very acute angle, so that its steel supports are at an angle to the viaduct and parallel to the intersecting tracks.  Brick arches  Two of the brick arches. The arched bridge at the northern end is long and comprises 30 arches, each with of open space. Brick was used for the masonry, contrary to the then-usual practice of the PRR to build bridges as far as possible in natural stone. This probably made this structure the longest brick bridge in the United States.Plowden, David: Bridges: The Spans of North America. W. W. Norton & Co., New York 1974, S. 30. Concrete, natural stone and bricks were available for the construction of this section at the time. Because concrete was considered unaesthetic and probably would have been too expensiveAt least according to contemporary statements comparing construction costs of bridges using different materials, such as in Schuylkill River Railroad Bridge. Engineering Record 69, No. 7, 14th February 1914: 196, the decision fell in favor of masonry. Because natural stone could not have been procured fast enough in the quantities needed, the choice ultimately fell to brick, although it was very labor-intensive.  Catenary  For the catenary, the typical PRR portal masts were used, which carry traction power lines at the highly extended upper ends of their supports. The masts are either mounted laterally to the steel columns of the viaduct or anchored in the ground next to it. Since the removal of the catenary in the 1980s, only the traction power lines still run along the High Line.  Further information   Literature  Plowden, David: Bridges: The Spans of North America .

It was described based on permineralised sori from the Early Cretaceous deposits of Apple Bay in Vancouver Island, British Columbia. C. cranhamii has sori arranged in two rows on narrow pinnules. They are covered by globose indusia which resemble those of Sphaeropteris species in morphology. Sporangia are circinate (ring-shaped) and bear multicellular stalks. They diverge from a basal, vascular receptacle. The sporangia contain 64 trilete spores which bear sculpturing on their outer covering (perispore) ranging from irregular granulate or echinate to prominent rodlets. The annulus is nearly vertical and arranged in a single series. It is not interrupted by the stalk. The specimens used to describe C. cranhamii are the first anatomically preserved tree fern sori known from the fossil record. Smith, Rothwell and Stockey (2003) state that \\"they represent the most ancient evidence for fertile structures of the Cyatheaceae and demonstrate that essentially modern species of cyatheaceous tree ferns had evolved by the Early Cretaceous\\". Numerous Cyathea species are present today in the Americas, especially the Greater Antilles, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.

Burnard was born in the village of Altarnun, on the edge of Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, and was the son of George Burnard, a local stonemason. He showed a talent for carving stone at an early age. Aged sixteen years, he sculpted a relief portrait of John Wesley over the doorway of Altarnun Wesleyan chapel next to his home. He went on to twice win the Silver Medal of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society.Annette Burnard and Annette Peach, ‘Burnard, Neville Northey (1818–1878)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 16 Nov 2007 He became a celebrated society sculptor, was introduced to Queen Victoria, and his work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London. He was in constant demand for public commissions, although he regularly returned to Cornwall. After turning to drink after the death of his daughter, he lost his wife and clients and returned to Cornwall permanently as a tramp. At one time he was reportedly discovered in a barn in St Cleer, where kindly folk looked after him until he went on the road again. He eventually died in Redruth Workhouse in 1878. He was buried in a pauper's grave in Camborne. In 1954 The Old Cornwall Society of Camborne erected a slate tombstone on his previously unmarked grave. Among his best known works are the statue of Richard Lander on the top of the Lander Memorial in Lemon Street, Truro, which he sculpted in 1852, (this has been the subject of much concern lately due to extensive erosion) and the memorial to Ebenezer Elliott in Sheffield (1854). As well as many fine gravestones, he also sculpted busts of Richard Trevithick, (now in the County Museum and Art Gallery in Truro), Dr George Smith in Camborne's Wesley Chapel, and William Bickford-Smith, MP for Truro and Helston, now at Trevarno, Cornwall.

It is also the site of three suicides by Lemp family members after the death of the son Frederick Lemp, whose William J. Lemp Brewing Co. dominated the St. Louis beer market before Prohibition with its Falstaff beer brand. The mansion is said to be haunted by members of the Lemp family. Architectural history The house was built in 1890 according to the St. Louis Tax records. In 1911, the house underwent major renovations including conversion of some space into offices for the Lemp Brewery, which then ceased all production when it was sold to International Shoe Company at auction in 1922. The Lemps lived in the house until 1949 when Charles Lemp committed suicide in his bed. In 1950, the mansion became a boarding house; throughout the next decade, it lost much of its ornate charm. The construction of Interstate 55 during the 1960s led to the destruction of much of the grounds and one of the carriage houses. Although many of the original details of the home have been replaced, there are still some remaining pieces. The decorative iron gates from the open-air elevator can be viewed from the basement restaurant. In the office where William Lemp, Jr. committed suicide, there is still an Italian marble mantel. The ceiling in the parlor is hand-painted, and the mantels are intricately carved African mahogany. The main bathroom includes a glass-enclosed shower that Lemp brought back to St. Louis from an Italian hotel. The three vaults where the Lemps stored their art pieces are located in the rear of the home. The Lemp Mansion is currently a restaurant and inn owned by the Pointer family; tours both historical and haunted are offered and it is a venue for murder mystery dinner theater and Halloween parties. There are other nearby buildings of historic interest including the Chatillon-DeMenil House at 3325 DeMenil Place. Lemp family history Adam Lemp and the Western Brewery The original patriarch of the Lemp Family was Johann \\"Adam\\" Lemp, born in 1798 in Grüningen (Pohlheim), Germany. He became a naturalized citizen in November 1841. He arrived in the United States in 1836, eventually settling in St. Louis in 1838. In the St. Louis city directory of 1840–41, he is listed as a grocer. Adam Lemp started a grocery store at Sixth and Morgan, called A. Lemp & Co., family grocery. This site is now occupied by the middle of the south side of The Dome at America's Center. In addition to typical groceries, Lemp sold his own vinegar and beer. By 1840 he focused solely on the manufacture and sale of beer, forming Western Brewery at 37 South Second Street (about where the south leg of the Arch now stands). Adam Lemp’s beer became very popular due to the increase of German population in the area. Lemp was one of the first in the country to produce German lager, which was a great difference from the English ale and porters. The business prospered, and when a large storage space became necessary, a cave in south St. Louis was used for this purpose as it provided natural refrigeration. The cave was below the current locations of the Lemp and Chatillon-DeMenil House and the Lemp Brewery. By the 1860s there were 40 breweries in the St.Louis area taking advantage of the caves along the Mississippi, with the Western Brewery emerging as one of the most successful. William J. Lemp Sr. Adam's son William J. Lemp was born in Germany in 1835. After completing his education at St. Louis University, he worked at the Western Brewery until he left the company to form a partnership with another brewer. In 1861, he enlisted in the United States Army, and achieved the rank of Orderly Sergeant. On December 3, 1861, he married Julia Feickert. On August 23, 1862, Adam Lemp died, and William returned to the Western Brewery as owner and operator. In 1864 he began building a larger brewery above the caves where Western had been storing its goods. Under William Lemp, the Western Brewery became the largest brewery in St. Louis, and then, the largest outside of New York with a single owner. William began to brew and bottle the beer in the same facility to meet growing demand, a practice that was rare at that time. Further demonstrating his innovation and business sense, in 1878 he installed the first refrigeration machine in an American brewery, and then extended the idea to refrigerated railway cars, in a successful attempt to be the first beer in the United States with a national reach. Soon, Lemp Beer was sold worldwide. In 1892, the William J. Lemp Brewing Company was founded from the Western Brewery with William as President, his son William Jr. as Vice- President, and his son Louis as Superintendent. William J. \\"Billy\\" Lemp, Jr., was born on August 13, 1867. Like his father, he went to St. Louis University and then studied the art of brewing. However, it was William Sr.'s fourth son, Frederick, born in 1873, whom he hoped to groom to take over the company. Unknown to William Sr. and his family, Frederick had significant health problems. On December 12, 1901, Frederick died of heart failure due to complication of diseases. William Sr. became despondent and slowly declined. He was dealt another blow on January 1, 1904, when his best friend Frederick Pabst died.Shepley, Carol Ferring. _Movers and Shakers, Scalawags and Suffragettes: Tales from Bellefontaine Cemetery._ Missouri History Museum: St. Louis, 2008. On the morning of February 13, 1904, William Lemp committed suicide by gunshot, and died at 10:15 a.m.MILLIONAIRE BREWER W.J. LEMP SUICIDES WHILE DESPONDENT, in the Tacoma Times; published February 13, 1904; retrieved December 26, 2014 (via Chronicling America) William J. Lemp, Jr. On November 7, 1904, William J. \\"Billy\\" Lemp, Jr., took over the brewing company as president. Billy had married Lillian Handlan five years earlier, and they moved to a new home at 3343 South 13th Street. Lillian Handlan Lemp was, allegedly, nicknamed the “Lavender Lady” for her lavender- colored wardrobe and carriages. She filed for divorce in 1908, charging Billy with desertion, cruel treatment and other indignities. Their divorce proceedings lasted 11 days and ended in Lillian being granted her divorce and custody of William III - their only child - with Billy given only visitation rights. After the trial, Billy built \\"Alswel\\" - his country home overlooking the Meramec River. The home was located in what is now the southern edge of Sunset Hills. By 1914, he lived at Alswel full-time. The Lemp Brewery suffered in the early 1920s when Prohibition began. The brewery was shut down and the Falstaff trademark was sold to Lemp's friend, \\"Papa Joe\\" Griesedieck. The brewery complex was sold at auction to International Shoe Company for $588,000. On December 29, 1922, Billy Lemp shot himself in his office -- a room that today is the front left dining room. Elsa Lemp Wright Elsa Lemp Wright, the youngest child of William Sr. married Thomas Wright, president of the More-Jones Brass and Metal Company in 1910. They separated in 1918 and in February, 1919, Elsa filed for divorce. She cited, among other things, damage to her mental and physical health. The divorce was granted after a trial, but Elsa and Thomas soon reconciled and remarried in March 1920. Later that month on March 20, Elsa shot herself while in bed at their house at 13 Hortense Place. Some suspect her death to be a murder masked as a suicide; a feature film exploring this idea, The Case for Elsa Lemp, is in development. William Lemp III In 1939, William J. Lemp III, the only son of Billy Lemp, licensed the Lemp name to Central Breweries of East St. Louis. Central Breweries renamed itself the William J. Lemp Brewing Company and began a grand marketing campaign resulting in increased sales of the new Lemp Beer. The contract was terminated by Ems Brewing, which bought out Lemp in 1945. Charles Lemp Charles Lemp, the third son of William Sr., was the final Lemp to live in the mansion, starting in 1929. He had left the brewery in 1917, to go into banking and finance. He had also dabbled in politics, influencing many southside wards. He never married and lived with his dog in the mansion with two servants, a married couple. April 1941, Charles Lemp sent a letter to a south St. Louis funeral home requesting that in case of his death, his remains should be taken by ambulance to the Missouri Crematory. His body should not be bathed, clothed, or changed. His ashes should be put into a wicker box and buried on his farm. There were to be no funeral held or a notice put in the papers. Eight years later, he shot himself in the head, leaving the following suicide note: \\"St. Louis Mo/May 9, 1949, In case I am found dead blame it on no one but me. Ch. A. Lemp\\". Edwin Lemp After Charles' death, the only surviving son of William Sr. was Edwin Lemp. (Louis Lemp, the second oldest son, had died of natural causes in 1931.) Edwin, the youngest son, had worked in the brewery until 1913. He then retired at \\"Cragwold\\", the estate he had built overlooking the Meramec River in 1911. \\"Cragwold\\", in western Kirkwood, had an observation tower, two servants' houses, and a collection of birds, antelope, sheep, yaks, buffalo and other animals. After his retirement, Edwin dedicated himself to many charitable causes, primarily the St. Louis Zoo. In 1970, Edwin died at the age of 90. His final order to his caretaker was to destroy his art collection and family heirlooms. Folklore According to local legend, Lemp Mansion is haunted by spirits. According to the Missouri History Museum, Life Magazine included the Lemp mansion in an article on America’s nine most haunted houses in 1980. In popular culture In 2010 the mansion was investigated by The Atlantic Paranormal Society, which was featured on the September 29 episode of Ghost Hunters.

The company was started in 1927 by Italian immigrant Pietro \\"Peter\\" Mule (changed to Mole). Born November 10, 1891, in the Italian town of Termini Imerese, Sicily, he first worked for General Electric (GE) in New York. In 1927 he began selling incandescent tungsten lighting to the film industry, which allowed a more natural lighting than the previous arc lights. The new lights were also silent, an advantage for the new sound films. Mole- Richardson invented the Fresnel Solar Spot unit in 1935, adapting the fresnel lighthouse lens for use in motion pictures. It won the first of four technical Academy Awards the company has earned. During World War II, Mole-Richardson concentrated their efforts on developing searchlights for battleships, tanks and artillery units to aid the Allied Forces' battle in Europe and the Pacific. In 1945, Peter Mole was invited to light the first United Nations conference held in San Francisco. Peter Mole died on August 2, 1960, very suddenly. His son-in-law, Warren Parker, took over the company. Mole- Richardson Company is now run by two of Warren Parker's four sons and grandchildren of Peter Mole, Larry Mole Parker and Mike Parker. Mole- Richardson is considered by many to be the staple of motion picture and television lighting in the movie industry today, setting the standard for tungsten fresnel fixtures.

The bandage or medical tape is usually stiff, not allowing the digits to move; the healthy digit acts as a splint, keeping the damaged one in a natural position for healing. Rest plays a major role in the healing process. Buddy wrapping may also be used for sprains, dislocations, and other injuries. This treatment may be performed by a physician or other medical professional in a hospital, orthopedic clinic, or other medical facility. Buddy wrapping may also be used when medical help is not immediately available, for example in the wilderness. Buddy wrapping can be a temporary solution or it can be used as a treatment all by itself. A layer of absorbent cotton or gauze is placed between the digits to prevent the breakdown of the skin with resultant ulcers and/or infection. The bandage is applied loosely, in several non-encircling layers. This avoids cutting off the blood flow to the digit that a too-tight wrap can precipitate. If the damaged part is only partly fractured, e.g., a greenstick fracture, the buddy wrapping method may also be used.http://boneandspine.com/what-is-buddy-wrapping/ See also * Elastic therapeutic tape * Elastic bandage * Self-adhering bandage * Athletic taping References Category:Emergency medicine Category:Sports medicine Category:Orthopedic surgical procedures ","title":"Buddy wrapping"},{"id":"8073843","text":"The Foreign Branches of Fondo de Cultura Económica (FCE) are offices this Mexican publishing house has established outside of Mexico.

The flesh is cream-coloured and spore print creamy white. The base colour of the cap under the scales is yellow. The cap is convex and 4-10 cm (1.5-4 in) across. The stipe (stem) is cylindrical and up to 10 cm (4 in) tall with a red scaly base developing to a yellow colour towards the cap. It has no ring or volva. Distribution and habitat 200px Tricholomopsis rutilans can be found growing on tree stumps and logs (especially those of spruce) in coniferous woodlands throughout the northern hemisphere, in places as diverse as Ireland, Bulgaria, Ukraine and North-West Russia, in late summer and autumn (June until November). It has also been found, probably accidentally introduced, in Australia and Costa Rica on introduced pine trees. A related species Tricholomopsis decora is also found in conifer woods but is golden in colour, much less common and found at higher altitudes.

The same image was used to illustrate Casimir III of Poland. Alexander Guagnini (,Annotated footnote to an edition of Compendium Maleficarum by Francesco Maria Guazzo and Montague Summers, ; 1538 in Verona, Republic of Venice – 1614 in Kraków, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) was an Venetian-born Polish writer, military officer, chronicler and historian of Italian heritage. He is known as a Crown Rotmistrz of Poland and Commandant of Vitebsk. Guagnini fought for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the Livonian War and the Moldavian Magnate Wars. Gwagnin is known for publishing the Latin book Sarmatiae Europeae descriptio, quae Regnum Poloniae, Lituaniam, Samogitiam, Russiam, Masoviam, Prussiam, Pomeraniam... complectitur, usually translated as \\"A Description of Sarmatian Europe\\" (printed in Kraków, 1578), which contained descriptions of the countries of Eastern Europe (history, geography, religion, traditions, etc.). The full name of his work is called \\"Sarmatiae Europeae descriptio, quae regnum Poloniae, Litvaniam, Samogitiam, Rvssiam, Massoviam, Prvssian, Pomeraniam, Livoniam, et Moschoviae, Tartariaeque partem complectitur\\". Along with his father, Guagnini came to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Livonian War. He spent almost his entire life in Poland and considered it his other Motherland and wrote about that in his Description of Sarmatian Europe. During his years of service Guanini was close to the Great Hetman Lithuanian and at the end of it he was closely connected with the court of Cracow Archbishop. He was referred in front of the Polish Sejm by the first persons of European states. Biography Research The earliest biographic information about Alexander Guagnini is recorded by Szymon Starowolski in his \\"Scriptorum Polonicorum εχατοντας\\" in 1622. Later briefly Guagnini was mentioned by Franciszek Bohomolec in the fourth volume of his \\"Zbior dziejopisow polskich w czterych tomach zawarty\\" (Work collection of Polish chroniclers in four volumes). It is possible that the information about the Italian was based on the excerpt from the Szymon Starowolski's book. A new source was introduced for the scientific circulation by Michał Wiszniewski in the mid 19th century, which was a recommendation letter of Russian voivode Mikołaj Sieniawski for Guagninis father and son to the King of Poland Sigismund Augustus dated 25 February 1561. It contained the following phrase in Old Polish language, \\"Wloch z Werony pan Ambrozy, z szynem ssvym Alexandrem\\" (Italian out of Verona Mister Ambrosius with his son Alexander). In 1860 Kazimierz Józef Turowski published excerpts out of the \\"Description of Sarmatian Europe\\". In his brief article about life and works of the Italian he provides extended quotes of the Franciszek Bohomolec foreword to the 1768 edition. In 1887 Italian historian Carlo Cipolla published a big research \\"One Italian in Poland and in Sweden on the border of the 17th century. Biographic information\\" (). As a result of his search in archival storages of Venetia and Verona, the historian discovered unknown earlier sources to biography of his countryman. Among other researchers about Guagnini was Polish author Antoni Pietkiewicz who edited the Guagnini's information in the Polish \\"Great General Illustrated Encyclopedia\\". In general, researchers were more interested in the issue of authorship of \\"Description of Sarmatian Europe\\". With a turn of the 20th century, the interest in Guagnini has dissipated. In 1960 Włodzimierz Budka edited an article about the chronicler in \\"Polish biographic dictionary\\" adding few more interesting details that he found in the Cracow's Archives. Based on documents from the archives, Budka discovered facts a rector's court appeal of a translator Grzegorz Czaradzki in reference of not payment by the Italian an agreed sum of money as well as a court appeal of Guagnini himself against a publisher Mikolaj Loba. In 1967 another article about Guagnini was published by Polish historian Andrzej Wyrobisz who specializes in history of Polish glass production industry. Outlook Alessandro Guagnini is of Italian origin. He was born in the city of Verona which was indicated at the publishing of his work, in Latin as Alessandri Guagnini Veronensis and in Polish as Przez Alexandra Gwagnina z Werony. Mykola Kovalskyi pointed out that in literature could be met two dates of his birth. One is 1534, while the other is mostly used 1538. Ukrainian writer Oksana Pakhlyovska, a daughter of a Polish writer Jerzy Jan Pachlowski, provided both dates in the \\"Ukrainian Literary Encyclopedia\\". The discrepancy could be solved after checking the Verona's archives that were found by professor Carlo Cipollo. According to them, the Guagnini family was quite famous and well respected in the city. Its representatives were members of the city council as early as the 15th century. His grandfather Ambrogio Guanini de'Rizzoni in 1529 at age of 48 lived in Veronian district Ferrabo and had six children. The oldest son Ambrogio was 23 years old. During the 1541 census his age was recorded as 32 instead of 35. Along with him to the list was added a wife Bertholomea 33 y.o. and three children Francesca 9, Alessandro 7, and Clara 4. In 1545 census Alessandro is recorded as 11 year old. Cipolla recalls also a list composed in 1555 where the age of future chronicler is indicated as 20. It is probably could be explain that to the document was entered a number of full years. Regardless of it, Carlo Cipollo who entered in scientific circulation the mentioned sources argued that Guagnini was born in 1538. Some writers (i.e. Wiszniewski, Turowski, others) did not indicated his year of birth, but wrote that the chronicler died in 1614 at age 76. Practically nothing is known about childhood and adolescence of Alessandro. Possibly during that time he learned military engineering and military topography that became useful during his service in the Polish military. Without referring to sources, S.Grzybowski, Julia Radziszewska and others were pointing to his skills in topography and map drawing. Military skills Allesandro, possibly, learned already in Poland from his father Ambrogio who quoting the words of voivode Seniawski was \\"a person educated in knightly affairs\\". More than likely yet in Italy Guagnini learned Latin in which he was writing freely as well as adopted some humanistic ideas of Italian culture. Particularly his historic and geographical work is noted for its great tolerance towards people of other nationalities and religious background. It is known that Ambrogio left Verona in 1555 along with his family. However, Alessandro stayed back for couple of year, possibly due to his education. Gassenkamp shared a thought that Guagnini senior left for Poland where since 1548 ruled Sigismund the Augustus, a son of Italian who was sympathetic towards former countrymen of his mother. After being able to save up some money, by 1558 Ambrogio invited his son. Gassenkamp and Budka expressed a guess that departure of Ambrogio could have been with political foundation. Grounds for that was exchange of letters between the King of Poland and the Herzog of Prussia during the winter of 1563 which included mentioning of Guagnini. Out of that Gassenkamp made a conclusion that before entering military service in Poland, Guagnini offered his service to Albrecht of Prussia. In 1571 he received an indygenat (a type of naturalisation through adaptation of nobility) from the King of Poland. At that time Gwagnin also adapted his family coat of arms with a hedgehog (according to Włodzimierz Budka), due to his official last name dei Rizzoni where riccio in Latin means hedgehog. European Sarmatia Chronicles Maciej Stryjkowski, who was his subordinate, alleged that Guagnini stole a manuscript of the Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all of Ruthenia from him and was not the author of the book. Stryjkowski protested before the Polish king and his claims were recognized in 1580, but the book continued to be printed under Guagnini's name and was translated into Polish.Oleg Łatyszonek, \\"From White Russia to Belarus\\" Annus Albaruthenicus, no. 5, 2004 An expanded edition appeared in 1611. The chronicle included portraits of Lithuanian dukes for the first time. Despite the images being purely fictional and having nothing to do with actual dukes, anachronistic clothes and weapons, and that some of the images illustrated multiple people, the portraits highly influenced future depictions of the grand dukes of Lithuania. To this day they remain the most popular portraits used in many history books.For example, Gimtoji istorija. Nuo 7 iki 12 klasės Copies of the book are preserved, among other places, in the Vilnius University Library and in the Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum in London.

Plot Tyler's plot explores the ways ordinary people react to disastrous events with quietly heroic behavior. When seventeen-year-old Ian Bedloe confronts his older brother Danny with his belief that the latter's wife, Lucy, is having an affair, Danny commits suicide. Shortly after, Lucy dies of an overdose of sleeping pills, and responsibility for the care of the deceased couple's three children (two from their mother's previous marriage) falls to their grandparents. A profoundly guilty Ian, who has discovered his accusations were wrong, receives spiritual guidance from Reverend Emmett of the storefront Church of the Second Chance, and he decides to drop out of college to become a carpenter and help his ailing parents with the children, until he eventually becomes their primary caretaker, sacrificing his own freedom to fulfill what he perceives to be a lifelong moral obligation. As the years pass and the three children mature, Ian continues to be torn between his sense of obligation to the children and the urge to have a \\"real life,\\" but he increasingly finds solace and peace in participation at the church and becomes devoted to it, its homespun followers, and Rev. Emmett. Ian also develops into a dependable and loving father. The two oldest children (Agatha and Thomas) eventually leave home and form their own families, while the youngest (Daphne) stays home with Ian and the grandparents. When the grandmother has a heart attack, Agatha returns to find a disorganized house and tries to restore order. Efforts to organize the house with help from Daphne's friend, a young female professional \\"Clutter Counselor\\"(Rita), ultimately provide Ian with an opportunity for a new beginning. \\"Moving back and forth among the points of view of various characters, Ms. Tyler traces two decades in the lives of the Bedloes, showing us the large and small events that shape family members' lives and the almost imperceptible ways in which feelings of familial love and obligation mutate over the years.\\"Kakutani, Michiko (August 30, 1991)“Books of the Times: Love, Guilt, and Change in a Family,” New York Times.

Indeed, this is a dialectic that every member of the Bedloe family must come to terms with by the end of the novel....Each character in \\"Saint Maybe\\" has been fully rendered, fleshed out with a palpable interior life, and each has been fit, like a hand-sawed jigsaw-puzzle piece, into the matrix of family life. The result is a warm and generous novel, a novel that attests once again to Ms. Tyler's enormous gifts as a writer and her innate understanding of the mysteries of kinship and blood.\\" Poet and novelist Jay Parini writes, \\"I adored Saint Maybe. In many ways it is Anne Tyler's most sophisticated work, a realistic chronicle that celebrates family life without erasing the pain and boredom that families almost necessarily inflict upon their members. Ian Bedloe, for his part, sits near the top of Ms. Tyler's fine list of heroes. Exactly how she makes us care so much about him remains a mystery to me. That is, perhaps, the mystery of art.\\"Parini, Jay (August 25, 1991)\\"The Accidental Convert,\\" New York Times In her review in the Christian Science Monitor, Marilyn Gardner summarizes, \\"In Saint Maybe, as in her other novels, Tyler dramatizes a debate about the pros and cons of family life. Is the family an anchor in the storm? Or is it a shackle? Do duty and devotion hold together the members who make up a family as well as the family itself? Or do families become, not support systems, but burdens of guilt, leading to damaging sacrifices of personal freedom?...As she explores the myriad ways in which dreams get deferred and hopes revised, infusing the prosaic details of domestic life with honor, humor, and deep affection, it is Anne Tyler's achievement to raise ordinariness to an art form.\\"Gardner, Marilyn (September 25, 1991) \\"Ordinariness as Art,\\" Christian Science Monitor, p. 13.

Pothuraju is an Avatar of Vishnu. He is considered a guardian angel in some parts of India. Pothurajus are priests who worship Lord Pothuraju. He is known as Potraj in the other states of India. The Potraj are a fast vanishing tribe that hail from the Western state of Maharashtra. They are worshipers of a goddess that is referred to as ‘Kadak Lakshmi’. The Potraj are nomads who get alms for displaying an extremely grueling performance. The women balance a small platform with their deity perched on their heads and play a drum to a foot-tapping beat while the men dance, twirl and smack themselves with heavy whips made out of woven coir or leather. The whips may weigh in the region of 10 kg (22 lbs) each and are knotted for added measure and land on the backs of these performers with a resounding ‘thwack’. Children are thrust into this profession at a very early age so that they may grow up and be able to bear the crack of the whip on their backs. Young boys may start as early as the age of six with lighter whips till they reach puberty and their teens and graduate to heavier whips. Apart from the gruelling treks between cities, nights spent exposed to the elements, unrelenting sun above their heads the entire day and the unforgiving rope whip on their backs, the members end up living a hand to mouth existence on what can only be described as meager charity.

At one time he held the position of rabbi at Oran, Algeria, but late in life he left that city to settle in Amsterdam, where he opened a Talmudical school which counted among its pupils Manasseh ben Israel and Isaac Aboab da Fonseca. Dissatisfied with the laxity in religious matters which he noticed among many members of the Sephardic community, Uziel delivered a series of lectures which led to the foundation of a new congregation under the name of \\"Neveh Shalom\\". In 1610, at the death of Judah Vega, the first rabbi of the new congregation, Uziel was called to the rabbinate. Uziel was the author of a Hebrew grammar, Ma'aneh Lashon, edited by his pupil Isaac Nehemiah at Amsterdam in 1627 (2nd ed. 1710). He left also in manuscript many Hebrew and Spanish poems (Libros Poeticos en Declaracion de Todos los Equivocos de las Sagradas Letras); these are highly praised by De Barrios, who represents the author as a great poet, an able musician, and a distinguished mathematician. Joseph Serrano dedicated a poem to Uziel; it is inserted in the Temime Derek.

It is located in the northern part, between Rîbniţa and Camenca. It is composed of two villages, Iantarnoe (Янтарне, Янтарное) and Rașcov.Clasificatorul unităților administrativ-teritoriale al Republicii Moldova (CUATM) History Rașcov village was founded in 1402 as a trading post on the Dniester river. Some maintain that the name derives from the Romanian term for Lactarius deliciosus, a variety of mushroom. However, there are a number of settlements across Poland and Ukraine with the same name, casting doubt on this claim. Rashkov () is also a Bulgarian male surname. One of the oldest villages of Transnistria, it is known for having historically possessing a significant Polish population. From the 15th century, all of northern Transnistria was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,George Reichersdorf: Moldaviæ quæ olim Daciæ pers, chorographia, Georgio a Reichersdorf Transilvano auctore, Viennæ 1541.Bronovius and Georg Werner: Transylvania, Moldavia and Chersonesus Tauricæ.

During the Middle Ages, the village hosted one of seven major fairs for the Dniester-Southern Bug area (the others being Mohuliv, Dubăsari, Yampil, Silibria, Yaruga, and Vasilcău). Before becoming part of the Russian Empire in 1793 during the second partition of Poland, the largest groups living between the Dniester and the Bug rivers were Moldavian, Ruthenian (Ukrainian) and Tatar peasants.Andrew Wilson: \\"The Ukrainians: Engaging the Eastern Diaspora\\" (Westview Press, 1998)  Hasidic history Raşcov was the residence for Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne, a leading Jewish Hasidic tzaddik and one of the first of the disciples of the founder of Hasidic Judaism, the Baal Shem Tov. His book, Toldos Yaacov Yosef, (published on 1780), was the first chassidic work ever published. In it repeats the phrase, \\"I have heard from my teacher\\", 249 times. He is one of the foremost sources for teachings from the Baal Shem Tov. Reb Yaacov Yosef was also somewhat known for his abrupt temperament, yet his teachings on the Zaddik, the saint-mystic and holy leader, provide an example of attainment of the highest degree of spiritual solitude, while also exemplifying the piety of a respected leader at the center of the community. Rabbi Jacob Joseph came to Raşcov as a result of his exile from Shargorod. Having been the rabbi of Shargorod for several years, Rabbi Jacob Joseph was expelled from his position in Shargorod on a Friday afternoon in 1748. In several of his responsa, which he wrote in Raşcov, he reveals the suffering which he had undergone.Dresner Zaddik; p. 57 He would later leave Raşcov after being appointed rabbi in Nemirov, a center of Hasidism, where he practiced daily fasting for five years, until the Besht came upon him. The family continued to have a presence in the local Jewish community, as Rabbi Jacob Joseph's son was Rabbi Samson of Raszkow. Historic sites Rașcov and the surrounding area is home to numerous historic monuments and architecture, among them the Polish Roman Catholic Saint Cajetan Church, considered a historical heritage. It has recently undergone extensive renovation. The church was built when this part of Transnistria was a part of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom, with generous contributions by the Moldavian prince Petru Rareş. Landscape Outside Rașcov is located the Rascov National Park, an extensive natural landscape preserve, and an ecologically protected area.http://www.biotica-moldova.org/library/Shar_ro.pdf Classification More recently, the Transnistrian separatist authorities have edited an Atlas of Pridnestrovie, which refers to the area around Rașcov as the \\"Pridnestrovian Alps\\": Time, wind, and water have eroded the abrupt slopes near the village of Rashkov, having formed the limestone outliers, towering above the slopes.

Career In the 2005–06 season, while playing for Gorica, Burgič was the top goalscorer of the Slovenian League with 24 goals in 35 games. At that time he was a prospect for French, Swiss and German clubs. However, Burgić signed for AIK in the summer of 2006. In his home debut he scored two goals against Östers IF. Immediately he showed great ability to score in the penalty area with both feet and headers. Due to two severe knee injuries he did not reach his top level during his spell in Sweden. During the summer 2008 when Burgič was back after injury he scored several goals and was close to a transfer to Greek side AEK Athens. However, he was stopped by then manager Rikard Norling, who considered him crucial for the team. After the 2008 season Norling got the sack and was replaced by Mikael Stahre. Burgič got the first half of the season destroyed by a knee-injury, and after his recovery he was not considered first choice among the strikers. In the same year the club won the title for the first time in eleven years, but Burgic only did nine appearances, including being substituted lately in the decisive game against IFK Göteborg where the club secured the title. After the 2009 season Burgič wanted a new challenge and decided to not extend his contract that was about to expire in the summer of 2010. At the same time he was aspiring for a place in the Slovene national team that was about to participate in the World Cup. The club faced a tough campaign and had to fight to avoid relegation, and despite only playing occasionally, Burgič managed to score five goals, including two against Kalmar FF in a 3-0-win. In his last game for AIK, which was also the club's last game before the break for the World Cup, he scored a hat-trick in the club's 4-1-win against Åtvidaberg. Despite not playing regularly during the spring of 2010, Burgič was on the verge to break into the Slovenian squad that participated in the World Cup, and was included in the initial 30-man squad. However, he did not make the final cut. Shortly after it was announced that he had signed a contract with Austrian side Wacker Innsbruck on a free transfer. In the Austrian club he got somewhat of a new role, where he acted more of a second-striker. In summer 2012 Burgič left Wacker Innsbruck since the club's finances were in terrible state. He later signed for Israeil side Hapoel Ramat Gan in the Israeli Premier League.

Revolutionary activities Elofre began his revolt when, as cabeza de barangay, he failed to collect all the taxes from his constituents. Spanish soldiers beat his father, Cris Elofre, to death in order to teach him a lesson. Thereafter, he rallied the people against the forced payment of taxes. Later, he included religious freedom as part of his agenda, and directed the celebration of the ancient rites of the babaylan (ancient Visayan shaman), a revival of the religious leader of the pre-Spanish era. He and his followers were later called the babaylanes, which numbered about 2,000. Elofre reputedly dressed in female clothing and was said to be effeminate in the same manner as ancient asog shamans. Death The activities of Elofre so alarmed the Spanish colonial government that Governor-General Valeriano Weyler sent 500 men of the Guardia Civil and a battleship to Negros to deal with the threat. In August 22, 1887, Elofre raided Siaton, the town adjoining Zamboanguita, and was killed in the encounter with colonial forces. His wife, Flaviana Tubigan, continued the revolt, but lacked her husband's charm and charisma. She was succeeded by Ka Martin de la Cruz, of Tolong in southern Negros Oriental, Elofre's lieutenant, but his command of the babaylanes degenerated into banditry. When the Spanish authorities failed in their bid to capture him, on September 11, 1893, de la Cruz was killed in a trap laid by his own mistress, Alfonsa Alaidan. The remaining Buhawi followers, conjectures Modesto P. Sa-onoy, were later recruited by Papa Isio when he began to organize his own group of babaylanes in another revolt against Spain.Calma, Ma.

The Power Surge was first operated in 1999, and is produced in both trailer-mounted and park versions. Zamperla recommends that riders be 48 inches (122 cm) or taller; however, 52 inches (132 cm) is more common. Design and operation Joyland's Power Surge in the racked or transportable position Six fixed arms are connected in an asterisk pattern, with two sets of two seats attached at right angles to the arms. The arm assembly is connected to a main arm. Twenty-four riders at a time can be loaded onto the ride. Riders are restrained by an over-the-shoulder harness, with their legs dangling free for excitement. When this ride is activated, multiple movements occur. The arm assembly rotates, the main arm is raised from the stationary position to an angle of approximately seventy degrees from the horizontal. Once this height is reached, the main arm is capable of rotating, with the combined rotations of both sections causing the seat sets to swing and rotate around the point of attachment. The rotating components can move in both clockwise and anti- clockwise directions, and the different movements can be activated in isolation of each other. The trailer version of the ride fits onto a standard road trailer, and can be assembled or racked in approximately 2 hours by two people.

It lies on the south bank of the River Stour one mile upstream from the town of Harwich, opposite the Port of Felixstowe. The port was formerly known as Parkeston Quay. History Young Jewish refugees from Germany at Harwich in 1938 The Great Eastern Railway, which was formed from the merging of the Eastern Counties Railway and the Eastern Union Railway in 1862, operated passenger steamers across the North Sea from Harwich to continental Europe. By 1872, shipping trade had increased so that more capacity was required and the Great Eastern Railway obtained permission to reclaim land at Ray Farm, a mile to the west of Harwich, and build a new quay. This new quay was opened in 1883 by Charles H. Parkes, the then Chairman of the Great Eastern Railway company, the port being named after him as Parkeston Quay. The port had its own railway station, and a hotel was built between the northern platform and the quay; the hotel building is now used as offices. The railway station was originally called Parkeston Quay, but was renamed Harwich Parkeston Quay in 1934 when the new Parkeston Quay West station was opened to serve the west end of the quay. It was given its current name, Harwich International, in 1995. The port remained under the ownership of the Great Eastern Railway until 1923 when the company became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). In 1939 the Admiralty requisitioned Parkeston Quay for naval purposes, naming it HMS Badger. It was released back to the LNER in 1946. On 1 January 1948 the LNER was nationalised and the port came under the ownership of British Railways (BR). In 1984, as part of the privatisation of BR's Sealink ferry services, the port was sold to Sealink's new owners Sea Containers, which then sold it on to Stena Line in 1989.\\"The Great British Rail Sale is Over\\" The Railway Magazine issue 1152 April 1997 page 24 In 1997 Parkeston Quay was acquired by Hutchison Port Holdings, which renamed the port Harwich International Port.History Hutchison Ports Current operations Royal Princess at the port Passport stamp The main user of the port is the regular ferry services of Stena Line to the Hook of Holland. Previously, DFDS Seaways operated services to Esbjerg, Denmark (ceased 29 September 2014), Cuxhaven (and before that to Hamburg), Germany, and Gothenburg, Sweden; the latter two services were discontinued by 2005. Cruise ships once called regularly at the port during the summer months, although in recent times these calls have become more and more infrequent. The year 2016 saw 12 visits – the lowest since the service started. While the majority of opinion puts this down to the recent economic downturn, others feel the reason is due to the lack of facilities for visitors when compared to the likes of Southampton or Dover. Tankers call at the Petrochem Carless refinery, and some general cargo and bulk cargos are worked at the port. As of May 2010, the port was the base for the installation of the offshore Greater Gabbard wind farmOffshore wind handled at Harwich Breakbulk, 21 May 2010.

He attended the University of Berlin pursuing both undergraduate and postgraduate studies from 1928 through 1932.

(1953): Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological Examination, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, vol. 43, pp. 226-245. It was both a repudiation of Richard Hartshorne's position in United States, and a call for a scientific approach to geography based upon the search for geographical laws (the ultimate form of a scientific generalization). Schaefer died before his article even appeared in print, and so he was never able to elaborate his argument, nor defend himself from Hartshorne's subsequent critique. But the article became a rallying point for the younger generation of economic geographers who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science, or spatial science as it was later dubbed. The subject has now been revived by economists under the umbrella of the new economic geography. Other sources Schaefer's papers were donated to the American Geographical Society by his wife, Mary Strub Schaefer.

He previously held high- ranking roles at NFL Network, ESPN, and ABC. While at ESPN, he organized putting SportsCenter reruns on during the morning hours. Early life and education Bornstein was born and raised in a Jewish familyLos Angeles Times: \\"NFL's Steve Bornstein defends Thursday games, talks new package\\" by Joe Flint October 28, 2013 in Fair Lawn, New Jersey to Julian Leon and Marge Frankel Bornstein, as the youngest of four, the others being Fred, Andy, and Faye.Hiestano, Michael. \\"Pioneer steers ABC, ESPN to top of game\\", USA Today, December 10, 1997. Accessed March 29, 2011. \\"He grew up on TV in Fair Lawn, N.J., where he fantasized about becoming an Olympic skier.\\" He attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison and graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Science in communications. Career Bornstein began his career as a producer, and later executive producer, at WOSU-TV in Columbus, Ohio. He also worked with Warner-Amex Cable, producing Ohio State Buckeyes football programming for the company's interactive QUBE system. ESPN In January 1980, he joined ESPN as manager of program coordination when the cable sports network was a four-month-old start-up. During his time as manager of programming coordination, he developed and implemented ESPN's successful programming philosophy of presenting a mix of events, sports news and special interest programming. In 1988, Bornstein was promoted to Executive Vice President of Programming and Production. He advanced through the network’s programming and production ranks, becoming ESPN’s youngest president and CEO in 1990 at age 38. In January 1992, ESPN Radio was launched and began a rollout of 24-hour programming in October 1998. Also in 1992, Bornstein established the subsidiary ESPN Enterprises to develop new businesses like ESPN.com, which has grown to become the leading sports news and information site on the internet. Bornstein helped to oversee the debut of ESPN2 in October 1993 and ESPNews in November 1996. In October 1997, Bornstein directed the acquisition of Classic Sports Network and rebranded the channel as ESPN Classic, adding yet another network to the ESPN family. Additionally, Bornstein oversaw the development of ESPN International, which has grown to include ownership - in whole or in part - of 24 television networks internationally, as well as a variety of additional businesses that allow ESPN to reach sports fans in over 61 countries and territories across all seven continents. In March 1998, ESPN the Magazine was launched as a joint venture of Disney Publishing and ESPN with distribution being handled by Hearst Magazines. Throughout his time at ESPN, the network created many of the popular programming staples that still thrive today, including the iconic SportsCenter franchise, NFL Countdown, NFL PrimeTime, Baseball Tonight and the Outside the Lines series. In addition to his contributions to ESPN programming, Bornstein developed the X Games and Winter X Games, week-long extreme sports competitions. Bornstein is also credited with the creation of the ESPYs Awards, short for Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Award. First awarded in 1993, the ESPYs gather top celebrities from sports and entertainment to commemorate the past year in sports by recognizing major sports achievements, reliving unforgettable moments and saluting the leading performers and performances. During his tenure at ESPN, Bornstein's team won 59 Emmys and 57 Cable Ace Awards. American Broadcasting Company In April 1996, Bornstein was named President of ABC Sports. In a short time, Bornstein established ABC Sports as the preeminent network of college football, creating the College Football Championship Series, and extending contracts with all major CFB conferences. In 1999, Bornstein was named President of ABC, where he was responsible for all the media network and cable assets at ABC/Disney. NFL Network In January 2003, Bornstein was appointed President and CEO of NFL Network and Executive Vice President of Media by then NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. While at the NFL, Bornstein oversaw the league's media division, which included the relationships with national broadcast and sponsorship partners as well as NFL-owned media assets and revenue. In November 2003, Bornstein launched NFL Network, which was the most widely distributed sports network in the history of the industry when it launched and became the youngest network ever to win a Sports Emmy after just 58 days on the air. In 2009, Bornstein spearheaded the creation of NFL RedZone, the widely acclaimed channel produced by NFL Network that whips around live to every NFL game on Sunday afternoons delivering the touchdowns and most exciting moments to viewers. Under Bornstein’s leadership, NFL Network and NFL RedZone completed distribution deals with Cablevision and Time Warner Cable in 2012. Currently in more than 72 million homes, NFL Network now has carriage agreements with each of the country’s largest television providers including Comcast, DirecTV, DISH Network, Cablevision, Cox, Charter, Time Warner Cable, Verizon FiOS and AT&T; U-Verse. Ultimately, Bornstein would bring the league’s internet and mobile assets in-house and help build NFL Media into a collection of league-owned media assets including NFL Network, NFL.com, NFL Mobile, NFL RedZone, NFL Now, and NFL Films along with the NFL’s highly visible social media platforms. While building out and growing the NFL’s own media assets, Bornstein reconfigured and repackaged the NFL’s television assets and helped the league bring NBC back into the fold, move Monday Night Football to ESPN, introduced flexible scheduling, and created a new package of Thursday primetime games for NFL Network, all while creating more value for the NFL and its television partners. Bornstein was instrumental in the December 2011 landmark nine-year extensions with CBS, FOX and NBC which continue the NFL’s tradition on broadcast television through the 2022 season. Those new deals came just three months after he helped secure an eight-year agreement to keep Monday Night Football on ESPN until 2021. Bornstein also helped lead renewal negotiations in 2014 with DirecTV for exclusive rights to carry NFL Sunday Ticket and its package of every Sunday afternoon out-of-market game through a new multi-year agreement. The 2014 renewal also expanded DirecTV’s rights to stream NFL Sunday Ticket live on mobile devices and via broadband, known as NFL Sunday Ticket TV. In 2014, Bornstein was succeeded by Brian Rolapp as CEO of NFL Network. Charitable activities Bornstein takes part in numerous charitable activities with a wide range of organizations. He is the founder and current Board Chair of The V Foundation, one of the nation’s leading cancer research funding organizations, which has raised more than $125 million for cancer research in the name of late college basketball coach Jim Valvano. In addition, he has served on the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and the California Governor’s Council on Physical Fitness, the National Cable Television Association, Hampton University, Steamboat Ventures, and Infoseek. Activision Blizzard and FlockU.com On October 21 video game publisher Activision Blizzard announced the establishment of a new esports competitive video game division headed by Chairman Steve Bornstein and Senior Vice President Mike Sespo of Major League Gaming. He is currently on the Board of Directors for hudl. Personal life Bornstein lives in Los Angeles with his wife Carol and four children.

They were passive participants in a system that did not foster active engagement. Often there was a lack of continuity between lecture and section. Students had widely varying levels of knowledge about the texts. Faculty had very little information about the students’ knowledge as the course proceeded and the students had little feedback on their performance. Course design The curriculum was based on the reading of five texts, Genesis, Blade Runner, Hamlet, Descartes' Meditations, from the viewpoint of the scholar of history, literature, or philosophy. The course emphasized methods of reading and critical and interpretive approaches, rather than content. This first year course met weekly in two one-hour lectures for all 100 students and two one-hour discussion section meetings of 15 students each. Students and instructors engaged in web activities including structured reading assignments and asynchronous discussion forums. The web site provided rich resources to supplement the texts. Students worked cross-section group projects and on panel discussions. There was no final exam for the course; a fair was held in which students exhibited their project web sites. Technology Course Web Site Home Page with Announcements *Central Course Web Site A site that had a calendar, announcements, faculty bios, the asynchronous discussion forums, assignments, and student projects Web Site Genesis Material *Rich Web Resources The course web site linked rich resources supporting each text to engage students from novices to those well-informed on the texts. It included explanatory information, annotations, cultural information, critical analyses, visual interpretations of the texts including paintings, video recordings of multiple performances, and different cuts of the films. Web Reading Assignment *Structured Readings The web site also had a series of on-line assignments that structured the learners’ reading activities. These on-line activities drew upon the students’ previous knowledge and guided them as they approached each text. In the first year of the project in 1997 students responses were recorded in a personal on-line, shareable portfolio, but after noting little use of the portfolio, the design was changed in the second iteration of the course in 1998 so that assignments were displayed directly in the discussion Forum. * The Forum The Forum had special features to support large lecture courses such as photographs of the posting student next to his/her message, organization into sections, and notification systems to alert faculty and groups to special postings. The forum was used to discuss lectures; it was where assignments were posted (they were not sent to an instructor); and was used for communication in forming project groups. The Forum was enhanced in the second year to allow direct linkage to assignments, faculty-controlled subject organization, and threaded discussion. * Student Project Web Sites The students in the course completed projects in the second half of the course that demonstrated their understanding of the texts. Projects were constructed in many media the first year but were limited to posters and web sites in the second. Faculty met often with students helping them to plan their projects. All projects from the previous year were available as models when the course was repeated. * Evaluation The project employed several modes of project and technology evaluation: questionnaires, interviews, video interaction analysis, peer review, and ethnographic studies. Findings: -The Forum provided a venue for discussion by quiet students and accommodated different learning styles. -The Forum and assignments helped students prepare for face-to-face meetings by discussing basic issues before class. -It added to workload of teaching staff. -There was a positive correlation between scores on papers and number of Forum postings.

The tune usually used (especially for the chorus) is \\"In and Out the Windows\\".  Lyrics  The opening verse is typically something along the lines of: However, the lyrics exist in numerous variations. For example, the last line varies, being substituted with any of a large variety of phrases such as 'Our crest a rampant penis',Sebastian Hogbotle and Simon Feckes Snatches and Lays (Melbourne: Sun Books: 1973). pg. 87. 'With a mouth full of dead man's penis', or 'Sucking on a red-hot penis'.Loudon Wainwright III \\"Good Ship Venus\\" on Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys 2006 The usual rhyming structure for this song is the limerick AABBA structure.  Origin  It is possible that this song was inspired by an actual event, where a female convict (Charlotte Badger), sailing on the colonial brigantine Venus, convinced members of the crew to commandeer the vessel, sailing from Port Dalrymple, Tasmania, (now part of George Town, Tasmania) in 1806. Despite various reports, the ultimate fate of the Venus is unknown. This may have led to speculation by those left behind, with fantasies leading to the creation of this drinking song. One of the verses also refers to a 'Charlotte':  HMS Venus, RN  Five ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name between 1758 and 1972. The most recent was a destroyer launched in 1943, which was converted into a fast frigate in 1951, and served during the 1950s and 60s, to the surprise of those who assumed the name in the song to be apocryphal. (She was a sister ship of HMS Troubridge, whose name inspired the fictional \\"HMS Troutbridge\\" in the long-running BBC radio comedy The Navy Lark of the same period).  Recordings  Notable recordings include the Oscar Brand 1952 version, and the British punk band Sex Pistols, which appears on their Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle album, and appears as the finale track in the film of the same name. Released as part of a double-A side, it reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart in 1979 and was the band's biggest selling single. When a ship was required in The Goon Show it was often named the \\"Good Ship Venus\\" or \\"HMS Venus\\", one of several references to dirty jokes the Goons managed to get past the 1950s BBC censors. The American thrash metal band Anthrax covered the Sex Pistols' version, but with different lyrics. In 2006 Loudon Wainwright III recorded it on the compilation album Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys. The American punk band Showcase Showdown also released a version of the song on a tribute to the Sex Pistols. Serbian punk rock musician Toni Montano recorded a version of the song, with lyrics in the Serbian language, entitled \\"Frigidna je bila\\", relying on the Sex Pistols version. In British director Ken Russell's 2005 \\"Hot Pants Trilogy\\", \\"The Goodship Venus\\" short was billed as a musical trip around Cape Horn with \\"as horny a crew of sex-crazed sailors who ever sailed the seven seas.\\" The trilogy received its world premiere at the Oldenburg Festival, Germany in Sept 2005.  In popular culture  The chorus from the Sex Pistols' version of the song was used in the opening titles of the Channel 4 situation comedy Captain Butler; minor variations to the words (in spoken form) were added, notably by the series' lead actor Craig Charles. A Royal Navy ship Venus is the setting of the film Carry On Jack. Also, in the Television Series Man About the House, George Roper tries to teach his budgerigar 'Oscar' the song 'On Board the Good Ship Venus' in the episode 'One more for the pot' (Season 6, Episode2).

Nagar, Chennai. It is one of the principal shopping districts of Chennai. Etymology The market ‘Soundarapandianar Bazaar' was named after Justice Party politician W. P. A. Soundarapandian Nadar whose statue is situated in the square. The police station in that area is officially called 'Soundarapandiyanar Angadi Kaval Nilayam'. Transport Theyagaraya Road, which is the arterial road of Pondy Bazaar, suffers from slow-moving traffic. To ease the traffic, the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (Chennai) has diverted buses going to the T. Nagar bus terminus that used to go via Pondy Bazaar. They now travel via the Thanikachalam Road- Burkit Road route. For some routes, such as the 47s and 11s, the buses occasionally go via Pondy Bazaar and occasionally via the diversion. Private vehicles headed for the T. Nagar bus terminus or for Anna Salai (Saidapet and beyond) are strongly encouraged to either use the Thanikachalam Road route or Boag Road, rather than the Pondy Bazaar route, especially during rush hour. Shopping district Clothes Footwear Mobiles Accessories Pondy Bazaar has a wide variety of clothing, accessories and footwear stores in all price ranges within a two or 3 km radius. It is a one stop destination for the multi-brand Retail.

The album was released on April 28, 1998 and now generally considered a trip hop classic despite poor sales. Despite its containing several expletives and sexual content, the album was not released with a Parental Advisory warning. Thanks in part to the success of the album's music videos, the album has sold over 100,000 copies in the United States, and achieved Gold certification in the artist's native Canada. Background Esthero and Doc McKinney met in January 1996 at the EMI in Toronto. The pair's demos sparked interest from Warner Music Group, EMI and BMG in Canada. Esthero's managers, Zack Werner and Beau Randall, signed them directly to Sony Music Entertainment in U.S. The duo suddenly wrote \\"Superheroes\\", \\"Indigo Boy\\" and \\"That Girl.\\" In August 1996 they wrote another 4 tracks, include the single \\"Heaven Sent\\". In late January, 1998, prior to album's release 15,000 copies of promo EP \\"Short of Breath\\", featuring tracks \\"Breath from Another\\", \\"Heaven Sent\\", \\"Country Livin' (The World I Know)\\" and \\"That Girl\\" were sent to Sony Music staff worldwide. McKinney stated in a 2016 NPR interview that, when writing and producing the album, he was inspired by reggae, calypso, and house music, three genres that didn't receive much exposure in his native Minneapolis, also citing Björk, Portishead, and Massive Attack as influences. Critical reception Breath from Another received positive reviews from music critics. Tom Demalon of Allmusic stated that album \\"too scrumptious sounding to be ignored\\", however called it unfocused. He praised tracks \\"That Girl\\" and \\"Country Livin' (The World I Know)\\" as album's best offerings. Chris Molanphy of CMJ New Music Monthly noted that album sounds \\"slick for starters; clamorous but never abrasive, yearning but not very dark\\" and \\"organic\\". The A.V. Club's review, penned by David Peisner, was also positive, commenting that while some of the songs were unimaginative, some (such as \\"Heaven Sent\\" and \\"Country Livin'\\") were more unusual, and praising Esthero's vocals as \\"sublime\\" and \\"sultry\\". Accolades At the Juno Awards of 1999, the album received a nomination for \\"Best Alternative Album.\\" However, it lost to Rufus Wainwright's eponymous debut album. In 2016, the album was nominated for a Polaris Heritage Prize, for best album from 1996-2005. The album lost, however, to Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" (which won the public vote) and Lhasa de Sela's \\"La Llorona\\" (which won the jury vote). Commercial performance Despite not charting in any country, the album sold 118,000 copies in the US and over 250,000 copies worldwide as of 2005. In Esthero's native country Canada, the album sold over 50,000 copies and received Gold certification. \\"Heaven Sent\\" and \\"That Girl\\" received significant play on Canadian television (namely the music channel MuchMusic), and also received some airplay on MTV. \\"Heaven Sent\\" reached number 27 on MTV's most-played videos chart. Singles \\"Heaven Sent\\" was released as the album's first official single. It was released as a double A-side CD single with \\"Breath from Another\\". A music video was shot and received MTV airplay. The single charted at #4 on Billboard Hot Dance Breakout Maxi-Singles Sales. \\"That Girl\\" was slated to be the album's second official single, but was never officially released commercially. It was released as the album's second promotional single instead. A music video was shot and aired on MuchMusic. Uses in media The title track was featured on the CMJ New Music Monthly February 1998 promotional CD. \\"Lounge\\" appears on the soundtrack to film Zero Effect.

Vanderbilt (July 7, 1888 – June 16, 1957) was an American judge and judicial reformer. He served as Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court from 1948 to 1957, the first Chief Justice under the revamped New Jersey court system established by the Constitution of 1947, in which the Supreme Court replaced the old Court of Errors and Appeals as the highest court. He also was an attorney, legal educator and proponent of court modernization. Early years and education Vanderbilt was born on July 7, 1888, in Newark, New Jersey, to Louis and Ellen H. ( Leach) Vanderbilt. He had one sibling, a younger brother named Leslie He attended Newark (now Barringer) High School where he was class president, editor of the newspaper, and a member of two fraternal groups, The Ramblers (later Omega Gamma Delta) and Lambda Tau. Following high school he took off a year to work on the railroad to earn money for college. He attended Wesleyan University, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon, president of the student body, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. A sidelight of his Wesleyan career was the inauguration of President William A. Shanklin. Vanderbilt was one of the inauguration speakers, along with U. S. President William Howard Taft, and then startled Taft by showing up later as a waiter at the inaugural dinner. Vanderbilt then attended Columbia University School of Law. Career Many of Vanderbilt's ideas for court reform had been incorporated into the new judicial article of the New Jersey Constitution. One of those innovations was the designation of the Chief Justice as the administrative head of all courts in the state, replacing the previous system of almost completely autonomous courts. As Chief Justice, he created the first state Administrative Office of the Courts in the nation. An appreciation of the changes brought to the New Jersey judicial system can be gained from a comparison between the structure of the courts before the new constitution and after. There were over 20 different courts in the system (e.g.-superior court, supreme court, court of errors and appeals, chancery, oyer & terminer, orphan's court, county court, general sessions, quarter sessions, etc., etc., etc.) which were replaced by the New Jersey Supreme Court, the Superior Court (Law, Chancery and Appellate Divisions), County Court, County District Court and the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. The County Courts were merged into the Superior Court, Law Division, as were the County District Courts, now known as the Special Civil Part of the Superior Court, and the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, now the Family Part of the Chancery Division. These were joined by the Tax Court. In addition, there are Municipal Courts which handled minor criminal and ordinance violations. In the new practice, if an action is filed in the wrong court there is a procedure to transfer the matter to the proper court. Previously, filing the action in the wrong court was a fatal defect if the matter was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Professor John Lynch, who taught Constitutional Law and New Jersey Practice at The Seton Hall School of Law in the 1970s and 80s, told the apocryphal story of a politically sensitive case in the 1930s or 40s, in which the plaintiffs feared that the court would find it had no jurisdiction in order to avoid the political consequences of ruling in the plaintiff's favor. To avoid this, the plaintiff filed the action separately in all 20+ courts, only to have each court rule that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Professor Lynch, of whom this writer was a student, claimed to be constantly in search of the actual case; it is not known if he was ultimately successful. Vanderbilt was President of the American Bar Association in 1937–38. He also served for many years as Dean of New York University Law School, currently housed in a building that bears his name. Vanderbilt was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1936, 1940 and 1944. On two separate occasions he declined to be considered for nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court.Page 5 Vanderbilt was the principal mentor to William J. Brennan, Jr when Brennan was a member of the New Jersey Supreme Court and played an instrumental role in Dwight D. Eisenhower's nomination of Brennan to the United States Supreme Court.Pages 5-7 Publications Vanderbilt authored many articles and a number of books, including: * Men and Measures in the Law * The Challenge of Legal Reform * The Doctrine of the Separation of Powers and Its Present-Day Significance * Judges and Jurors * Improving The Administration of Justice Honorable distinctions For his work in law reform, he was awarded 32 honorary degrees and the American Bar Association Medal.http://camlaw.rutgers.edu/statecon/publications/vandy2.pdf Death Vanderbilt suffered a heart attack while parking his car at the Lackawanna Railroad station in Short Hills, New Jersey, on June 14, 1957. He lingered for two days, and died at 1:20 A.M. at Overlook Hospital in Summit, New Jersey. His funeral was held at Christ Protestant Episcopal Church in Short Hills, and he was buried at Restland Memorial Park in East Hanover, New Jersey. Personal life Vanderbilt married Florence J. Althen in 1914. They had five children: William, Robert, Jean, Virginia, and Lois. His grandson, Arthur T.

The series starts with One Life to Live storylines (1968–1979). The plot continues in One Life to Live storylines (1980–1989). The plot in the next decade is outlined in One Life to Live storylines (1990–1999) and the story concludes in One Life to Live storylines (2000—2013). 1968-1978 The earliest storylines of One Life to Live focused on the blue collar, Polish Catholic Wolek family, and the super-rich Lords. Additionally, there was also the Rileys, although most of the latter were featured much less prominently. Larry/Merrie in love Young intern Dr. Larry Wolek (Paul Tulley, Jim Storm, from 1969 onward Michael Storm) falls in love with Meredith Lord (Trish Van Devere, Lynn Benesch) the younger of two daughters of Victor Lord (Ernest Graves, Shepperd Strudwick). They initially met when Larry helped treat Merrie's heart condition. Victor disapproved of Larry as a suitor for his daughter and forbade her seeing him. Frustrated, Larry turned to Karen Martin (Niki Flacks), a nurse who saved his life when he was trapped in a fire. Larry wed Karen, but realized soon afterward it was a mistake; he didn't love her. He did stay with her when he found out she was pregnant however. Meanwhile, a heart-broken Merrie became involved with Tom Edwards (Joseph Gallison), a young man whom she found wandering in the park with amnesia and who was more to Victor's liking. Karen miscarried her baby and agreed to a divorce. Larry wanted to court Merrie again, but she had already accepted Tom's proposal. Ultimately though, Merrie chose to wed Larry. Merrie went through her own extremely difficult pregnancy, but successfully delivered twins, a son Danny (who would eventually grow up to be a doctor as well) and a daughter who died at birth. She suffered from post-partum depression. She was also held hostage by two escaped convicts for a prolonged period. Tragically, she died of a brain aneurysm in 1973, leaving Larry crushed. \\"Niki Smith\\" Merrie's sister Victoria Lord (originated by Gillian Spencer, from 1971 onward Erika Slezak) was a sexually repressed young woman who lived for her father's approval. When brash reporter Joe Riley (Lee Patterson) began to chip away at her defenses, the fun-loving red-wigged \\"Niki Smith\\" began showing up at local bars. Joe's best friend, truck-driver (and later police officer) Vinny Wolek (Antony Ponzini, Jordan Charney, Michael Ingram), fell in love with Niki. When he realized she was really a split- personality (or 'alter') of Viki, he told Joe the truth. Viki underwent psychoanalysis with Dr. Polk, and her split-personality seemed at the time to be cured. She married Joe soon afterward. A few years later, Joe was presumed dead. Viki married reporter Steve Burke (Bernard Grant), who at the time was being stalked by the psychopathic Marcy Wade (Francesca James). Steve went on trial for her murder, and was ultimately cleared by none other than Joe himself, who had survived his presumably fatal car crash, but had been amnesiac for over a year. Poor Viki suddenly found herself with two husbands, and had a difficult time deciding on which husband to stay married. Viki and Joe reunited, but not before he had a child with Cathy Craig (Dorrie Kavanaugh). When the child died, Cathy kidnapped Viki and Joe's baby, Kevin Riley, in 1977. OLTL was the first soap opera to have a racially integrated cast. Additionally, it was the first to deal with interracial relationships. The character of Carla Gray (Ellen Holly) was an African American woman trying to pass for white. Her mother, Sadie Gray (Lillian Hayman, Esther Rolle), who was the neighbor and friend to the Woleks and worked in the Housekeeping Department at the hospital (she later became Head of Housekeeping there), discovered her daughter, Clara, was pretending to be a white woman, and eventually persuaded her to reveal her true racial identity. Anti-drugs The show also had a sustained anti-drug storyline centering on wild child Cathy Craig (Catherine Burns, Dorrie Kavanaugh, Jennifer Harmon). Cathy was the only daughter of widower Dr. Jim Craig (Robert Milli, Nat Polen). She resented her father's second marriage to Anna Wolek (Doris Belack, Kathleen Maguire, Phyllis Behar). Cathy rebelled by taking drugs, and spiralled into addiction. While on a bad acid trip, she murdered her drug dealer Artie Duncan (John Cullum), but blocked the incident out of her memory. Vinnie was wrongly accused and sentenced for the crime. Cathy finally recalled her actions and confessed. Rather than go to jail, she was sent to Odyssey House, a real-life NYC treatment center for drug-addicted youths. In an unusual move, Cathy's portrayer, actress Amy Levitt, was videotaped while sitting in on real-life therapy sessions at Odyssey House, which were then broadcast as OLTL episodes during the summer of 1970. Dorian Cramer Dr. Dorian Cramer (Nancy Pinkerton, on-and-off from 1979 Robin Strasser) arrived in Llanview in April 1973 with her sister, Melinda (Patricia Pearcy); the following year she and her married lover Dr. Mark Toland (Tommy Lee Jones) conspired to cover up their complicity in the death of patient, Rachel Wilson (Nancy Barrett). When the truth came out, Dorian was suspended from Llanview hospital; erroneously believing Viki was partly responsible, Dorian vowed revenge. After becoming the private physician to Viki's ailing father Victor, she married him, and schemed to control his fortune. Dorian's machinations further fueled the enmity between Viki and herself. After Victor's mysterious death in 1976, the shadow of suspicion surrounded Dorian for decades. Decline and resurgence As social issue-oriented stories on matters such as race and drug addiction played themselves out, ratings fell; in response, in 1975 ABC hired high-priced Another World actors George Reinholt and Jacqueline Courtney to portray Tony Lord and Pat Ashley. The numbers rose, but the pairing never achieved the success expected by executives. Reinholt left after only two years and replaced by Philip MacHale and, later, Chip Lucia; Courtney was fired in 1983. The show did have huge success in the middle and late 1970s with new character-siblings Jenny (Katherine Glass, Brynn Thayer) and Karen Wolek (Kathryn Breech, Julia Duffy, Judith Light), distant cousins of the original Wolek family. Jenny was a novitiate nun who left the convent after falling in love with Tim Siegel (Tom Berenger). Her cousin Vinnie was angry, and accused Tim of 'stealing Jenny from the church.' Vinnie & Tim got into a physical fight, one that left Tim with grave head injuries from which he died soon afterwards. Jenny married Tim on his deathbed. Later, Jenny married bad boy Brad Vernon (Steve Fletcher, Jameson Parker), a philandering Lothario who caused her no small amount of grief. Karen seduced Larry into marrying her, a controversial move in itself given that they were related (albeit several familial relations removed). But Karen, bored with married life and suffering overwhelming self-esteem problems, began turning tricks in the daytime with rich suitors in exchange for expensive 'gifts.' The sleazy opportunist Marco Dane (Gerald Anthony) discovered Karen's trysts and blackmailed her into becoming a housewife hooker, turning tricks for his clientele while Larry was at work. Karen was overwhelmed with guilt, and finally confessed to Viki her secret life. Viki helped Karen escape Marco's control. Also appearing for the first time in 1978 was Viki's teenage ward Tina Clayton (Andrea Evans), introduced as the orphaned daughter of Viki's college friend Irene Manning Clayton (Kate McKeown) who asked Viki to be Tina's guardian before she died. Red-headed, free-spirited Tina seemed quite a lot like Viki's alter-ego Niki Smith, and was almost as troublesome. Nevertheless, Viki did her best to be a good mother figure to Tina. It would be years later that the two women learned how close their bond really was. 1979: Murder of Marco Dane A Grand Jury indicted Viki for the murder of Marco Dane. Karen Wolek searched for her hooker friend, Katrina Karr (Nancy Snyder), because she believed Katrina knew who killed Marco. Karen confided this to her client Talbot Huddleston (Byron Sanders), who was concerned Katrina may have seen him kill Marco. D.A. Herb Callison (Anthony Call) dropped the biggest bombshell of all by calling a surprise witness; Marco Dane's twin brother, Dr. Mario Corelli (also played by Gerald Anthony). Mario introduced damaging letters Marco had written to him about how Viki had threatened him. Viki's trial reached a thrilling climax when Karen took the stand for the defense. Karen had finally found Katrina. In exchange for money she needed for drugs, Katrina gave Karen the combination to a Post Office box, which Katrina claimed contained information revealing the identity of Marco Dane's killer. When Karen went to the Post Office to get the information, she discovered to her horror the killer had beaten her to it. Also, Katrina had been run down by a car and was now lying comatose in Llanview hospital. Karen correctly guessed Talbot was the killer and prepared to break the news in court. As Karen took the stand, she was savagely cross- examined by Herb, who forced her to reveal her secret life as a hooker. Larry listened in stunned silence as his wife revealed she had been turning tricks when he thought she was tending to their home. Katrina later came out of her coma and named Talbot as the killer. This was enough to exonerate Viki, but Karen's marriage to Larry appeared to be doomed. Dorian led a vicious campaign to have Larry ousted as Chief of Staff of Llanview Hospital. Dorian ordained her old friend and mentor, Dr. Ivan Kipling(Jack Betts), as Larry's replacement; A move the ambitious and cutthroat Dr. Kipling strongly favored. Larry offered to make another go of his marriage. Karen realized she'd always be Larry's albatross, and decided to divorce him. Dr. Mario Corelli settled in Llanview. In time, Karen discovered an amazing truth. Mario was really Marco Dane. He wasn't dead after all. Karen forced Marco to tell what really happened the night he was supposedly murdered. Marco was horrified to discover the dead body of his brother Mario, and made the instant decision to exchange identities with the corpse. Marco implored Karen to keep his secret, telling her he'd been \\"born again.\\" Karen agreed on one condition. He had to stop practicing medicine. Marco agreed. Gambling debts Jenny was delighted to be pregnant with Brad's baby. Brad had developed a compulsion for gambling. With his losses mounting, Brad stole Jenny's key to the hospital's pharmacy. Brad gave the key to a mobster named Brick in exchange for forgiving Brad's gambling debts. When Brick and an accomplice tried to rob the pharmacy, they were caught by Dr. Jack Scott(Arthur Burghardt), who was shot and paralyzed in the violent exchange. Feeling guilty Brad was home alone without her, Jenny asked Karen to look after him. Karen knew Brad did not like her, but Karen would do whatever Jenny wanted. Brad and Karen clashed at first, but eventually Brad became fascinated by his sexy sister-in-law. The fascination grew into obsession. One night, Brad tried to seduce his sister-in-law, but the seduction turned to rape. Karen knew she couldn't reveal a word about the rape because if Jenny were to find out, it would all but destroy her. Larry began his own detective work and realized Brad raped Karen. In a rage, Larry beat Brad to a pulp. Jenny threw Brad out of their apartment. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, and was sentenced to three months in prison. Jenny gave premature birth to her tiny baby about the same time Katrina gave birth to her own healthy baby. When Karen and Marco were visiting the hospital, Jenny's baby went into cardiac arrest and died before their eyes. In a panic, Karen and Marco switched Jenny's baby with Katrina's baby. Katrina fell into a deep depression when she was told her baby died. Jenny took baby Mary home, never suspecting the precious little girl belonged to another woman. When Pat discovered her new husband Adam Brewster(John Mansfield) had put all moral considerations aside in order to get his financial empire back in order, she quickly had their new marriage annulled. For comfort, Pat turned to her TV producer, Dick Grant(A.C. Weary). In Pat's presence, Dick was a cheerful, charming, very outgoing gentleman. However, unbeknownst to Pat, Dick had developed a psychotic crush on her. When Samantha discovered Dick had turned his apartment into a photo-covered shrine to Pat, he kidnapped her, and then Pat, before the police apprehended him. Viki received some joyous news when she discovered she was pregnant with her second child. Joe began suffering all the classic signs of a recurrence of his brain tumor. When Joe learned he had only a few weeks left, he treated Viki to a wonderful wedding anniversary. With time running out, Joe hand-picked his successor as editor of The Banner. He sent for the editor of a small but prestigious newspaper in Arizona. The man's name was Clint Buchanan (Clint Ritchie). Joe broke the news of his prognosis to Viki, shortly before succumbing to his illness. He beseeched Viki to move on with her life after he was gone. Viki poured her energies into working with Clint at The Banner, and fending off a takeover attempt by her arch-rival, Dorian Lord.

Life Nider was born in Swabia. He entered the Order of Preachers at Colmar and after profession was sent to Vienna for his philosophical studies, which he finished at Cologne, where he was ordained. He gained a wide reputation in Germany as a preacher and was active at the Council of Constance. After making a study of the convents of his order of strict observance in Italy he returned to the University of Vienna, where in 1425 he began teaching as Master of Theology. Elected prior of the Dominican convent at Nuremberg in 1427, he successively served as socius to his master general and vicar of the reformed convents of the German province. In this capacity he maintained his early reputation of reformer and in 1431 he was chosen prior of the convent of strict observance at Basle. He became identified with the Council of Basle as theologian and legate, making several embassies to the Hussites at the command of Cardinal Julian. Sent as legate of the Council to the Bohemians he succeeded in pacifying them. He journeyed to Ratisbon (1434) to effect a further reconciliation with the Bohemians and then proceeded to Vienna to continue his work of reforming the convents there. During the discussion that followed the dissolution of the Council of Basle by Pope Eugene IV, he joined the party in favour of continuing the Council in Germany; abandoning them, however, when the pope remained firm in his decision. He resumed his theological lectures at Vienna in 1436 and was twice elected dean of the university before his death. As reformer he was foremost in Germany and welcomed as such both by his own order and by the fathers of the Council of Basle. As a theologian his adherence to the principles of St. Thomas and his practical methods made him distinguished among his contemporaries. He died at Colmar.  Writings  The most important among his many writings is the Formicarius, a treatise on the philosophical, theological, and social questions of his day. Book Five of the Formicarius related to witchcraft and diabolism. It recounted the experiences of Peter of Greyerz, an Inquisitor active in the regions in and around Bern in the 1390s to 1410s. Peter claimed to have interviewed a captured male witch, who described in detail aspects of witchcraft pertaining to acts of child murder, heresy, and apostasy. The Formicarius was circulated at the Council of Basle in 1437. Nider's work On the Contracts of Merchants, which was later one of the first works on economics to be printed, uses the language of probability to discuss the price of future goods whose present worth is uncertain. For example, he allows a merchant sell a good in June, with payment delayed till December when the good is usually dearer, to charge the expected December price.

He was convicted of the December 12, 1985 murders of Joe and Martha Joyce, as well as the rape and murder of their daughter, Sara Joyce McCurdy, in Sebastian County, Arkansas. Alan Willett was also executed on the same day for the unrelated murders of Eric Willett and Roger Willett. The murders Mark Gardner was 29 when he killed Joe Joyce, his wife Martha and raped and murdered their adult daughter, Sara Joyce McCurdy. Joe Joyce had just returned home from a funeral and Sara McCurdy had gone to her parents' home for lunch while her husband was away on Air National Guard duty. The family was tied up and they were suffocated with tape that was placed over their mouths and noses. Martha was found with a wire coat hanger around her neck. Their house was ransacked and jewelry and a car was stolen. Gardner was on parole for an armed robbery conviction and was under an arrest warrant out of Illinois for another armed robbery. Some of the family's jewelry was found on Gardner when he was arrested and he told police that he had also killed a man in New York State. At his trial he claimed that demons had made him do it. Mark Gardner was accused of repeatedly raping and beating a fellow Death Row inmate who was later released from prison, Damien Echols, who had been convicted for the West Memphis Three murders. Execution Gardner's last meal was fried shrimp, grilled salmon, garden salad, and chocolate cake with a Coke. Gardner was executed first because he had the lower inmate number (SK901) than Alan Willett (SK930). The injection of a lethal drug was administered at 8:02 p.m. CDT, and he was pronounced dead at 8:15. Gardner's last words were \\"Blessed are those who are called to the Lord's supper.

Its predecessor was the Alien Business Act of 1972, enacted by a military junta. Industries which must be majority- owned by Thais included the newspaper business, radio stations, television stations, rice farming, animal husbandry, fishing, land trading, mining, wholesaling and retailing, restaurants, and all service businesses. The law criminalized nominees, any Thai who held shares on behalf of a foreigner. Nominees could be fined 100,000 to 1 million baht and face up to 3 years in prison. However, the law did not prohibit foreigners from being the majority in the board of directors and also did not prohibit having different classes of shares with differing voting rights. This loophole allowed thousands of foreign-controlled businesses to operate in Thailand.  The new draft Foreign Business Act The first draft was issued by the Thai Ministry of Commerce in December 2006. A second draft was done in March and the third and final draft was approved by the cabinet in April 2007. The main points of contention are : *1. The draft proposes to extend the definition of alien (foreign individuals or companies) as being that any company where foreigners hold half or a majority of the voting rights would be classified as alien and thereby restricted from participation in businesses regulated under the Foreign Business Act. *2. limited grandfathering is included. All foreign owned companies as under the new definition and that have been operating for a year have to apply to the Ministry of Commerce for a certificate with a year. Once the certificate has been issued they have to adjust their shareholding or voting profile to conform to the new definition of the act within 3 years. This would exclude most service businesses. *3. 100% foreign ownership was allowed for retail and wholesale businesses under the Foreign Business Act with the condition that 100 million Baht capital was fully paid or 20 million Baht per shop. That has now been abolished under the new Foreign Business Act. Objections of the foreign business community The foreign business community have objected to the draft on the following bases. *1. Thailand as a WTO member had equal national treatment of businesses of all WTO member countries, provided foreign equity investment was limited to 49%. The draft Foreign Business Act eliminates those rights. *2. Foreign companies in Thailand had for years structured their companies into different classes of shares with differential voting rights. These had been accepted by the Ministry of Commerce for years. The new Foreign Business Act will make those structures illegal. *3. All other countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam, China and India are opening their markets to foreign investment yet the draft Foreign Business Act by narrowing the definition of alien closes the Thai market and makes Thailand look as if it has a protectionist strategy.

The businessman wrote an open letter to the local newspaper informing the extortionists that he was no longer willing to pay pizzo, a Sicilian term for protection money. Other business-owners and shopkeepers in Palermo refused to join his public campaign. Grassi was gunned down in the street near his home eight months after writing the letter. Grassi was born in Catania, was married, and had a son and daughter. Following his death, his family have continued his campaign, lending their support to the Addiopizzo movement that is against pizzo. Pizzo demands Grassi ran the Sigma factory producing men's underwear and pyjamas in Palermo. The company had around 100 employees and a business volume of US$5 million in 1990.A Bullet For a Businessman, Business Week, November 4, 1991 Like many businessmen in the city, he was soon subjected to demands to pay \\"pizzo\\" or face the consequences.'They say the Mafia is beaten.

Refusal to pay pizzo In late 1990, Grassi began to refuse to pay up, as did an estimated 50% of Palermo businesses. The extortionists demanded money \\"for their poor friends in jail\\" and threatened to kill him.Milan and the Mafia: Who Has a Line on Whom? The New York Times, July 1, 1991 On January 10, 1991, Grassi wrote an open letter in the Giornale di Sicilia, a Palermo daily, that began \\"Dear extortionist,\\" in which he denounced the Mafia's demands for protection money and publicly announced his refusal to pay. Libero Grassi, martire civile , La Sicilia, August 30, 2009 The same day, he reported the names of his would-be extortionists to the police, a move that resulted in five arrests in March. Un antieroe onesto e scomodo, La Repubblica, August 30, 1991 The morning after the letter was published, the Mayor of Palermo, the prosecutor, the colonel of the federal police, and the press showed up at his factory to show support. However, even after he got police protection, two strangers appeared who claimed to be health inspectors and threatened the workers once they were inside. Grassi became something of a national hero in Italy, a Sicilian businessman who stood up to the Mafia, after appearing on nationwide TV on April 11, 1991 (at Michele Santoro's Samarcanda on Rai Tre). However, instead of receiving solidarity from other shopkeepers and businesses for his refusal to pay protection money, he was criticised, gradually isolated, and accused of demolishing the image of the Palermo business world. In his interviews, he denounced the Mafia and also the way that many of his fellow businessmen seemed to shun him, and how even customers ceased to frequent his store in fear of being caught in the wrath of the Mafia whom Grassi was provoking with his stance. Grassi stated in an interview: Retaliations and murder Grassi eventually had his shop broken into in early 1991 and the exact amount of money was stolen that had been demanded of him. An unsuccessful arson attack on his shop soon followed. The 67-year-old Grassi was gunned down in the via Vittorio Alfieri in Palermo at 7:30 in the morning on August 29, 1991, less than a year after taking his stance against the Mafia. He was shot in the head three times as he walked from his home to his car. No witnesses came forward. After the killing, 10,000 people took to the streets to protest his murder.Killing in Sicily Sets Off Backlash Against Mob, The New York Times, October 12, 1991 On September 26, 1991, TV hosts Santoro and Maurizio Costanzo dedicated a joint five-hour nationwide television programme to the memory of Grassi in a unique cooperation between the public Rai Tre and the private Canale 5, with the participation of anti- Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone. Rai e Fininvest contro la mafia, La Repubblica, September 26, 1991 Libero Grassi's wife Pina and their children Davide and Alice tried to keep the family firm going. \\"I was terrified for their safety so, as the threats continued after Libero's killing, we reluctantly agreed to allow a state holding to run the company with Davide keeping a share,\\" Pina recalls.

The series starts with One Life to Live storylines (1968–1979). The plot continues in One Life to Live storylines (1980–1989). The plot in the next decade is outlined in One Life to Live storylines (1990–1999) and the story concludes in One Life to Live storylines (2000—2013). 1980 - 1983 The early 1980s were a time of big changes for One Life to Live. The Wolek sisters were the spotlight characters of the show as the new decade began. The major storyline on OLTL in 1979 was Viki’s trial for the murder of Marco Dane (Gerald Anthony). But Anthony was so popular with fans that he quickly returned (a quick rewrite revealed Marco's heretofore unknown twin brother Mario was killed instead; Marco impersonated him for several years). Karen discovered Marco’s secret, but realized he was genuinely trying to rehabilitate, so she didn’t expose him. Meanwhile, Jenny was treated badly by her husband Brad who then manipulated her into taking him back over and over again. Brad also raped Karen. Jenny was in a high-risk pregnancy at the time, and the news of the rape sent her into early labor. When the baby died in the nursery, Karen forced Marco to switch the child with fellow hooker Katrina Karr's child. Jenny finally left Brad for good and married Dr. Peter Janssen, who was later killed in a car accident. It would be several years before she found out the truth about ‘her’ baby and in a heartbreaking sequence, gave her daughter back to Katrina. Joe Riley succumbed to a brain tumor and died in the fall of 1979, only weeks before Viki delivered their second son (whom she named Joseph in his memory). Viki buried herself in work as publisher of the Banner, and in looking after Tina, who was perpetually involved with one bad-news boyfriend after another. Although she deliberately avoided a new relationship, she attracted two prospective love interests. One was Ted Clayton, Tina’s father (actually stepfather, though she didn’t know it at the time) who was more interested in Viki’s wealth than her. The other was Clint Buchanan (Clint Ritchie), who took over Joe’s position as chief editor of the Llanview Banner. Viki and Clint clashed both professionally and personally – Clint was a no-nonsense cowboy who initially saw Viki as a pampered primadonna. Eventually though true love won out and, despite numerous schemes by Ted, Viki and Clint were married. Ted was finally gunned down, prompting a devastated Tina to leave Llanview for a while. Quickly following Clint to Llanview were his brother Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods), and father Asa Buchanan (Phil Carey). Asa was a Texas oil baron millionaire who had a love-hate relationship with his sons, and practically everyone he knew. The Buchanan clan was an obvious attempt to imitate the then wildly popular prime- time soap Dallas, but the Buchanans proved to be such big hits that they soon dominated the entire show. Most of the Wolek and Lord family members who anchored OLTL since its inception were written out, or (in the case of Viki) married into the Buchanan family. (Ironically the Buchanan family has remained a popular fixture on the daytime soap to this day, outlasting their inspirations on Dallas by more than a decade.) Asa was as much a scoundrel as J.R. Ewing in his business dealings but he was also an irrepressible ladies' man. Almost immediately after arriving in Llanview, Asa wooed Brad Vernon's sister Samantha, who was decades younger than he was. What no one knew was that Asa's first wife Olympia (mother of Clint and Bo) was still alive, still legally Asa's wife, and being held prisoner by him. Throughout the 1980s, Asa took one young bride after another - including Delilah Ralston, Becky Lee Abbott, Pamela Stuart and Gabrielle Medina. He also locked horns with his sons, particularly Bo, who had his own romantic interest in both Delilah and Becky Lee. The role of Dorian was recast with Robin Strasser, who arguably became the definitive portrait of the character. While continuing to be a thorn in Viki’s side (she briefly ‘romanced’ Clint when he and Viki were on the outs), her character was fleshed out a little more. She married Herb Callison, the district attorney who prosecuted Viki for murder. Although she expected to be able to control him, Herb proved to be more than a match for her, and their marriage was a tempestuous affair, although surprisingly long- lasting for two soap opera characters. Also complicating Dorian’s life was the abrupt arrival of Cassie Howard, the illegitimate daughter whom Dorian had given up years earlier. Dorian at first resisted becoming a mother to Cassie, but eventually she accepted the girl into her home. Karen’s \\"housewife hooker\\" storyline was rehashed in 1981 by having Karen go undercover, posing as a prostitute while investigating the murder of her cousin Vinnie Wolek. Much like every soap in the early 1980s, OLTL aped the wild success of General Hospital’s “Luke & Laura” story by having Karen & Marco framed for murder and having to go on the run from the mob. The reality-based tales took a turn towards the absurd in the early 1980s, as Karen and Larry had control chips implanted in their brains by the evil Dr. Ivan Kipling (Jack Betts) and Larry had to save Karen from Kipling's jungle hideaway. 1983 - 1986 In 1983 Karen fell in love with fugitive Steve Piermont (Robert Desiderio, Light's real-life husband.) In spite of Larry urging her to remain in Llanview, she decided she would rather go on the run with a man who needed her than stay with her old demons. Karen’s sister Jenny fell in love with David Rinaldi (Michael Zaslow), a concert pianist, who had fathered Dorian’s daughter Cassie. Although married to Herb, Dorian was at turns furiously bitter towards, and jealously possessive of David. She sought to drive a wedge between David and Jenny, going as far as seducing him. Her schemes ultimately backfired; not only was she unsuccessful at breaking up David and Jenny, Herb found out about her fling and divorced her. David and Jenny were then embroiled in a spy storyline in 1985, taking them to Vienna, Austria with Viki & Clint. Jenny and David remained in Vienna. Thanksgiving 1983, Asa held a lavish costume ball in honor of his young wife Samantha. During the festivities, Olympia escaped captivity, revealed to Bo that she was still alive, and that Asa wasn’t really his father (the last bit turned out not to be true.) Olympia tried coaxing Bo into shooting Asa, but he couldn’t pull the trigger. When Olympia herself tried to kill her husband, Samantha lunged to save Asa and knocked Olympia and herself out a window. Only Samantha survived the fall. When she was informed that Asa was a liar and a bigamist, she dumped him then and there. Perhaps the most spectacular part of this storyline was its length. While it was all supposed to occur in the space of one night, it took up an entire month's worth of episodes, with five, hour-long episodes being aired for four whole weeks. These episodes took up approximately 20 hours of airtime and were all dedicated to the events of one single evening. Asa and Bo promptly went on fighting – mainly over women. Bo fell in love with Delila Ralston, but Asa deliberately led them both to believe that they were half-siblings (Bo had been told by Olympia that his real father had been Yancey Ralston – Delila’s father). Asa let them know that they weren’t actually related only after he married Delila. Soon afterward, Asa faked his death to test Delila’s fidelity – she wasted no time marrying Bo! Later, aspiring country-western singer Becky Lee Abbott became pregnant with Bo’s son Drew, but married Asa instead. Later still, Bo fell in love with and married Didi O’Neill, whose father Harry O’Neill (Frank Converse) was a blue-collar workingman fighting Asa’s plans to ‘gentrify’ east Llanview. In 1986, it was revealed that throughout all the convoluted events of the past several years, Asa had been bigamously married to another woman, Pamela Stuart. Pamela was never involved with Bo in any way. In 1985, Viki returned to the spotlight in one of the show’s landmark storylines – the return of Niki Smith. Tina returned to Llanview and uncovered proof that she was Victor Lord’s illegitimate daughter. Viki angrily refused to believe Tina’s claims, until the discovery of a secret room in Llanfair (the Lord family mansion) that Victor had used as an illicit sex den. Shocked to discover this side of her father’s persona, Viki began having ‘Niki Smith’ episodes once again. Tina hooked up with sleazy con man Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born), who concocted a plan to turn Viki into Niki permanently, which (thanks to a clause in Victor Lord’s will) would leave Tina in control of the vast Lord fortune. But when Tina discovered Mitch wanted to kill ‘Niki,’ she turned against him. ‘Niki’ remained in control for months, causing misery for Clint. Tina rebounded from her uncharacteristic bout of selflessness in order to seduce Clint. ‘Niki’ was able to imitate Viki’s mannerisms well enough to fool people into thinking she was really Viki. She then used Clint’s transgression with Tina as grounds to divorce him. Clint was eventually able to shock Viki back to her senses. With ‘Niki’ banished once more, Viki happily remarried Clint. On their wedding day, she broke the news to him that she was pregnant with his child. Almost nine months later, Viki delivered daughter Jessica. The wildly popular Niki Smith storyline re-energized OLTL. It was during the Paul Rauch era when One Life to Live would maintain consistently high ratings, placing it in the top three of daytime soap operas from 1985 into the late 1980s. OLTL also found success with the enormously popular supercouple pairing of Tina and good-hearted cowboy Cordero ‘Cord’ Roberts (John Loprieno). The two fell madly in love from the moment they met, but Tina was intent on marrying a rich husband. When she discovered that Cord was the illegitimate son of Clint (and potential heir to Buchanan mega-millions), she wasted no time marrying him! Cord however would soon become disgusted by Tina’s conniving ways. Complicating matters was Cord’s mother Maria Roberts (Barbara Luna), who despised Tina and sought to undermine her at every turn. Maria was also still in love with Clint, and wanted to break up Clint and Viki in order to win him back. Maria even went as far as tracking down the late Joe’s heretofore unknown long-lost twin brother Tom Dennison (like Joe, played by Lee Patterson) and bringing him to Llanview in hopes that Viki would leave Clint for him. Mitch Laurence also returned to town to menace both Tina and Viki. In the guise of a fundamentalist minister, Mitch began leading a religious cult composed mainly of young women he seduced. He tried to rape Cassie, but was (presumably) killed in self-defense by Dorian. Dorian was wrongly found guilty of premeditated murder and sent to prison. But evidence would lead to her conviction being overturned, releasing Dorian from jail. She would continue her TV journalism career at WVLE while finding romance with private investigator, Jon Russell. With Cassie visiting her father, David in Vienna, Dorian also found a young protege in Diane Bristol. But Diane had a dark side and was secretly involved with Jon's sociopath nephew, Jamie Sanders' criminal activity. Cassie returned to Llanview and became suspicious of Diane's focus on Dorian. Jon shared Cassie's concern and the two paired up to uncover Diane's motives. Cassie soon found herself alongside Dorian in a dangerous confrontation with an unhinged and gun-toting Diane. Dorian saved Cassie by intercepting Diane, causing her to fall to her death through her penthouse's plate glass window. Soon Dorian noticed that Cassie had grown close with Jon during the ordeal. After confronting both of them, Cassie admitted to having feelings for him, leading Dorian to break up with Jon and to her falling out with her daughter. Dorian was soon offered the opportunity to become U.S. Ambassador to the country of Mendora. After mending her rift with Cassie, Dorian would leave Llanview to begin work in her new role. 1987 - 1989 In the late 1980s, usually either Viki and Clint, or Tina and Cord were at the center of the major storylines. Viki and Clint were the show’s exemplary married couple; their love was strong enough to weather any crisis (no matter how bizarre.) Tina and Cord on the other hand broke up and reconciled (including marrying and divorcing) at a head-spinning rate. Tina genuinely tried to change her selfish ways to please Cord, but her greedy nature always got the better of her and she would alienate Cord’s affections time and again. Also at this time storylines became extremely campy but were told in a way that viewers could understand and they seemed to enjoy the change that was made as they became more and more bizarre from the Maria Roberts Saga to Viki going to Heaven, Eterna and the Crown Jewels to Mendorra. Following the ‘Niki Smith’ saga, Allison Perkins (one of the ‘late’ Mitch Laurence’s cult disciples) kidnapped Viki’s baby Jessica for a while. This was a plot point that would have major ramifications in later years. Then in 1987, Viki underwent a brain operation to remove an aneurysm. During the operation, Viki had an out-of-body experience in which she visited Heaven and was reunited with many deceased characters, such as Victor, Meredith, Eugenia, Tony, Irene, Samantha, Harry and Vinnie. Many past cast members came back, and Lee Patterson (who was appearing as new character Tom Dennison) even resurrected his original character, Joe Riley. Viki returned to her body and woke up, and it remained unclear whether Viki had actually been to Heaven or simply dreamed it. (Though later storyline developments have made it clear that Viki was only dreaming.) A new major family, the wealthy and powerful Sanders clan, was created with three power-house soap veterans playing the older members of the family: Emmy nominated Lois Kibbee (The Edge of Night) as powerful matriarch Elizabeth Sanders), Peter Brown (Days of Our Lives, The Young and the Restless, Loving) as her handsome son, Charles Sanders, ambassador to a fictional country named Mendorra, and Louise Sorel (Santa Barbara, later Days of Our Lives) as his wife, Judith Sanders, the D.A. who prosecuted Dorian for Mitch Lawrence's murder. A controversial element of their storyline had acerbic Elizabeth openly anti-Semitic towards Judith even though she was quite powerful in her own right. While the family was given some entertaining storylines (very similar to the Quartermains from General Hospital), both Brown and Sorel became restless and left after only a year. Kibbee would remain on for another two years, only taken off of contract after Elizabeth was revealed to be the mastermind behind a plot to bring down the Buchannan family as part of revenge against both Asa and Cord. She would return infrequently over the next year until a summer storyline in 1989 had her in cahoots with grandson Jaime to escape from prison, ultimately resulting in Cord and Tina being held captive by them.'' OLTL does time travel The following year, 1988, Clint was blinded by a gunshot wound to the head. After a riding accident in the Arizona desert, he regained his sight but found himself transported back in time to 1888, and the old west town \\"Buchanan City\\". While there, Clint met the lookalike ancestors of Asa, Cord and Viki (played by Carey, Loprieno and Slezak respectively.) Like \\"Heaven\\", this storyline was intended to have a vague ending – after its resolution, Clint would reappear in the present and not be able to determine if he was actually there, or had an extended hallucination. Before the storyline was finished though, the Writers Guild of America went on strike. Several scab writers rewrote the storyline so that Viki also went back in time to rescue Clint (who was on the verge of marrying her ancestor Ginny Fletcher at the time). Thus the time-travel story was definitely established as a \\"real\\" event in the history of OLTL. As for Tina and Cord: Cord took an interest in scientist Kate Sanders (Marcia Cross), so Tina fled to Argentina with bad boy Max Holden (James DePaiva), even though she was pregnant by Cord at the time. After running afoul of drug dealers, Tina went over the Iguazu Falls in a raft and was presumed dead. (Actress Andrea Evans had it written into her contract that she get eight weeks off per year.) Meanwhile, Tina was alive and well and being kept alive in the jungle. Cord rebounded by proposing to Kate, but Tina crashed the wedding ceremony carrying a baby she claimed was Cord’s son though it was not. Baby \\"Al\\" had actually been Max’s son by Gabrielle Medina (Fiona Hutchison). Tina then got into a scuffle with Cord’s mother Maria and accidentally killed her. Because she tried to cover up her accidental involvement, Tina was wrongfully found guilty of deliberately murdering her, and sent to jail for several months. After getting out of jail, Tina learned she had not miscarried Cord’s son after her plunge over the falls, but that a ring of baby-sellers had stolen the child. Tina and Max tracked down the baby, and Max had to storm a castle ramparts to rescue both Tina and the baby (named Clint Jr. or C.J. Roberts in honor of Clint, who was thought dead at the time.) Tina almost married Max, but while saying her vows, she said Cord's name by accident. This caused Max to abruptly leave her at the altar. Max and Gabrielle became popular characters in their own right and were spun off into their own storyline. Another popular new character at the time was Renee Divine (played mainly by Patricia Elliott) as the new love of Asa’s life. For years, Asa had typically favored trophy wives, much younger women whom he could control (or attempt to control). However, Renee was his peer, and a former Texas madam. She was worldly and strong-willed enough to stand up to Asa, whom she often called an \\"old coot\\". Patrick London impersonates Bo Buchanan Bo returned to Llanview (actor Robert S. Woods had left the series for two years), and took center-stage for a while in 1988. When he came back to town, he was mysteriously divorced from his wife Didi, and acted quite strangely. Several months after his return, it was revealed that this was not the real Bo but an impostor (nicknamed Faux Bo) who was part of Elizabeth Sanders' elaborate scheme to stage a hostile takeover of Buchanan Industries. The real Bo, his wife Didi, and even his ex-wife Delila, were being held prisoner in a bunker. The real Bo, who escaped imprisonment and had a showdown with his impostor, thwarted the hostile takeover scheme. Alas, Didi was killed, but Bo eventually found happiness again with Sarah Gordon(Jensen Buchanan), who had been Clint’s therapist during the time he was blind. Soap within a soap Fraternity Row OLTL engaged in some meta-humor in 1988 when several characters became involved with the production of a fictional soap opera called Fraternity Row. The backstage antics at the soap became a central storyline for OLTL for several years. The star of the soap was Sarah's sister Megan Gordon (Jessica Tuck), a petty diva. Megan got involved with Max, who took her down a peg or two. But Megan would have a major impact in the life of central heroine Viki. Much to her surprise, Viki learned that she had become Niki Smith while still a teenager (much earlier than anyone knew) and that her father Victor had a hypnotist erase her memory of the incident. Even more shocking was the revelation that Viki/Niki had given birth to a daughter. (Adding insult to injury, Viki's longtime best friend Larry Wolek had delivered the baby and helped Victor cover the incident up.) Eventually, Viki would learn that the baby she had given birth to was Megan. But there were plenty of bizarre twists and turns to unravel before mother and daughter were reunited… The Lost Underground City of Eterna OLTL took a turn towards science fiction in early 1989 as, through Michael Grande's machinations, Viki and several others (including Tina, Cord, Gabrielle and several others) were trapped in the underground city of Eterna. Alone with Viki in the underground city, Roger Gordon finally confessed his long-buried secret: He was raised in Eterna, but had found a way to escape. He met Viki when she was in high school. They made love. One day, Viki watched in horror as the entrance to Eterna exploded. Believing that Roger was dead, she turned into Niki Smith. Viki/Niki gave birth to his daughter, Megan. She had carried the baby as Niki, then later turned back to Viki during childbirth, but Victor had her hypnotized to forget the birth. He then paid Roger to take the baby and leave town. Viki was amazed to learn that Megan, who had been her adversary, was actually her flesh and blood. While in Eterna, Viki and Roger's old feelings for each other began to resurface. Led by Clint, the authorities located and rescued everyone trapped inside just before Eterna collapsed. Viki enjoyed an uneasy \\"reunion\\" with her reluctant daughter, Megan. In time, Viki and Megan mended their fences and came to respect, admire and love each other. Megan became the center of attention on OLTL, and had several comical adventures with Marco Dane (who returned to the show after a five-year absence). Austin terrorizes Llanview Austin Buchanan, son of Asa's brother, Pike, arrived in town and became obsessed with Sarah Gordon. He set out to steal her from Bo. Austin knew that Bo and Michael Grande were mortal enemies, so he rigged the brakes on Michael's car to fail. The accident killed Alicia and her baby, and injured Gabrielle instead! Audrey Ames (Pia Porter), also on the road that night, was hit by the car driven by Gabrielle, putting her in a wheelchair. Austin framed Bo for the car crash that killed Alicia, and her baby and injured Gabrielle and Audrey. Austin eventually confessed to the crime, but wanted Sarah to make love to him. She tried to put him off, but he became angry and brutally raped her. After the rape, Sarah shot Austin. To protect her, Cord and Asa buried Austin's body. However, the evil Buchanan cousin was not dead after all! He crawled out of his shallow grave, and sought revenge on Sarah. Austin's reign of terror quickly came to an end. After taking Viki and Megan hostage, Clint found them and shot Austin. Felled by Clint's bullet, Austin plunged out a high-rise window to his death, but not before shooting Viki. As the decade drew to a close, OLTL featured a rehash of the classic Karen/Jenny baby-switch storyline. This time, Gabrielle (aided by Austin) switched Michael’s and the late Alicia’s baby (who died shortly after being born) with that of Brenda Grande’s baby. At the same time, Megan went into a fugue state in which she believed she was her Fraternity Row character Ruby Bright, a riff on her mother Viki’s Niki Smith escapades. Both stories, however, were well received by critics and fans. The Fraternity Row Stalker Another infamous story saw the soap, Fraternity Row being stalked from January to March 1989 as numerous past death scenes were recreated and used to kill the cast and crew as producer Randy was killed by a falling chandelier, Bo was attacked, Audrey was nearly strangled, Bo saved Sarah from a bomb, an explosion destroyed the lab and many other death plots. Bo soon discovered that anyone who seemed to put Mari-Lynn Dennison down died! Jon Russell, Melinda Cramer, Mari-Lynn, Sarah Gordon and Bo himself all teamed up to catch the killer. Prime suspects were Casey an autistic stagehand and Neil, another stagehand with a deep love for Mari-Lynn. The killer then tried to kill off Sarah again by pushing a stone gargoyle from a church rooftop where they were filming location scenes. Bo rescued her and while filming location scenes at Duke University, Sarah realized Neil was indeed the killer so Neil stopped Sarah from escaping and chloroformed her as she cried out for Bo. He then dragged her to the University clock tower where he held Sarah captive. Mari-Lynn, Wade and Bo located Neil and Sarah and burst into the tower to rescue Sarah. Neil had an axe to defend himself with and pushed Wade over a railing as Mari-Lynn hovered over Neil in tears. Bo fell down a flight of stairs as Neil headed over to kill Sarah, Wade and Bo until Bo battled Neil one last time before the cops arrived. The Infamous Crown Jewels of Mendorra Tina Lord Roberts set out to pursue the lost Crown Jewels of Mendorra for Michael Grande throughout the summer despite her family's dismay. But what she did not know was that many of her past enemies were also after the jewels among them being Jamie and Elizabeth Sanders and Ursula Blackwell. To escape prison, Ursula set off a bomb that allowed numerous convicts to escape and they fled to the rundown Seaside Arena in Atlantic City where Tina and Cord were captured and held prisoner. They were forced into doing many wacky things including Cord wrestling the Titan in a wrestling ring and Tina and Ursula wrestling! Then Tina was put on a \\"murder trial\\" in the ring for killing Ursula's father Cornelius who fell out of a lighthouse window trying to save Tina in 1988. After the trial in which Tina escaped death row, Jamie and Elizabeth planned to flee the Arena on a helicopter and Leave Tina and Cord to die when the arena blew up. But Titan and Ursula dragged Tina and Cord away from their cells and strapped Tina to Ursula's homemade electric chair where Ursula fried Tina. However, the cops invade the Arena and the convicts are captured and Cord is reunited with an alive and well Tina. Ratings 1979-1980 Season (HH Ratings) *1. General Hospital 9.9 *2.

Overview Valencia made significant changes for the season, with coach Quique Sánchez Flores and technical director Amedeo Carboni overhauling the squad. Players who did not fit in the current playing system, such as Marco Di Vaio, Bernardo Corradi, Pablo Aimar, Rufete, and Mista, were some of those who were sold, while Fábio Aurélio signed for Liverpool (reuniting with former Valencia manager Rafael Benítez) after refusing an extension to his contract. To strengthen the squad, Valencia signed Joaquin, Asier del Horno, Fernando Morientes and Francesco Tavano, as well as recalling David Silva and Jaime Gavilán from loan spells, and promoting several youngsters from the Valencia B squad. The club's transfer activity was not wholly successful, however: the club failed in an attempt to sign Benfica winger Simão, while veteran defender Roberto Ayala expressed his desire to sign for rivals Villarreal. Valencia started the season strongly, winning their first three Champions League matches, against Olympiacos, Roma and Shakhtar Donetsk. The team qualified to pass on to the next round in a 2–2 draw against Shaktar on Matchday Four. On 15 December, Valencia were drawn to play against Italian champions Inter Milan in the last 16 of the Champions League, with the first leg scheduled to take place on 21 February. In La Liga, Valencia started the season with victories against Real Betis, Atlético Madrid, Getafe and Gimnàstic de Tarragona, along with a creditable draw with reigning Liga champions Barcelona. As of 1 October, Valencia were second, behind Barcelona on goal difference. However, they went through a slump in November which caused them to slip up in the league. The first of six winless matches started with a 1–0 defeat to Racing de Santander. This poor run was attributed to injuries to key players like captain David Albelda, midfielder Rubén Baraja, wingers Jaime Gavilán and Vicente, defenders Carlos Marchena and Asier del Horno and forward Francesco Tavano. Despite all these worries, the team is made a strong comeback, winning their last three matches before the winter break (against Deportivo de La Coruña, Real Zaragoza and Mallorca).

It is a state and/or a tendency denoting the growth of groups at the extremities of the social hierarchy and the parallel shrinking of groups around its middle. One of the earlier stimulating research works on social polarization is from R.E. Pahl on Isle of Sheppey,R. E. Pahl, Divisions of Labour, Oxford: Blackwell, 1984, wherein he provides a comparison between the Pre-capitalist society and capitalist society. More recently, a number of research projects have been increasingly addressing the issues of social polarization within the developed economies.Frank Moulaert, Erik Swyngedouw and Arantxa Rodriguez. The Globalized City: Economic Restructuring and Social Polarization in European Cities. Oxford University Press, 2003, When social polarization occurs in addition to economic restructuring, particularly in cities, economic inequality along social class and racial lines is exacerbated. Such separation can be best observed in the urban environment, “where [communities] of extreme wealth and social power are interspersed with places of deprivation, exclusion, and decline.” In addition to how spatial compositions are managed in cities, the technologies used in regards to social relations can also contribute to social polarization (see Social Polarization & The Media). Increased spatial segregation of socioeconomic groups correlates strongly with social polarization as well as social exclusion and societal fragmentation.  Creative class  Aspects of this concept can also be associated with the phenomena of the creative class and how these members have created their own dominant status within society. Globalization and its associated ”creative destruction\\" has contributed to great prosperity and growth for elites in many cities. Conversely, the process of creative destruction is intrinsically spatially uneven, so some urban neighborhoods “at the receiving end” of globalization are harmed by it.  Urban poverty  Several theoretical models can be strung together to explain the basics that create social polarization, and the subsequent deprivation that occurs when there is extreme societal deprivation between those of high-wealth and low-wealth. They are: * a Culture of Poverty * a Cycle of Poverty * Government Failure—particularly when public policy institutions divided into departments (education, housing, etc.) are ineffective when it comes to dealing with the interdisciplinary problems of the poor * an Inequitable Distribution of Resources/Opportunities * Class Conflict, and * the concept of an \\"Underclass\\". When these phenomena are combined in urban areas, it can fuel social polarization. Urban decay is a visual manifestation of social polarization, while riots, civil commotion and general social disintegration can be symptomatic of this concept as well. However, it can also lead to an informal economy in many urban areas.  Role of media  Digital media, and particularly social media, could potentially play a role in encouraging social polarization. This is because social media sites like Facebook can help cluster friends and acquaintances into homophilous circles, and social news sites like Digg can facilitate a consumption of news that is biased by its user’s choices. In the extreme, a lack of “a common public sphere” could lead to isolated, polarized groups which could even be hostile towards one another. For example, during the Arab Spring uprisings, it was observed that social media furthered the social stratification already present in several Arab states. However, cyberbalkanization, the phenomenon where media audiences fragment into \\"enclaves\\" where they only consume content they concur with—and thus theoretically promoting social polarization—may not have as much influence as believed. Utilizing Nielsen television and Internet audience data, James G. Webster found that ideological segmentation among media users was unlikely, as “even consumers of obscure niche media devoted most of their attention to more broadly appealing fare.” Yet Webster does admit that his research does not measure the particular nature of the subject matter consumed , or how strongly it affected the media viewers’ perceptions of society. Polarization observed in a particular social media site need not necessarily be a result of events and discussions that happen on that platform. Observed trends of polarization in online social media may therefore emerge from activities of users in other online platforms or offline activities. As an instance from a 2019 study, messages propagating anti-climate change beliefs on Twitter were collectively found to carry no credibility. Hence it is highly unlikely that such messages which are not credible can increase polarization of climate change opinions on Twitter.

Biography  Robinson-Walcott was born in 1956 and earned a bachelor's degree in English from McGill University in 1977. In 1979, she earned a master's degree in town planning from University College London. She earned her PhD in English from the University of the West Indies (UWI) in 2001. She married Harclyde Walcott and had two children, Miles and Sidney.  Work  In 1981, Robinson-Walcott began her career as the director of editing for Kingston Publishing, but left in 1986. Until 1994, she was the strategic planning director of Kingston Restoration Company, planning the renovation of historic properties in Kingston. That year, she started her own publishing consulting business, Editors Ink, and returned to Kingston Publishers as the director of editing, focusing her work on children's books and fiction. In 2000, she became the book editor at the Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies, UWI and would continue in that post for a decade. Robinson-Walcott became the editor-in-chief of the Jamaica Journal, the primary publication of the Institute of Jamaica in 2004.

Issues might focus on a mix biographical studies of important figures in Jamaican history, dancehall culture, sculpture, medicinal plants, historic landmarks, aerial photography, as well as book reviews and other topics. Robinson-Walcott's book, Out of Order! (2006), was called \\"a brilliant exercise in literary criticism\\" by Caribbean Quarterly. The book examines the work of the white Jamaican novelist Anthony Winkler. It discusses the issue of race in the Caribbean and in his work. The Jamaica Gleaner called it \\"A smart and crackling engagement with West Indian whiteness.\\" Robinson-Walcott knew Winkler personally and he has said that she \\"discovered\\" him. In addition, she was his first editor. Robinson-Walcott has also done work on John Hearne and challenged his placement in the canon of Caribbean literature. She wrote the introduction for the short story collection, John Hearne's Short Fiction. She has been a fixture on the cultural lecture circuit, giving many presentations on important figures in Jamaica's history and cultural acquisitions, such as Anthony Winkler's archive. In October of 2010, Robinson-Walcott became the editor-in-chief of Caribbean Quarterly, simultaneously continuing her work with the Jamaica Journal. She also writes poetry.

Sa- onoy, recruited from the remnants of the followers of Dios Buhawi upon the dissolution of his group under the poor leadership of Camartin de la Cruz during the years prior to the onset of the Philippine Revolution.Calma, Ma. Cecilia C. and Concepcion, Diana R.: The Revolution in Negros., Raison D'Etre, University of Negros Occidental-Recoletos Research Planning and Development Office, Bacolod City, 1998 Early life Magbuelas was the son of migrants from Panay, either Antique or San Joaquin, Iloilo, who cleared a small piece of land in the forests of Himamaylan. In his younger years, Papa Isio witnessed the loss of their small landholding to the marauding sugar barons of Negros. His family then moved to Payao in Binalbagan. When his parents died, Magbuelas gathered coconut sap to make native coconut wine in order to make ends meet. He later reportedly worked for the family of Carlos Gemora in Ilog. By 1880, he was 34 years old and was working as a cattle herder in the farm of the Montilla family in Tinungan. It was here that Magbuelas had a scuffle with a Spaniard and his opponent was wounded. Fearing reprisal from the Spanish authorities, Magbuelas fled to the mountains at the time that Dios Buhawi was leading his revolt. He may have joined this group as a means of avoiding the civil guards. Revolution Papa Isio with two babaylanes followers in a prison in Bacolod after his surrender to American authorities in 1907 According to Sa-onoy, Magbuelas's nom de guerre, Papa Isio, was partly dictated by the religious thrust of his revolt against Spain and the Catholic religion it championed. The title \\"Papa\\" was a repudiation of the Pope's (Santo Papa) authority - which Magbuelas then appropriated upon himself. This particular group of babaylanes were organized by Magbuelas in 1896 in Himamaylan, Negros Occidental.Cuesta, Angel Martinez, OAR: History of Negros., Historical Conservation Society, Manila, 1980 Fusing religion with agrarian reform and nationalism, Papa Isio called for the removal of non-Malays from Negros and the division of the land among the natives. It is contended that Papa Isio responded to the Philippine Revolution which was begun in August 1896 by Andrés Bonifacio. The group of babaylanes was said to have adopted \\"¡Viva Rizal!\\" (Spanish, \\"Long Live Rizal!\\"), \\"¡Viva Filipinas Libre\\" (Spanish, \\"Long Live a free Philippines!\\") and \\"Kamatayon sa Katsila\\" (Hiligaynon, \\"Death to Spaniards!\\") as their battle cries. While Filipino revolutionary General Miguel Malvar, widely acknowledged to be the last leader of the Philippine Revolution to surrender to the Americans, actually capitulated on April 16, 1902, Papa Isio gave up his struggle very much later - on August 6, 1907. Finally cornered by government forces, Papa Isio surrendered to an American officer, Lieutenant J. S. Mohler. At first, he was sentenced to death, but the punishment was later mitigated to life imprisonment. Papa Isio died in the Old Bilibid Prison in Manila in 1911. Commemoration On November 6, 2009, the National Historical Institute of the Philippines unveiled a historical marker in honor of Dionisio Magbuelas at the public plaza of Isabela, Negros Occidental. The marker states: In popular media * Filipino author Eric Gamalinda based his novel My Sad Republic loosely on the person of Papa Isio. * The Kanlaon Theater and Dance Company, the student theater and dance group of Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod, staged Papa Isio... Tingog Sang Kadam-an (Hiligaynon, \\"Papa Isio, Voice of the Masses\\"), a musical based on the life of Papa Isio, during the Second National Theater Festival hosted by the Cultural Center of the Philippines in February, 1996. * Don Papa Rum, a rum distilled from sugar cane, is inspired by Papa Isio.

During Manhattan's bootleg wars, Rothstein would bring in the Bug and Meyer Mob, led by Meyer Lansky and Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel, to protect alcohol shipments. As Luciano and Lansky had previously worked together prior to Prohibition, Meyer and Siegel were made partners in the Judeo-Italian criminal organization. By the late 1920s, the Broadway Mob supplied New York speakeasies with some of the highest quality whiskey including Sherman Billingsley's Stork Club, the Silver Slipper, Jack White's, Jack and Charlie's 21 Club among others. Even its lesser quality alcohol imported from Philadelphia mobster Waxey Gordon was considered far superior to the rotgut liquor supplied by the rest of New York's underworld. At the suggestion of Rothstein, the Broadway Mob bought interests in several popular speakeasies and nightclub which would lead to purchasing valuable real estate in Manhattan.

They are helped by Max and Gabrielle who become involved when their son Al is kidnapped to be sold. Ambrose lures them to an old factory on New Year's Eve 1989 where hidden fireworks are set to explode and kill them. Clint rescues them but the Wymans escape after shooting Max. While everyone else is at the hospital, Tina tracks down the Wymans on their yacht and pulls a gun on them. They then gain the advantage and hold her hostage. Clint and Cord rescue her before she is killed and the Wymans are arrested. Soon after, she failsto break up Cord and Debra's relationship. Tina then bids Llanview farewell with her son CJ. Mendorra The final adventures of the Rauch-era feature political intrigue in the fictional country of Mendorra, which has been wreaking havoc on Llanview citizens for years. The royal battle between brothers Prince Raymond and Roland Hohenstein come to head with Sarah and Megan being captured and held prisoner in Mendorra by the evil Prince Roland after traveling there to help Prince Raymond who went blind while rescuing Megan from a fire. Roland hatches an evil plot in which Sarah is to marry Raymond so he can assume the throne. Bo, Cord, Dorian, Cassie and Debra team up to save them and in the conclusion, Bo poses as Raymond and marries Sarah in the cathedral. After the royal wedding, Sarah, Bo, Megan and Raymond escape on skis still dressed in their wedding attire and ski down a mountain with Roland in pursuit (on location in Austria). Then Roland and Raymond battle to the death with good defeating evil and Raymond winning back the throne. Michael Grande and Drug Cartels As the new decade begins, Viki runs for mayor of Llanview on a strong anti-drug platform. Roger Gordon manages her campaign, and the two fight their mutual feelings for each other. Meanwhile, Gabrielle's mother Julia Medina (Linda Thorson), who is every bit the schemer her daughter is, sets her sights on snaring Clint. Making things even more complicated is Viki’s opponent, Herb Callison, whose campaign is managed by newly returned Dorian (now played by Elaine Princi). Viki wins, and becomes a target of the local drug cartel, whose mastermind is Michael Grande. Michael has alienated virtually everybody in Llanview. When he is gunned down, there is no shortage of suspects. But Megan is arrested, tried and found guilty of the crime. Jake Harrison (Joe Lando), new love in her life, busts her out of jail. Megan is saved from a life-without-parole sentence when her father Roger confesses to killing Michael in self-defense. (He would have confessed sooner, but he hadd been in a coma.) Michael’s drug- trafficking business is taken over by Carlo Hesser (Thom Christopher), one of the most durable villains in the series' history. Like Michael before him, Carlo becomes a bitter enemy of everybody in town, is gunned down and there is a major murder investigation lasting months. This happens not once, but twice—in 1992 and 1997. Badderly Island After all the trauma they endured in early 1990, Sarah and Bo decided to honeymoon in July and chose the remote island of Badderly as the place to go. They decided to bring the cast and crew of Fraternity Row along for a location shoot. So Sarah, Bo, Megan, Cord, Spring Skye and company travel to Badderly, but the situation turns dangerous as the gang realize that the island is infested by mobsters. Carlo's son Johnny Dee, his sister Charlotte, Tina who is involved with Johnny join an undercover Marco Dane up to another one of his schemes. Marco falls for Megan again and tries to help the gang escape; they all go undercover, Sarah as a country woman, Megan as a bookworm and Bo as a mobster. Jake and Lucky then travel to Badderly after learning about the island and Jake has to pretend he likes Charlotte so their cover is not blown. Then Marco and Megan try to escape on a raft but it capsizes and Marco has to save Megan from drowning. Then Sarah and Megan walk in the jungle and Sarah finds herself trapped in a pit of quicksand. Megan is forced to leave her and get Bo and Jake who rescue her. Then the gang discovers the drug lab on the island as their cover is blown. Bo is forced to shoot Jake who actually recovers. Then they are held hostage and survive an explosion before defeating the mob. All of the couples happily reunite. They then race back to Llanview to try to save Viki who the Hessers plan to assassinate. One of Carlo’s early heinous acts is to attempt to have Viki assassinated. He fails but does cause her to have a stroke, leaving her an invalid for many months. Unknown to anyone, Viki begins having hallucinatory visits from her alter Niki. Meanwhile, Carlo’s son Johnny Dee Hesser is stalking Tina (now played by Karen Witter) and insists that the baby she is carrying is his, not Cord’s. One night, Johnny Dee breaks into Llanfair and attempts to kidnap Tina. Viki turns into Niki (who was not affected by Viki’s stroke-induced paralysis), shoots Johnny, and reverts to Viki. Since Tina is unconscious, nobody saw \\"Niki\\", and hence everyone assumes that Viki could not possibly shoot him. Months later, Carlo learns the truth and attempts to get even by killing Megan. Gabrielle is ordered by Carlo to drug Viki, which is a part of his diabolical scheme to turn Viki into Niki, and get her to kill her own daughter, Megan. Gabrielle can not go through with Carlo's plan and is later sentenced to fifteen years in Statesville Prison (taking the fall for Carlo, who threatened her son's life). Bo marries Megan’s sister Sarah, but she is kidnapped and believed killed by Carlo Hesser’s henchmen to keep her from testifying against him. While searching for Sarah, Bo is assisted by FBI agent Alex Olanov (Tonja Walker) who later turns out to be mentally unbalanced, and develops an obsessive fixation on Bo. When Bo begins dating Dorian's daughter Cassie (Laura Koffman), Alex flips out and tries to kill her. Later, immediately after Bo and Cassie are married at Llanfair, Alex shows up with a huge surprise—Sarah, alive and well. Bo leaves Cassie to reconcile with Sarah, but she actually dies from injuries caused by a car accident in November 1993. 1992 to 1996 The mid-1990s are considered by some fans to be something of a golden age for OLTL, in part thanks to head writer Michael Malone, who introduced some popular new characters and introduced some surprisingly novel storylines. Megan's death Jake and Megan are wed, but almost as soon as they tie the knot, Jake (a P.I.) leaves on an investigation in the middle-eastern country Jaba. Jake disappears, and Megan is left not knowing whether he is alive or dead. Worse yet, Megan begins suffering from lupus. Despondent over losing Jake, she ignores her health and parties heavily, taxing her system to the limit. A desperate kidney transplant (Viki was the donor) fails to save her. Reverend Andrew Carpenter (Robert Krimmer) harbors a crush on Megan, and risks his life going to Jaba to rescue Jake just in time for husband and wife to have one last moment together. Megan dies in Jake’s arms. Cord is reportedly \\"killed\\" in Jaba as well, although he turns up a year later. In the interim, Tina takes up with con man Cain Rogan (Christopher Cousins). Carlo is believed murdered, and a lengthy police investigation ensues. One of the chief suspects is Alex Olanov, who has blackmailed Carlo into marrying her (and then entertained him with kinky bondage games). While the former FBI agent is not Carlo’s killer, she does take over his criminal empire for a time—reluctantly aided by Mortimer Bern who was separated at birth from his twin brother Carlo. New Relationships The death of Megan, and supposed death of Cord sparks a rift between Clint and Viki that grows wider over time. Viki takes an interest in Andrew’s father General Sloane Carpenter (Roy Thinnes), whose personality is disturbingly like that of Viki’s late father Victor. The unthinkable happens when Viki has an affair with Sloane, and finally divorces Clint in order to marry him. Sloane, who suffers from Hodgkin’s disease, is living on borrowed time though. Viki actually marries him while he is in the hospital intensive- care unit, and he dies shortly afterward in 1994. Dorian shocks Llanview society by brazenly dating Jason Webb (Mark Brettschneider), 21-year-old nephew of Wanda Webb Wolek (Marilyn Chris). Like Dorian, Asa returns to his old ways—he cruelly dumps Renee for the much younger new wife Blair Cramer (Mia Korf). Blair is Dorian’s niece and takes after her aunt by swindling Asa and cheating on him with Max Holden. Blair has her own grudge against Dorian over the treatment of Addie Cramer (Pamela Payton-Wright), Blair’s mentally ill mother and Dorian’s sister. Max is so smitten with Blair that he barely notices his business partner Luna Moody (Susan Battan), who co-owns the Serenity Springs Spa with him. The wacky, goddess-worshipping, New Age Luna is convinced that she and Max are soul mates—and they are. But before they marry in 1993, Luna had to fight the Specter of Death itself to save Max, and Max faced off with the ghost of Luna’s first husband Johnny; not to mention Alex, who stages a fake haunting of Serenity Springs to drive away business and stage a hostile takeover (she fails). Max later becomes a gambling addict, and Blair (who has broken up with Asa) exploits this weakness to seduce him. But when Luna suffers a near-crippling spinal injury, Max realizes what is important to him and mends his bad-boy ways. After Blair dumps Asa, he takes up with Carlo’s widow Alex. Asa and Alex are definitely two of a kind—greedy, power-mad and competitive. Alex is also prone to gaudy displays of wealth—such as her wedding to Asa, which she arrives at via a \\"royal barge\\" decked out as Cleopatra. She uses Asa’s money and connections to buy social prestige, even running for and winning the election as Llanview’s mayor. Meanwhile, Viki and Clint’s kids are SORAS-ed from young children to teenagers and young adults. Kevin Buchanan (Kirk Geiger) has a son Duke by LeeAnn Demerest (Yasmine Bleeth), and falls under Asa’s corrupting influence. When LeeAnn breaks up with him to be with Jason Webb, Kevin uses Asa’s connections and money to get a court order declaring LeeAnn an unfit mother, which gives him sole custody of Duke. Jason kidnaps Duke, and LeeAnn goes into hiding with him, but they are eventually found and arrested. Kevin turns over a new leaf though, thanks in large part to the influence of a new love interest—Rachel Gannon (Ellen Bethea), and allows LeeAnn to leave town with Duke. Homophobia Joey’s best friend Billy Douglas (Ryan Phillippe) comes out as gay and is at the center of a major town scandal: wild child Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell) spreads rumors that Rev. Andrew had sexually molested Billy, and homophobia spreads through Llanview in the summer of 1992. Andrew’s brother is a gay man who died of AIDS, and he fought against the town’s desire to stigmatize gay people. The storyline culminates with the AIDS quilt coming to Llanview. Andrew and Cassie fall in love and are married soon after. Bo and Sarah are on their way to get remarried when a hit-and-run driver runs them off the road and Sarah is killed. Bo almost has a nervous breakdown trying to track down the man responsible. He is aided in his search by Nora Hanen Gannon (Hillary B. Smith), the ex-wife of the district attorney Hank Gannon (Nathan Purdee) and mother of his daughter Rachel. Nora, a lawyer herself, begins experiencing blackouts and headaches from a brain tumor. For a time, she mistakenly believes that she herself was the hit-and-run driver who ran Bo’s car off the road (she had blacked out that night due to stress from the tumor.) Bo and Nora fall in love, and the two \\"rockin' oldies\\" fans are eventually married by none other than Little Richard (who is an ordained minister in real life). Marty's Rape Several people, including Andrew and Viki, try to befriend the very troubled Marty. She adamantly resists help and creates trouble for everyone who reaches out to her. In time, she mellows. But her trouble-making history comes back to haunt her in a big way in the spring of 1993. After getting drunk at a college fraternity party, she is gang-raped by three students. The ringleader is the sociopath Todd Manning (Roger Howarth). Because of her inebriation, Marty mistakenly thinks that Kevin Buchanan (Kirk Geiger) is one of her assailants (he is not). When Marty presses charges, the entire town is polarized, with many people believing this is one more in a string of her mean-spirited lies. Marty eventually realizes that Kevin is not one of her attackers, and retracts the charges against him, even though it hurts her case. The rest of the defendants are almost cleared of the charges because crucial evidence can not be located. But their defense attorney, Nora, realizes that Todd and his cronies really are guilty, and during her closing argument loses her cool and rails against her own clients. Todd went to jail, but fools a naïve Christian missionary girl Rebecca Lewis (Reiko Aylesworth) into believing he has changed his ways. With her unwitting help, Todd escapes from jail. While a fugitive from justice, Todd gets into a fight with Marty’s boyfriend Suede Pruitt (David Ledingham) that accidentally results in the latters death. Todd also menaces a temporarily blind Nora before being apprehended by the new police commissioner, Bo. However, Todd shows he has a good side when he rescues Cord and Tina’s kids C.J. and Sarah, Jessica Buchanan, and even Marty from a perilous car crash. Because of this, Todd is given a chance to redeem himself and released on probation—much to the dismay of many Llanview-ites. Marty even circulates a petition to have Todd returned to jail. He does reform himself, although he maintains his surly disposition. Surprisingly, he finds a soul mate in Blair, another town pariah who wants a shot at redemption. Dorian Meanwhile, Viki and Dorian’s long feud re- ignites (Robin Strasser had returned to the role at this point). Viki discovers evidence that supports her long-held belief that Dorian murdered her father, and had her nemesis is brought up on charges. Dorian's lawyer, Nora, finds conflicting evidence from a Lord family butler who says he saw Tina's mother, Irene Clayton, fleeing from Victor’s room just after he died. Nevertheless, Dorian is found guilty and given a death sentence for Victor’s murder. Yet, she is saved by a handsome young man named David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) who claimed to witnesds Irene murder Victor. Even more shocking is his claim that he is Irene and Victor's son. Dorian, free from jail, seeks revenge in an unusual way—she seduces Viki’s son Joey (SORAS-ed yet again and played by Nathan Fillion). Dorian manipulates the boy into falling in love with her, and then lures Viki to her house to find them (on her scheduled wedding day to Sloane). But once again, Dorian’s revenge scenario backfires on her—she genuinely falls in love with Joey. Later, when Joey transfers his affections to Dorians niece Kelly Cramer (Gina Tognoni), she takes it quite hard. Victor's son David is not Victor's son—he is a con man who has learned of the existence of the son and tries to pass himself off to steal a trust fund. David’s scheme unravels when he falls for Tina, who is supposed to be his sister. He entrusts her with his secret, but she can not keep it. Eventually, Cord finds out and exposes them both. The true identity of Victor's missing son is a huge shock—it is Todd. Todd is one of the last people to know the truth; even Blair discovers the secret first. Once she knows, Blair makes certain to sink her claws into Todd (a potential millionaire) before he asserts his birthright—she claims she is pregnant and cajoled him into marrying her. Later, after learning the truth and obtaining his inheritance, Todd suspects Blair has bamboozled him and demands she take a pregnancy test. Even Blair is surprised when the test comes back positive. She miscarries after being assaulted by muggers. Viki's New Alters David’s fraud (and Tina's complicity) is the latest in a string of stressful incidents for Viki—divorcing Clint, Dorian’s seduction of Joey, Sloane’s death—that finally take a toll on her psyche. The final straw is when Viki has an angry confrontation with Dorian, in which Dorian reveals the late Victor’s darkest secret: he is a pedophile who seduced and repeatedly raped Viki over the entire course of her childhood. Faced with memories that she has repressed for her adult life, Viki snaps and reverts to her multiple personality disorder (now known as Dissociative identity disorder). But this time, she exhibits a number of new personalities beside \\"Niki\\". The main new \\"alter\\" (alternate identity) is \\"Jean Randolph\\" (a skewed version of Viki's mother, and a control freak), as well as \\"Princess\\" (a frightened little girl), \\"Tommy\\" (a violent young boy) and \\"Tori\\" (the most explicitly vengeful of the alters). \\"Jean\\" imprisons Dorian in Llanfair’s secret room for a while. When she finally lets her go, she forces her to marry David Vickers to keep her away from Joey. Eventually though, \\"Tori\\" takes control and actively seeks to destroy everything that Victor Lord has ever built. \\"Tori\\" sets Llanfair on fire, hoping it will burn to the ground. But she realizes that Viki’s daughter Jessica is still inside. Viki reasserted herself to rescue Jessie, and after many months of drama involving the alters, undergoes psychotherapy to deal with the reality of her childhood. She remembers the most terrible secret of her life in therapy though; back in 1976, she briefly became \\"Tori\\" and murdered Victor (although years later, it would be revealed that Victor survived the attempt on his life). Viki was found not guilty of murder by reason of temporary insanity, but her life was forever changed. Diversity Returns to Llanview Throughout his tenure as head writer, Malone had steadily reintroduced racial and cultural diversity into Llanview—the members of the Gannon family (brothers Hank and RJ, and Hank’s daughter Rachel) are all important characters; Hank’s ex-wife Nora was OLTL’s first major Jewish character since the 1970s; and Billy Douglas was one of the first gay characters in the history of daytime TV. In 1995, Malone introduced the working-class and largely Hispanic Angel Square neighborhood of Llanview, and the Vega family. Angel Square is overrun by gangland drug war violence, and mayor Alex Buchanan wants to raze the whole place to put up an arts center (named in her honor). However, many residents fight hard to save their homes. Carlotta Vega (Patricia Maureci) is introduced as Dorian’s maid, but later owns and operates the Vega Diner. She dates Clint, and later Hank. Carlotta’s younger son Cristian Vega (Yorlin Madera, David Fumero) becomes Jessica’s teenage romance. Cristian’s older brother Antonio Vega (Kamar De Los Reyes) is in jail, although Bo arranges to have him pardoned in exchange for his help ending the gang wars. Antonio fell in love with police officer Andy Harrison (Wendee Pratt). Luna’s brother Dylan Moody (Christopher Douglas) opens a youth-center in Angel Square, in between dates with Marty Saybrooke. Tragically, Luna is one of the victims of the gang violence—being hit by a stray bullet during a shoot-out. Months later, Cristian designs a new angel statue that is erected in the center square bearing Luna’s likeness. Todd An extremely controversial character, Todd is, however, allowed to mend fences with his old enemy Marty, form a sibling bond with Viki, and even reconcile and remarry Blair (who is again pregnant by him) before being presumed dead and written out. Meanwhile, Marty finds herself in the middle of a love triangle. She marrys Dylan, but her heart truly belongs to Irish poet Patrick Thornhart (Thorsten Kaye). Blair blames Marty for Todd’s supposedly tragic accident. She gives birth to daughter Starr Manning, then chases after Patrick, for no better reason than to irritate Marty. Writer Malone resigned from his head writer position in early 1996. 1996 to 1999 Several actors left the show taking their characters out of Llanview: Nathan Fillion (Joey), Tonja Walker (Alex), Jon Loprieno (Cord), and Stephanie Williams (Sheila) all left the show in 1996. Kamar De Los Reyes and Wendee Pratt, who played popular supercouple Antonio and Andy, left in 1997. Susan Haskell and Thorsten Kaye (Marty and Patrick) also departed that year. Carlo Carlo Hesser is resurrected and becomes a part of every ongoing storyline as the major villain. This is so that Carlo can be killed, and another a major \\"Who killed Carlo Hesser?\\" storyline can take place with everybody in town named as a suspect. Still seeking revenge against Viki for the death of his son Johnny, he blackmails her psychiatrist into hypnotizing her. He wants to make her hate her son Kevin enough to shoot him. Carlo also enlists Alex’s help in fleecing Asa. Using the alias \\"Poseidon\\", Carlo is emailing Asa about an offshore gambling operation, but it is a scam to swindle him. Meanwhile, Asa pressures Alex to give him a new heir. Not wanting to actually have a child, Alex claims she is pregnant and stuffs a pillow under her shirt to fake a belly. Eventually Asa gets wise and publicly exposes mayor Alex’s dirty dealings, ripping the pillow out of her shirt, before divorcing her. Alex is forced to resign from her office in disgrace. However she gets the last laugh on Asa and his family. When she leaves town, she leaves a videotaped good-bye with personalized insults for all the Buchanan family members, and reveals she is leaving in the company of Carlo, who had inexplicably survived his second murder. Drew Bo’s son Drew Buchanan (Victor Browne) is brought back and has a romance with Kelly after Joey leaves town. Like everyone else at this time, Drew is connected to Carlo. Also, Drew’s mother Becky Lee Abbott (Mary Gordon Murray) returns to town, but acts remarkably different than the character had in the past. Whereas Becky Lee has always been a sweet-natured, aspiring country and western singer, she is now depicted as a small-time grifter. Days of Our Lives star Crystal Chappell was brought in amid much fanfare to play Maggie Carpenter, Max’s new love interest. It is revealed that the free-spirited, saucy Maggie is a novitiate nun. Maggie eventually leaves the church with the intention of opening a \\"circus arts\\" school. Maggie was written out shortly after that. Marty, Patrick, Blair, and Todd Marty and Patrick narrowly survive Irish assassins, mad bombers, Carlo's schemes, and Blair. Blair blames Marty for Todd's \\"death\\" and seeks to steal Patrick from her. Blair succeeds in seducing Patrick, and being impregnated just before Todd returns from the dead. While Blair's new pregnancy was written because actress Kassie DePavia (née Wessley) was pregnant in real life, it left a sticky situation for the characters to resolve. In 1997, new head writer Claire Labine \\"solved\\" the problem by having Blair's cousin Kelly crash into Blair and Patrick's car. Blair's unborn baby dies, and she lashes out at Todd before going into a coma. Desperate to keep custody of their other child Starr, Todd marries Tea Delgado (Florencia Lozano), his lawyer, but a woman he barely knows, to make a fake family life. Tea represents him in the custody battle. Todd also gets a parrot, and talks to the parrot about his life in a number of scenes. Other stories at the time involvedMarty and Patrick's wedding ending in a hail of gunfire and blood, Dorian's struggles to hide her dark family past, Nora struggling with peri-menopause, and RJ Gannon opening a new bar with a transvestite mixologist. The Phelps Era In early 1998 ABC hired Jill Farren Phelps as executive producer and Pam Long as head writer. The first few months of their tenure (featuring a mystery over who killed Nora's crazy assistant Georgie—the killer was Nora’s daughter Rachel)—were well received. However, popular characters were killed (such as Dorian's husband Mel and Bo's son Drew) or written out (such as Dorian's daughter Cassie). Many longtime characters like Nora, Jessica, and Viki were given stories which revolved around the new Rappaport/Davidson family. Linda Dano was added to the cast in late 1999, after the cancellation of Another World. Dano had played a supporting role on OLTL twenty years earlier, Gretel Cummings. The character, renamed Rae Cummings, returns to Llanview. Dano appears as Rae on all four of ABC's soaps at the time—General Hospital, All My Children and Port Charles in an attempt to promote all four shows to viewers of the individual shows. Similarly, actress Robin Christopher resurrected her AMC character Skye Chandler as a OLTL vixen, before taking the same character to GH. Phelps hired many actors she had previously worked with to play Llanview characters—Mark Derwin, Kale Browne, John Bolger, Timothy Gibbs. Moments like Todd punching Tea in the face and Nora sleeping with her former lover Sam to give her sterile husband a child provided some powerful drama, but to many viewers, came at the expense of character integrity. Beloved couple Nora and Bo split bitterly. Jessica Meanwhile, beloved teen heroine Jessica (Erin Torpey), who had worried about whether or not she wanted to sleep with boyfriend Cristian, loses her virginity during a drunken night with stepbrother Will Rappaport. She becomes pregnant, but when Dorian runs her down as she is about to give birth, the baby dies. Jessica, in an altered state of mind, begins stalking Dorian. Soon she goes on the run to Ireland with Cristian and fugitive Will, singing in a rock and roll band. In early 1999, Long left, and Phelps (with some help from Harding Lemay) was essentially head writer for an entire year. Eventually Megan McTavish took over writing chores and created a series of dark storylines involving mobsters, the search for Asa's real son, and tortured love triangles (Kevin/Kelly/Joey; Blair/Max/Skye). Max fakes being Asa's son, develops a brain tumor, strings both ladies along, and is then shot in the back by Blair.

It is considered to be the most famous episode of the show. In 1997, TV Guide ranked it #2 on their list of the \\"100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\\".The 100 Greatest TV Episodes In 2009, they ranked it #4 on their list of \\"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time.\\"\\"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time\\" TV Guide; June 15, 2009; Pages 34–49Empire, June 19, 2009 The initial episode was watched by 68% of the television viewing audience at the time. Plot Ricky (Desi Arnaz) is given an opportunity to host a television show and is notified that he needs to find a girl to do a commercial spot for one of their sponsors. Lucy (Lucille Ball) begs Ricky to let her do the commercial, but he refuses. Lucy asks Fred (William Frawley) to assist Lucy in a scheme to get Ricky to watch a show with her in it when he returns home from his band rehearsal. Lucy waits behind the TV screen to do a mock commercial as Johnny, the bellhop of Phillip Morris fame. Ricky, disliking the stunt, goes behind the set and plugs the cord back into its outlet, which accidentally sets off a minor explosion behind her. Ricky finds out that Lucy had taken out each part of the television set piece by piece (rather than sliding the whole chassis out) so that she could fit into the box. The following morning, Lucy avoids Ricky. Ricky asks Fred if he can wait for a telephone call from the girl willing to do the commercial to tell her the time and studio. After Ricky leaves, Lucy tells Fred she will deliver the message instead. Lucy tells the girl she is not needed for the commercial and takes her place. The director of the commercial (Ross Elliot) explains their sales pitch regarding the \\"Vitameatavegamin\\" health tonic to Lucy. What Lucy and the director are unaware of—but what the propman (Jerry Hausner) realizes to his shock—is that the tonic contains 23% alcohol. Lucy begins her first take, which makes her grimace, as the tonic tastes terrible. After a few more practices, Lucy becomes intoxicated and her speech becomes comically slurred. The director asks the propman to take her to her dressing room to rest until the commercial. When the television show begins, Ricky sings \\"El Relicario\\", but Lucy comes out from backstage and staggers toward Ricky. She sways, waves to the camera, starts singing along with Ricky, and repeats her sales pitch in the middle of his singing despite Ricky's attempts to keep her offscreen. Ricky desperately carries her off the stage. Notes *In later reruns, the scene where Lucy is in a broken television set doing \\"The Lucy Ricardo Show\\" edited out the sponsor she announced, Philip Morris, which was sponsoring I Love Lucy at the time. (Tobacco advertisements were banned from broadcast television beginning in 1971.) The DVD release, as well as the colorized episode, restore this. *The Vitameatavegamin was originally 11% alcohol, but was increased to 23% on the show. The bottle from which Lucille Ball was at first pouring the tonic, and later drinking from directly, actually contained apple pectin. *Vivian Vance, who plays Ethel on the series, is absent from this episode.

It connects Martigny at and Le Châtelard (Finhaut). The road from Martigny to the Col has an average gradient of 6% but in parts is closer to 8%. After the Col, and Le Châtelard, the road leads to Chamonix in France via Vallorcine and the Col des Montets. The pass was little known in the 19th century. It was not until the rise in tourism, particularly in Chamonix, that the region became a popular tourist area. History The pass was originally a track used by mule teams and smugglers that zig-zagged up the mountain face from Martigny and over into France. Construction on the road was begun in 1827 and the tunnel completed in 1836 (and expanded in 1905). The road was at first opened only to public transport and was not open to private vehicles until 1920. At the time, the pass was closed at night, and the speed limit was . Today, the pass is an important link to the tourist areas around the Mont Blanc. There is a restaurant and shop at the pass, and it is a popular destination for weekend excursions and bicycle and motorcycle tours. A number of trailheads at the pass invite hikers into the mountains (Arpille, Bovine, etc.) or to the foot of the nearby glacier (Glacier du Trient). The pass is generally open in winter, but together with the Col des Montets on the French side it can be closed in extreme weather and will frequently require snow chains and/or winter tires. In the event of closure, travellers who want to go to Chamonix must take the long detour around Lake Geneva. Conditions can be checked with Chamonix tourist office. There is another connection from Martigny to France (by train only) through the Vallée du Trient (Gorges du Trient): the line Martigny au Châtelard (Chemin de Fer de Martigny au Châtelard)/Chamonix (Ligne de Saint Gervais - Vallorcine).

He co-founded the Handel Society of New York with entrepreneur James Grayson in 1966. Early life Judson studied violin beginning at the age of eight, and continued his studies for one year as a teenager with the composer, conductor, violinist Max Bendix and the violinist Leopold Lichtenberg in New York. At the age of nineteen, he became the dean of the music department at Denison University, Granville, Ohio from 1900 to 1907. In 1903 at Denison, he performed the Richard Strauss Violin Sonata in what he called the first public performance in the United States. He returned to New York in 1907 to attempt a recital career. He also spent eight years on the staff of Musical America magazine, serving as advertising manager and critic. Disillusioned of a concert career (he said of this time \\"I was a good violinist, but no Kreisler or Heifetz\\"), Judson was pleased to be offered a lucrative management career. Orchestra manager and artists' manager A benefit of Judson's Musical America job was traveling to hear concerts and meeting the people who performed or attended the concerts. Judson was therefore already known for his knowledge of music and judgment on musicians of quality when he was appointed as the manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra in July 1915. Within months, he launched Concert Management Arthur Judson, Inc. in Philadelphia to manage artists, and commuted daily to his New York office where he set up a second artists’ management office. With three partners, he organized the Judson Radio Program as another venue for his artists in 1926. His attempt to get an exclusive contract with David Sarnoff at the National Broadcasting Company for the radio program failed. Judson and his partners therefore purchased a low-power station owned by the Atlantic Broadcasting Company and by January 27, 1927 signed up a network of sixteen stations known as the United Independent Broadcasters to carry his program. William S. Paley purchased this network on September 25, 1927 and it became the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), with Judson as the second largest stockholder. In 1930, Judson became the president of Columbia Concerts Corporation (which is now Columbia Artists Management). William S. Paley was chairman of the board. Judson amalgamated seven independent concert bureaus in what would become known as the \\"Judson Empire\\". These were the Wolfsohn Music Bureau, Haensel and Jones, The Metropolitan Musical Bureau, Evans and Salter, American Opera Company, and the Community Concert Service of Ward French. Also included in this amalgamation was Concert Management Arthur Judson. The new company managed 125 artists and organizations, approximately two-thirds of the top musicians in America. Judson managed the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1915 to 1935 and the New York Philharmonic from 1922 to 1956. Judson's zenith was reached between 1930 and 1935 when he simultaneously managed the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, instituted and managed the summer New York Stadium concert series at Lewisohn Stadium 1920-1943 in New York and the summer Robin Hood Dell concerts in Philadelphia 1930-1935 as well as serving as president of Columbia Concerts Corporation. He also was the advisory manager of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra for five years (1924–1928). As an impresario, he advised many other organizations. When Theodore Spiering, conductor of the Oregon Symphony, suddenly died in 1925 the orchestra called Judson. His recommendation, Willem van Hoogstraten, was hired. When the Minneapolis Symphony (now the Minnesota Orchestra) needed a conductor in 1931, Judson recommended Eugene Ormandy. Judson also recommended the successors to Ormandy in Minneapolis: Dimitri Mitropoulos and Antal Doráti. Some likened the Minneapolis orchestra to Judson's \\"farm team\\". Judson was not only big in the music world, he was also a physically big man described as six foot four, 200 pounds, possessing a massive head, barrel chest, and also huge hands useful for his favorite pastime of chopping wood. He had a ruddy complexion which he explained as a \\"permanent rage\\" induced by dealing with artists. He was impeccably groomed and worked standing at a high antique desk while he smoked cigars. He was surrounded by steel engravings, shelves of books, antique furnishings, and old pewter. He was always available to walk across the street to Carnegie Hall to listen to an audition. He was extremely choosy when it came to pianists and violinists, accepting very few. He considered himself a \\"disappointed conductor\\" but made up for this by conducting the 100-piece summer orchestra at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, beginning in 1898. The Community Artists series made it possible for communities to obtain high quality artists without having to assume high financial risks since the concerts were prepaid. Artists had more opportunities too, but in return they paid a 20 percent commission to Judson's Columbia Concerts Corporation and another 20 percent to Community Artists. Many artists believed they were being exploited and not promoted. The only other company in this field, NBC Artists Service (which opened in 1928), shared the market and did not compete with Judson. In 1939 Judson was called before the Federal Communications Commission to testify. This was described in a highly unflattering Time magazine article on February 6, 1939 titled \\"Chain-Store Music\\". Readers were surprised to learn that music was organized just like any other business. Salesmen toured the country selling musicians to 376 communities involved in the Community Artists series. In order to get the big-name artists, lesser known commodities also had to be purchased. There was plenty to choose from in the catalog: Columbia Concerts Corporation controlled two-thirds of the nation's musical artists and conductors. Impending government investigations into the concert management monopoly caused William S. Paley to resign as chairman of the board and sell his interests to Judson in 1941. CBS and NBC also sold their agencies to their directors to avoid monopoly investigations. Judson renamed the company Columbia Artists Management. NBC became the National Concert Artists Corporation. There were some musicians Judson did not represent. One was the conductor Artur Rodziński. Judson attempted to stop Rodzinski from taking over the Cleveland Orchestra in 1933 (an attempt that failed). Judson succeeded in stopping Rodzinski from taking over the New York Philharmonic in 1936. In 1947, Rodzinski who had finally become the conductor of the New York Philharmonic with Judson's short-term assistance battled with Judson over hiring and programming. Addressing the board, he called Judson (who was present) \\"a dictator who made musical progress impossible\\". Rodzinski requested that the orchestra board then choose between himself and Judson The board sided with Judson. Rodzinski also lost his next job as conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra over programming disputes, purportedly due to the influence of Judson. Two other conductors who believed Judson damaged their careers were Eugene Aynsley Goossens and Otto Klemperer. Goossens decided, after twelve years, he no longer needed to pay Judson a commission. Judson forced him to pay in an out-of-court settlement, and then dumped him. Klemperer, engaged by Judson for the first fourteen weeks of the New York Philharmonic's 1935-1936 season made the \\"mistake\\" of programming Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 2 over Judson's objections. Judson thereafter abandoned Klemperer. Strained relations with a major conductor and the impropriety and conflict of interest in managing artists and orchestras which then hired the same artists caused Judson to resign his orchestra management positions. He announced his resignation as Philadelphia's manager on October 8, 1934 (which became effective May 31, 1935). The cause was increasingly strained relations with its conductor Leopold Stokowski. Although the two collaborated in later years, Stokowski said at the time \\"Mr. Judson is not my manager\\". New York Times's music critic Howard Taubman's article \\"The New York Philharmonic-- What's Wrong and Why?\\" appeared on April 29, 1956. Taubman alleged over-hiring of Columbia artists at the New York Philharmonic and may have encouraged the seventy-five-year-old Judson to resign from that post. One singer Arthur Judson did not represent (but probably should have) was Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman. In 1948, Margaret's agent, James A. Davidson, listened to her complaints about getting few bookings. She learned from Davidson that concerts in the U.S. were largely controlled by Columbia and the National Concert Artists Corporation. Margaret told her father what she had heard, and the president requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigate. In October 1955, the United States Department of Justice filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Columbia along with three other defendants were charged with restraint of interstate trade and commerce in the booking of artists, and also with monopolizing organized audience associations. The agencies pleaded no contest and were forced to release their monopoly position. By this time, Arthur Judson had been replaced at Columbia by Ward French. Amongst the artists Judson presented and represented: Ruth St. Denis, Marian Anderson, John Barbirolli, Robert Casadesus, Van Cliburn, Clifford Curzon, Todd Duncan, Nelson Eddy, Benjamino Gigli, Mischa Elman, Zino Francescatti, Gary Graffman, Jascha Heifetz, Vladimir Horowitz, Jose Iturbi, Lorin Maazel, Yehudi Menuhin, Eugene Ormandy, Lily Pons, Fritz Reiner, Rudolf Serkin and Helen Traubel. Awards included being elected an officer in the French Academy, 1920; an honorary Doctorate in Music from Denison University, 1931, and the Order of the Academie des Beaux Arts, 1941.

The series starts with One Life to Live storylines (1968–79). The plot continues in One Life to Live storylines (1980–89). The plot in the next decade is outlined in One Life to Live storylines (1990–99) and the story concludes in One Life to Live storylines (2000–13). One Life to Live (2000-2013) 2000 Into the new millennium, more new characters were introduced, including Lindsay's (Catherine Hickland) sister Melanie (Darlene Vogel) and her husband Colin (Ty Treadway). Colin was killed, but his twin brother was brought on the canvas, only to lose his mind and become a killer. Phelps' tenure saw the departure of a number of long-running actors, such as Laura Koffman (Cassie), Clint Ritchie (Clint), and Strasser (again). 2001 and 2002 When Phelps and McTavish left in early 2001, they were replaced by executive producer Gary Tomlin and writers Lorraine Broderick and Christopher Whitesell. Many of the actors hired under Phelps' tenure were let go. Fan favorite Gabrielle returned after a ten-year absence and romanced Max, then Bo. Storylines became more campy, and the show had a much-acclaimed week in May 2002 where the episodes were broadcast live. This experimentation was mixed with truly dark tales such as Todd selling Blair's baby, telling her the child was dead and then passing him off as an adopted baby when he realized he was the natural father. Another story involved Viki returning to her former split personality Niki Smith to block out the painful memory of being raped by Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born). She had one child with Clint (Natalie) and the other child (Jessica) was fathered by Mitch. Another storyline was Antonio (Kamar de los Reyes) having a one-night stand with a woman who turned out to be his fiancé Keri's (Sherri Saum) mother, Liz (Barbara Niven). She then implanted her embryo into Keri, meaning that Keri was unknowingly giving birth to her fiancé's child. To the chagrin of many viewers, much airtime was devoted to Lindsay's daughter, Jen (Jessica Morris). 2003 In early 2003, Malone and Josh Griffith were rehired as head writers with Frank Valentini taking over as executive producer. A new major storyline involved Mitch kidnapping sisters, Natalie and Jessica, to figure out which one's heart was a match for their grandfather. Victor had been faking his death. He was too ill to have major confrontations with his children and died a few weeks into the story. Dorian then showed up as Mitch's new bride, and she became enmeshed in a storyline involving a jewel hunt as well as a \\"curse\\" that blinded Mitch. Mitch was later killed by Jessica. Another story involved the return of Cord and Tina's daughter, Sarah Roberts, as rock singer Flash (Shanelle Workman). Flash dated, and even kissed, Joey Buchanan (Bruce Michael Hall), her cousin. Joey, who was a minister at the time, then married Jen Rappaport, but the marriage did not last due to her affair with former husband Rex Balsom. Joey was then sent back to London to live with Clint. Roger Howarth had come and gone several times but quit for good in early 2003. Mitch had him kidnapped. When the character returned several months later, he was posing as Mitch's brother Walker and was played by Trevor St. John. Apparently Todd had been so badly beaten that he had to get extensive plastic surgery. In spite of much fear that viewers would never accept any other actor as Todd, the talented St. John became popular and Todd, for the first time in a decade, had love scenes as well as a semi-functional relationship with Blair. In April 2003, Dorian Lord returned with plans to strike it rich. She married Mitch Laurence, claiming she \\"loved him\\". It was later found out that she married him to pay him back for the harm he did to the Cramer and Buchanan families. Viki developed heart trouble and was saved by a heart transplant from her comatose husband, Ben. One of the most appreciated storylines of the second Malone/Griffith era was Marcie Walsh (Kathy Brier)'s struggle with her self- esteem and her love story with Al Holden (Nathaniel Marston). Inexplicably, Marston was fired, while Al was killed off despite the couple's immense popularity. But a write-in campaign led by Marcal fans convinced ABC to rehire Marston, in spite of his character having died on screen. Al's spirit took over Michael McBain's body, causing the ghost to lose all memories as Al, and court Marcie and Michael. Brooding actor Michael Easton (who had a following as Stephen Clay/Caleb Morley, a singing vampire, on Port Charles) was hired as Michael's cop brother, John McBain. John was introduced as a pool tournament organizer who recruited Natalie for her pool skills. Natalie and John had an instant connection and attraction to each other but Natalie was engaged to Cristian. Unknown to her and Cristian, John was an undercover FBI agent working on a bust to trap Walker Flynn, Mitch Lawrence's brother who had been paid by Todd to use his face as a cover. After Natalie and Cristian wed, they flew to Las Vegas for a high-stakes pool competition against the Black Widow. Antonio, who learned of John's identity at Cristian's bachelor party, joined them in Las Vegas along with Jessica. John told Natalie to lose on purpose or he would kill her and Cristian. When Natalie learned that both Cristian and Roxy bet their life savings on her, she won the tournament. Chaos erupted eventually leading to Cristian Vega's death only a day after he married Natalie. In her grief, Natalie lashed out at John who made it his mission to make it up to her. John was reassigned to the Music Box Killer case in New Jersey but remained in Llanview when the serial killer killed a local Private Investigator, Alyssa Collins. John worked alongside Bo and Antonio on the case, forming a friendship with both. Eventually, Natalie's heart softened toward John and they began a close friendship. Al's mother, Gabrielle, was murdered by the Music Box Killer, and Al's father, Max, left town, thus removing the Holden family from the canvas. Next came the saga of the Santi mobster family, to whom Antonio learned he was related. To the detriment of ratings (which fell to an all-time low in the summer of 2004), much of the action revolved around new characters: Antonio's brother Tico (who married Jessica Buchanan), stepsister Sonia, and mother Angelina. 2004 Writers Malone and Griffith chose to leave and were replaced by Dena Higley in December 2004. On the day he was to remarry Blair, Todd was kidnapped by the crazed Margaret Cochran, who in a homage to Misery, tied him up for weeks in a secluded cabin while he recovered from his injuries. She then drugged him and forced him to have sex in order to impregnate herself, a throwback to his history of rape. Margaret then conspired to get rid of Todd's wife, Blair, by locking her in the trunk of her car. Margaret became pregnant and stabbed Todd because he tried to strangle her. To keep her away from his family, Todd took Margaret to a lake, and she never came back to shore. A few weeks later, her body and the unborn child washed up on shore. Todd was arrested for the crime and was tried for first-degree murder and sent to death row. Todd was trying to prove his innocence with the help of Evangeline (his lawyer), but did he or someone else kill Margaret? 2005 A storyline played out in 2005 in which Nora's (Hillary B. Smith) new husband, politician Daniel Colson (Mark Dobies) was revealed to be Paul Cramer's murderer. He first framed his son's girlfriend Jennifer Rappaport (Jessica Morris) for the crime, and then suffocated her when she learned the truth. But the revelation that his killing spree was all to cover up his homosexuality proved controversial in the media. During this time, Natalie's husband, Cristian Vega, was in Statesville Prison. Attorney Evangeline Williamson took over his case and won, which led to the release of Cristian Vega. After Cristian's release, Evangeline and Cristian grew closer and fell in love. Nora's health took a downturn after she suffered a massive stroke during an argument with Bo about Paige. She remained in a coma for several months, but eventually made a full recovery. Jessica, meanwhile, had developed a split personality, changing into bad girl \\"Tess\\" who goaded Viki into having a heart attack. Jess/Tess become pregnant either by Jessica's boyfriend, Antonio, or Tess's boyfriend, Nash (who has a past of his own). Concerned that the baby was actually Antonio's, Tess destroyed the sample that would identify the actual father. Viki then became Niki Smith and kidnapped Jessica, forcing her to become Tess in order to finally discover what made Tess emerge and would destroy Viki forever. Tess refused to tell Niki her secret because if anyone knew, Jessica would integrate into the dominant personality. Determined to know what happened to their daughter, Viki and Clint returned to the bar where Niki had taken Jessica when she was a child. The evidence pointed to a house a couple of blocks away from the bar, where they discovered VHS tapes buried underneath the house labeled with Tess's name as well as those of other young girls. Viki and Clint decided to give the evidence to Bo, but before Tess's tape could be released to the police, Viki and Clint begged Bo to let them see what had happened to their daughter. Jessica's abuse at the hands of a pedophile led to the original creation of the \\"Tess\\" personality. Jessica gave birth to a little girl named Brennan (or Bree for short), and the father was later revealed to be Nash. Tess and Jess were later integrated, and Jessica married Antonio Vega. 2006 May 2006 was a month with both tragedies and happier times for Llanview. Duke Buchanan, son of Kevin Buchanan, was injured after a tornado wreaked havoc on the town during Michael McBain and Marcie Walsh's wedding. Kevin was heartbroken as he was forced to choose who would get a life-saving surgery and chose Kelly over Duke. Kelly survived but Duke died. Kelly became pregnant with Duke's baby and later gave birth to a premature baby, Zane Buchanan. Kelly, Kevin, and the baby left Llanview to start life anew in London. It turned out that Spencer Truman, revealed to be David Vickers' half brother, framed Todd Manning by faking Margaret's death, wiping her memory, and gave Margaret's baby away. David Vickers, Natalie Buchanan, and John McBain later found a very-much-alive Margaret in Thailand. She had no memory of what happened to her or her baby. On Todd's execution day, John stormed into the execution chamber with Margaret in tow. By then, Todd had already been given the injections and Blair was devastated. Blair was shocked to find that Margaret was alive and Todd was telling the truth all along. She begged Spencer to save Todd, and he did. Meanwhile, the police talked to Margaret about what happened. She did not remember anything of what happened but later regained her memory during transport to jail. Unfortunately, the van she was in was involved in an accident and she was killed. Later, Blair realized that Spencer was indeed behind the framing of Todd. She helped the Llanview police by getting proof that Spencer may have killed John's father, not David, as had previously been thought. He was arrested and put on trial. In August 2006, Dorian's daughter, Adriana Cramer (Melissa Fumero), was kidnapped by Bruce Bartlett, and held for ransom. Bruce was killed and Adriana was rescued by Rex Balsom (John-Paul Lavoisier) and Dorian, but the damage was done. Adriana was angry at her mother's involvement. Dorian had hired Bruce to stalk Adriana because she despised Adriana's boyfriend, Rex, and did everything she could to cause them to break up. Adriana moved out but was later reconciled with her mother on Christmas Day, at the urgency of Carlotta Vega. Hugh Hughes learned that Paige and Spencer were his biological parents. Just after Hugh found out about that, there was a major car accident involving the car in which he was traveling with John McBain. Michael McBain went with Bo to identify the body and it turned out to be John. Everybody thought that John had died. However, later, everyone soon learned that John was the one in a hospital burn unit, and Hugh was the casualty. After being released to a sterile environment, John failed to take his medication properly, forcing Natalie to put it in his food. John discovered what Natalie was doing, and they broke up. Cristian's return from the dead didn't thrill the art world, so Cris became a boxer. New arrival Vincent Jones (One Life to Live) became Cris' manager, but was working to make it look as though Cris botched a fight. Cris lost his boxing career, and Vincent was cleared of all charges. However, Layla was not willing to forgive Vincent, until after an encounter with death. A racist arsonist began targeting Llanview, causing the death of Ted Osbourne and the catatonic state of Evangeline Williamson. Vincent, Layla, Adriana and Rex were almost killed and all were shocked to learn that ex-baseball player Tate Harmon was the arsonist. Tate was apprehended and sent to prison. Starr Manning found new love with a boy named Cole Thornhart. After a roid rage on Cole's part, Cole was arrested, and the Mannings were baffled to discover that Cole was the son of Marty Saybrooke and Patrick Thornhart. With their parents forbidding them to see each other, Starr and Cole eventually continued their relationship in secret. Overcoming several roadblocks, Cole and Starr got their happy ending during prom night. Due to the threat of Lee Ramsey, Todd set plans to move his family to Hawaii, forcing Starr to have one last special night with Cole. Cole and Starr made love for the first time, but were interrupted by Todd. Surviving Todd's multiple beatings, Cole was again forbidden from seeing Starr. But Starr soon learned that she was pregnant, and telling Cole, ran away. Todd caught up with them, with Blair learning the truth. Wanting Marcie and Michael to adopt her baby, Starr began fighting with Cole, who wanted to keep the baby as a legacy of his deceased parents. Cole came clean with Todd about the pregnancy, and the two worked together to prevent Starr from giving the baby away. Spencer was deemed unfit to stand trial and was to be sent to Wingdale. Todd abducted Spencer and tortured him for information on the whereabouts of his missing son with Margaret. In a freak accident, Todd, Spencer, and Blair ended up on the roof of a warehouse from which Blair and Spencer fell. Both survived, and Blair revealed to Todd that she was pregnant with his child. Blair soon miscarried, and was diagnosed with a heart disease, but survived. Spencer killed his attorney, Marc Casey, and nearly raped Blair, until an unknown assailant stabbed him repeatedly from behind. Michael, Rex, David, and Marty were each arrested for the murder but Lindsay turned out to be the true culprit. Her motive was to silence Spencer, in order to keep the truth from Marcie that Tommy (her adoptive son with Michael) was really Todd's son. Rex (who knew the truth about Tommy) gave Todd a phony death certificate, but Todd soon got a lead on his son, which took him to Chicago. Todd was stabbed and went missing, later turning up in the apartment of Hunter Atwood, the boyfriend of Sarah Roberts. Todd was soon free, and Hunter was accidentally stabbed by Cristian Vega. Miles Laurence gave Todd proof that Tommy was his son, and Todd interrupted Lindsay's murder trial to reveal the truth. Todd soon won custody, but Marcie kidnapped Tommy and went on the run. Marcie was eventually apprehended, and Tommy was given back to Todd, who renamed him Sam. John blackmailed Todd into dropping the charges against Marcie and posting her bail. Miles Laurence, brother to Mitch, arrived in town as Spencer's heir. Miles had spent his entire life in an institution because his family wanted nothing to do with him due to the disfigurement caused by tumors on his face. Spencer replaced Miles's face, thereby making Miles eternally indebted to Spencer. Socially-inexperienced Miles fell in unrequited love with Marty. Suffering from panic attacks, Marty remembered killing Spencer, and admitted so to her psychiatrist. Miles got his hand on the tape used to record Marty's session and used this to blackmail Marty into marrying him. Marty had no choice but to give in, and she married him. Learning that Miles was holding a missing Todd captive and blackmailing Cole, Marty turned Miles in. Miles was later released on bail, and was befriended by Natalie. Miles was devastated to learn that Marty died in an explosion as the result of a showdown with Irish terrorists. Lindsay faked a nervous breakdown and was institutionalized. Nora suspected that Lindsay faked her condition but never gained proof. Lindsay was released into the custody of Bo, and the two began to fall in love once more. Lindsay received a letter from R.J. that soon got mixed up in Nora's paperwork.

After the death of Asa Buchanan, Dorian learned that Langston Wilde was an orphan living on her own since her parents' death over a year earlier. Dorian became Langston's foster mother, which caused Dorian to miss out on the reading of Asa's will. However, Dorian made it to Texas with the newly married David Vickers and Alex Olanov. Dorian caught Clint and Nora in a liplock and slept with David. Clint walked in on them and broke things off with Dorian. Breaking up with Evangeline for kissing Todd, Cristian began to suspect that Jessica and Nash were fooling around behind Antonio's back. Jess convinced Cris that this wasn't the case. Antonio asked Jess to adopt Jamie and become her mother, but Jess ran out of the courtroom during the adoption hearing. She ended up in the arms of Nash, and they made love for the first time. However, Jessica collapsed in Antonio's arms as she was about to tell the truth. But before the truth could come out, Jess was diagnosed with Hepatitis C and liver cancer as a result of Tess sharing heroin needles. The truth came out, and Antonio left Jess and the country, only to then be revealed as a match for a liver transplant. The transplant was successful, but after their divorce hearing, Jess was back in the hospital, where her body rejected Antonio's liver. David was also found as a match, and just before surgery, Nash married Jessica. The transplant was successful, but David wanted $10,000,000 before he agreed to the transplant. Viki learned the truth, and in an attempt to regain their friendship, David gave the money back to Clint, and Viki forgave David. 2007 Viki Davidson wound up on an adventure of her own when she left Llanview for Paris, Texas, in 2007. She began working at a diner as a waitress and fell in love with Charlie Banks, Jared's father. Viki then realized that Charlie was an alcoholic. He turned back to the bottle after failing to reconnect with his son. Viki helped him recover and then she was stunned to see that Marcie Walsh was in Texas and on the run with Tommy/Sam, Todd Manning's son. 2008 Marcie was running out of options and took Viki hostage as 2008 rolled in. Viki and Sam were rescued and Marcie was finally captured. Viki returned home, Charlie soon followed, and they reunited. However, they were not happy for long, as Charlie lied that he was Rex's father, and then Dorian Lord set it up to make it look as if Charlie was drinking again, resulting in the breakup of Viki and Charlie. In July 2008, Viki and Dorian were in a horrible car accident where Viki dies as a result of the crash. Dorian briefly thinks about not saving Viki. However, Dorian ultimately comes to her archenemy's aid, and with a shot of adrenaline straight to Viki's heart, Dorian, with David and Mel's spirit by her side, is able to revive Viki. After re-examining her life Viki and Charlie reunite in December 2008, after Charlie rebuilt Carlotta's diner to resemble the same Paris Texas diner where they fell in love. After being cleared of Spencer's murder and annulling her marriage to Miles, Marty began a relationship with John. But, during the search for Marcie, Marty was abducted by an Irish terrorist and was reunited with Cole in Ireland. John and Ramsey arrived on the scene, forcing terrorist Simon to take Marty and Cole in a van. Ramsey shot the van's tires, causing the van to go over a cliff. Cole was thrown from the vehicle and survived. Marty did not. However, Ramsey was nursing a mystery woman back to health. This woman turned out to be Marty. After Ramsey's murder, Todd discovered an amnesiac Marty and began taking care of her, failing to share their history. This sparked a very controversial plot where Marty fell in love with Todd and they eventually had sex. John discovered that Todd had Marty captive and raced to rescue her. Marty then felt cornered as John and Todd began to argue that she held them both at gunpoint and then learned everything that Todd did to her and she shot him! These events sent Marty on a months long wild streak until she eventually began to regain her memory and reunited with her son Cole. Tina Lord, princess of Mendorra, returned to Llanview looking for the crown jewels of Mendorra, which had been stolen by Ramsey. After Ramsey was murdered, Tina took the jewels, only to be held at gun point by American ambassador to Mendorra Jonas Chamberlain. As Cristian and Sarah hid Tina, Jonas came upon Talia, whom he forced to trick Sarah into a trap. Jonas kidnapped Talia and Sarah to Mendorra, where Carlo Hesser revealed himself as Talia's father. Antonio was beyond not pleased to learn of this truth, while Sarah was reunited with Tina and Cristian only to be sent over the Hohenstein Falls by Carlo's army in order to haunt Tina for killing his son Johnny Dee Hesser in 1990. Carlo's plan was designed to be cruelly reminiscent of Tina's having gone over Argentina's Iguazu Falls in the '80s. Tina's prince turned out to be none other than Cain Rogan. Then Carlo planned to have Cain and Tina executed in front of the people of Mendorra, until Christian rescued them. Sarah was then revealed to be alive. Chris and Sarah reunite, but Antonio must say goodbye to Talia, as she is held prisoner until they return and rescue her. Dorian was very angry with the Buchanans when she discovered that Jared Banks (John Brotherton) was posing as Asa's long-lost son and having an affair with his supposed niece, Natalie Buchanan (Melissa Archer). She exposed the truth at a Buchanan Enterprises shareholders' meeting, then announced that she had taken over the company. These events spiraled out of control, as Jared and Nash Brennan got into a fistfight that resulted in Nash falling through a skylight to his death, leaving daughter Bree, wife Jessica, and his unborn baby behind. This sent Jessica turning back to her alter, Tess, who planned to murder Natalie and Jared because she blamed them for Nash's death. Tess sent Viki packing to Africa, had the secret room rebuilt, and then held Natalie hostage down there. Tess continued pretending to be Jess, but Tina Lord (who had moved into Llanfair) realized that Jess was Tess. Tess blackmailed Tina into keeping her mouth shut. Jared eventually realized the truth, only to wind up trapped with Natalie for a short while before Viki returned home. Running out of options and going into labor, Tess left Nat and Jared locked up with a bomb set to go off. Tess ran off and gave birth to a stillborn baby while confronting the illusion of her mother Viki's alter, Niki Smith. Jess then secretly gained a third alter, Bess, who switched her dead baby with the living baby of Starr Manning and Cole Thornhart, who was born on the same night.

Kim later found Stacy in the trapped rental home basement with Gigi where she rescued Stacy, and put her into the hospital in Kentucky. Kim also reunited with her estranged older brother Cutter, which led to the discovery that Kim was the real Aubrey Wentworth and got plastic surgery to improve her looks. Cutter later betrayed her sister by framing her for his murderous crime that he committed at The Spotted Pony (which was the secret that Rama had on Cutter!) so that he could use Stacy to pose as Gigi for leverage to scam the Buchanans for their fortune again after Aubrey dumped him for the second time for lying about hiding Rex's gun that was a piece of evidence against Rex for Victor Jr.'s murder case (despite Cutter trying to reform himself by getting a legit job as the front desk clerk at The Minute Man Motel). Cutter then told Rex to hand over the entire fortune to him in exchange for getting his wife back when he tried to show him a picture of Gigi on his cell phone. Rex didn't believe him, and got into a fight with him! After Stacy woke up from her coma, she reluctantly agreed to take part in Cutter's scam after she found out that she remembered that she was Stacy, but later changed her mind and wanted to reverse her plastic surgery to look like her old self again. Cutter agreed to her decision and accompanied her to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil to get her surgery from Dr. Fascinella, the same plastic surgeon that did her original surgery. Cutter then reunited with her long-lost mother Alex Olanov, who abandoned her family when she took off with a piece of her wealthy husband William J. \\"Billy Joe\\" Wentworth's fortune which led to him to commit suicide when Cutter and Kim where kids, which caused them to both wind up in the foster care system. Alex tried to make up for abandoning Cutter and Kim by helping him and Stacy evade Rex and Aubrey when they were hot on their trail to expose his scam by posing as Stacy after her \\"surgery\\". After Alex helped Cutter and Stacy, Cutter then developed romantic feelings for Stacy, and planted a kiss on her! Rex and Aubrey also developed feelings for each other as well and they kissed each other while they were in Rio.

Cutter then took Stacy to meet Dr. Fascinella, where he then told him that Stacy was really Gigi, and that Stacy was the one who really died in that basement from the toxic fumes! Cutter then lied to Gigi saying that she couldn't get the surgery because of the toxic fumes she was exposed to as \\"Stacy\\", and he also let Gigi believe that she was still her sister Stacy since Gigi couldn't remember anything about her life. Cutter and Gigi then left Rio to move to Paris, Texas, where Gigi and her son Shane used to live at before they moved to Llanview a few years ago. Cutter and \\"Stacy\\" got jobs at The Bon Jour Cafe, where Gigi once worked as a waitress. Rex then went back to Paris, TX with Shane to attend a \\"pie-off\\" contest where Gigi's old co-worker Noelle Stubbs entered a pie named in Gigi's honor. Gigi then spotted Rex at the diner, and Cutter helped her hide from him before he could spot her working at the diner. Rex then found \\"Stacy\\" and confronted her for getting plastic surgery to look like Gigi. Cutter then showed up at the diner and told Rex that \\"Stacy\\" was really Gigi, but Rex didn't believe him and had him finally arrested for his old crime at The Spotted Pony, thanks to a tip from his sister Kim, who was exonerated from prison in exchange for telling Rex the truth and whereabouts of \\"Stacy\\". Professor Delfina Jr., whose father helped Rex and Gigi return to the present day from 1968 when they both time travelled to the past, helped convince Rex that \\"Stacy\\" was really Gigi by showing him the events that led to Stacy's death thanks to the professor's time travelling TV device!

Rex also broke the news about Gigi to Aubrey, and they broke up with each other before Aubrey left town heartbroken about the end of their potential relationship. After Kim tried unsuccessfully to get back together with Clint after he admitted to her that he was back in love with his ex-wife Viki, Kim got a call from Cutter in prison to get help from her to break him out of prison.

Ford awakens in hell and despite his changed ways and pleas to live, he dies of his injuries. Viki is greeted by her daughter Megan and Clint is greeted by Stacy Morasco whose heart he now has. While Stacy condemns Clint to hell, and Megan encourages her mother to rest and cross over into heaven, Clint escapes Stacy's clutches and races to find Viki where he declares his undying love. The two choose to give life another chance and are revived by paramedics. In the finale, Allison Perkins is reading a script she wrote about the people of Llanview. Over the course of the episode, it becomes clear that she is reading the script to another person, who does not respond to Allison (it is implied that the person is probably being held captive by Allison). A new DNA test proves Jessica is biologically Clint's daughter. Rex, Gigi, and Shane move to London. Natalie and John resume their romance. Starr and Hope go to California (for Starr to pursue her music career) where they re-connect with Markko and Langston. Blair and Todd continue to grow closer since New Year's Eve, now bonding over missing Starr. They agree to trust one another, and they make love for the first time in years. Langston and Markko are grieving over Cole's reported death; Starr reveals to them that Cole survived and that Todd (because Cole had taken a bullet for Starr) helped Cole reunite with Marty and Patrick (who is revealed to be alive and living in hiding somewhere). An associate of Todd's shows up at the L.A. apartment to introduce Starr to her new bodyguard: it turns out to be Cole. Cole and Starr reunite. Jessica is visited by Brody and he apologizes for his actions and reveals he is reenlisting with the SEALS. It is hinted that the pair will eventually reconcile as a spark of their old love surfaces. Destiny gives birth to her and Matthew's son at home, with her parents, Bo, and Nora in attendance. Mathew realizes he wants to be with her and their child, so he arrives to talk with her only to find that she is in labor. He reconciles with Destiny moments before the birth. They name the baby Drew, after Bo's dead son and Mathew's brother. New grandparents Bo and Nora declare their love for each other one more time in a touching scene. In the final moments: After sorting through their emotions, Clint again declares how Viki has always been the one. He drops to his knee and asks her to marry him for a third time. While Tea and Tomas Delgado wait at John McBain's apartment, John bursts into Blair's bedroom with Llanview Police backup, interrupting Todd and Blair lying blissfully in bed. John announces to Todd that he's under arrest for the murder of Victor Lord, Jr. In the final scene, it is revealed that the person to whom Allison Perkins is reading her script titled \\"One Life To Live\\" is none other than Victor Lord Jr. who is alive and tied up to a bed in her hotel room. 2013 One Life to Live returned as Prospect Park's online revival of the hit soap series on April 29, 2013. Brand new exciting stories were crafted for Llanview including Victor Lord Jr's. return, and a mysterious tattoo organization cult that involved Jeffrey King (Corbin Bleu), a freelance reporter and internet blogger for The Banner, and Allison Perkins' wealthy businessman brother Carl Peterson (Ron Raines) that was after both Victor Jr., Todd, and their families. Other storylines included Danielle's shocking turn to drugs, Dorian's political scandal, and Natalie moving on from John McBain with her new boyfriend, former con artist turned nightclub manager and club promoter of Llanview's new nightclub Shelter Cutter, and the reunion of Todd and Blair.

It is located southwest of Burnaby Mountain. Squint Lake is surrounded by Burnaby Mountain Golf Course. Squint Lake Park is a park to the north of the lake. Eagle Creek flows into Squint Lake from the north and continues south eventually flowing into Burnaby Lake. There are two tiny ponds on either side of Squint Lake. Prehistoric fossils have been found in the surrounding mud. At the south end of the lake, there is an underground chute, approximately 4 feet in diameter, that has still never been traced. According to a map and materials by Heritage Advisory Committee and Environment and Waste Management Committee of the City of Burnaby (1993), Eagle Creek is fed by a large watershed which drains the slopes of Burnaby Mountain and at one time included a large marsh and beaver pond located in the old Lochdale district. In 1910 when the Vancouver real-estate firm of Ross and Shaw tried to sell their new subdivision on the mountain they printed ads in the Vancouver Daily Province which announced: \\"Adjoining this desirable property is the beautiful Quinte Lake, where it is proposed to erect a tourist hotel.\\" Apparently local residents thought the name was hilarious and much too grandiose a description for a beaver pond. Instead, Lochdale residents joked that \\"...you had to squint to see it\\" and the name Squint Lake stuck. http://burnabytoday.com/burnabysquintlakepark.html Residents enjoyed swimming in the pond and in the winter people came from miles around to skate. Unfortunately later developments drained the swamp and the pond slowly disappeared from the landscape. Its memory is commemorated in Squint Lake Park.

His resignation in 1958, along with that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer Peter Thorneycroft and fellow Treasury Minister Enoch Powell, was described by Harold Macmillan as \\"little local difficulties\\". He exacted his revenge when, in the wake of the Profumo scandal, he attacked the Macmillan government and quoted in his memorable speech the devastating words of Robert Browning on William Wordsworth: \\"Never glad confident morning again\\". His speech showed Macmillan as weak and out of touch, and it sealed Birch's reputation of being as deadly as Leo Amery. In 1950 he married Esmé Glyn, the daughter of the 4th Baron Wolverton.

In discrete geometry, a k-set of a finite point set S in the Euclidean plane is a subset of k elements of S that can be strictly separated from the remaining points by a line. More generally, in Euclidean space of higher dimensions, a k-set of a finite point set is a subset of k elements that can be separated from the remaining points by a hyperplane. In particular, when k = n/2 (where n is the size of S), the line or hyperplane that separates a k-set from the rest of S is a halving line or halving plane. K-sets are related by projective duality to k-levels in line arrangements; the k-level in an arrangement of n lines in the plane is the curve consisting of the points that lie on one of the lines and have exactly k lines below them. Discrete and computational geometers have also studied levels in arrangements of more general kinds of curves and surfaces.Agarwal et al. (1997); Chan (2003; 2005a,b).  Combinatorial bounds  It is of importance in the analysis of geometric algorithms to bound the number of k-sets of a planar point set,Chazelle and Preparata (1986); Cole et al. (1987); Edelsbrunner and Welzl (1986). or equivalently the number of k-levels of a planar line arrangement, a problem first studied by Lovász (1971) and Erdős et al. (1973). The best known upper bound for this problem is O(nk1/3), as was shown by Tamal Dey (1998) using the crossing number inequality of Ajtai, Chvátal, Newborn, and Szemerédi. However, the best known lower bound is far from Dey's upper bound: it is Ω(n exp(c (logk)1/2)) for some constant c, as shown by Toth (2001). In three dimensions, the best upper bound known is O(nk3/2), and the best lower bound known is Ω(nk exp(c (logk)1/2)).Sharir et al. (2001). For points in three dimensions that are in convex position, that is, are the vertices of some convex polytope, the number of k-sets is Θ((n-k)k), which follows from arguments used for bounding the complexity of k-th order Voronoi diagrams.Lee (1982); Clarkson and Shor (1989). For the case when k = n/2 (halving lines), the maximum number of combinatorially distinct lines through two points of S that bisect the remaining points when k = 1, 2, ... is :1,3,6,9,13,18,22... . Bounds have also been proven on the number of ≤k-sets, where a ≤k-set is a j-set for some j ≤ k. In two dimensions, the maximum number of ≤k-sets is exactly nk,Alon and Győri (1986). while in d dimensions the bound is O(n^{\\\\lfloor d/2\\\\rfloor}k^{\\\\lceil d/2\\\\rceil}).Clarkson and Shor (1989).  Construction algorithms  Edelsbrunner and Welzl (1986) first studied the problem of constructing all k-sets of an input point set, or dually of constructing the k-level of an arrangement. The k-level version of their algorithm can be viewed as a plane sweep algorithm that constructs the level in left-to-right order. Viewed in terms of k-sets of point sets, their algorithm maintains a dynamic convex hull for the points on each side of a separating line, repeatedly finds a bitangent of these two hulls, and moves each of the two points of tangency to the opposite hull. Chan (1999) surveys subsequent results on this problem, and shows that it can be solved in time proportional to Dey's O(nk1/3) bound on the complexity of the k-level. Agarwal and Matoušek describe algorithms for efficiently constructing an approximate level; that is, a curve that passes between the (k - d)-level and the (k + d)-level for some small approximation parameter d. They show that such an approximation can be found, consisting of a number of line segments that depends only on n/d and not on n or k.Agarwal (1990); Matoušek (1990,1991).  Matroid generalizations  The planar k-level problem can be generalized to one of parametric optimization in a matroid: one is given a matroid in which each element is weighted by a linear function of a parameter λ, and must find the minimum weight basis of the matroid for each possible value of λ. If one graphs the weight functions as lines in a plane, the k-level of the arrangement of these lines graphs as a function of λ the weight of the largest element in an optimal basis in a uniform matroid, and Dey showed that his O(nk1/3) bound on the complexity of the k-level could be generalized to count the number of distinct optimal bases of any matroid with n elements and rank k. For instance, the same O(nk1/3) upper bound holds for counting the number of different minimum spanning trees formed in a graph with n edges and k vertices, when the edges have weights that vary linearly with a parameter λ. This parametric minimum spanning tree problem has been studied by various authors and can be used to solve other bicriterion spanning tree optimization problems.Gusfield (1980); Ishii et al. (1981); Katoh and Ibaraki (1983); Hassin and Tamir (1989); Fernández-Baca et al. (1996); Chan (2005c). However, the best known lower bound for the parametric minimum spanning tree problem is Ω(n α(k)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function, an even weaker bound than that for the k-set problem. For more general matroids, Dey's O(nk1/3) upper bound has a matching lower bound.Eppstein (1998).

There can be multiple indications to use a procedure or medication. An indication can commonly be confused with the term diagnosis. A diagnosis is a particular [medical] condition while an indication is a reason for use. The opposite of an indication is a contraindication, a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment because the risks of treatment clearly outweigh the benefits. In the United States, indications for prescription drugs are approved by the FDA. Indications are included in the Indications and Usage section of the Prescribing Information. The primary role of this section of labeling is to enable health care practitioners to readily identify appropriate therapies for patients by clearly communicating the drug’s approved indication(s). The Indications and Usage section states the disease or condition, or manifestation or symptoms thereof, for which the drug is approved, as well as whether the drug is indicated for the treatment, prevention, mitigation, cure, relief, or diagnosis of that disease or condition. Additionally, the Indications and Usage section should contain the approved age groups as well as other information necessary to describe appropriate use (e.g., identifying the indicated patient/disease subgroups, stating if adjunctive therapy is required). Drugs Most countries and jurisdictions have a licensing body whose duty is to determine whether to approve a drug for a specific indication, based on the relative safety of the drug and its efficacy for the particular use. In the United States, indications for medications are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and are included in the package insert under the phrase \\"Indications and Usage\\". The European Medicines Agency (EMA) holds this responsibility for centrally authorized drugs in the European Union.  Label indications vs. off-label indications  In the United States there are label indications and off-label indications Label indications: Medication that have label indications mean that they were approved by the FDA. This means that they are clinically significant for the indication and manufacturers are allowed to market their drug for the indication. A drug can have more than one FDA labeled indication, this means they can be used for multiple medical conditions. As the evidence and consensus for use of the drug increases and strengthens, its class of indication is improved. Preferred drugs (and other treatments) are also referred to a \\"first line\\" or \\"primary\\" while others are called \\"second line\\", \\"third line\\" etc. A drug may be indicated as an \\"adjunct\\" or \\"adjuvant\\", added to a first line drug. Off-label: Off-label indications are drugs that are used for medical indications that have not been approved by the FDA. Off label indications often have some clinical significance to back the use, but they have not gone through the extensive testing required by the FDA to have an official labeled indication. Drug companies can not provide any official medication information (e.g. package inserts) for off label indications.  FDA approval  The purpose for adding FDA-approved indications in the United States is to ensure that healthcare providers can easily identify appropriate use of drug therapy. Gaining FDA approval is based on the body of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of a drug treatment. The scientific evidence is gathered in the first 3 steps in the drug development process: discovery and development, pre-clinical research (testing safety), and clinical research (testing efficacy). After there is adequate completion of research and development phases by the drug companies, they send a New Drug Application (NDA) or a Biologics License Application (BLA) for approval to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the proposed scientific evidence for use in an intended population is evaluated by a team of physicians, statisticians, chemists, pharmacologists, and other scientists. Essentially, if it is found that there is substantial evidence that benefits of treatment outweigh the risks, the proposed labeling in the Prescribing Information is appropriate, and the manufacturing process is safe and adequate, then the drug is approved to go to market under that now FDA-approved indication. Even after approval, the FDA CDER continues to do postmarking surveillance of the drug through MedWatch and FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).  Effect on drug pricing  Indications can impact the pricing of medications through Value- based Pricing, also known as indication specific pricing or indication value- based pricing.Pearson SD, Dreitlein B, Henshall C. Indication-specific pricing of pharmaceuticals in the United States health care system: a report from the 2015 ICER Membership Policy Summit. Boston: Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, March 2016. Since drugs can be used for different indications, this form of pricing would set different prices for each indication based on the value the drug offers for whatever it is being used to treat. This pricing scheme is often discussed in relation to oncology drugs, which are costly and not always successful in treating patients. Oncology drugs can be used for multiple different types of cancers so by applying indication-specific pricing, the drug would be priced based on how effective it is for treating each type of cancer. If the drug is more effective for Cancer A than Cancer B, then the patient taking the drug to treat Cancer A will pay more than the person using it for Cancer B because they are getting more value out of it. Currently, most medications in the United States are priced the same regardless of what they're being used for or how effective they are at improving outcomes. Companies like CVS and Express Scripts in the US have begun implementing pricing based on indication and in countries like Italy, similar forms of pricing are already being used. For example, Express Scripts' \\"Oncology Care Value Program,\\" uses indication-based pricing for certain oncology medications and was launched in 2016. Italy on the other hand, uses a model similar to indication-based pricing where the amount the hospital pays for certain drugs varies based on what it's used for. Patients can receive reimbursements for treatments based on their response and either be fully or partially refunded. Italy's reimbursement system is run by AIFA, the Italian Medicines Agency, which is the national authority that regulates drugs in Italy.  Incorporating indication of use on prescription drug labeling  There has been some thought on incorporating the indication in prescription drug labeling as an approach to improve patient understanding of the medications they are on. This information can help healthcare providers reduce medication errors related to drugs that may look and sound alike. Knowing the indication of the drug can also help providers determine if the dose of the drug is appropriate per indication, and this can greatly improve patient safety and drug effectiveness. However, there are still some challenges with incorporating the indication of use on prescription drug labels. Revealing the indication of use on prescription drug labels can breach patient confidentiality since the label will disclose private information publicly. Some medications can also be used for multiple diseases and one disease may have multiple medications for its prevention or treatment, therefore adding an indication on prescription labels in these cases may cause some confusion and may not be able to actually fit onto the label. Medical tests Each test has its own indications and contraindications, but in a simplified fashion, how much a test is indicated for an individual depends largely on its net benefit for that individual, which largely depends on the absolute difference between pre- and post-test probability of conditions (such as diseases) that the test is expected to achieve. Additional factors that influence a decision whether a medical test should be performed or not include: cost of the test, time taken for the test or other practical or administrative aspects. The possible benefits of a diagnostic test may also be weighed against the costs of unnecessary tests and resulting unnecessary follow-up and possibly even unnecessary treatment of incidental findings. Also, even if not beneficial for the individual being tested, the results may be useful for the establishment of statistics in order to improve health care for other individuals.

The municipality covers an area of 33.325 km². It is situated about 10 km east of Banská Bystrica, in the Hron river valley. Slovenská Ľupča is part of two administrative units, the Banská Bystrica District and the Banská Bystrica Region. History In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1250. It was founded on an ancient trade route Via Magna connecting Buda to Kraków. The settlement was built around two important political and social centers: a castle and a monastery. A favorite residence of the influential noble Magister Donč, Slovenská Ľupča was elevated to a town by Charles I in 1340. Slovenská Ľupča lost its town charter in the 19th century. The development of the village in the 20th century was connected with the large pharmaceutical factory Biotika built in 1953. Ľupča Castle Ľupča Castle Ľupča Castle () was built in the Middle Ages to protect an important trade route along the Hron river. It was a favorite hunting resort of King Béla IV, who signed the royal town privileges of Banská Bystrica in the castle in 1255. Other monarchs who frequently resided in the castle were King Charles I, King Louis the Great, Emperor Sigismund, and King Matthias Corvinus. The castle hosted an orphanage from 1873 to 1938. Other landmarks Kláštorisko is an open-air museum with ruins of a medieval monastery. We do not know when the monastery was founded, but it certainly existed by 1263. Its great supporter Magister Donč was interred there in the 14th century. The monastery was abandoned in the 17th century. The Holy Trinity The Church of the Most Holy Trinity, three-lane Gothic building with a polygonal ended presbytery and a tower forming part of the mass of the church from the period after 1370. It is situated in a fenced area in the middle of the village. The church underwent a late-Gothic reconstruction in 1470, when the presbytery was newly rebuilt by a vaulted vault. From the Gothic details, windows with stone treads, a cross vault with ornate consoles and studs, and a non-gothic pastorphony were preserved in the church. Another significant adaptation was made in 1575 for Paul Rubigall, who adapted the church to a Renaissance triple. Around the year 1618 the annexation of the Tribell funeral chapel was built on the north side of the church. The church remained for almost two hundred years during the Reformationwikipédia slovak A \\"plague column\\" (Slovak: Morový stĺp) was erected in the 18th century in thanksgiving to the Virgin Mary for ending a deadly outbreak of plague.

Threatened and Endangered Animals and Plants, Species Information. Description Like the other 13 species members of its genus, Eriophyllum latilobum presents generally alternate leaves ranging from entire to nearly compound. The flower heads are grouped in radiate, flat-topped heads, with an hemispheric to nearly conic involucre. Phyllaries are either free, or more or less fused, their receptacle flat, but naked and conic in the center. The ray flowers (the \\"petals\\") have yellow ligules entire to lobed. Fruits are 4-angled cylindric achenes in the outer flowers, but are generally club-shaped for the inner flowers; the pappus is somewhat jagged.Mooring, Madroño 38:213–226, (1991) Eriophyllum latilobum occurs as a subshrub between 20 and 50 centimeters in height. Its thin leaves are two to six centimeters in length, and have a diamond to obovate shape; the deeply triangular-lobed leaves are smooth on the top surface. The inflorescence's peduncles are one to eight centimeters and the involucres measure four to seven millimeters. The acute, barely overlapping phyllaries number six to ten. The ray flowers number 6-13. The rays surround 40-70 disc flowers, each three to four millimeters in diameter. The strigose (hairy) fruit measures 3-4 millimeters (0.12-0.16 inches), and its pappus can vary between 0.3 and 1.0 millimeters (0.012-0.40 inches). Disc scales are larger than the ray scales. Chromosomes are characterized as: 2n=32.Jepson Manual, University of California Press (1993) Distribution and habitat Eriophyllum latilobum has been found in San Mateo County, San Benito County, and Napa County in habitats of oak woodland, but at altitudes only between 100 and 150 meters. Eriophyllum latilobum grows to 90 centimeters in height on erect woolly stems and produces bright yellow flowers.Eriophyllum latilobum Rydberg in N. L.

The character appears in Tevis' novel The Hustler (1959). Jackie Gleason portrayed the character in the 1961 film adaptation of The Hustler, a performance that received several awards and nominations. The character was an original creation of Tevis, though a real pool hustler, Rudolf Wanderone, who began calling himself \\"Minnesota Fats\\" in 1961, claimed to be the inspiration. Tevis denied Wanderone's claim, though Wanderone capitalized on it for years. Rudolf Wanderone as \\"Minnesota Fats\\" Real-life pool hustler and entertainer Rudolf Wanderone was known as \\"New York Fats\\" (among other nicknames) when the book was published. Realizing there was money to be made from being associated with the success of the book and subsequent film, he changed his nickname to match the fiction and later went on to play himself as the character \\"Minnesota Fats\\" in the film The Player (1971). Tevis consistently denied that Wanderone had anything to do with the author's character, writing in a subsequent printing of The Hustler: \\"I made up Minnesota Fats—name and all—as surely as Disney made up Donald Duck\\". Wanderone's association with the name started in 1961. That year, while at a drive-in movie theater owned by a friend of Wanderone's (George Jansco), in Johnston City, Illinois, showing The Hustler, Wanderone boasted that the author had based the character upon himself, which was picked up by local news and soon by the U.S. national press. Willie Mosconi – famed as the 15-time winner of the World Straight Pool Championship and the technical adviser for the filming of The Hustler – disputed the claim, which had the paradoxical effect of giving it more notoriety. Wanderone capitalized on this, threatening to sue Tevis and 20th Century Fox. Tevis responded by denying he had ever met Wanderone. Meanwhile, the press covered it all, and the association became fixed. Wanderone's second wife later claimed that a financial settlement had been made by Tevis to avoid a lawsuit, which Wanderone's first wife denied. Film Jackie Gleason played Minnesota Fats in the 1961 adaptation of The Hustler. His performance earned Best Supporting Actor nominations for the Academy Award and the Golden Globe, and the Best Supporting Actor award by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. The Minnesota Fats character did not appear in the 1986 film version of The Color of Money, which had an entirely different storyline from the novel.

Biography Wilentz's father, David T. Wilentz, was Attorney General of New Jersey in 1935, when he prosecuted Bruno Hauptmann for the kidnap and murder of the son of Charles Lindbergh, the aviator. The elder Wilentz also founded the New Jersey law firm of Wilentz, Goldman and Spitzer. Robert Wilentz was raised in Perth Amboy, New Jersey and was the valedictorian of his graduating class at Perth Amboy High School.Stout, David. \\"Robert Wilentz, 69, New Jersey Chief Justice, Dies; Court Aided Women and the Poor\\", The New York Times, July 24, 1996.

Robert Wilentz was born on Feb. 17, 1927, the son of David T. and Lena Wilentz. He spent his boyhood in Perth Amboy.\\" He graduated from Harvard University and received his law degree from Columbia Law School. He married Jacqueline Malino (1928 – March 29, 1989) in 1949 and they had three children, James Robert, Amy and Thomas.\\"'Restless Seeker for Justice': Robert Nathan Wilentz\\". The New York Times, January 22, 1983. Accessed March 21, 2008. He was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1965 and 1967, but chose not to seek a third term. He also practiced law with the firm founded by his father. Wilentz was appointed Chief Justice by Democratic Governor Brendan Byrne in 1979. He was reappointed in 1986 by Republican Governor Thomas Kean, but there was a confirmation battle in the New Jersey Senate. After a contentious debate that involved charges of judicial activism on the part of Wilentz and his court, the chief justice was confirmed by a vote of 21 to 19. Wilentz retired July 1, 1996, stating that he could no longer carry out his duties due to advanced cancer. He died several weeks later, on July 23, 1996. He would have reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 in February 1997. Notable opinions One of Robert Wilentz's most famous opinions was in the matter of Baby M, which invalidated a surrogate motherhood contract. Another of the notable judgements by Wilentz\\"New Jersey's Chief Justices 1948--: Selected References\\" was in State v. Kelly, 91 N.J. 178 (1984), a Supreme Court of New Jersey case where the defendant, Gladys Kelly, was on trial for the murder of her husband, Ernest Kelly with a pair of scissors. The Supreme Court remanded the case for further trial after finding that expert testimony regarding the defence's submission, that Kelly suffered from battered woman syndrome, was incorrectly excluded since battered woman syndrome was a proper subject for expert evidence.Full text here \\"STATE of New Jersey, Plaintiff-Respondent v.

The earlier Mount Laurel decision (1975) established a basic principle: that municipalities had to provide low- and moderate-income housing for residents. But finding that towns had done little or nothing since the earlier decision to carry out the intent of the court’s will, Chief Justice Wilentz wrote Mount Laurel II. This landmark decision instructed the lower courts to come up with firm, quantifiable targets for every municipality in the state. Mount Laurel II also declared that if a town or village did not have a realistic, implementable plan to meet its fair share, the courts could override local governments and grant approvals or what it called a \\"builder’s remedy\\" or incentive to those developers who proposed to incorporate a \\"substantial number\\" of affordable housing units into their projects. In a historic, and memorable, footnote, the court suggested that 20 percent affordable housing was a \\"reasonable minimum\\" for a municipality.The Betrayal of Mount Laurel References Category:1927 births Category:1996 deaths Category:American people of Latvian-Jewish descent Category:Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of New Jersey Category:Perth Amboy High School alumni Category:Politicians from Perth Amboy, New Jersey Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Columbia Law School alumni Category:20th-century American judges Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Robert Wilentz"},{"id":"8075228","text":"Julio A.

GLD&D; operates primarily in the United States but conducts one-quarter of its business overseas. It is currently based in Oak Brook, Illinois. History US Vice President Joe Biden aboard Dredge 54 on the Delaware River in Philadelphia, 2014 The company was founded in 1890 as the partnership of William A. Lydon & Fred C. Drews and was named Lydon & Drews dredging company. Early projects included the shoreline structures for the Chicago's Columbian Exposition. The company soon had satellite operations throughout the Great Lakes. It was renamed the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company (GLD&D;) in 1905. Between 1900 and 1950, GLD&D; undertook major projects such as the Sabin Lock, straightening of the Chicago River west of the Chicago Loop, the Michigan Avenue Bridge, foundation landfill and reclamation of the area where the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum, Soldier Field, Meigs Field and Field Museum of Natural History stand today in Chicago and harbor work for the Naval Station Great Lakes. During the Second World War, GLD&D; constructed the MacArthur Lock. After the Second World War, GLD&D; participated in extensive oil-related dredging in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1979, Great Lakes International Inc. (GLI) was included as a holding company for GLD&D.; From 1985 to 1998, GLI was acquired by several companies to include ITEL Corporation, Blackstone Dredging Partners and Vectura Holding Company (Citigroup) until being purchased by Madison Dearborn Partners in 2003 for $340 million.http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20090812/NEWS01/200035112/madison- dearborn-cashing-out-of-great-lakes-dredge It was spun off a publicly traded company on NASDAQ in 2006 after the Madison's special-purpose acquisition company Aldabra Acquisition Corp merged with it. Aldabra in turn changed its name to Great Lakes Dredge and Dock. Madison sold the last of its shares in 2009. 1992 Chicago flood In 1992, a barge operated by GLD&D; was driving new pilings for the Kinzie Street Bridge in Chicago when it accidentally punched into an unused service tunnel passing beneath the river at that point. The tunnel flooded, in turn flooding the basements of many buildings in downtown Chicago; the event is commonly known as the Chicago Flood. Work on the bridge was actually completed the prior year October, 1991. In February 1992 local cable company technicians discovered the breach and reported it to city officials. GLD&D; was never made aware of the breach until April 1992 after severe leakage into the tunnel system had begun. The work performed on the Kinzie Street Bridge conformed to specifications and did pass City inspection upon completion in 1991. In the lawsuits that followed Great Lakes was initially found liable but was later cleared after it was revealed that the city was aware the tunnel was leaking before the flood and the city had also not properly maintained the tunnel.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/great-lakes-dredge- dock-company- history/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-01-21/business/0701210120_1_underground- flood-dredging-chicago-river In addition the case went the United States Supreme Court in which ruled that since the work was being done by a vessel in navigable waters of the Chicago River, Admiralty law applied and Great Lakes liability was greatly limited.https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/513/527/case.html 2008 Liberian freighter collision  In January 2008, a 117 ft.

Operations Great Lakes Dredge and Dock conducts most of its operations within the United States and 25% of its operations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. GLD&D; dredging operations consist of deepening and maintaining waterways, shipping channels, and ports; creating and maintaining (re-nourishing) beaches; excavating new harbors; reclaiming land in the water or improving low-lying land areas; restoring aquatic and wetland habitats and excavating pipeline, cable and tunnel trenches. In 1990, GLD&D; renewed its overseas efforts and created a foreign division. By 1993, GLD&D; was awarded significant projects in the Middle East. Soon projects in Europe, Africa, Mexico and South America would begin as well. GLD&D; also provided excavation and reclamation for the Oresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden. In 2003, GLD&D; performed dredging of the Umm Qasr Port in Iraq. GLD&D; also constructed a port in Hidd, Bahrain around the same time.

She is considered a precursor of feminism in Poland.  Life  Żmichowska became governess for the noble House of Zamoyski in 1838. She went with her employer to Paris, where she reunited with her brother Erazm, Polish revolutionary, exiled from the Russian Partition after the anti-Tsarist November Uprising crushed by the imperial army. Her brother's political and social views greatly influenced Narcyza. On his advice, she enrolled at the Bibliothèque Nationale, and became one of the first women at the French Academy ever. Narcyza Żmichowska by Władysław Radzikowski, bust at the Historical Museum of Kraków, 1880s Her stay in France completely changed Żmichowska. She began to publicly express her radicalized views about women; dubbed by her bourgeois surroundings as \\"an excentric\\". She smoked cigars, which was prohibited to women. Her perfect knowledge of French enabled Narcyza to find new employment easily upon her return to occupied Poland. She became governess to four children of Stanisław Kisielecki at an estate near Łomża. She travelled to Warsaw frequently, where she met with other intellectuals. She debuted in the literary magazine Pierwiosnek (Primrose), and wrote regularly for other Polish magazines under the Russian censorship including Pielgrzym (edited by Eleonora Ziemięcka) and Przegląd Naukowy, where other women published as well. Żmichowska founded a group of Suffragettes in Warsaw active in 1842–1849, who also took part in anti-Tsarist activities. She was arrested by the Russians in Lublin and sentenced to three years in prison in 1849 for her membership in the delegalized Związek Narodu Polskiego (pl). Żmichowska's first novel published in 1846 was Poganka (The Heathen), in which she is known to have expressed interest in her friend Paulina Zbyszewska. The book was published by Northern Illinois University Press in 2012 in English translation by Dr Ursula Phillips. Letters to friends and family written by Żmichowska were published in five volumes by Wrocław University in 1960. There, she also expressed interest in a married man, Edward Dembowski, which led to a known scandal. Her correspondence with Bibianna Moraczewska (an unmarried woman by choice like Narcyza) spanning 32 years consisted mostly of intellectual discourses.

The Lifshitz-Khalatnikov parameter is u=2 (1/u=0.5) and the r coordinate is 2pα(1/u)τ where τ is logarithmic time: τ = ln t.The expression for r is derived by logarithming the power coefficients in the metric: ln [t2pα(1/u)] = 2pα(1/u) ln t. Shrinking along the axes is linear and uniform (no chaoticity). The Kasner metric (developed by and named for the American mathematician Edward Kasner in 1921)Kasner, E. \\"Geometrical theorems on Einstein’s cosmological equations.\\" Am. J. Math. 43, 217–221 (1921). is an exact solution to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. It describes an anisotropic universe without matter (i.e., it is a vacuum solution). It can be written in any spacetime dimension D>3 and has strong connections with the study of gravitational chaos.  Metric and conditions  The metric in D>3 spacetime dimensions is :\\\\text{d}s^2 = -\\\\text{d}t^2 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{D-1} t^{2p_j} [\\\\text{d}x^j]^2, and contains D-1 constants p_j, called the Kasner exponents. The metric describes a spacetime whose equal-time slices are spatially flat, however space is expanding or contracting at different rates in different directions, depending on the values of the p_j. Test particles in this metric whose comoving coordinate differs by \\\\Delta x^j are separated by a physical distance t^{p_j}\\\\Delta x^j. The Kasner metric is an exact solution to Einstein's equations in vacuum when the Kasner exponents satisfy the following Kasner conditions, :\\\\sum_{j=1}^{D-1} p_j = 1, :\\\\sum_{j=1}^{D-1} p_j^2 = 1. The first condition defines a plane, the Kasner plane, and the second describes a sphere, the Kasner sphere. The solutions (choices of p_j) satisfying the two conditions therefore lie on the sphere where the two intersect (sometimes confusingly also called the Kasner sphere). In D spacetime dimensions, the space of solutions therefore lie on a D-3 dimensional sphere S^{D-3}.  Features  There are several noticeable and unusual features of the Kasner solution: *The volume of the spatial slices is always O(t). This is because their volume is proportional to \\\\sqrt{-g}, and ::\\\\sqrt{-g} = t^{p_1 + p_2 + \\\\cdots + p_{D-1}} = t :where we have used the first Kasner condition. Therefore t\\\\to 0 can describe either a Big Bang or a Big Crunch, depending on the sense of t *Isotropic expansion or contraction of space is not allowed. If the spatial slices were expanding isotropically, then all of the Kasner exponents must be equal, and therefore p_j = 1/(D-1) to satisfy the first Kasner condition. But then the second Kasner condition cannot be satisfied, for ::\\\\sum_{j=1}^{D-1} p_j^2 = \\\\frac{1}{D-1} e 1. :The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric employed in cosmology, by contrast, is able to expand or contract isotropically because of the presence of matter. *With a little more work, one can show that at least one Kasner exponent is always negative (unless we are at one of the solutions with a single p_j=1, and the rest vanishing). Suppose we take the time coordinate t to increase from zero. Then this implies that while the volume of space is increasing like t, at least one direction (corresponding to the negative Kasner exponent) is actually contracting. *The Kasner metric is a solution to the vacuum Einstein equations, and so the Ricci tensor always vanishes for any choice of exponents satisfying the Kasner conditions. The full Riemann tensor vanishes only when a single p_j=1 and the rest vanish, in which case the space is flat. The Minkowski metric can be recovered via the coordinate transformation t' = t \\\\cosh x_j and x_j' = t \\\\sinh x_j.

Monsoon rains may begin as early as May in some parts of the Indian subcontinent, and crops are generally harvested from 3rd Week of September to October, again depending upon the region and the crops. Rice, maize and cotton are some of the major kharif crops in India. Etymology The words kharif and rabi both have their origins in the Arabic language. These came to be used in India with the ascent of the Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent and have been widely used ever since. Kharif literally means \\"autumn\\" in Arabic, since this period coincides with the beginning of autumn in the Indian subcontinent; the monsoonal sowing season is called the kharif period. Kharif season The kharif season varies by crop and region, starting at the earliest in May and ending at the latest in January. In India the season is popularly considered to start in June and end in October.Crop Calendar of Major Crops, Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India Kharif crops are usually sown at the beginning of the first rains during the advent of the south-west monsoon season, and they are harvested at the end of monsoon season (October- November). Monsoon sowing dates vary, occurring toward the end of May in the southern state of Kerala and reaching July in some north Indian states. In other regions like Maharashtra, the west coast of India, and Pakistan, which receive rains in June, kharif crops are sown in May, June and July. In Bangladesh, kharif crops are usually sown with the beginning of the first rains in June. These crops are dependent on the quantity of rain water as well its timing. Too much, too little or rain at the wrong time may lay waste to the whole year's efforts. Kharif crops stand in contrast to the rabi crops, which are cultivated during the dry season. Common kharif crops Rice is the most important kharif crop of India. It is grown in rain fed areas with hot and humid climates, especially the eastern and southern parts of India. Rice requires a temperature of during the growing season and during ripening. It needs rainfall from and needs a flooded field during the growth period.

It was the 79th Mickey Mouse short film to be released, and the eighth of that year. Plot The cartoon revolves around three different storylines that all take place on a frozen lake during wintertime. In the first, Mickey helps Minnie learn how to skate. The second storyline has Goofy attempting to catch fish by dropping tobacco into the water and making the fish come up to spit. Donald pulls a prank on Pluto by putting ice skates on his feet and luring him out onto the ice in the third one. The subplots come together when Donald skates around with a kite on his back. The wind kicks up and sends him flying over the waterfall. Mickey hears his cries for help and saves him by pulling on the yarns of his sweater. Donald ends landing right where Goofy is fishing.
