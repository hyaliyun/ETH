Plot A tribe of American Indians is unhappy about the way that the three radio crooners (Bing Crosby, Russ Columbo and Rudy Vall√©e) have influenced their squaws and the cartoon opens with the braves singing the ‚ÄúCrosby, Columbo and Vall√©e‚Äù song. Next a young brave is seen canoeing over various dangers to meet his girl. When he reaches her tipi, he produces a radio and with the help of a spider who provides the necessary connection, the radio gives out with some more of the title song and a snatch of a Crosby-like voice singing ‚ÄúMany Happy Returns of the Day‚Äù. The animals in the forest join in and a moose sings ‚ÄúThis Is My Love Song‚Äù in a Vall√©e impression. The radio is retuned and the title song emerges again and many young Indians join in a dance as do the forest animals. A fire breaks out and three baby birds are trapped at the top of a tree.

Hybrids A. baetica x A. belladonna ‚Äì A. x martiana Font Quer published in Cavallinesia 5: 156 (1932) In areas of Spain where A. baetica and A. belladonna grow together (either naturally as in the province of Ja√©n, or through the agency of humans, as in Cuenca and Madrid) populations of Atropa exist, the members of which are hard to assign to one species or the other, showing as they do features intermediate between the two. A x martiana was described from a plant found growing in the Botanic Garden of the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (now known as the Historic Botanic Garden of Barcelona): a natural/spontaneous hybrid between a plant of A. belladonna grown from seed collected in the Serra de la Mussara in the Province of Tarragona and a plant of A. baetica derived from seed from the Sierra de las Nieves in Malaga. Eminent, Catalan scientist Professor Pius Font i Quer (1888‚Äì1964), who first described the hybrid, was also the founder of the botanic garden in which he noted that the cross had occurred. Although native in the Serrania de Cuenca, Atropa baetica has also been aided in the distribution of its seed there by human activity: in 1936, local gatherers of medicinal plants gathered ripe berries from plants in the area and sowed the seed in various localities in the Serrania in an attempt to replace the plants that they were harvesting and thus ensure the feasibility of future harvests of mature plants. Comparison with Atropa belladonna  Atropa baetica is most easily distinguished from A. belladonna when the plants are in flower and fruit: not only are the open, cup-like, yellow corollas of the former more ornamental than the sombre, purple bells of the latter, but they also offer a more pleasing contrast with the glossy black berries (- if its luscious- looking fruits did not pose such a threat to children, A. baetica might make an attractive garden plant for the herbaceous border). The berries of A. baetica are slightly smaller than those of A. belladonna and contain fewer seeds, although the seeds themselves are larger than those of A. belladonna. When not in flower or fruit, differentiation is less easy, but may be achieved by attention to leaf colour and relative pubescence: A. baetica has yellowish- green foliage and the plant is relatively glabrous, while A. belladonna is a somewhat pubescent plant with dark green foliage. Furthermore, A. baetica is a somewhat smaller plant, rarely exceeding 125 cm in height, while A. belladonna often reaches 150 cm with occasional very robust specimens reaching 200 cm. Habitat Atropa baetica grows among the undergrowth of mixed, upland forest on dry, sunny, rocky or stony slopes (and also, occasionally, in moister, shadier areas near watercourses) in limy (Calcium-rich) soils (often in disturbed, nitrogen-rich locations ‚Äì see Nitrification and Human impact on the nitrogen cycle) at altitudes of 900‚Äì2,000 m. It is not, however, a quick coloniser of recently disturbed areas, preferring instead locations which have been disturbed at some time in the past e.g. the margins of disused or seldom- used paths, bridle paths and trackways (see ridgeway (road) and Drover's road) and also forest clearings, often in rather remote areas. A. baetica is frequently found growing in woodland of which the conifers Pinus nigra subsp. salzmanii var. salzmanii, Abies pinsapo and Juniperus communis form major components. Other frequent companion plants include the hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, the shrubs Buxus sempervirens, Viburnum tinus, Genista scorpius and Daphne laureola ‚Äì and the tussock (grass) Brachypodium phoenicoides. Phenology Atropa baetica has a short growing season (around 5 months), favouring sites subjected to heavy winter precipitation in the form of snowfall and a hot summer/early autumn. The green shoots begin to sprout at ground level in mid-May. Growth (initially very rapid ‚Äì stems reaching their full height in a mere 3‚Äì4 weeks) continues until early August, involving also residual summer growth of small leaf-rosettes (associated with the spread of the clump of rhizomes) which persist near ground level without giving rise to flowering stems. Anthesis (flowering) can occur from as early as the third week in June until mid-August, the greatest number of open flowers being present during the first fortnight of July. Unripe berries may be seen from late June up until the third week of September. Ripe berries are present from the beginning of September to mid-October, nearly all being ripe by the end of September.Senescence is observable between early/mid-September and late October: the first signs of foliar senescence have become noticeable by mid- September and by mid-October practically all plants are reduced to stands of leafless stems, the non -flowering basal rosettes being the last to lose their leaves. The last vestiges of aerial growth disappear shortly after the first rains or heavy falls of snow. Pollinators The three insects observed to visit the flowers of Atropa baetica most regularly are the bumblebees Bombus lucorum L. and Bombus pascuorum Scop. and the European honeybee Apis mellifera ‚Äì all members of the bee family Apidae. Other pollinators include, in bee family Megachilidae: Anthidium septemdentatum Latr., Megachile octosignata Nyl. and Megachile lagopoda L.; in bee family Anthophoridae: Anthophora albigena Lepeletier, and various Ceratina species; in bee family Halictidae: Halictus scabiosae Rossi and Lasioglossum albocinctum Luc.; and the ant species Lasius niger L. In subfamily Formicinae of the Formicidae. Insect consumers Atropa baetica is one of the food plants of the larva of the Noctuid moth Heliothis peltigera Schiff. However, the toxicity of the leaves before the onset of senescence is such that the moth imagoes can display developmental abnormalities resulting from larval consumption of the plant e.g. deformities of the wings. The common name of H. peltigera in German (Bilsenkraut-Bl√ºteneule) translates as 'the henbane-blossom owl (moth)', revealing the species' penchant for another plant in the Hyoscyameae ‚Äì namely Hyoscyamus niger, black henbane ‚Äì the chemistry of which is similar to that of Atropa baetica. Several species of Hemiptera have been observed to feed on the juice of the fruits ‚Äì both ripe and unripe: Spilostethus pandurus Scop. in family Lygaeidae and Carpocoris mediterraneus Tamanini in family Pentatomidae suck the sap of developing fruits in August‚ÄìSeptember, while (more rarely) Corizus hyoscyami L. of the Rhopalidae and Palomena prasina L. of the Pentatomidae have been known to suck the juice of the ripe berries in September‚ÄìOctober. Very occasionally, Camptopus lateralis Germar. of the Alydidae has been seen to feed on the sap of the leaves. The flea beetle Epitrix atropae (family Chrysomelidae, tribe Alticini) received its specific name in reference to its feeding upon Atropa species ‚Äì chewing a multitude of tiny holes in the leaves.. Avian consumers Like many other plants bearing juicy, sugar-rich berries full of small seeds,(including other species of Atropa) A. baetica is dependent on various species of birds as seed-dispersal vectors. Birds transport the berries they have eaten far from the parent plant and the acids and enzymes present in the avian gut serve to break down the seed coat and speed the rate of germination in seeds passed in droppings. The droppings themselves, being rich in Nitrogen, furnish fertiliser to feed the seedlings, once germination has occurred. The extreme similarity of the berries of A. baetica to those of A. belladonna permit the conclusion that the bird species involved in the distribution of the seeds of the two species are almost certainly the same; although (unfortunately) it is rarely possible to observe birds consuming the fruit (of the rarer species) due to the severe damage to A. baetica caused by ungulates at fruiting time (see below). This conclusion allowed, it may be noted that one of the avian seed vectors for A. belladonna is Turdus philomelos, the song thrush and it is likely that other members of the family Turdidae found in Spain (of which there are a further nine ‚Äì see section Passeriformes in List of birds of Spain)Thrushes by Peter Clement. Princeton University Press (2001), . are involved too. In this connection it is worth mentioning that there is a small, but nonetheless intriguing, piece of evidence, in a Plautine comedy, that the Roman province of Hispania Baetica may have been famed as a supplier of thrushes, as food, to the tables of Ancient Rome. If this was indeed the case, such intensive bird- trapping could not fail to have had some impact on a plant dependent largely upon thrushes for its propagation by seed. The Tartessian (see Tartessos) tribe the Turdetani (thrush people?) of the valley of the Guadalquivir may have been known as such to the Romans by virtue of their trade in these edible songbirds.Captivi Act 1 Scene 2 verse 162 (and see footnote 5). Ancient Roman comedy by Plautus, Titus Maccius translated by Henry Thomas Riley, 1912. www.gutenberg.org The berries of Atropa belladonna have also been reported to be consumed, without harm, by the common pheasant, Phasianus colchicus (an introduced species in Spain) ‚Äì which is therefore, like the song thrush, likely also to be a consumer of the berries of Atropa baetica.Press, J.R., Sutton, Dr. D.A., Tebbs, B.R. (principal authors) et al., ed. Davison, Michael W. Field Guide to the Wild Flowers of Britain ‚Äì pub. the Reader's Digest Association Ltd. 1981, reprinted 1997, as part of the Reader's Digest Nature Lover's Library. In addition to the common pheasant, there are six other bird species (partridges in the main) placed in the phasianidae found in Spain (of which four are native and two introduced) which are probable consumers/seed vectors of Atropa species. Like the phasianidae, the domestic chicken is also a member of the order Galliformes and will feed on Atropa berries if presented with them (- see below in section Medicinal Uses). Mammalian consumers Neither vertebrates nor invertebrates consume A. baetica during the earlier stages of its growth cycle; however, during the month of September, when the onset of senescence causes the levels of tropanes in the aerial parts of the plant to fall, it often sustains severe damage from being browsed by the Southeastern Spanish ibex Capra pyrenaica Schinz. ssp. hispanica Schimper. Plants are stripped almost bare of leaves, fruit (both ripe and unripe) and even stem tips. Plants damaged in this way respond by producing small rosettes of leaves ‚Äì either at ground level or upon the lower third of the flowering stem ‚Äì which tend to sustain no further browsing damage before winter dormancy, possibly because of alkaloid levels raised as a defense mechanism activated by the check to growth. Needless to say, the effect of such browsing upon the sexual reproduction of A. baetica is profound: fewer ripe berries ‚Äì and therefore fewer viable seeds ‚Äì survive such wholesale destruction and the plants themselves are weakened and effectively undergo a prematurely enforced dormancy. The ibexes do not appear to suffer any ill effects from consuming a plant so rich in toxic alkaloids, which fact (even allowing for the decrease in the plant's toxicity in the month of September) highlights the widely varying susceptibility of different vertebrate species to the poisons involved. (Compare cases of human poisoning by the closely related Atropa belladonna ‚Äì in which as few as two ripe berries have led to the death of a child. There has been no research to date into the role of the Spanish ibex as a dispersal vector (through its droppings) of Atropa baetica seed. Considerable damage, through browsing, is also inflicted on the plant in the Sierra de la Cazorla during the time of its flowering and fruiting by two non- native/introduced ungulate species, namely Ovis orientalis ssp. musimon, the mouflon and Dama dama, the fallow deer. An online account of a recent botanical foray in search of Atropa baetica populations in Spain and Morocco mentions a plant of the species which the author maintains to have been severely damaged by either feral pigs or Sus scrofa ssp. meridionalis, the Mediterranean wild boar. Dr. Herrera, however, notes (in his excellent study of A. baetica in the Sierra de Cazorla) that on no occasion did he see evidence that wild boars had been digging up the rhizomes of the plant in order to feed on them ‚Äì the rarity of which behaviour he attributes to the boars' rejection of such potentially nutritious, starchy perennating organs (see perennation), on account of an awareness of their toxicity. In this context it is instructive to consider that wild boars are able to consume, without harm, a variety of plant genera which are toxic (in some cases extremely so) to humans ‚Äì most notably Aconitum, a genus yielding some of the most virulently poisonous alkaloids in the plant kingdom.Baskin, L. & Danell, K. (2003), Ecology of Ungulates: A Handbook of Species in Eastern Europe and Northern and Central Asia, Springer Science & Business Media, pp. 15-38, If wild boars do indeed eat the rhizomes of Atropa baetica on occasion, it is at least possible that they do so for reasons other than simple hunger. There is anecdotal evidence that certain Suidae deliberately consume at least one alkaloidal, plant hallucinogen, becoming highly intoxicated as a result. Indigenous groups in Gabon claim that they first learned of the psychoactive properties of Tabernanthe iboga (now utilised in the Bwiti religion) by observing wild pigs grubbing up the roots of the shrub, eating them and subsequently exhibiting symptoms of wild excitement.Furst, Peter T. Hallucinogens and Culture pub. Chandler and Sharp 1976 (volume in series on cross-cultural themes) Medicinal uses Like its better-known relative Atropa belladonna, A. baetica is a medicinal plant that has, in the past, been gathered in the wild as a source of valuable tropane alkaloids ‚Äì most notably Atropine and Scopolamine (=Hyoscine). The harvesting of the roots and rhizomes has involved the destruction of mature plants, further endangering a species likely never to have been common to start with and now extremely rare. As a result, the plant can now no longer be found in certain localities in which it used to grow e.g. its type locality (biology): the wooded valley of Barrancon in the Sierra de Maria-Los Velez Natural Park, Province of Almeria In addition to its former use in modern medicine as a source of alkaloidal drugs (discontinued, due to conservation concerns over the rarity of the species), Atropa baetica has interesting uses in the traditional medicine of Morocco. One of the Moroccan Arabic names for both Atropa baetica and A. belladonna is ·∏•abb el-fahm meaning 'seed of intelligence/understanding'. One author) maintains this to be due to a confusion (due to a similarity between certain Moroccan names of the plants in question) with Anacardium occidentale L., but this is belied by an ethnobotanical note on A. baetica by the estimable Prof. Font i Quer, who recorded a practice whereby a chicken was fed with Atropa berries until its flesh was judged to be sufficiently saturated with the plant's poisons (or metabolites thereof?) The chicken was then killed and its meat eaten by a person seeking (as the first author has it) to 'sharpen the faculties of the mind'. For some days the eater of the drugged chicken would show signs of belladonna poisoning, but, when they recovered from this intoxication, would find their faculty of memory greatly enhanced in clarity and retentiveness ‚Äì an effect often sought as an aid to the memorising of passages from the Quran and to cramming (education) for examinations. The same practice (along with another, undertaken for the same purpose, involving drinking the milk of a goat fed on Atropa berries) has been recorded more recently with regard to Atropa belladonna.Boulos, Loutfy Medicinal Plants of North Africa, no.3 in series Medicinal Plants of the World, pub. Reference Publications 1983. (Additional evidence that birds can indeed accumulate tropanes in their muscle tissue as a result of consuming a Solanaceous plant is provided by certain waterfowl in Mexico: the ducks of the Huizache lagoon of Mazatlan have been found to be intoxicating, when eaten, as a result of their habitual consumption of the tropane-containing Datura ceratocaula.Preissel, Ulrike; Preissel, Hans-Georg (2002). Brugmansia and Datura: Angel's Trumpets and Thorn Apples. Buffalo, New York: Firefly Books. pp. 106‚Äì129. . As to the curious (positive) pharmacological rebound effect of recovery from a tropane-induced delirium leading to an enhancement of mental capacity, there is an instructive parallel in the folk medicine of Bulgaria, in which senile dementia sufferers are said to recover their lost faculties to a surprising degree after recovering from being subjected to just such a delirium through the use of Atropa belladonna). Another use of Atropa baetica in the folk medicine of Morocco is as one of the constituent plants in a polyherbal, abortifacient preparation. This is employed by local Traditional birth attendants in the Rif and takes the form of an orally administered decoction of the following plant species (all of which are considered locally to be toxic and/or narcotic): Cannabis sativa, Atropa baetica, Nerium oleander, Ruta montana, Agave americana, and Drimia maritima. The decoction, drunk on an empty stomach, is reported to be effective in the termination of pregnancy at a stage of 2‚Äì3 months. The traditional medical practitioners who employ such herbal abortifacients stress that they are dangerous and have caused numerous fatalities.Merzouki A., Ed-Derfoufi F. & Molero Mesa J. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) and abortion, Short communication, Journal of Ethnopharmacology 73 (2000) 501-503 Agave americana is undoubtedly the least toxic of the plant ingredients, although it sometimes causes the condition Purpuric agave dermatitis and could thus be acknowledged to possess some irritant properties.James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al.

Even without taking into account complex drug interactions, such a 'cocktail' of dangerous plants could indeed prove fatal, not only to a fetus but also to the pregnant woman carrying it. Chemistry No fewer than 15 tropane alkaloids have been isolated from Atropa baetica, of which the most abundant are atropine and scopolamine ‚Äì alkaloids of frequent occurrence in toxic Solanaceous plants (notably in tribes Hyoscyameae and Datureae)) with a history of employment as analgesics, anaesthetics and hallucinogens in traditional medicine.Zarate, Rafael; Hermosin, Bernardo; Cantos, Manuel and Troncoso, Antonio: Tropane Alkaloid Distribution in Atropa baetica Plants: Journal of Chemical Ecology August 1997, Volume 23, Issue 8, pp. 2059‚Äì2066Maqbool, Farhana; Singh, Seema; Kaloo, Zahoor A.; and Jan, Mahroofa, of University of Kashmir, Hazratbal, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India: Medicinal Importance of Genus Atropa Royle -A review: International Journal of Advanced Research (2014), Volume 2, Issue 2, 48-54. Nomenclature The authority for the binomial name Atropa baetica is the eminent German botanist and pioneering plant-hunter in Spain Heinrich Moritz Willkomm (1821‚Äì1895), who published it in 1852 in the German (language) Linnaea (journal)(Berlin, 1826‚Äì1882) (see also Polish Wikipedia page Linnaea (czasopismo) ). The common name 'belladonna de Andalucia' (Andalusian belladonna) is a botanical/horticultural coinage, being essentially a translation of the Latin binomial, placing the plant in relation to its notorious sister species, A. belladonna (a much commoner and far more widespread species, found in nearly all of Europe). By contrast, the most widely used common name for Atropa baetica in Spanish ‚Äì tabaco gordo i.e. 'stout/big tobacco' ‚Äì places the plant in relation, not to the one other species of Atropa found in Spain, but to plants belonging to a different genus of the family Solanaceae ‚Äì namely Nicotiana. This is also true of most, if not all, of the other common names recorded for A. baetica in Spain of which the following are listed: tabaco de pastor ('shepherd's tobacco'), tabaco Filipino ('Filipino tobacco') tabaco verde ('green tobacco') and tabaco borde ('wayside tobacco'). These tobacco-related names imply that A. baetica has, on occasion, been smoked like tobacco in Spain and that there has been a popular awareness there of a family resemblance (particularly in relation to foliage) between Atropa and Nicotiana. In this context, it is worth noting that, while the flower of the widely cultivated Nicotiana tabacum is of a pale pink to violet colour, that of the less frequently cultivated but much more potent Nicotiana rustica, is yellow ‚Äì like that of Atropa baetica. Smoked as recreational drug While the smoking of cigarettes containing the dried leaves of Atropa species for the purpose of relieving asthma symptoms is well documented in the history of modern medicine, the practice of smoking Atropa leaves as a recreational drug in the period predating the upsurge of interest in such drugs among the Beat Generation of the 1950s and in the hippie subculture of the 1960s is neither well-known nor well-researched. That the tobacco-related common names for Atropa baetica in Spanish cited above demonstrate that the plant really has been smoked as a tobacco substitute in Spain is confirmed by an ethnobotanical observation made by Prof. Font i Quer, who states that A. baetica is smoked by the shepherds of la Sagra. (The geographical designation la Sagra generally refers in Spain to a part of the Submeseta Sur (a part, in turn of the Meseta central), although it is possible (given the distribution of A. baetica ) that the Sierra de la Sagra (a mountain range further to the South of the Submeseta) may be intended). Font i Quer goes on to compare this smoking of A. baetica with the occasional smoking of A. belladonna in the Catalan (i.e. Eastern) part of the Pyrenees (where one of A. belladonna 's common names, in the Catalan language is tabac bord ‚Äì compare name tabaco borde for A. baetica in Spanish). In neither instance, however, does he enlarge upon his observations, making no mention of the time of year at which the leaves were gathered, whether they were cured like tobacco or merely dried, how much of the leaf material was smoked at one time etc. ‚Äì all of which would affect the amount of tropanes absorbed by these smokers of Atropa leaves and thus the degree of their intoxication. Atropa baetica is also smoked as a recreational drug in the Rif of Morocco, where ‚Äì under the name of Tabba ‚Äì it occasionally forms one of the constituents of the cannabis-based preparation kief, smoked in the traditional Sebsi ‚Äì a small-bowled pipe fitted with a mesh screen.Maverick Guide to Morocco. Pelican Publishing. pp. 84‚Äì. . 2006 World Drug Report: Analysis. United Nations Publications. 1 January 2006. pp. 2120‚Äì. . That Atropa species should ever have become popular as recreational drugs is surprising, to say nothing of a testament to human curiosity and foolhardiness. It can hardly be overstressed that Atropa baetica is an extremely poisonous plant and that the altered state of consciousness produced by its use is better characterised as a delirium or Substance-induced psychosis than as the more lucid and contemplative state evoked by true hallucinogens such as LSD, psilocybin, mescaline et al. The following colourful mnemonic lists the main features of the anticholinergic syndrome produced by intoxication by tropane-containing Solanaceous plants such as A. baetica: *Blind as a bat (dilated pupils) *Red as a beet (vasodilation/flushing) *Hot as a hare (hyperthermia) *Dry as a bone (dry skin) *Mad as a hatter (hallucinations/agitation) *Bloated as a Toad (ileus, urinary retention) *And the heart runs alone (tachycardia). Visions caused by anticholinergics (including Atropa alkaloids) are often characterised by the following: warping or waving of surfaces and edges (distorted perception of objects actually present);flashes of 'light', 'smoke', visual snow, textured surfaces and insect or spider-like forms likely deriving from entoptic phenomena and form constants; and vivid hallucinations (indistinguishable from reality) of lifelike objects, animals and persons not actually present. The state is further characterised by confusion, fear, outbursts of rage, plucking or grabbing movements of the hands, sexual arousal and often also amnesia concerning parts of the experience. Blurred vision from cycloplegia and concomitant photophobia often persist for some days afterward. Long term use of anticholinergic drugs (including the alkaloids present in Atropa) is associated with physical and mental deterioration leading to dementia\\"Study suggests link between long-term use of anticholinergics and dementia risk\\". Alzheimer's Society. 2015-01-26. and premature death. Studies of the use of Atropa as a hallucinogen in Europe have generally focused on its role as a frequently listed ingredient (often under such obsolete names as Solanum lethale and Solanum somniferum) in recipes for the witches' flying ointmentHansen, Harold A. The Witch's Garden pub. Unity Press 1978 Baroja, Julio Caro The World of the Witches pub. Phoenix 2001 (Original Title Las brujas y su mundo) ) dating from the late medieval to the early modern period ‚Äì as described, for example, in the Magia Naturalisdella Porta, Giambattista Natural Magic of Renaissance scholar and scientist Giambattista della Porta. By contrast, the smoking of Atropa leaves (for purposes other than the relieving of asthma symptoms) does not seem to have been recorded outside the Ibero-Maghrebi area. What the transdermal absorption route involved in the use of 'flying ointments' and the pulmonary absorption route through smoking have in common is that both techniques allow users a modicum of control over the intoxication that would be more problematic in oral use (ingestion of Atropa is recorded mainly in cases of poisoning ‚Äì by the fatally edible-looking berries ‚Äì rather than in accounts of hallucinogenic use). The smoking, as hallucinogens, of genera of tropane-containing Solanaceae other than Atropa ‚Äì alone or as additives to Cannabis preparations ‚Äì is not unknown elsewhere and is, in some instances, a practice of considerable antiquity. Charred seeds of Hyoscyamus niger have been found at certain prehistoric sites, leaves of Hyoscyamus muticus have been smoked by certain Bedouin tribeshttp://wilderness-ventures-egypt.com/2011/04/sakaran-ÿ≥ŸÉÿ±ÿßŸÜ/Ratsch, Christian, The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and Its Applications pub. Park Street Press 2005. and the leaves of Datura metel have been smoked with cannabis in India. By contrast ‚Äì judging from the prevalence of tobacco-related names for Atropa baetica in Spain ‚Äì the smoking of the plant may not date from earlier than the introduction of tobacco to Spain in the sixteenth century. However, given a) the Iberian peninsula's history of Islamic cultural influence under Arab rule b) Islam's tolerance of the practice of cannabis-smoking and c) the greater antiquity of cannabis-smoking than the smoking of tobacco, it is possible that Atropa baetica was smoked with cannabis (as it still is in Morocco) in Spain prior to the introduction of tobacco from Hispaniola.

In addition to the years he served in the Swedish Army, Tamm led a group of Swedish officers who developed the Ethiopian military school's officer training (1934‚Äì36 and 1945‚Äì46) and he was a volunteer in the Winter War in Finland in 1940 commanding the II. Battlegroup of the Swedish Volunteer Corps. Back in Sweden he eventually became Chief of the Army Staff and the General Staff Corps (1948‚Äì53) and commander of the I Military District (1953‚Äì61) before retiring as a Lieutenant General in 1961. Career Tamm was born in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of the bank director and later finance minister Henric Tamm and his wife Louise Tham. He became a second lieutenant at the Svea Life Guards (I 1) in 1916 and was promoted to lieutenant in 1919. Tamm attended the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1925 to 1927 and became captain of the General Staff in 1930 and at the Svea Life Guards (I 1) in 1934. He entered the Ethiopian Empire service in 1934. Captain Tamm and the then Chief of Air Force, Major General Eric Virgin, who was employed as the emperor's military political adviser, as well as four other military officers (the lieutenants Nils Bouveng, Arne Thorburn, Gustaf He√ºman and Anders Nyblom) entered together into the Ethiopian service to organize the country's only military school for the training of Ethiopian officers. A Swedish military academy for cadets was established in Holeta Genet under captain Tamm who, with his staff, stayed on in Ethiopia after the outbreak of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War despite pressure by the Swedish government to return. Tamm re-entered into the Swedish Army as captain of the General Staff in 1936 and was a teacher of tactics at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College in 1936. Tamm became major in the General Staff Corps in 1937 and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1939. During World War II, he was a member of the Finlandskommitt√©n and in 1940 he entered into Finnish service and became commander of the II. Battlegroup of the Swedish Volunteer Corps during the Winter War. He was a lieutenant colonel of the General Staff Corps and head of department at the Army Staff's Education Department in 1940. Tamm was colonel in the General Staff Corps in 1941 and head of the Royal Swedish Army Staff College in 1941 and commander of the Southern Scanian Infantry Regiment (I 7) from 1942 to 1944. Furthermore Tamm was Inspector of the Infantry from 1944 to 1946 and was back again in Ethiopian service from 1945 to 1946. He was deputy military commander of the I Military District in 1946 and was promoted to major general and was Chief of the Army Staff and the General Staff Corps from 1948 to 1953.

Ward's published work focuses on a broad range of topics, from feminist pornography, queer parenting, and the racial politics of same-sex marriage, to the social construction of heterosexuality and whiteness. She is the blogger for FeministPigs. She is a cofounder, along with CJ Pascoe and Tey Meadow, of the blog SocialInqueery.com. Beyond her writing, she was a founding member of \\"The Miracle Whips\\" burlesque group in 2004. She also started the parenting collective \\"L.A. Genderqueer Parenting\\" in 2009. Both groups were based in Los Angeles.  Works  Ward's first book, Respectably Queer, is based on her observations of three different queer organizations: the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, Bienestar, and Los Angeles-Christopher Street West. Ward's second book, Not Gay, has received positive reviews from New York Magazine and many other outlets. New York Magazine states \\"[Ward] shows that homosexual contact has been a regular feature of heterosexual life ever since the concepts of homo- and heterosexuality were first created‚Äînot just in prisons and frat houses and the military, but in biker gangs and even conservative suburban neighborhoods.\\" In Not Gay, Ward examines same sex encounters between men who are considered to be heterosexual.http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&sid;=b48281a0-3b64-4ad2-b407-e620df0921f1%40sessionmgr4010&hid;=4110 Questions that frame her analysis include \\"Are men gay for having sex with other men?\\" To answer such questions, she traces American history to the 1950s, examining same sex encounters such as those in public bathrooms. Ward also uses sociological, psychological, and historical research to link gender and sexuality to race, focusing on the perceived heterosexuality of white men who have sexual encounters with other white men. Ward's work in Not Gay presents a perspective on opposite couple attraction and a new outlook on heterosexual masculinity. In 2020, Ward published her third book, entitled The Tragedy of Heterosexuality.

Written by Mark Amato, the film is about two airline passengers whose flight to New York City is rerouted to Buffalo due to a snowstorm. The television film first aired on November 28, 2015 on the Hallmark Channel and achieved 4.78 million viewers.Cable ratings for November 28, 2015  Plot  Radiant Bride magazine writer, Paige Summerland (Candace Cameron Bure), boards a flight to New York City on her way to meet her wealthy \\"soulmate\\" fianc√© and future in-laws. Her romantic optimism leaves her convinced that her upcoming wedding to Jack Collins (Marcus Rosner) is destined to be as perfect as her picture-perfect magazine articles and her \\"vision board\\", with photos reflecting her life goals. She sits next to Dylan MacKenzie (Paul Greene), a cynical unromantic bartender who is traveling to see his family for the first time in four years‚Äîa reunion he is not looking forward to. Due to a heavy snowstorm, their flight is rerouted to Buffalo, New York. They take a shuttle bus to the Buffalo Airport Hotel, where she is assigned an adjoining room next to Dylan. Convinced that a flight will shortly be leaving to New York, Paige heads back to the airport terminal, where she befriends a married couple, Frank and Maxine, whose twenty-year marriage seems less than ideal. Unfortunately, the snow storm has turned north and completely closed down Buffalo for at least two days, making a \\"perfect Christmas\\" at the in-laws look very unlikely. Dylan pulls up in a four-wheel drive SUV and offers her, Maxine, and Frank a ride to New York. As they make their way along the back roads of upstate New York, the snowstorm forces them to stop at a small town, where they spend their Christmas Eve at the O Tannenbaum Inn. Paige and Dylan get to know each other and talk about Dylan's former fianc√©e, who left him for his own brother. That evening at a local pub, after Frank and Maxine rediscover their love for each other and take to the dance floor, Dylan invites Paige to dance, but she feels uncomfortable with her new-found friendship with Dylan and walks away. Later they walk to the town center, where she admits that while she dreamed all her life of spending the perfect Christmas with someone like Jack, this Christmas with Dylan indeed seems right, and they kiss beneath the mistletoe. Disturbed by her feelings for Dylan, Paige leaves early the following morning hitchhiking a ride alone with a truck driver, who takes her all the way to New York City. Meanwhile, Dylan drives Frank and Maxine to their house in Connecticut, where Maxine reveals that Paige will be having dinner with her fianc√© and in-laws at the Glen Rock Country Club. After returning to his mother's home and reconciling with his brother and ex-fianc√©, Dylan drives to Glen Rock and delivers Paige's \\"vision board\\", but includes a photo of Paige and Dylan together. Realizing that she is in love with Dylan, she returns her engagement ring to Jack, and follows after Dylan. Sometime later, Dylan and Paige arrive at his mother's loving home to spend Christmas together.  Cast   Production  A Christmas Detour was filmed on location in Langley, British Columbia, Canada.  Critical response  In her review on the Inquisitr website, Tracity Reyes called the film \\"adorable\\". According to the review on the It's a Wonderful Movie website, Candace Cameron Bure is \\"ideally cast\\" and Paul Greene is \\"terrific\\" in what the reviewer called a \\"fun film\\".

This strike-slip event damaged and destroyed a number of small villages in a sparsely populated region near the Alborz mountain range. It left four people dead, forty injured, and about 800 people without homes. The deaths and injuries in this moderate event were attributed to the low quality construction styles that are typical of the area. The Iranian Strong Motion Network provided data by which seismologists determined the type and extent of the slip as well as the peak ground acceleration. Other large and destructive earthquakes have affected the Semnan Province, including several events in 856 AD and 1953. Tectonic setting The tectonics of Iran are dominated by the continental collision of the Arabian and Eurasian Plates. The rate of convergence has been estimated at two centimeters per year for the past 10 million years; about half of that occurs across the Zagros fold and thrust belt. The northern Iran region near the Alborz mountains contains numerous reverse and left-lateral strike-slip faults that lie to the south of the Caspian sea. The Astaneh strike-slip fault was a likely source of the 856 Damghan earthquake that caused the largest loss of life in the history of Iran‚Äîmore than 200,000 deaths. Earthquake USGS ShakeMap for the event A more recent damaging event that also occurred near the Alborz mountain range was the 1953 Torud earthquake, in which more than 900 perished. Like that shock, the 2010 Damghan event took place in a rural area that exposed relatively few villages to strong shaking. It occurred at 11:53 local time in the north-central desert region of Iran on a fault that dipped 78¬∞ to the northwest. Fault motion occurred on a NE-SW striking fault that was almost pure left-lateral strike-slip. A Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong) was observed in Kuh Zar and the nearby villages of Tuchahi, Kelu, and Shimi. In Hoseynian, Moalleman, Satveh, and Torud, the intensity was VI (Strong). Some surface cracks and fissures were present near Tuchahi and Kelu villages, but no significant surface faulting occurred. Damage The affected area has a low population density and has an abundance of homes that are constructed with local clay material by unskilled workers. The unreinforced stone masonry or adobe homes are sometimes overloaded single story structures with flat wooden roofs with steel beams. Most of these types of homes suffered partial collapse, and led to a number of roof collapses. Fifty homes were destroyed, three-hundred were damaged, including a roof cave- in that left two women dead. Overall, seven villages sustained damage and twelve were destroyed. Four people died, forty were injured, and 800 were left homeless, but no major infrastructure (dams, bridges, or power stations) were impacted. Strong motion The first isoseismal map that was created in Iran was for the earlier 1953 Torud event. In an effort to focus on the association between the macroseismic effects and the instrumental intensity for the 2010 event, seismologists Shahvar and Zar√© conducted a field investigation and interviews. An isoseismal map that was created using the data aligned with a ShakeMap that was created by the Tehran-based International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology. The closest strong motion station was about to the east of the origin of faulting, and showed a horizontal acceleration of .55g. The peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity that were attained from the Iranian Strong Motion Network were considered large for a moderate event.

The fantasy comic was written by Kazu Kibuishi, and is a successful bestseller. It was written in 2009.  Summary  Emily, her brother, and their crew of robots continue to travel in the underground world to the city of Kanalis to find an antidote for her mother. At the same time, the elf Trellis continues to hunt Emily down, due to her denial of agreeing to join him to fight his evil father, the Elf King. However, because his son did not bring Emily to him, the Elf King states that Trellis has failed him again. He forces Trellis to be accompanied by the Elf Luger, who like Trellis and Emily, is also a stonekeeper. While Emily mourns for her mother, the robot Cogsley is currently teaching Navin how to control the robotic house. When the crew arrives at Kanalis, they find everyone in the city are humanoid animals. Almost immediately, as they seek the town's doctor, elves begin to tighten their grip on Kanalis which puts the city under depression. A humanoid fox named Leon Redbeard offers to be Emily's bodyguard but is rejected from the robot Miskit, despite Emily thinking it's a good idea. When the elves shoot a cannon on the hospital the crew is in, everyone in the building is evacuated to a train, except for Emily, Leon, and Miskit, who begins to dislike Leon. Leon leads them through underground so they could reach their destination, Demon Mountain, in which the doctor claimed that magical curing fruit is on top of the mountain, which could cure Emily's mother. Many people and elves who have attempted this quest have never come back. Soon they are encountered once again by elves. Leon is able to protect Emily for a bit but almost dies in doing so. Emily saves him with her magical amulet, astonishing Leon, the elves and Miskit. At the same time, elves invade the robotic house, and the robots have no choice but to shut themselves down so the elves don't collect data from them. Meanwhile, the humanoid bull Balin shows Navin a future-telling talking tree, and he rushes to Demon Mountain due to one of the tree's visions of Emily falling to her death. Meanwhile, while climbing the mountain, Leon shows Emily how to focus her amulet's power with a walking stick. He begins by showing her how to pick up a nut with her amulet without burning it. After mastering this, she moves a bunch of explosives that were in their way. At the same time, the sinister voice of her amulet is growing stronger and almost makes her injure Leon and leave Miskit. Navin, with the help of Balin and a crew called the Resistance, are able to turn on the robots again, who begin to travel to Demon Mountain in the robotic house. Emily asks Leon what happens to a stonekeeper when the voice completely takes over their body. He explains that years before, four stonekeepers lost control of their powers. They grew into giants and would have destroyed them all had they not been defeated by other stonekeepers, her great-grandfather among them. They were able to kill the rogue stonekeepers...except one. That one was an elf and was sent to jail, separated from his amulet in an attempt to break his curse. The elf kept begging them to kill him, and warned that dark days would come. One day, the elf's amulet returned to him so he could break out of prison, and he caused an explosion which killed many, including a prison guard that was Leon's father. And that elf grew up to be The Elf King. Eventually, Emily, Leon and Miskit reach the top of the mountain, where they find future telling talking trees, the trees that grow the fruit they are looking for. The trees explain that whoever came to the mountain would die because they chose the wrong fruit to eat. Using the amulet's power, she finds the fruit that isn't deadly and heads down the mountain. While the elves travel through Demon Mountain, Luger injures Trellis, believing that he would stand get in their way and seeing him as useless. After burning down the future-telling trees, the elves fight Leon and Emily. Trellis, who woke from his coma tries to stop Luger from killing Emily, but with the power of his amulet, Luger grows into a giant, knocking Trellis out and knocks Emily and Leon into a chasm, but they are saved by the robotic house. Navin tries to use the house to fight Luger, who almost destroys the house, but Emily gives the house extreme power while Navin controls the house to punch Luger two times. The second punch is strong enough to send Luger into the chasm, Emily's mother is cured and Trellis follows the house, still planning to recruit Emily as the crew continues to try and stop The Elf King.  Themes  Themes of The Stonekeeper's Curse includes resisting a greedy temptation, as shown when the Amulet almost gets full control over Emily.  Title  The book was named The Stonekeeper's Curse because of the scene when Leon was explaining to Emily about what would happen if the Voice took full control.

The Liber de apparitione Sancti Michaelis in Monte Gargano (Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina 5948)Edited by G. Waitz in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptores rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum (Havover 1898), pp. 541-43; reprinted, with an English translation, in Richard F. Johnson, Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), 110-15. is a composite 9th century hagiographical text by an anonymous author containing the foundation myth of the Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo, also known as Mont Gargano, on Mount Gargano, Italy, in northern Apulia. It contains record of the first known appearance of Saint Michael the Archangel in western Europe after the transmission of his cult from the Greek East. Manuscript tradition The earliest extant manuscripts of the De apparitione are from the late eighth or early ninth century,Otranto, Giorgio. \\"Per una metodologia della ricerca storico-agiografica, il santuario micaelico del Gargano tra Bizantini e Langobardi,\\" In Vetera Christianorum 25 (1988):381-405. but the tripartite composition of the text suggests at least three layers of narrative accretion; the oldest strata seems to go back to a lost sixth century version,Richard F. Johnson, Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), pp. 37-38.Nicholas Everett, \\"The Liber de apparitione S. Michaelis in Monte Gargano and the hagiography of dispossession\\", Analecta Bollandiana 120 (2002), 364-391. which the author of the anonymous final version mentions in his recension. Legend There are three sections to the legend, recording three apparitions by Michael on Mount Gargano. The first and third sections appear to be part of the same narrative, while the second is possibly the account of a battle half a century later. According to the first and last parts of the legend, around the year 490 the Archangel Michael appeared several times to the Bishop of Sipontum near a cave in the mountains, instructing that the cave be dedicated to Christian worship and promising protection of the nearby town of Sipontum from pagan invaders. These apparitions are the first appearances of Saint Michael in western Europe. The second section of the text describes Michael's intercession on behalf of the Sipontans and the Beneventans against invading pagan Neapolitans. Michael strikes the pagans with lightning, killing over 600 of them, and the Sipontans and Beneventans are victorious. Giorgio OtrantoOtranto, Giorgio. \\"'Il Liber de Apparitione,' il santuario di san Michele sul Gargano e i Longobardi del Ducato di Benevento.\\" In Santuari e politica nel mondo antico, 210-245. Milan: 1983. identifies this battle as the one recorded in Book 4 of Paul the Deacon's History of the Lombards,Paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardi. In Monumenta Germanica Historica: Scriptores Rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum. Edited by Ludwig Bethmann and Georg Waitz. Hanover, 1878. which describes the defense of the oraculum on Mount Gargano against 'Greeks'‚Äì Byzantine Neapolitan troops‚Äì by the Lombard Duke of Benevento, Grimoald I, on May 8, 663. Richard Johnson summarises the legend: * \\"Garganus, a wealthy man of Siponto who owned a large herd of cattle, became enraged with a bull that had strayed from his herd. When he found the bull at the mouth of the cave, he shot it with a poisoned arrow which reversed its trajectory in mid-flight and killed him. Hearing of this mysterious event, the archbishop instructed the local citizens to fast for three days. During the course of the fast, St Michael appeared to the bishop and revealed to him the significance of the event. *At this point in the hagiographical account, the narrative of Garganus and the bull is interrupted, and the account of St. Michael's military intervention on behalf of the Christians of Siponto is taken up. According to this part of the legend, the Sipontans and their neighbors, the Beneventans, were besieged by the pagan Neapolitans. In despair, the Sipontans turned to their bishop for help. The bishop instructed them to perform a three-day fast and to pray for protection from St. Michael. The archangel appeared to this bishop and assured him of their victory over the pagans. The Neapolitans were defeated and as a sign of his aid in their victory, St. Michael left the mark of his footprints in the stone of the cave where Garganus had been killed. * After the description of the archangel's military intervention, the hagiographical narrative returns to the scene of the grotto and gives an account of his third apparition. The Sipontans, in great doubt and fear as to whether they dare enter the grotto, consulted their bishop again. A third time, St. Michael appeared to the bishop and told him that there was no need to consecrate the grotto chapel since he had already done so. St. Michael instructed the bishop to enter the chapel first and conduct mass. In the cavern, he discovered an altar, covered with a red cloth. The bishop then appointed priests and psalm-singers to conduct daily services in the grotto-chapel. The account of the \\"discovery\\" of the grotto-chapel ends with a description of the clear and sweet water which seeped from the ceiling stone beyond the altar. When drunk from the glass vessel suspended by a silver chain near the source, the dripping water heals all manner of infirmities. The hagiographic account of St. Michael's three apparitions on Monte Gargano ends with St. Paul's observation on the function of angels (Hebrews 1:14): \\"For angels are ministering spirits and sent to minister for them who will receive the inheritance of salvation.\\" Other records of the legend The legend of the Archangel's apparition at Gargano is also recorded in the Roman Breviary for May 8, as well as in the Golden Legend (Legenda Aurea), the compendium of Christian hagriographies compiled by Jacobus de Voragine between 1260-1275. Its presence in the Golden Legend ensured its wide circulation in medieval Europe.Richard F. Johnson, Saint Michael the Archangel in Medieval English Legend (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2005), p. 65. This foundation myth may have influenced those of other Michaeline sanctuaries, such as the Revelatio Ecclesiae de Sancti Michaelis of Mont Saint-Michel.

The palace, owned by the comune, since 1999 houses the Museo Ebraico di Bologna or Jewish Museum of Bologna. History A palace at the site had been constructed by the bread merchant, Francesco Pannolini. In his will of 1595, he left the property for the creation of a school for poor children, intending to study the trade as merchants. By 1619, the Collegio Pannolini had been created. The college was closed in 1765 by Pope Benedict XIV, and the site was transferred to the Academy of Sciences. The Malvasia family acquired the structure, and merged it with their adjacent Palazzo Mavasia. The museum incorporates part of the Malvasia palace.Museo Ebraico of Bologna. Ghetto of Bologna A Jewish community had lived in Bologna since the 14th century. Jews were circumscribed to a ghetto starting in 1556 by Pope Paul IV. The Jewish district in Bologna was present just southwest of the Museum, in an area delineated by the intersection of via del Carro and via Zamboni, via Oberdan where an arch looks onto vicolo Mandria, and the start of via de' Giudei. The entrances to the Ghetto were sealed from sunset to sunrise. By 1569, the Jewish community of Bologna was expelled by Pius V. Allowed to return in 1586 under Sixtus V, they were again expelled in 1593 under Pope Clement VIII, and did not return until the Napoleonic occupation. In 1593, nearly 900 people left the city, mostly taking refuge with the Jewish community in Ferrara.Bologna Welcome, website.Gardens and Ghettos: The Art of Jewish Life in Italy, by Vivian B.

It can be stored in an array as an implicit binary tree like the former, and has the efficiency guarantees of the latter. Weak-heapsort uses fewer comparisons than most other algorithms, close to the theoretical lower limit, so is particularly useful when comparison is expensive, such as when comparing strings using the full Unicode collation algorithm. Description A weak heap is most easily understood as a heap-ordered multi-way tree stored as a binary tree using the \\"right-child left-sibling\\" convention. (This is equivalent to, but reversed from, the usual left-child right-sibling binary tree.) In the multi-way tree, and assuming a max-heap, each parent's key is greater than or equal to () all the child keys (and thus, by induction, all members of the subtree). Expressed as a binary tree, this translates to the following invariants: *The root node has no left child *For every node, the value associated with that node is greater than or equal to the values associated with all nodes in its right subtree. *The leaves of the tree have heights that are all within one of each other. The last condition is a consequence of the fact that an implicit binary tree is a complete binary tree. The structure of this tree maps very neatly onto the traditional -based (Ahnentafel) implicit binary tree arrangement, where node has a next sibling (left child) numbered and a first child (right child) numbered , by adding an additional root numbered . This root has no siblings, only a first child, which is node (). This structure is very similar to that of a binomial heap, with a tree of height being composed of a root plus trees of heights , , ..., . A perfect (no missing leaves) weak heap with elements is exactly isomorphic to a binomial heap of the same size, but the two algorithms handle sizes which are not a power of differently: a binomial heap uses multiple perfect trees, while a weak heap uses a single imperfect tree. Weak heaps require the ability to exchange the left and right children (and associated subtrees) of a node. In an explicit (pointer-based) representation of the tree, this is straightforward. In an implicit (array) representation, this requires one \\"reverse bit\\" per internal node to indicate which child is considered the left child. A weak heap is thus not a strictly implicit data structure since it requires additional space ( bit per node). However, it is often possible to find space for this extra bit within the node structure, such as by tagging a pointer which is already present. In the implicit binary tree, node with reverse bit has parent , left child , and right child . Viewed as a multi-way tree, each node in a weak heap is linked to two others: a \\"next sibling\\" and a \\"first child\\". In the implicit tree, the links are fixed, so which of the two links is the sibling and which the first child is indicated by the reverse bit. Operations on weak heaps Note that every node in a weak heap can be considered the root of a smaller weak heap by ignoring its next sibling. Nodes with no first child are automatically valid weak heaps. A node of height has children: a first child of height , a second child of height , and so on to the last child of height . These may be found by following the first child link and then successive next sibling links. It also has next siblings of height , , etc. A node's parent in the multi-way tree is called its \\"distinguished ancestor\\". To find this in the binary tree, find the node's binary parent. If the node is the right child (first child), the parent is the distinguished ancestor. If the node is the left child (next sibling), its distinguished ancestor is the same as its binary parent's. In the implicit tree, finding the binary parent is easy, but its reverse bit must be consulted to determine which type of child the node is. (Early papers used the term \\"grandparent\\" for the distinguished ancestor, a meaning confusingly different from the usual \\"parent of parent\\".) Although the distinguished ancestor may be levels high in the tree, the average distance is . (It's at least , and half of the time we recurse, so , meaning that .) Thus, even a simple iterative algorithm for finding the distinguished ancestor is sufficient. Like binomial heaps, the fundamental operation on weak heaps is merging two heaps of equal height , to make a weak heap of height . This requires exactly one comparison, between the roots. Whichever root is greater (assuming a max-heap) is the final root. Its first child is the losing root, which retains its children (right subtree). The winning root's children are installed as siblings of the losing root. This operation can be performed on the implicit tree structure because the heaps being merged are never arbitrary. Rather, the two heaps are formed as part of sifting a node up the multi-way tree: * The first is a normal weak heap (whose next sibling link exists, but is ignored). * The second is the imaginary heap formed by linking the first root's distinguished ancestor (multi-way parent) to the first root's following siblings. At the beginning, the heap invariants apply everywhere except possibly between the first root and its distinguished ancestor. All other nodes are less than or equal to their distinguished ancestors. After comparing the two roots, the merge proceeds in one of two ways: # (The distinguished ancestor is greater or equal.) Nothing needs to be moved, and the result of the merge is the distinguished ancestor. # (The first root is greater.) The first root's binary children (first child and next sibling) are exchanged (using the reverse bit), and then the first root and its distinguished ancestor are exchanged (by copying). The second case works because, in the multi-way tree, each node keeps its children with it. The first root is promoted up the tree because it is greater than its distinguished ancestor. Thus, it is safely greater than all of the ancestor's previous children. The previous ancestor, however, is not a safe parent for the first root's old children, because it is less than the first root and so it's not guaranteed to be greater than or equal to all of its children. By swapping the binary children, the appropriate subset of the demoted ancestor's old children (which are safely less than or equal to it) are demoted with it. The demoted ancestor's new siblings are the first root's old children, promoted, which are safely less than or equal to the promoted first root. After this operation, it is uncertain whether the invariant is maintained between the new distinguished ancestor and its distinguished ancestor, so the operation is repeated until the root is reached. Weak-heap sort Weak heaps may be used to sort an array, in essentially the same way as a conventional heapsort. First, a weak heap is built out of all of the elements of the array, and then the root is repeatedly exchanged with the last element, which is sifted down to its proper place. A weak heap of elements can be formed in merges. It can be done on various orders, but a simple bottom-up implementation works from the end of the array to the beginning, merging each node with its distinguished ancestor. Note that finding the distinguished ancestor is simplified because the reverse bits in all parents of the heaps being merged are unmodified from their initial state (\\"not reversed\\"), and so do not need to be consulted. As with heapsort, if the array to be sorted is larger than the CPU cache, performance is improved if subtrees are merged as soon as two of the same size become available, rather than merging all subtrees on one level before proceeding to the next. Alternate PDF source. Sifting down in a weak heap can be done in comparisons, as opposed to for a binary heap, or for the \\"bottom-up heapsort\\" variant. This is done by \\"merging up\\": after swapping the root with the last element of the heap, find the last (height 1) child of the root. Merge this with the root (its distinguished ancestor), resulting in a valid height-2 heap at the global root. Then go to the previous sibling (binary parent) of the last merged node, and merge again. Repeat until the root is reached, when it will be correct for the complete tree. Priority queue operations In a weak max-heap, the maximum value can be found (in constant time) as the value associated with the root node; similarly, in a weak min-heap, the minimum value can be found at the root. As with binary heaps, weak heaps can support the typical operations of a priority queue data structure: insert, delete-min, delete, or decrease- key, in logarithmic time per operation. Sifting up is done using the same process as in binary heaps. The new node is added at the leaf level, then compared with its distinguished ancestor and swapped if necessary (the merge operation). This is repeated until no more swaps are necessary or the root is reached. Variants of the weak heap structure allow constant amortized time insertions and decrease-keys, matching the time for Fibonacci heaps.. History and applications Weak heaps were introduced by , as part of a variant heap sort algorithm that (unlike the standard heap sort using binary heaps) could be used to sort items using only comparisons... They were later investigated as a more generally applicable priority queue data structure...

She is called the \\"mother of aerospace materials\\" and the \\"mother of semiconductor materials\\" in China. In 1957, she returned to China and became a researcher at the Institute of Physics CAS. She then moved to the Institute of Semiconductor CAS and spent her research life there. Among her many contributions include manufacturing China's first monocrystalline silicon, and the first mono-crystal furnace used to extract silicon in China. She laid the foundation of development in microelectronics and optoelectronics. She was responsible for developing extensive materials in a high-purified vapor phase and liquid phase and led China to become the world leader. She was honored as Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences and became the vice president of China Association for Science and Technology. She received the National S&T; Progress Award twice, and the first prize in CAS S&T; Progress Award four times. In 1998, she was given the Henry Fok Achievement Award. In the political field, she was selected as a deputy to the National People's Congressand as a member of its Standing Committee.  Early life  Lin was born in Putian City, Fujian Province, in southern China. Lin Lanying was the first child born into a large and prestigious family, which could be traced back to the Ming dynasty 600 years before. Her sisters became child brides or were killed. Before she was six years old, Lanying was required to wash clothes and cook for the whole family. Her ancestor Lin Run was an imperial censor during the Ming Dynasty. This was an official position that controlled and supervised other government officials. During his career he faced two influential persons who challenged state authority. By helping the emperor deal with these two challengers, the emperor gave him money to build a house in Putian, which is now called the Old House of Lin Run. Lin were all born and raised in this house.  Education  At age six, she wanted to go to school rather than housework and chatting with other women all day. The only escape was via education. Her mother was deeply influenced by Chinese social gender norms and forbid her to get an education. Lin locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat unless she was allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, and finally allowed her to attend Liqing primary school. Lin often got the best grade in her class, while she was required to do all the washing and cooking. Then came studying that often kept her up to 12 AM. She got up to cook and then went to school. Her habit of sleeping six hours continued throughout her life. She fought a similar battle to continue to Liqing middle school. Her mother said that as a female, literacy did not matter. She convinced her mother that if she did not need money to study, she could go. This middle school provided scholarships for students who got the three best grades each semester. Lin earned her scholarship every semester. After finishing middle school, she enrolled in Putian high school. Her mother finally accepted her studies because of her success in middle school. However, Lin stayed in this school for only one year. Japan started war with China and killed many Chinese. A lot of the students became angry and held many parades to boycott Japan. Many Japanese soldiers and agents were in China, so the parades were suppressed and some students were killed. Lin transferred to a women‚Äôs school called Hami Lton School. One of her teachers came from American and could not speak Chinese very well, so many of her classmates could not understand his courses. Lin helped the teacher as an assistant. When the teacher taught something in English, Lanying Lin would translate. Because of this, she was called ‚Äòlittle teacher‚Äô. She continued her study at Fukien Christian University, a top university at that time in China. She graduated at age 22 with a bachelor's degree in Physics as one of the best in her class. She worked at the university for 8 years, four years as an assistant to teach some fundamental courses such as mechanics. Her first book was Course for Experiments in Optics and earned certification as a professor.  Education in America  Fukien Christian University had exchange programs with New York University at that time and many teachers who worked more than 2 years could study abroad. However, because she was not a Christian, she was excluded. So she applied to attend Dickinson College and earned a full scholarship and another bachelor's degree in mathematics with the help of her workmate Lairong Li in 1931. She then studied solid state physics at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1955, she received a doctorate degree there in solid-state physics and became the first Chinese national in a hundred years to earn a doctorate degree there. She thought that compared with math, physics was more applicable and more useful for China.  Career   America  Lanying wanted to return to China after graduation. However, the Chinese political situation was not good. At that time, America had many opportunities for scientists and including international students. Many Chinese students were not allowed to repatriate. Through the recommendation of her professor at the University of Pennsylvania, she decided to work as a senior engineer at the Sylvania Company which mainly manufactured semiconductors. At that time, the company had failed several times in making mono-crystalline silicon. Lanying discovered the problems and helped the company successfully engineer the silicon technology.  China  After Lin had worked in America for a year, China signed a treaty during the Geneva Conference in 1956 that covered international students. On 6 January 1957, Lin returned to China after eight years. Just before she boarded, the Federal Bureau of Investigation approached her and threatened to withhold her earnings for the year of US$6,800, to persuade her to stay. Lin accepted this and boarded the ship. Her family stayed poor because her salary was only 207 RMB, or 20 dollars a month. Her workplace had little money. However, she never gave up. In 1957, her workplace-Institute of Semiconductor CAS‚Äîfinished making the first mono- crystalline germanium in China. By virtue of her experience in Sylvania Company, she knew the processes for making mono-crystalline silicon. However, she could not get equipment because of embargoes from other countries. She changed the process and made China's first mono-crystalline silicon in 1958. China became the third country to make mono-crystalline silicon. In 1962, she designed the mono-crystal furnace. This furnace was licensed to many countries. In the same year, she made the first mono-crystalline gallium arsenide in China. Lin‚Äôs gallium arsenide achieved the highest mobility until that time. The Cultural Revolution intervened. From 1966-1976, billions of people in China suffered from it. All educators and scientists were suppressed. Lin was not allowed to do research and had to stay in her room under the monitoring of authorities. Lin‚Äôs educator father died during an assaulted by young people. Despite the tragedy, she worked at age 60 after the Cultural Revolution. She found that the dislocation density of existing gallium arsenide was large due to gravity and not good enough to use, so she decided to make the experiment in artificial satellites. This was a dangerous experiment because the melting point of gallium arsenide is 1,238 Celsius degrees. However, she finished successfully and became the world's first to do so. Because of this work in gallium arsenide, the Chinese government named a gallium arsenide company(Chinese: ‰∏≠ÁßëÁ®ºËã±) after her in 2001. At age 78, in 1996, she was diagnosed with cancer. She had been working on building the semiconductor base in the southern part of China. When she was diagnosed, she asked, ‚ÄúCan someone give me another ten years? In ten years, I can definitely finish what I am doing and I can die with no regrets!‚Äù She wanted those years to offset the ten years lost to the Cultural Revolution. At 1:00 p.m. on March 4, 2003, she died.  Opinions about gender issues  Throughout her life, she faced difficulties as a female. After she returned from the US, she joined the All-China Women's Federation. She held a lot of conferences and talked about gender issues. As a woman, she never accepted gender roles and always fought for herself. She believed that in the science field, women and men are equal and that the reason why fewer women are in this field is that women are more easily distracted by e.g., gossip, so women have to memorize more unrelated things and cannot focus on work.  Personal relationships   Family members  Her family included more than 20 people. Her mother and father influenced her most. Her father Jianhua Li was an educator. As a youth he moved far from home and studied at the university. Although he did not stay with Lanying, he often wrote letters to her and bought some books for her. Jianhua led Lanying into studying. Lanying‚Äôs mother was Shuixian Zhou, who was a tough woman because she had to manage the whole family. Lanying learned from her and became persistent. Although Shuixian was deeply influenced by traditional gender roles, she helped Lanying to be a persistent person, so Lanying could conquer many difficulties in her life. Lanying had two brothers. After she came back from America, she helped raise two nieces because she had no child of her own.  Qichang Guan and Cheng Lin  Lin did not marry, but she loved two men. The first was Qichang Guan. Lanying and Qichang were in different classes of the same middle school. After graduation Qichang went to another city with his parents, so they separated. But they continued their relationship by mail. Qichang told Lanying that he wanted to marry her and work as teachers in a middle school. However, Lanying was more ambitious. They gradually stopped writing to each other. At the age of 17, Qichang died due to leukemia. She also loved Cheng Lin. They met at Fukien Christian University. They had the same interests and both were ambitious. After graduation, they both stayed at this university and worked as teachers. However, because Lanying wanted to learn more things and decided to go to America, they separated. Cheng Lin married after Lin went to America. Their story has been told in the novel The Second Handshake.

period the Kingdom of Iberia (Kartli, eastern Georgia) was under the suzerainty of the Sasanian Empire. The period includes when it was ruled by Marzbans (governors) appointed by the Sasanid Iranian king, and later through the Principality of Iberia. History The Georgian kingdoms were contested between the Sasanids and the neighboring rivalling Roman-Byzantine Empire ever since the 3rd century. Over the span of the next hundreds of years, both the Byzantines and the Sasanids managed to establish hegemony over these regions. At the few remaining times, the Georgian kings managed to retain their autonomy. Sasanian governance was established for the first time early on in the Sasanian era, during the reign of king Shapur I (r. 240-270). In 284, the Sasanians secured the Iberian throne for an Iranian prince from the House of Mihran, subsequently known by his dynastic name Mirian III.Lenski, Noel. (2003) Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D. University of California Press. \\"(...) they successfully asserted their claim by crowning a Persian dynast named Mirian III. Mirian, founder of the Mihranid dynasty, which ruled Iberia into the sixth century (...)\\" Mirian III became thus the first head of this branch of the Mihranid family in the Kingdom of Iberia, known as the Chosroid dynasty (otherwise known as the Iberian Mihranids, or Mihranids of Iberia), whose members would rule Iberia into the sixth century.Lenski, Noel. (2003) Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D. University of California Press. \\"(...) they successfully asserted their claim by crowning a Persian dynast named Mirian III. Mirian, founder of the Mihranid dynasty, which ruled Iberia into the sixth century (...)\\" In 363, Sasanian suzerainty was restored by king Shapur II (r. 309-379) when he invaded Iberia and installed Aspacures II as his vassal on the Iberian throne. The continuing rivalry between Byzantium and Sasanian Persia for supremacy in the Caucasus, and the unsuccessful insurrection (523) of the Georgians under Gurgen had severe consequences for the country. Thereafter, the king of Iberia had only nominal power, while the country was effectively ruled by the Persians. By the time of Vezhan Buzmihr's tenure as marzban of Iberia, the hagiographies of the period implied that the \\"kings\\" in Tbilisi had only the status of mamasakhlisi, which means \\"head of the (royal) house\\". When Bakur III died in 580, the Sassanid government of Persia under Hormizd IV (578-590) seized on the opportunity to abolish the Iberian monarchy. Iberia became a Persian province, administrated through its direct rule by appointed marzbans, which in fact was, as Prof. Donald Rayfield states; \\"a de jure continuation of de facto abolition of Iberian kingship since the 520s\\". The Iberian nobles acquiesced to this change without resistance, while the heirs of the royal house withdrew to their highland fortresses ‚Äì the main Chosroid line in Kakheti, and the younger Guaramid branch in Klarjeti and Javakheti. However, the direct Persian control brought about heavy taxation and an energetic promotion of Zoroastrianism in a largely Christian country. Therefore, when the Eastern Roman emperor Maurice embarked upon a military campaign against Persia in 582, the Iberian nobles requested that he helped restore the monarchy. Maurice did respond, and, in 588, sent his prot√©g√©, Guaram I of the Guaramids, as a new ruler to Iberia. However, Guaram was not crowned as king, but recognized as a presiding prince and bestowed with the Eastern Roman title of curopalates. The Byzantine-Sassanid treaty of 591 confirmed this new rearrangement, but left Iberia divided into Roman- and Sassanid-dominated parts at the town of Tbilisi. Mtskheta came to be under Byzantine control. Guaram's successor, the second presiding prince Stephen I (Stephanoz I), reoriented his politics towards Persia in a quest to reunite a divided Iberia, a goal he seems to have accomplished, but this cost him his life when the Byzantine emperor Heraclius attacked Tbilisi in 626, during the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628, marking the definite Byzantine predominance in most of Georgia by 627-628 at the expense of the Sasanids until the Muslim conquest of Persia.

It was then added as a contributing property in the Heritage Hill Historic District in 1982. History The Burlington Public Library traces its origin to a subscription library that was created in two rooms located in city hall in 1868. It was established by US Senator James Wilson Grimes who contributed $5,000 of his own money to the effort. Local philanthropist Philip M. Crapo suggested that a new library building be constructed. He offered $20,000 of his own money for the project if the city council matched his gift, which they did. with Crapo also provided the funds for many of the furnishings in the building as well. Boston architect T.S. Hoyt designed the building in the Gothic Revival style. The builder, J. C. Sutherland, modified the plans and it was constructed in more of a Renaissance Revival style from 1896 to 1898. The total cost of the project was $55,000. The ground was broken for the present library building in October 2004. Funding for the project came from the Friends of the Burlington Public Library Foundation, private contributions raised by a capital campaign, the city of Burlington, a Vision Iowa Grant, and Des Moines County. It was opened for the first time on November 13, 2006. The library won the Main Street Iowa Award for the Best Community Initiated Development Project in 2007. The library is heated and cooled by a geothermal system that is fed by 132 wells under the parking lot. The old library building became the home of the Des Moines County Historical Society museum.

She and her colleagues maintain the world's largest collection of \\"cognitively normal\\" brains (numbering 125 as of 2006) at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. Research Albert Einstein's brain The lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure) in a normal brain. In Einstein's brain, this was truncated. Witelson came into possession of three portions of Albert Einstein's brain after being contacted by Dr. Thomas Stoltz Harvey, the pathologist at the hospital where Einstein died. In 1955, he took the brain and, after preserving, photographing, and creating slides from it, gave out limited portions for research. Years later, after hearing of Witelson's brain bank, he sent her a fax asking if she would like to study it, and she told him yes. Her analysis, with a credit to Harvey as well as her research assistant, was published in a 1999 paper titled \\"The exceptional brain of Albert Einstein\\". In it, she stated that the brain had a 15% wider inferior parietal region as well as a shorter than normal lateral sulcus. As the parietal lobe is the center for visuospatial perception and navigation, and the shorter sulcus would have allowed more of the area to be physically connected, she proposed that this may have allowed Einstein higher functionality in this area. Anatomical asymmetry In 1973, she investigated anatomical asymmetry in newborns' brains. Witelson found that anatomical and functional asymmetry of the brain is present at birth. Differences between males and females Witelson published a paper in 1976 detailing how the brains of six-year-old boys use a single hemisphere when reading, whereas girls use both sides of the brain while performing the same task. She also found that female brains had a thicker corpus callosum - the bridge between hemispheres - and that the thickness was in the region of linguistic skills. A different study showed that women have more brain cells than men in the language region. She also noted that the amygdala, which becomes more active in times of negative stress, signals more strongly to areas controlling motor skills in men, whereas in women, it signals more to the hypothalamus, which controls internal functions such as breathing and heart rate. Witelson conducted a study testing intelligence relative to brain size in 100 neurologically normal, but terminally ill, volunteers who agreed to have their brains measured after they died, and took extensive personal data on them. Her findings were that, overall, larger brains fared better. Brain size decreased with age in men over the age span of 25 to 80 years, but for unknown reasons, age minimally affected brain size in the women. Verbal and spatial intelligence in women was connected with brain size, but in men, verbal intelligence was better for right-handers only, most likely due to the brain's asymmetry. Spatial ability in men was unchanged relative to brain size. Sexual orientation In yet another study, Witelson found that the corpus callosum was thicker in homosexual men than in heterosexual men. Although that structure, as well as the amygdala, are formed early, indicating a possible genetic component to homosexuality, she said causality cannot be assumed and still needs to be investigated. Personal life Witelson was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec and resides in Hamilton, Ontario. She is currently a professor in the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Neurosciences, at McMaster University's Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine. She received her PhD at McGill University.

Reserves of metals like cobalt, copper, gold, iron ore, nickel, niobium, platinum-group metals, silver, tantalum, and zinc are awaiting exploration. Industrial minerals with identified reserves include black sands with ilmenite, monazite, rutile, and zirconium, celestine, clays, dimension stone, dolomite, feldspar, fluorite, gypsum, limestone, magnesite, perlite, pure limestone, quartz, salt, sandstone, scoria, talc, and zeolites; some of these are under exploitation. Crude oil and natural gas reserves amounted to 3.0 billion barrels and 479 billion cubic meters. The slow progress in the mineral sector is on account of the security situation caused by civil strife and political uncertainty in the country which has been a deterrent for private companies to operate. As of 2010 the mineral industry's contribution to the country‚Äôs GDP was 13.9%. History Mining for gold by Sabaeans, which is now Yemen, is ancient history when a large number of gold mines existed. It is said that many of their palaces and temples were decorated with doors, ceilings and walls with gold, silver and gemstones. These old mines exist. In recent explorations carried out by the Geological Survey & Mineral Resources Board and Foreign Companies some of these mines have been identified. Production and impact Salt pits in Socotra, Yemen The Sana'a and Thammar Provinces had 819 active mining sites, as of 2013, and produced 2 million tons of building materials and 1,000 tons of some industrial minerals. In the fossil fuel sector, out of 105 concession blocks awarded, 13 blocks were exploited as of 2013. Export of petroleum accounted for 25% of the GDP growth providing revenue worth 70% to the government in 2011. Stone, gypsum, refined petroleum products, and salt have been produced during 2013. Also, in 2013, natural gas production, mostly exported as LNG, was of the order of 10.3 billion cubic meters. Legal framework Earlier legal framework in mining sector consisted of basically the Mines & Quarries Law (No. 24 of 2002), Executive Regulations (Prime Minister‚Äôs Decree No. 101 of 2007) and the Financial Regulations (Prime Minister‚Äôs Decree No. 101 of 2007), which have been strengthened with new laws. Mineral exploration and production operations are defined now by Mines and Quarries Law No. 22 of 2010 under Article 8 of Yemen‚Äôs Constitution. This law, which was initially approved by the Government in 2010, received consent of the Parliament on 16 December 2011. The law provides for regulations related to prospecting, exploration, and mining operations including artisanal mining. Provisions in the law include royalty rates, income tax, limits on prospecting permits, and quarrying permits. The Ministry of Mines, through its Yemen Geological Survey and Mineral Resources Board (YGSMRB), is responsible for mineral production. Commodities Cobalt, copper, nickel reserves are found in three locations in the Al Masna‚Äôa, the Suwar, and the Wadi Qutabah in northeastern Yemen. Gold and silver have been identified in 40 locations and their extraction is now awaiting proposals under foreign investment; Al Hariqah gold deposit in northwest of Sana‚Äôa is a significant resource. Gold deposits exist in the Medden area, which is said to be the largest with a reserve of 678,000 tons where the average yield of 15 grams of gold and 11 grams of silver are estimated. Nine locations have been identified for mining of iron oxide, pigments and titanium; these are in the Mkiras region and in Um Halwal (Majil). The Jabali zinc and silver mine, to the northeast of Sana'a, has reserves of 12.6 million tons of oxide resources, though awarded for extraction, was under hibernation.

Early life McDonald was born in Wellington on 18 April 1952, the daughter of Joan Margaret McDonald (n√©e Legg) and James Joseph McDonald, and educated at Erskine College. Acting career Beginning her professional acting career on stage and radio as a teenager, first appearing at Wellington's Downstage Theatre in 1967. McDonald made her New Zealand television debut in 1971 in an episode of the drama series Pukemanu. She then spent five years in London, where her television appearances included small parts in programmes including Harriet's Back in Town, Angels and The Nine Tailors, and the lead in the television play Sweeping Plains. She also appeared in the production of Don's Party at the Royal Court Theatre in 1975. Following her return to New Zealand in 1976, McDonald played the role of Shirley Paget in the television soap opera Close to Home. She also played Beryl in the original television adaptation of Roger Hall's play Glide Time. From the late 1970s McDonald's best-known character, \\"Lyn of Tawa\\", was seen on New Zealand television in her own series (the theme song to which was a remake of the instrumental tune \\"The Happy Organ\\"), as well as in a monologue during the 1981 Royal Variety Performance at the St James Theatre, Auckland. Lyn reappeared in the 1990s in In Search of the Great New Zealand Male and Visual Symphonies. In 1979, McDonald portrayed cheerful mother-to-be Sandra Allenby opposite Stephen Tozer in the tele-movie It's Your Child. She played the title character in the 1983 television drama Pioneer Women ‚Äì Hera Ngoungou. In 1989 she appeared as Lady Guinevere Galaxy in the children's sci- fi television series Space Knights. During the 1990s, McDonald's acting credits included Dead Certs (1995) alongside Rawiri Paratene, Face Value ‚Äì Her New Life (1995)‚Äîwhich she also produced‚Äîand Duggan (1999). She also presented the New Zealand version of the garden makeover show Ground Force from 1998 to 1999. She played June Ramsay in the 1997 production of Anthony McCarten's play Four Cities at Circa Theatre in Wellington.

She also played the role of a marriage celebrant in the 2009 New Zealand movie Separation City. Her daughter Kate McGill is also an actress. \\"Lyn of Tawa\\" McDonald's alter ego, \\"Lyn of Tawa\\", first appeared onstage as a result of a backstage encounter between McDonald and playwright Bruce Mason in the late 1960s, in which Mason heard McDonald experiment with various accents. McDonald subsequently created \\"Lyn of Tawa\\" and, together with Mason and Roger Hall, wrote a series of sketches featuring the character for the revue show Knickers. It was, however, after McDonald's return from London that Lyn really came to prominence, following her appearance at a celebrity roast for Judith Fyfe, which led to spots on variety shows, then one-off special and culminated in her own series. She said in 2016 that she would let go of Lyn of Tawa to take on older roles. Career as producer and director McDonald made her debut as a television director and producer on the final series of Gliding On. She also directed episodes of Close to Home, Open House and Country GP. McDonald produced the award-winning kidult television series The Fire-Raiser, written by Maurice Gee, and was the creator and producer of the 1987 series Peppermint Twist. She also produced another series written by Maurice Gee, The Champion, in 1989. Other programmes produced by McDonald include the television adaptations of the 1997 play Nga Wahine by Riwia Brown, and Joyful and Triumphant by Robert Lord. Honours and awards In 1970 McDonald won the Hollywood Bowl radio award for best voice commercial. She was twice named best actress at the Feltex Awards, in 1980 and 1984, for her roles in Pioneer Women and It's Your Child, respectively.

Begun by Major Donald Nichols as an impromptu extension of his pre-Korean War espionage in 1950, it was first dubbed \\"Special Activities Unit Number One\\". In April or May 1951, it officially became the 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron. The 6004th was an unorthodox unit that engaged in espionage and aircrew escape and evasion, as well as collecting information. It was Far East Air Force's primary supplier of intelligence for the war, generating as many as 900 reports per month. Preceding activities The origin of the 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron lies in the confusion following the start of the Korean War on 25 June 1950. When the North Koreans invaded South Korea, the United States Air Force had no military intelligence units. To fill the need for what he deemed \\"positive intelligence\\", Chief Warrant Officer (later Major) Donald Nichols improvised spy and espionage operations within the agent net he had formed prewar.Haas (2002), pp. 54‚Äì55, 58. In July 1950, Nichols set up an impromptu parachute training course so espionage agents could be dropped behind the communist enemy's front lines. Some of them would shortly thereafter parachute behind North Korean lines to rescue the crew of a downed B-29 Superfortress. Forty-eight others would form the 13 spy teams dropped behind enemy lines during this time; they spotted and reported rear area targets for the Air Force.Haas (2002), p. 56. Although the 6004th could draw upon air assets from the 581st Air Supply and Communications Wing or the Special Air Missions Detachment of the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron for infiltrating agents into North Korea's interior, exfiltration was by foot. This drawback would be addressed by beginning seaborne infiltrations via the 22nd Crash Rescue Boat Squadron, or scrounged fishing boats. Numerous islands lying just off the North Korean coast sheltered UN-backed guerrillas and offered sanctuary to seaborne infiltration missions, as well as refuge for downed UN pilots. The North Korean lines of communication running down either peninsular coast were tempting targets for sabotage. The North Koreans sometimes raided the islands, and were even known to wipe out guerrillas they found, but to no avail.Haas (2000), pp. 87‚Äì88.Haas (2002), pp. 62‚Äì64. In March 1951, the Air Force decided to gather Nichol's ad hoc activities into \\"Special Activities Unit Number One\\". The new unit was envisioned as consisting of three detachments reporting to Fifth Air Force headquarters:Schuetta, p. 73. * Detachment 1: To gather technical military intelligence concerning operations of enemy forces, and to conduct Prisoner of War interrogations. * Detachment 2: To provide an \\"unusual\\" Top Secret effort to gather and distribute intelligence. * Detachment 3: Tasked with developing an escape and evasion program to recover downed UN aircrew members from behind communist lines. Haas (2000), p. 84. Detachment 1 already existed under Nichols. Detachments 2 and 3 would be founded a bit later.Haas (2000), pp. 85, 89‚Äì90. Foundation and operations The new unit was directed to coordinate activities with other intelligence agencies such as Combined Command Reconnaissance Activities, Korea. It was the first covert intelligence unit in the Air Force. Given Nicols' bent for \\"positive intelligence\\" the proactive unorthodox new squadron contained commandos, scholars, linguists, spies, and saboteurs along with its intelligence specialists.Haas (2002), pp. 55‚Äì56, 58, 63.Haas (2000), p. 84, 87, 89‚Äì90. It evolved into the 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron on 19 May 1951.Scheutta, p. 75. On 17 April 1951, a technical team of five led by commanding officer Donald Nichols staged a daring raid into the enemy's rear to gather aeronautical specifications and some gear from a crashed MiG-15. This supplied the Air Force with its first data on the advanced swept-wing fighter that threatened UN air supremacy.Haas (2000), pp. 82‚Äì83. On 1 June 1951, in violation of their mandated operational role, Detachment 1 of the 6004th was ordered to drop 15 saboteurs behind enemy lines to destroy a pair of railroad bridges. The entire team was captured by Chinese communist volunteers. After this failure, Detachment 1 was left to its required tasks of standard intelligence operations and prisoner of war interrogations.Haas (2000), pp. 84‚Äì85. On 25 July 1951, the new squadron was divided into two equal detachments.Schuetta, pp. 77‚Äì78. Nichols founded Detachment 2, with an American strength of seven officers and 26 enlisted. Its brief was to infiltrate behind communist lines and personally reconnoiter for air strike targets. Given the impossibility of Caucasians remaining undetected in the Asian populace of communist rear areas, there was a minimal need for Americans in this U.S. Air Force detachment. However, now that the fighting had settled into trench warfare, the communists began increasing security in their rear areas. Also in July 1951, the squadron actually managed to retrieve a crashed MiG-15 from behind enemy lines. The communist jet fighter had splashed onto mud flats behind enemy lines, northwest of Pyongyang. Backed by a small UN fleet, including LSU-960 which mounted a crane, the MiG was plucked from its muddy bower. British and American fighters supplied air cover for the event.Warnock, p. 48. In January 1952, after repeated requests, a confidential fund of 30,000,000 won per month was established for the squadron's intelligence needs.Schuetta, p. 169. By this time, Americans made up only 5.7% of the detachment's 665 personnel.Haas (2000), p. 85. Korean civilians made up 72.3% of the detachment's strength, with the remainder being Korean Air Force troops.Schuetta, p. 79. By July 1952, the American head count totaled 58; the other 900 members of the Detachment were Korean. By this time, the squadron had 23 espionage teams working in the communist rear areas, increasing the difficulty of the squadron's tasks. A typical team would have one American adviser to the Korean commanding officer. One difficulty of this position carrying an officer's responsibilities was that it was often filled by an enlisted airman. One unusual difficulty was that the agents on the teams would rather fight than spy after insertion.Haas (2000), pp. 85‚Äì86.Haas (2002), pp. 58‚Äì60.Schuetta, p. 100. By the spring of 1952, the 6004th was heavily involved in supporting the South Korean guerrilla forces dispersed on offshore islands off both coasts of North Korea. Major Nichols requested 14 boats of varying sizes be supplied to the unit. The squadron became desperate enough for watercraft that an officer was tasked with finding sunken vessels to salvage for the unit's use.Schuetta, pp. 170‚Äì173. On 10 July 1952, Fifth Air Force activated its Air Targets Division. The 6004th would be the primary contributor to the target data base. The squadron was generating 600 to 900 intelligence reports per month.Futrell, p. 502. By August 1952, Detachment 2 had five shallow water Korean fishing boats operational among the North Korean offshore islands.Haas (2002), p. 62. It was a prescient move, as by the end of 1952, airborne insertions had become virtual suicide missions.Haas (2000), pp. 100 ‚Äì 101. By that time, the Detachment 2 fleet had swelled to 30 vessels of all sizes and purposes.Haas (2000), pp. 87‚Äì88. By now, it included three Japanese fishing boats acquired through military channels, as well as the salvaged and scrounged craft. On 6 August, Detachment 3 was activated. Detachment 3 formed an escape and evasion (E&E;) network. They experimented with flying pickups of agents by Douglas C-47s a la the McGuire rig. However, Detachment 3's effort was hampered by lack of radios with the Air Force's aircraft emergency frequency and bureaucratically blocked by the CIA's primacy in E&E.;Haas (2002), p. 63.Haas (2000), pp. 89‚Äì90.Warnock, p. 72. In the latter part of 1952, the squadron's mission had stabilized enough that official courses in interrogation, intelligence gathering, and parachute usage were established. One of the causes for the late start in schooling were the casualties suffered increasingly often among infiltrated agents. However, by year's end, there were 32 espionage teams operating in North Korea. After the armistice In September 1953, after the fighting ceased, the 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron was dubbed the \\"primary [military intelligence] collection agency of FEAF [Far East Air Force]\\". It had grown into such an effective unit, FEAF had to ward off power grabs when the CIA's Joint Activities Commission Korea and Combined Command Reconnaissance Activities, Korea tried to shanghai it. However, by the time the armistice came into effect, the 6004th's input was greatly diminished by ever increasing agent casualties.Haas (2000), p. 86. Endnotes References * Futrell, Robert F. (2000).

Nielson is a former member of The Mint Chicks, a band he started with his brother Kody Nielson, Paul Roper, and Michael Logie. The four members met at Orewa College in Orewa, New Zealand, although the band started moving between Portland, Oregon and Auckland. The band broke up following Ruban's departure. Biography Early life Nielson was born in Darwin, Australia on February 20, 1980. His mother is an American hula dancer from Hawaii and his father is Maori New Zealand trumpet player Chris Nielson who has played in NZ bands such as Kora. The two met on tour. The Mint Chicks (2001‚Äì10) Ruban Nielson and his brother Kody Nielson formed the band in high school in 2001, and began by playing punk house parties and low profile shows before being discovered by acclaimed New Zealand independent record label Flying Nun Records. They released two EPs and three albums under the Flying Nun Records banner: Octagon, Octagon, Octagon EP (2003), Anti-Tiger EP (2004), Fuck the Golden Youth (2005), Crazy? Yes! Dumb? No! (2006) and Screens (2009), as well as one EP on a minor label, Bad Buzz (2010). All were produced and recorded by the band's core members Ruban and Kody Nielson, with the exception of Crazy? Yes! Dumb? No! which was produced by the Nielson brothers and their father Chris Nielson at two different home studios. All four original band members met at Orewa College in Orewa, New Zealand, although the band starting moving between Portland, Oregon and Auckland, as the Nielson brothers have dual citizenship in New Zealand and the U.S. In 2006, the band played support for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The volume of the show was reportedly so loud that part of the St James theater complex fell down, injuring two concert goers. They have also played support slots for The White Stripes, Death From Above 1979, TV on the Radio, The Blood Brothers, The Black Lips, and The Bronx. They were also part of the New Zealand line-up for Big Day Out 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009. In 2005, it was notable that Kody Nielson wielded a chainsaw on stage and destroyed a corporate sponsor's overly prominent sign with it. At the 2007 New Zealand Music Awards the band won five Tui awards including best rock group, best album, best rock album as well as winning best album cover and best music video for the single \\"Crazy? Yes! Dumb? No!\\". On 24 October 2007, it was announced on the band's website that their bassist Michael Logie would leave the band when they relocated to Portland. The group continued as a trio, with Logie relocating to London, England. The band played a free show in Portland on 29 June 2008, in which they played their then- upcoming third album from beginning to end live. The band later supported Shihad on the July 2008 Beautiful Machine Tour and tested their new songs in front of a home audience. As a result of their bass player having left the band, the Mint Chicks weren't able to play hits from earlier songs, angering some fans. To counter this Shihad's bass player, Karl Kippenberger, filled in for several more popular songs. On 25 December 2008, The Mint Chicks released the Mintunes EP consisting of \\"8-bit versions\\" of both previously released songs and tracks from the upcoming album. The band also released an iTunes- only single during 2008, \\"Life Will Get Better Some Day\\", a teaser for the album \\"Screens\\", which was released in New Zealand on 16 March 2009 after having been recorded sporadically over the preceding two years. In October 2009 the Mint Chicks performed a rendition of Ray Columbus and the Invaders' classic hit She's a Mod at the New Zealand Music awards as a four-piece band, later released as a standalone single. Shortly afterwards on 16 October 2009, it was announced Michael Logie would be rejoining the band in a post on the band's Twitter. The band joined with New Zealand music website MusicHy.pe to promote their next record, the Bad Buzz EP, released in February 2010. Shortly after the release of the EP, the band played their final show on 12 March 2010. The show, originally a fundraiser for MusicHy.pe, ended in chaos after Kody Nielson destroyed the two drumkits and equipment, imploring the crowd to 'start your own fucking band'. Unknown Mortal Orchestra Inception and Unknown Mortal Orchestra (2010‚Äì2012) Nielson left The Mint Chicks in the beginning of 2010, citing a loss of interest in the group's music. Following an incident during one of the band's live performances and Nielson's subsequent departure, The Mint Chicks broke up. Nielson had already returned to Portland, Oregon, where he began working at a film production company as an illustrator. He quickly found himself wanting to write and record music again and began searching for \\"psychedelic records with lost tunes\\" for inspiration. Nielson had become very specific about what type of record he wanted to find for inspiration and, with that specificity, began making that record himself instead. Once he had finished writing and recording the first song, Nielson uploaded it anonymously on May 17, 2010 onto Bandcamp under the name \\"Ffunny Ffrends\\". Within a day, the song had received significant coverage from independent music blogs such as Pitchfork. Nielson maintained the band's anonymity as he was not sure what he wanted the band to be and did not want to \\"face up to Mint Chicks fans and to people who were looking forward to a new Mint Chicks record.\\" Nielson eventually claimed the track under the band name Unknown Mortal Orchestra. The band's debut self-titled album was released June 21, 2011 on Fat Possum Records. The album quickly received critical acclaim. Pitchfork gave the album an 8.1, describing that with \\"an expert use of space rare for such a lo-fi record, UMO manages a unique immersive and psychedelic quality without relying on the usual array of bong-ripping effects.\\"Cohen, Ian, (June 22, 2011). Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Pitchfork. Retrieved on December 7, 2012 In the spring of 2012, the band won the Taite Music Prize for the album. Although the nominated Unknown Mortal Orchestra did not win Best Alternative Album, Nielson took home the title of Best Male Artist at the 47th annual Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards. II (2012‚Äì2013) In September 2012, Unknown Mortal Orchestra announced that they had signed to Jagjaguwar and were working on their second full-length album. Unknown Mortal Orchestra's second album, II, was released on February 5, 2013.Young, Alex (November 28, 2012). Unknown Mortal Orchestra announces 2013 tour dates. Consequence of Sound. Retrieved on December 7, 2012 The first single from the album, entitled \\"Swim and Sleep (Like a Shark)\\", was first available as a 7\\" on their tour with Grizzly Bear. II has received widespread critical acclaim. In November 2013 it won Best Alternative Album at the New Zealand Music Awards. II was nominated for the Taite Music Prize 2014, an annual music prize awarded for the best album from New Zealand. Clash Music gave the album a 9 out of 10, saying \\"from opener 'From The Sun', which recalls George Harrison-psychedelia, to the tender Family Stone shuffle of the closing of 'Secret Xtians', 'II' displays both a glowing warmth in its production and a deft use of space that illuminate Nielson's superbly crafted compositions.\\" Paste Magazine called the album \\"a modern, beat-heavy take on '60s psych, with plenty of hooks and fuzz to get you hooked and feeling fuzzy.\\" NME praised Ruban's ability to turn his songs into \\"works of warm, fuzzy beauty.\\" During the winter of 2012, Unknown Mortal Orchestra capitalized on the success of II and embarked on a world tour. The tour started off with shows in Australia, and hometown shows in New Zealand, followed by several stops in Europe. The band then toured extensively throughout North America with opener Foxygen. In March 2013, Unknown Mortal Orchestra was named one of Fuse TV's 30 must-see artists at SXSW. Unknown Mortal Orchestra consistently sold out shows in both the UK/Europe and in North America, and as a result of their success on the road they announced in early April that they would extend their tour through the end of 2013. That summer the band performed at a number of major European festivals, including Roskilde Festival, Pukkelpop and Lowlands. On February 25, 2013, Unknown Mortal Orchestra made their American television debut, performing \\"So Good At Being In Trouble\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On October 29, 2013, the band released an EP titled Blue Record. It included three acoustic versions of songs taken from their previous album. Multi-Love (2015‚Äì2017) Ruban Nielson performing with Unknown Mortal Orchestra in Paris (2018) On February 5, 2015, the band announced their third studio album, Multi-Love. Soon after, they released the title track as the first single, which was designated \\"Best New Track\\" by Pitchfork.https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17321-unknown- mortal-orchestra-multi-love/ Multi-Love was released on May 26, 2015. It was well received by critics. Rolling Stone commented that \\"Multi-Love sees Nielson coloring outside the lines for a vibrant vision of connection\\" https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/unknown-mortal-orchestra- multi-love-20150724 and Pitchfork praised Nielson's ear for how something should sound and referred to the album as his \\"most accomplished\\".https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20590-unknown-mortal- orchestra-multi-love/ Singles \\"Multi-Love\\" and \\"Can't Keep Checking My Phone\\" were both A-listed at BBC's 6 Music.https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/e2305342-0bde-4a2c-aed0-4b88694834de Following the release, UMO embarked on a tour through the UK, Europe, the US and Canada, with many sold out dates. They are currently back touring in Europe through November, before heading to Australia and New Zealand for a string of headline shows in December.

It can be distinguished from Myoporum crassifolium, (the only other member of the genus to occur in New Caledonia) by its very thin leaves and its glabrous flowers. Description Myoporum tenuifolium is an erect shrub usually growing to a height of which has flattened branches. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are usually long, wide with a stalk about long. They are unusually thin, elliptic in shape and have a distinct mid-vein on the lower surface. The flowers are borne in groups of 1 to 4 in the axils of leaves on a flattened stalk long. The flowers have 5 triangular sepals and 5 petals, joined at their bases to form a bell-shaped tube. The petals are white and the tube is long with the lobes slightly shorter than the tube. The tube and its lobes are glabrous and there are 4 stamens which extend slightly beyond it. The fruit is a reddish to brown drupe that is oval shaped and about long. Taxonomy and naming Myoporum tenuifolium was first formally described in 1786 by Georg Forster in Florulae Insularum Australium Prodromus in 1810.

History From 1942 - 1957, U.S. Army infantry battalions consisted of a battalion headquarters and headquarters company (HHC), three rifle companies, and a heavy weapons company composed of machine gun and mortar platoons. With the implementation of the Pentomic organization, or Reorganization of the Current Infantry Division (ROCID) organization, regiments and battalions were eliminated, and divisions were composed of five battle groups. Each battle group consisted of an HHC, four rifle companies and a 4.2-inch mortar battery. Under Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE) 7-15D, dated 1 February 1960, the CSC made its first appearance in a U.S. Army infantry battalion. Because the original battle group HHC, with over 300 soldiers assigned, was too large for efficient command and control, the new CSC contained the radar section, and the reconnaissance, heavy mortar and assault weapons (antitank) platoons while the HHC retained the engineer platoon, supply and maintenance platoon, communications platoon and the staff sections.Wilson, John B.

Combat support companies were eliminated during the development of the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) structure in 1962, with battalions containing only an HHC and three rifle companies. But CSCs soon returned during the development of the airmobile division, with each airmobile infantry battalion containing an HHC, three rifle companies and a CSC with reconnaissance, mortar and antitank platoons. When the army began to expand for Vietnam with the organization of the 196th Infantry Brigade at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, the brigade's three infantry battalions were organized under a special \\"light\\" structure for counterinsurgency warfare. Like the airmobile infantry battalions, these battalions CSC had mortar, reconnaissance and antitank platoons. Although battalions deployed to Vietnam as infantry and airborne infantry (without CSCs) or light and airmobile infantry (with CSCs), U.S. Army, Vietnam reorganized 70 of its 72 non-mechanized infantry battalions under a modified TOE with an HHC, four rifle companies, and a CSC. In the early 1970s, CSCs were added to the infantry, mechanized infantry, and armor battalions, retaining a single company headquarters for reconnaissance, mortar, and antitank platoons, as well as air defense and ground surveillance radar sections. However, the Army of Excellence (AOE) organization implemented in the mid-1980s eliminated CSCs in favor of antiarmor companies, with the mortar and reconnaissance platoons returning to the battalion's HHC. The Army National Guard (ARNG) retained the older organization longer than the active army, but CSCs were eliminated from ARNG units by the mid-1990s.Pattison, Jack E. \\"The Combat Support Company--Rising from its Own Ashes.\\" 10 January 1989. Web. Accessed 27 November 2015. . Although eliminated from most standard organizations, a few unique organizations retained CSCs. When the 173rd Airborne Brigade reactivated in 2001, the 173rd CSC contained a sapper platoon, a light equipment platoon, a Stinger air defense platoon and a ground surveillance radar platoon.Walter, George F. \\"Operational Leadership Experiences: Interview with MAJ George Walter.\\" Combat Studies Institute. 28 February 2008.

He was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts in 1971. Personal life Kuhn Prayoon was born on 17 November 1915, the youngest of four children. As a three-year-old child, he began helping his parents peddle fruits and plu. When he was four, he was shamed when a teacher dressed him in rags and made him beg. This experience motivated him to get a good education to escape a life of poverty. The Chanyavongs family's fortunes changed because of their business involving authorized opium dens. Prayoon's father's death in 1923 caused financial problems and Prayoon had to transfer to a school with cheaper matriculation fees. He then attended a public secondary school which offered free tuition for students with perfect attendance record. His schooling was assured even though he contracted malaria thanks to his determination by bringing with him medicine and by requesting for rest hours from his teachers when his fever surged. It was also during this time that his passion for drawing was developed. To be able to buy foreign comic books, he resorted to skipping lunch. Career After finishing secondary school at the age of nineteen, Prayoon worked at a freight office for six months. He had wanted to work as a cartoonist but the job required an artist certificate. His big break came in 1934 when Dao Nakorn (Star of the City) published his work. After three years, he became a headline writer at the Prachamit (Friend of the People) and a year later, became a comic serial writer at the Supab Burut (Gentlemen). It was at this point when Sooklek was born. Characterized by a feather stuck on a band around his head, Sooklek became the vehicle through which Prayoon voiced his insights on politics and society. The comic figure won the hearts of Thai readers because of his sense of humor and for championing moral uprightness. Sooklek's popularity increased circulation of Supab Burut and in no time, Prayoon was earning a lot. In 1940, he ran for a seat in the Bangkok Municipal Council and won a three-year term but gave up politics after seeing how slowly things get done. During World War II, he joined the guerilla forces against the Japanese in Thailand. At this time, he helped a wounded British combat pilot find refuge among the Thai guerillas. Death and legacy In 1960, Prayoon won the first prize in International Cartoon for Peace Competition for this work entitled The Last Nuclear Test, showing the world exploding after being hit by a nuclear bomb. This work was created in 1956 as a reaction to the Cold War. Aside from political cartoons, Prayoon also created serial cartoons based on Thai folk tales for children. These became a hit among people in the provinces. Prayoon died of lymph gland cancer on December 3, 1992, leaving behind a volume of works which were turned over to the National Library of Thailand. His eyes and body were donated to an eye bank and a medical school respectively. At present, his son Sooklek and daughter Soodrak run the Prayoon Foundation to preserve their father's works. An animation studio has been set up to produce animation series starring the cartoon character Sooklek.

The house overlooks the neolithic site, Skara Brae, and the Bay of Skaill. In 1977, the house was included in the List of Scottish Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest.  History  Skaill House is situated near to the site of Skara Brae, and the lands were in use from neolithic times. Various finds from the Bronze- and Iron Ages show continuing use. The name Skaill derives from the Old Norse word for \\"hall\\". The names of all the surrounding farms are also derived from that language, and it is presumed that the lands have been permanently settled for over a thousand years. After the execution of Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney for treason in 1615, the lands were given to the Bishop of Orkney. In 1620, Bishop George Graham constructed a simple manor house, the first part of what is now Skaill House. His son became the laird of the estate, and the property was from that time passed down to succeeding lairds. Over the years, the building was expanded. In 1997, after six years of restoration work, Skaill House was opened to the public. It can be rented as a holiday home or for receptions and events.  Description  Skaill House, Orkney Skaill House is situated near the west coast of Mainland overlooking the Bay of Skaill and Skara Brae, and close to St Peter's Kirk. It is described by Historic Environment Scotland as the \\"most complete 17th century country mansion in Orkney\\". The oldest parts of the building surrounded three sides of a central courtyard, and were constructed in the early 17th century. The building is predominately two storeys, with some three storey sections, and is rendered with harl. Parts of the gables are crow-stepped. There is a stableyard with a brewhouse and harness room, to the north of the main buildings, and a dovecote dating to the 18th century beside the house. The south wing is partially built on an old, pre-Viking burial ground, thought to be Pictish.

Cobb, courtesy: University of Chicago Photographic Archive Silas Bowman Cobb (Montpelier, Vermont, January 23, 1812 - Chicago, April 5, 1900)Findagrave.com was an American industrialist and pioneer who made his fortune through business and real estate ventures primarily in Chicago, Illinois. Arriving in 1833, Cobb was one of Chicago's earliest settlers and later became one of its wealthiest businessmen and property owners as well as one of the city's largest benefactors. He is also noted for his principal contributions to the founding of the University of Chicago.  Chicago Pioneer  Cobb was born in 1812 in Montpelier, Vermont to farmer and tanner, Silas W. Cobb. His mother died when he was an infant. Due to his father's inconsistent and modest means, Cobb often had to forgo his education to support the family. It is said that this self-reliance led to his later success. In June 1833, he moved west to Chicago with very little money and began work at the then village's first hotel. At the time of his arrival, it is said that Chicago had only 250 residents. With his earnings, Cobb invested in stock and began to trade with local Native Americans. This provided the capital to start his first business venture, a harness shop, for which he walked 60 miles to obtain lumber that he carried back to Chicago via wagon. The business prospered and he sold it for a significant profit in 1848. He used the money to create a new boot and shoe business and flourished beyond his \\"fondest anticipations\\". With this new wealth Cobb invested early in Chicago real estate and became one of its wealthiest land owners. In 1840, Cobb married Maria Warren, daughter of fellow Chicago pioneer Daniel Warren. This cemented his place in high society by marrying into one of America's oldest families, descendants of Son of Liberty and Revolutionary War major general, Dr. Joseph Warren. Although known for his frugality and aversion to debt, Cobb was one of the original residents of Chicago's ostentatious \\"millionaire's row\\" on South Prairie Avenue with other notable Chicago residents such as department store mogul Marshall Field, railroad car manufacturer George Pullman, and his daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Griswold Coleman of Coleman Hardware Company.  Public Investment  Cobb has also been identified with semi-public enterprises. He made substantial investments in public utilities in Chicago and became a director of the Chicago Gas, Light and Coke Company. He was on the board of directors of two railroads, the Galena and Chicago Union and the Beloit and Madison, which were later combined to become the Chicago and Northwestern Railway. Cobb was also appointed the president of the Chicago City Railway Company and was responsible for introducing cable cars to the city. He was additionally a director of the former National Bank of Illinois.

A > noble building, the Cobb Lecture Hall, now stands on the University campus, > a monument of the builder's liberality and public spirit. - excerpted from > History of Chicago by John Moses Cobb was the earliest benefactor of the physical construction of the University of Chicago. While the original endowment for the university was funded by a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings. The university thus looked for donors who could secure Rockefeller's endowment by providing funds for the campus' physical facilities. Cobb provided the funds for the campus' first building, Cobb Lecture Hall, which included classrooms, a recitation hall, and a chapel. Constructed in 1892 at a cost of $222,000, it is the oldest and most expensive of the campus' original sixteen buildings. Members of Cobb's family were also major benefactors to the university's construction, including sister-in-law Mrs. Jerome Beecher, who funded Beecher Hall, and son-in-law George C. Walker, who funded the Walker Museum. References   Businesspeople from Chicago 1812 births 1900 deaths ","title":"Silas B. Cobb"},{"id":"48678149","text":"Lowekoti is a small village of Rohru town.

Early life Martin Scott was born in Bennington, Vermont on January 18, 1788. He was the son of Phineas Scott - one of the early settlers of Bennington. He was also a member of the Bennington organization the Sons of Liberty along with other local notables such as Hiram Harwood. He had a common school education and legendary skill as a marksman. He was known to drive nails with bullets and prided himself on being able to kill animals with shots to the head rather than to the body. He was barred from participating in turkey shoots (as his skill with a rifle gave him an unfair advantage) and was known to brag that once a raccoon surrendered to him in preference to being shot. Military career During the War of 1812, he was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in the 26th Infantry in April 1814. The next month he was promoted to 1st lieutenant. Soon after the war's conclusion, he was discharged in June 1815.Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army, 1789-1903. Francis B. Heitman. 1903. Vol. 1. pg. 869. In June 1818, he re-entered the Army as a 2nd lieutenant in the Regiment of Riflemen. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant in November 1819 and was transferred to the 5th Infantry in June 1821. He was promoted to captain in August 1828 and represented the U.S. Army at the signing of the Treaty of St. Peters between the United States and the Ojibwa tribes. The treaty ceded land in Minnesota and Wisconsin. When Scott was in command of Fort Mackinac in Michigan, he was described by an acquaintance said that he ‚Äúwas an interesting man, with strong, alert, athletic figure, bright, eager, keen grey eyes, and ruddy face, bronzed by long exposure. He was a great disciplinarian, and the fort was clean and orderly in the extreme.‚Äù Scott was unpopular with his fellow officers as he was perceived as being stingy (although Martin's frugality resulted from his spending most of his money to support his mother and sister back in Vermont). He was also viewed as being anti-social as he did not drink nor gamble. He once fought a duel in which both parties were wounded but survived. In 1840, he married Miss McCracken of Rochester, New York. Mexican-American War Scott saw active service during the Mexican-American war. In May 1846, he fought under Major General Zachary Taylor at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma and received a brevet (honorary promotion) to major. He was promoted to the full rank of major on June 29, 1846. He also received a brevet to the rank of lieutenant colonel for heroism at the Battle of Monterey on September 23, 1846. He was killed in action at the Battle of Molina del Rey on September 8, 1847. He is buried in the Old Bennington Cemetery at the First Congregational Church of Bennington in Old Bennington, Vermont, where his grave is marked with a marble obelisk. Legacy In December 1848, the Army established an outpost near Fredericksburg, Texas which was later named Fort Martin Scott. The fort was active until 1853 and is now a tourist attraction.

It was discovered by Martinus Beijerinck in 1901, and was the first aerobic, free-living nitrogen fixer discovered. A. chroococcum could be useful for nitrogen fixation in crops as a biofertilizer, fungicide, and nutrient indicator, and in bioremediation.  Characteristics  A. chroococcum is a microaerophilic plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGRP), which is bacillus in shape and is Gram negative. As a mesophile, this bacterium grows best in moderate-temperature soils and requires a neutral pH environment. It is able to fix nitrogen under aerobic conditions. The soil cannot be poor in phosphorus or else nitrogen fixing can be hindered. In addition to phosphorus, these bacteria needed potassium, \\"sulphur, magnesium, and calcium\\" to grow. To fix nitrogen A. chrococcum produces three enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) to \\"neutralise\\" reactive oxygen species. It also forms the dark-brown, water-soluble pigment melanin at high levels of metabolism during the fixation of nitrogen, which is thought to protect the nitrogenase system from oxygen. In the presence of some saccharides (such as sucrose and raffinose) while on agar plates, a levan ring can form around the A. chroococcum colony.  Uses  Research has been carried out into A. chroococcum's potential applications in improving crop production. At least one study has so far shown a significant increase in crop production linked to the production of \\"auxins, cytokinins, and GA‚Äìlike substances\\" by A. chroococcum. In addition to these biomolecules, this bacterium has been found to be able to produce \\"siderophores, ammonia, and ACC deaminase\\", as well as indoleacetic acid, which all are known to assist with the growth of crops. On top of helping with the growth of crops in general, A. chroococcum has also been shown to help crops grow in polluted soils. A. chroococcum is able to survive and improve the growth of crops in soils polluted with heavy metals when seeds are inoculated with the bacterium prior to planting. A. chroococcum not only produced growth-positive biomolecules and increased the number and quality of maize kernels, but also reduced the production of \\"proline, antioxidant enzymes, and MDA\\" in the plants, all which indicate of the presence of heavy metals in the soil. In addition to treating soils polluted with heavy metals, A. chroococcum can act as a fungicide that can be used to treat soils and plants inflicted with fungal infections, specifically fungi that are susceptible to \\"fungicidal substances of the anisomycin group\\". This bacterium can also be used to determine the nutrient composition of the soil. Since plants and A.chroccoccum both need phosphorus and potassium to grow, this bacterium can be used to determine if the soil is fit for crop growth, as it would thrive in soils that have these nutrients. A. chroococcum is also a possible asset for bioremediation. Melanin produced by this bacterium can bind to heavy metals, subsequently protecting A. chroococcum, which may be useful for removing heavy metals from polluted soils. Since this bacterium is able promote plant growth through nitrogen fixation, it can also reduce the amount of nitrogen that has to be added to fields, which can reduce the amount of nitrogen runoff. This effect of less nitrogen being added in soil was seen in a study involving cotton plants.

Bao's best known surviving work is his \\"Fu on the Ruined City\\" (W√∫ ch√©ng f√π ), a long fu rhapsody on the ruined city of Guangling. Life and career Bao Zhao, courtesy name Mingyuan (), was born around the year 414. Historical sources give contradictory information on his birthplace. He was probably born in the town of Jingkou (modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province), though sources variously say he was born in Shangdang (modern Zhangzi County, Shanxi Province) or Xuzhou (modern Tancheng County, Shandong Province). Bao's younger sister Bao Linghui was also a poet, with seven poems still extant. Little is known of Bao's early life. He was probably a farmer as a young man before beginning his career as an official on the staffs of local princes of the Liu Song dynasty. From about 438, Bao served as an attendant gentleman (sh√¨l√°ng ) to Liu Yiqing (), the prince of Linchuan. In the early 440s, Liu served as governor of Jiangzhou (roughly corresponding to modern Jiangxi and Fujian Provinces), and Bao writes that he traveled around the area of modern Jiujiang, writing poems on the mountain scenery around Mount Lu. After Liu Yiqing's death in 444, Bao briefly returned home to Jingkou, then in 445 joined the staff of Liu Jun (; 436463), another Liu Song prince, who was serving as governor of Yangzhou (modern Nanjing). Bao spent a number of years in Liu Jun's service, and accompanied him on his campaign to retaliate against the Xianbei-ruled Northern Wei dynasty, which had invaded southern China in January 451. Bao left Liu Jun's staff about 452, spending the next 12 years serving in various local governmental positions, as well as a stint in the imperial capital Jiankang (modern Nanjing) as a professor at the Imperial Academy. In 464, Bao joined the staff of the seven-year-old prince Liu Zixu (; 457466), who nominally served as governor of Jingzhou. In early 466, another Liu Song prince rebelled and declared himself Emperor, and Liu Zixu soon joined the rebellion, probably encouraged by his adult advisors. The rebellion was put down in the following months, and in September 466 imperial forces retook Jingzhou. Because the rebellion was organized by the prince's aides and administrators, and not the young prince himself, Bao was unable to escape punishment for his involvement. The nine-year-old Liu Zixu was forced to commit suicide, after which all of his staff members, including Bao, were executed. Works About 200 of Bao Zhao's poems survive. His works were initially gathered into a collection several decades after his death, but this collection seems to have been lost sometime during the Tang dynasty (618907). Eleven of Bao's poems are preserved in the early medieval anthology Selections of Refined Literature (Wen xuan ÊñáÈÅ∏). Bao's most famous piece is his \\"Fu on the Ruined City\\" (W√∫ ch√©ng f√π ), a moving fu rhapsody on the former capital, Guangling, which had been razed to the ground in the Northern Wei invasion of January 451. It gives an account of the ruined capital, contrasted with its former grandiosity, in a nostalgic and longing fashion that is common in Liu Song-era poetry. Another of Bao's surviving fu rhapsodies is \\"Fu on the Dancing Cranes\\" (W«î h√® f√π ËàûÈ∂¥Ë≥¶), which describes a troupe of trained performing cranes. Bao also composed shi poetry, and is best known for his use of the yuefu lyrical song genre. Bao is the first Chinese poet known to have composed shi poetry in the seven-syllable line format where, instead of the traditional AAAA rhyme scheme in which each line in a stanza rhymed, a more mixed rhyme scheme of ABCB was used.

It peaked in the lower reaches of the German and Austrian charts. It was nominated at the 2016 ARIA Music Awards for Best Adult Contemporary Album, but lost to Bernard Fanning for Civil Dusk. Details Scott Bromiley and Luke McDonald of the band The John Steel Singers played many instruments on the album and were also credited as co-producers. Forster had previously produced their debut album, Tangalooma. Forster said, \\"from very early on I wanted to work with Scott and Luke from The John Steel Singers. I had most of the album written by about 2010 or 2011, and I had them over to the house and I just said, 'Look, I'd love to work with you on the next album, and you take the songs where you want to take them. I'm not just having you over here to play bass and guitar ‚Äî go with it. Bring your sensibility into the songs and we can work together on them.'\\" It was also the first of Forster's album's to feature a strong contribution from his wife, Karin B√§umler, something they had wanted to do for some time. Forster was insistent that the recording be analogue. Forster claimed, \\"that was very, very important. I didn't want a screen. I wanted the musicians to play in a room and then come back inside and not stare at a screen. I wanted that atmosphere, I wanted that openness in the studio. And I like the sound of analogue as well.\\" The album was recorded at Wild Mountain Sound, about a half-hour drive from Forster's home. Forster said, \\"The recording budget was lower than anything I have ever done and I found that liberating. You find another way to work. I had the feeling, I can do whatever I want.\\" Twelve songs were recorded, with two omitted and intended for future release. Reception Songs to Play reached number 57 in the Austrian charts and 60 in Germany. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Songs to Play received an average score of 79, based on 11 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The Guardian said listeners should \\"imagine Reed narrating a Talking Heads album (it could be 77 or True Stories) and you‚Äôre getting close to the feeling of Songs To Play. For all its antecedents, though, Songs To Play is Robert Forster at his most singular. It's the sound of Forster starting anew, and the spring in his step is welcome.\\" An AllMusic review stated \\"these songs are direct and kinetic, full of hooks, rich in metaphors and irony, and a sleight- of-hand confessionalism. Though rock & roll riffs are in your face, the quirky pop spirit of the Go-Betweens is never far away.\\" The review noted the debt owed to The Velvet Underground, and also said, \\" these spirited, well-crafted songs offer rock & roll in a manner he's never even hinted at before.\\" PopMatters said it \\"needs to be acknowledged as an album from a unique songwriter who just so happened to catch his sound so damn well that it makes a strong case for Forster‚Äôs artistic life beyond the Go-Betweens.\\" Uncut called it \\"strikingly immediate, yet also rewarding repeated immersion. The 10 tracks here are, just as Forster intended, amusing, infectious and relaxed.\\" Luke Haines said, \\"The real joy of this album is the newness of it all. Robert sounds so agog with the possibilities that life has to offer that it‚Äôs as if he‚Äôs just discovered the sheer genius of the greatest art form of the modern age ‚Äî that‚Äôs rock & roll ‚Äî for the first time.

Course The source of Deep Creek is at an elevation of , at the head of Little Green Valley in the San Bernardino Mountains. It initially flows southwest, through the communities of Arrowbear and Running Springs, before turning north. It is joined by Hooks Creek from the west; a dam on Little Bear Creek, a tributary of Hooks Creek, forms Lake Arrowhead. A short distance downstream is Aztec Falls, a popular swimming area at a waterfall along Deep Creek. The creek continues north, at the bottom of a deep gorge through mountainous wilderness, receiving Holcomb Creek and Coxey Creek from the right before turning west, forming a canyon between the San Bernardino Mountains and Ord Mountains. The Deep Creek Hot Springs are located along the stream where it turns to the west. The Pacific Crest Trail follows the Deep Creek canyon for , from the confluence of Hooks Creek to the mouth. Deep Creek ends at its confluence with the West Fork Mojave River forming the Mojave River, at an elevation of . The confluence is located southeast of Hesperia, directly behind Mojave Forks Dam, a flood-control structure built in 1974. Drainage basin The Deep Creek drainage basin is in size. Most of the drainage basin is located in the San Bernardino National Forest. For most of its length it is a remote, swift-flowing mountain stream, with a riverbed characterized by \\"deep pools and boulder strewn reaches\\". Deep Creek derives most of its water from snowmelt in the winter and spring, and has very low flows in autumn. The creek is also prone to flash flooding in the summer due to monsoon storms. Deep Creek is one of the most ecologically diverse areas of the San Bernardino National Forest. At lower elevations, where the drainage approaches the Mojave Desert, the dominant vegetation type is chaparral, and creosote bush, chamise and California buckwheat are common. At middle elevations oak and pinyon-juniper woodland are common, with mixed conifer forests in the highest elevations. The endangered southwestern arroyo toad is found in the lower part of Deep Creek. The creek is designated a Wild Trout Stream by the state of California, and is home to populations of rainbow and brown trout.

The film is an experimental art film written and directed by Don Palathara, an International Film School Sydney diplomate. The film was shot entirely in black and white. Background Shavam is the brainchild of an Indian Australian who used to be a closely associated member of Kazcha Film Society. Don, an enthusiastic documentarian who had worked previously with Cinemavandi, re-discovered scope of art films from his international perspective. The director reveals that film aspects like the black and white picturization was to give the audience an opportunity to look at different parts of the screen at the same time, and methods such as color grading and the morbidity and lifelessness of the title was chosen for aesthetic aspects. The film's protagonist is the subject 'death' which lingers onto the body and slowly liberates the person with the final camera's upshot to heavens without complaints as a mere event. The first preview of the film was conducted by Cochin Film Society at Children's park theatre in Cochin, India. The film featured about forty actors.http://malayalam.filmibeat.com/interviews/an- exclusive-interview-with-don-palathara-the-director-savam-026196.html Plot Shavam's plot focuses on the unexpected death of an adult in a middle-class Christian family and the funeral process in home, where neighbors, relatives and friends of the dead person are gathered. The camera movement manipulates the viewer to look through the eyes of a curious unknown who goes around the nooks and corners of the house, and whose presence is equally neglected and acknowledged. The film presents insensitivity and actual prominence of the death and its emptiness reflect in current malayali worldview. Reception Media lists the film as an exposition of local culture in a satirical way. The ability of the director's stubbornness to clip-on its viewers to the narrative was well praised. The seminal film of the director has been an official selection to eight international film festivals and won the award for the best foreign film at Barni International Festival, Moscow.

It was initially administered by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) from 2012 to 2017, but is now managed by the University of the Philippines. History and services Project NOAH was a response to President Benigno Aquino III's call on a better disaster prevention and mitigation system in the Philippines in the aftermath of the destructive Tropical Storm Sendong in December 2011. It was publicly launched by President Aquino, project head Mahar Lagmay, and other government officials in Marikina on July 6, 2012. The program combines science and technology for disaster risk reduction and management. It is also a responsive program that aims to provide a 6-hour lead-time warning to agencies involved in disaster prevention and mitigation. The project also uses advanced technologies to enhance current geo-hazard vulnerability maps. It is also being developed with the help of the National Institute of Geological Sciences and the College of Engineering of the University of the Philippines; the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA); the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS); the Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI), and the Science and Technology Information Institute (STII). The project is now composed of twenty-one institutions from the local and private sectors, including media and telecommunication companies. The program involves seven major components described as follows: *Distribution of Hydrometeorological Devices in hard-hit areas in the Philippines (Hydromet) ‚Äì the installation of automated rain gauges and water level monitoring stations in major river basins and flood-prone areas. *Disaster Risk Exposure Assessment for Mitigation ‚Äì Light Detection and Ranging (DREAM-LIDAR) Project ‚Äì the development of accurate three-dimensional flood inundation and hazard maps for the country's flood-prone areas. *Enhancing Geohazards Mapping through LIDAR‚Äì the use of LIDAR technology and computer-assisted analyses to identify landslide-prone areas. *Coastal Hazards and Storm Surge Assessment and Mitigation (CHASSAM) ‚Äì to generate wave surge, wave refraction, and coastal circulation models to understand and recommend solutions for coastal erosion. *Flood Information Network (FloodNET) Project ‚Äì the building of a flood center to provide timely and accurate information for flood forecasts. *Local Development of Doppler Radar Systems (LaDDeRS) ‚Äì to develop local capacity to operate Doppler weather radar systems. *Landslide Sensors Development Project ‚Äì a low-cost, locally developed, sensor-based early monitoring and warning system for landslides, slope failures, and debris flow. *Weather Hazard Information Project (WHIP) ‚Äì the use of television and a web portal to display real-time weather data to help local governments and communities to prepare against natural hazards. The program has been dubbed as the country's flagship disaster prevention and mitigation program. In January 2017 however, the Philippine government announced that Project NOAH would be shut down effective March 1, citing the lack of funds; it was supposed to remain in operation until February 28, 2017 only. On February 23, 2017, the University of the Philippines decided to adopt Project NOAH and continue its operations upon the termination of its administration by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) on February 28. The last component completed before the end of its DOST-administered era was the Integrated Scenario-based Assessment of Impacts and Hazards (ISAIAH), which sought to translate hazards mapped by the project into municipal-level risk assessments that detail the level of exposure and vulnerability of a community. The component allowed citizens to contribute ground-level risk information through the use of OpenStreetMap. The component resulted to completion of 16 provinces mapped with 2.2 million structures added to the database. On June 20, 2017, the University of the Philippines relaunched the UP Resilience Institute with Project NOAH, now called NOAH Center, as its flagship program. Mobile application The official mobile version of project NOAH was launched by then-DOST Secretary Mario Montejo and Smart Communications on 17 October 2012. The app was developed by Rolly Rulete together with Pablito Veroy and Jay Albano. The mobile application prototype was originally written in HTML5.  Awards  International *ARKO, another mobile app under Project NOAH received the UN World Summit Awards Mobile Content under the e-Inclusion and Empowerment category in 2014. The award is a first for the Philippines, as ARKO bested 450 other international mobile applications. The nominees are selected based on how information technology is applied to empower social groups. *In 2016, International Data Corporation Asia Pacific named Project NOAH as the Top Smart City Initiative in Public Safety at the Smart City Asia Pacific Awards (SCAPA) 2016. *After being one of the five finalists in May 2016, Project NOAH takes home the Harnessing Data for Resilience Recognition Award from the Harnessing the Data Revolution for Resilience Summit in Bangkok, Thailand sponsored by USAID. *ARKO, the mobile application by Pointwest Technologies Corporation, added another feather to its cap after it took home the Silver Prize in the Corporate Social Responsibility category of the 2015 ASEAN ICT Awards. The event was held last 26 November 2015 at the Convention Center of Furuma Resort of Da Nang, Vietnam, and graced by the different ministers of ASEAN countries who attended the closing ceremony of the 15th ASEAN Telecommunications and IT Ministers and Related Meetings in Vietnam. *The Department of Science and Technology's (DOST) 3D mapping project called Disaster Risk Assessment, Exposure and Mitigation-Light Ranging and Detection Technology (DREAM-LiDAR) won the prestigious Geospatial World Excellence in Policy Implementation Award for 2014. A component of the Project NOAH, the DREAM-LiDAR addresses and helps mitigate the effects of flooding disasters in the country. *DREAM-LiDAR also won the Asia Geospatial Excellence Award during the Inaugural Ceremony of the Asia Geospatial Forum 2013 held in Jakarta, Indonesia last November 25, 2013. Local *On March 24, 2015, Arko also became the first winner of the Best Philippine-made Mobile Application of the Year in the 2015 International ICT Awards Manila. Organized by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines (CanCham) and the Information Technology and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP), the prestigious annual event aims to recognize achievements in the country's fast-growing IT-BPM industry. *Project NOAH was given a Special Award during the University of the Philippines' Recognition Ceremony for Extension programs held at the Malcolm Auditorium, UP College of Law on 17 May 2016. This was given in acknowledgement of Project NOAH's continuous contribution of knowledge through its research towards improving the Philippine Public's safety against the hazards brought about by typhoons; namely Flooding, Landslides and Storm Surges. *NOAH was also one of the 5 institutions that received the 2015 Gawad Parangal Awards as Quezon City continued its tradition of honoring outstanding individuals and institutions that have made achievements that inspire and exert a positive impact on society. *For making public information on weather conditions and disaster information available to the public, the NOAH mobile application won the Best Mobile App at the FutureGov Awards 2013, held in the New World Hotel, Makati City last April 11, 2013. FutureGov was a magazine for government, healthcare, and education. *The NOAH Android mobile app was also awarded the Best Telecom Project in the 16th Telecom Asia Awards, the region's longest-running and most prestigious telecom industry awards program that recognizes innovative and outstanding performance by Asian service providers and industry executives. The award was given last April 17, 2013 in Kuala Lumpur, and was received by SMART Communications Inc., who helped develop Project NOAH's mobile application for Android through the Smart Developer Network (SMART DevNet). *The importance of Project NOAH's mobile app was again cited in the recent 48th Anvil Awards, an award-giving body for outstanding Public Relations programs and tools in the Philippines. Developed by SMART Communications Inc. and Davao-based developer Rolly Rulete, the NOAH mobile app for Android won the Anvil Award of Excellence in March 2013. *In the 2012 CyberPress Awards, NOAH took home the ‚ÄúIT Product of the Year‚Äù award for paving the way toward a more responsive and innovative use of technology in providing weather information crucial for disaster response activities.

She was one of the first high-profile female nationalists in the movement, and was the National Propaganda Secretary for the Convention People's Party. She was also an active philanthropist and worked to improve women's lives in Northern Ghana.  Early life  Born in Busua, in the Western Region of the Gold Coast (now Ghana) in December 1918, Kudjoe was the youngest of 10 children. After finishing school, she became a popular dressmaker in Tarkwa, where she married J. C. Kudjoe. He was a manager of a gold mine near Tarkwa. The marriage did not last, and she began living with her brother, E. K. Dadson, a prominent United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) activist. She was inspired to enter into politics when Kwame Nkrumah stayed at their house in June 1947 and convinced her of the importance of women in politics.  Political career  After meeting with Nkrumah, Kudjoe began raising support for the UGCC. In March 1948, when the Big Six of the party were arrested, she raised money and led a campaign for their release. She was very involved in the Committee on Youth Organization within the UGCC and followed them when they split from the UGCC to form the CPP, and was the only woman present when the decision to split was made. Kudjoe was heavily involved with Positive Action, a campaign of mass civil disobedience that eventually led to the end of colonial rule, and she inspired massive support for the CPP through this campaign. She then became National Propaganda Secretary for the CPP and was an extremely effective organizer, mobilizing many people, including women, to join the CPP. After independence was won, Kudjoe founded the All-African Women's League in 1957, which later became the Ghana Women's League. She also worked to establish day nurseries and nursery schools throughout the country, and recruited workers and teachers and provided amenities for these establishments. She also championed an anti-nudity campaign in Northern Ghana. This included the free distribution of clothing donated from other countries. She taught women hygiene practices, such as how to boil water to bathe children. She undertook this work largely independently of the new government, leading to disapproval from the government, who minimized her role. She also helped distribute food in times of famine, and encouraged women to farm to grow their own food.  Death  Hannah Kudjoe died on 9 March 1986. Her obituary published on 8 May 1986 ends: \\"She was a priceless gem who in no small measure contributed to the political emancipation of Ghana from the clutches of imperialism. The vacuum created by her demise in spiritual terms though temporary, will be difficult to fill.\\" Her funeral took place at the Calvary Methodist Church in Accra on 6 July 1986.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple was constructed during the Cholas during the 10th century. Muruga is worshipped as Kanthaswamy along with his consorts Valli and Deivasena. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple is open from 6 am - 12:30 pm and 4:30 - 8:00 pm on all days. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Vaikasi Visagam, Kanthasasti festival, Soorasamharam, Thaipoosam festival and Panguni Uthiram festival being the most prominent being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend As per Hindu legend, Muruga obtained the Vel (spear) from his mother Parvathi from Sikkal Singaravelan Temple. He slayed Sooran, the demon, the event called Soorasamharam at Tiruchendur. During the war, the Bhutaganas, Shiva's army, is also believed to have helped Murugan. Since Murugan killed Sooran and his son Iranyeswaran, he attained Dosha (sin). To propitiate himself from the sin, he is believed to have installed the image of Shiva as Somanatha at this place and worshipped Shiva. Since the son of Shiva (called Sei) worshipped him, the place is called Cheyyur. The 27 Bhutaganas are personified to the 27 stars as per Hindu mythology. History The place was believed to be ruled by a Chola emperor named Valanvan and the place came to be known as Valavapuri. From the inscriptions in the temple, it is believed that it was constructed by the Cholas during the 10th century. The inscriptions from the Vijayanagar Empire during the 15th century indicate that Muslims were employed in the office of the kings. They also indicate that lands were endowed to the temple by the Muslims. The shrine of Meenakshi was added by the benevolent contribution by a devotee in 1937. Architecture Kanthaswamy temple has a flat rajagopuram in the North, piercing the rectangular granite walls around the temple. The presiding deity Kanthaswamy, is housed in the East facing sanctum, with Valli and Deivasena on either of his sides. The sanctum is approached from the main entrance through the flag staff hall, Maha mandap and Artha mandap. There is a granite Vel in front of Kanthaswamy. The flag staff is located in the flagstaff hall axial to the sanctum. An image of peacock, the vehicle of Muruga and Surya faces the main shrine in the Maha Mandap. There are shrines of Vinayaga before the Mahamandap and the sanctum is guarded by Brahma and Vishnu, which is an unusual feature in Murugan temples. The shrine of Tiripurasundari is located in the second precinct. There are separate shrines of Valli and Deivasena in South facing shrines diagonally opposite to the sanctum. The image of Somanathar and Meenakshi are in the temple. The images of the 27 Bhutaganas, each tall are sculpted in the niches around the sanctum. The first precinct around the sanctum houses the images of Nrithuya Kanthar, Bala Kanthar, Brahma Sastha, Sivagurunathar, Veduvar and Navagrahas. Festival The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 7:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:30 p.m., and Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m.. During the Arthajamam between 8:30 \\\\- 9:00 p.m, Kanthaswamy is believed to offer his worship Somanatha along with the 27 Bhoothagans and it is enacted everyday. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Kanthaswamy and Tiripurasundari. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6 am - 12:30 pm and 4-9:00 pm on all days. The temple has many festivals in its calendar, with the Vaikasi Visagam, Kanthasasti festival, Soorasamharam, Thaipoosam festival and Panguni Uthiram festival being the being the most prominent. Sarva vadyam is a music instrument used in the temple from historic times during the festive occasions. Chengalvaraya Sastri, a historical musician is believed to have composed songs praising the presiding deity. The practise of singing his songs during the rituals is continued in modern times.

It involves applying quantile regression to the point forecasts of a small number of individual forecasting models or experts. It has been introduced in 2014 by Jakub Nowotarski and Rafa≈Ç Weron and originally used for probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices and loads. Despite its simplicity it has been found to perform extremely well in practice - the top two performing teams in the price track of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom2014) used variants of QRA.  Introduction  The individual point forecasts are used as independent variables and the corresponding observed target variable as the dependent variable in a standard quantile regression setting. The Quantile Regression Averaging method yields an interval forecast of the target variable, but does not use the prediction intervals of the individual methods. One of the reasons for using point forecasts (and not interval forecasts) is their availability. For years, forecasters have focused on obtaining accurate point predictions. Computing probabilistic forecasts, on the other hand, is generally a much more complex task and has not been discussed in the literature nor developed by practitioners so extensively. Therefore, QRA may be found particularly attractive from a practical point of view as it allows to leverage existing development of point forecasting.  Computation  Visualization of the Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) probabilistic forecasting technique. The quantile regression problem can be written as follows: Q_y(q|X_t) = X_t\\\\beta_q, where Q_y(q \\\\cdot) is the conditional q-th quantile of the dependent variable (y_t), X_t=[1,\\\\hat{y}_{1,t},...,\\\\hat{y}_{m,t}] is a vector of point forecasts of m individual models (i.e. independent variables) and Œ≤q is a vector of parameters (for quantile q). The parameters are estimated by minimizing the loss function for a particular q-th quantile: \\\\min\\\\limits_{\\\\beta_q} \\\\left[ \\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\\\\\{t:y_t \\\\geq X_t\\\\beta_q \\\\\\\\}} q |y_t - X_t\\\\beta_q + \\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\\\\\{t:y_t < X_t\\\\beta_q \\\\\\\\}} (1-q)|y_t - X_t\\\\beta_q |\\\\right] = \\\\min\\\\limits_{\\\\beta_q} \\\\left[ \\\\sum\\\\limits_{t}(q - \\\\mathbf{1}_{y_t < X_t\\\\beta_q }) (y_t - X_t\\\\beta_q ) \\\\right] QRA assigns weights to individual forecasting methods and combines them to yield forecasts of chosen quantiles. Although the QRA method is based on quantile regression, not least squares, it still suffers from the same problems: the exogenous variables should not be correlated strongly and the number of variables included in the model has to be relatively small in order for the method to be computationally efficient.  Factor Quantile Regression Averaging (FQRA)  Visualization of the Factor Quantile Regression Averaging (FQRA) probabilistic forecasting technique. The main difficulty associated with applying QRA comes from the fact that only individual models that perform well and (preferably) are distinct should be used. However, there may be many well performing models or many different specifications of each model (with or without exogenous variables, with all or only selected lags, etc.) and it may not be optimal to include all of them in Quantile Regression Averaging. In Factor Quantile Regression Averaging (FQRA), instead of selecting individual models a priori, the relevant information contained in all forecasting models at hand is extracted using principal component analysis (PCA). The prediction intervals are then constructed on the basis of the common factors (f_t) obtained from the panel of point forecasts, as independent variables in a quantile regression. More precisely, in the FQRA method X_t=[1,\\\\hat{f}_{1,t},...,\\\\hat{f}_{k,t}] is a vector of k factors extracted from a panel of point forecasts of m individual models, not a vector of point forecasts of the individual models themselves. A similar principal component- type approach was proposed in the context of obtaining point forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters data. Instead of considering a (large) panel of forecasts of the individual models, FQRA concentrates on a small number of common factors, which - by construction - are orthogonal to each other, and hence are contemporaneously uncorrelated. FQRA can be also interpreted as a forecast averaging approach. The factors estimated within PCA are linear combinations of individual vectors of the panel and FQRA can therefore be used to assign weights to the forecasting models directly.  QRA and LAD regression  QRA may be viewed as an extension of combining point forecasts. The well-known ordinary least squares (OLS) averaging uses linear regression to estimate weights of the point forecasts of individual models. Replacing the quadratic loss function with the absolute loss function leads to quantile regression for the median, or in other words, least absolute deviation (LAD) regression.

Scale bar = 5mm Burmese amber, also known as Burmite or Kachin amber, is amber from the Hukawng Valley in northern Myanmar. The amber is dated to around 99 million years old, during the earliest part of the Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous. The amber is of significant palaeontological interest due to the diversity of flora and fauna contained as inclusions, particularly arthropods including insects and arachnids but also birds, lizards, snakes, frogs and fragmentary dinosaur remains. The amber has been known and commercially exploited since the first century AD, and has been known to science since the mid-nineteenth century. Research on the deposit has attracted controversy due to its alleged role in funding internal conflict in Myanmar and hazardous working conditions in the mines where it is collected.  Geological context, depositional environment and age  Geological context of Burmese amber in northern Myanmar The amber is found within the Hukawng Basin, a large Cretaceous-Cenozoic sedimentary basin within northern Myanmar. The strata have undergone folding and faulting. The Hukawng basin is part of the larger Myanmar Central Basin, a N-S orientated synclinal basin extending to the Gulf of Martaban to the south. The basin is considered to be a part of the West Burma Block or Burma Terrane, which has a debated tectonic history, it is considered to be associated with the concepts of the Cimmeria and Sibumasu terranes. The block was part of Gondwana during at least the Early Paleozoic, but the timing of rifting is very uncertain, with estimates ranging from the Devonian to Early Cretaceous. It is also disputed whether the block had accreted onto the Asian continental margin by the time of the amber deposition. Some members of the flora and fauna have Gondwanan affinities A recent paleomagnetic reconstruction finds that the Burma Terrane formed an island land mass in the Tethys Ocean during the Mid Creaceous at a latitude around 5-10 degrees south of the equator. At Noije Bum, located on a ridge, amber is found within fine grained clastic rocks, typically medium to greyish green in colour, resulting from the constituent grains being black, yellow, grey and light green. The fine grained rocks are primarily fine to very fine grained sandstone, with beds of silt and shale and laterally persistent thin (1‚Äì2 mm thick) coal horizons. Massive micritic limestone interbeds of 6-8 centimetre thickness, often containing coalified plant material also occur. This facies association is typically around 1 metre thick and typically thinly bedded and laminated. Associated with the fine grained facies is a set of medium facies primarily consisting of medium to fine grained sandstones also containing thin beds of siltstone, shale and conglomerate, alongside a persistent conglomerate horizon. A specimen of the ammonite Mortoniceras has been found in a sandstone bed 2 metres above the amber horizon, alongside indeterminate gastropods and bivalves. Lead-uranium dating of zircon crystals of volcanic clasts within the amber bearing horizons has given a maximum age of 98.79 ¬± 0.62 Ma, making the deposit earliest Cenomanian in age. Unpublished data by Wang Bo on other layers suggests an age range of deposition of at least 5 million years. The amber does not appear to have undergone significant transport since hardening or be redeposited. The strata at the site are younging upwards, striking north north-east and dipping 50-70 degrees E and SE north of the ridge and striking between south south-east and south-east and dipping 35-60 degrees south-west south of the ridge, suggesting the site is on the northwest limb of a syncline plunging to the northeast. A minor fault with a conspicuous gouge zone was noted as present, though it appeared to have no significant displacement. Several other localities are known, including the colonial Khanjamaw and the more recent Inzutzut, Angbamo, and Xipiugong sites. The Hkamti site SW of the Hukawng basin has been determined to be significantly older, dating to the early Albian around ca. 110 Ma and is therefore considered distinct. Paleoenvironment A Puzosia (Bhimaites) species juvenile shell in Burmese amber The Burmese amber paleoforest is considered to have been an estuarian coastal tropical rainforest where resin was subsequently transported into a brackish shallow marine environment. The presence of troglobitic nocticolid cockroaches suggests the nearby presence of caves. The shell of a dead juvenile Puzosia (Bhimaites) species ammonite, four marine gastropod shells (including Mathilda) and littoral or supralittoral isopods entombed in a piece of amber with shell sand, along with growth of Isocrinid crinoids, corals and oysters on the surface of some pieces indicate tidal zone conditions. Additionally pholadid bivalve borings into amber specimens along with at least one pholadid which became trapped show that the resin was still fresh and unhardened when it was being moved into the tidal areas. The amber itself is primarily disc-shaped and flattened along the bedding plane, and is typically reddish brown, with the colour ranging from shades of yellow to red. The opacity of the amber ranges from clear to opaque. Many amber pieces have thin calcite veins that are typically less than , but up to thick. The number and proportion of veins in a piece of amber varies significantly, in some pieces veins are virtually absent, while others are described as being \\"packed with veinlets\\" The amber is considered to be of coniferous origin, with a likely araucarian source tree, based on spectroscopic analysis and wood fragment inclusions, though a pine origin has also been suggested.  Fauna and flora  The list of taxa is extraordinarily diverse, with over 42 classes, 108 orders, 569 families, 1017 genera and 1379 species described as of the end of 2019, with over 300 species described in 2019 alone, the vast majority (94%) of which are arthropods.

History The amber is apparently referred to in ancient Chinese sources as originating from Yunnan Province as early as the first century AD according to the Book of the Later Han and trade with China had been ongoing for centuries. This has been confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of amber artifacts from the Eastern Han Dynasty (25 - 220 CE). It was first mentioned in European sources by the Jesuit Priest √Ålvaro Semedo who visited China in 1613, it was described as being \\"digged out of mines, and sometimes in great pieces, it is redder than our amber though not so cleane\\".Zherikhin, V.V., Ross, A.J., 2000. A review of the history, geology and age of Burmese amber (Burmite). Bulletin of the Natural History Museum, London (Geology) 56 (1), 3‚Äì10. The locality itself has been known to European explorers since the 1800s with visitation to the Hukawng Valley by Simon Fraser Hannay in 1836‚Äì1837. At that time the principle products of the valley mines were salt, gold, and amber, with the majority of gold and amber being bought by Chinese traders. Hannay visited the amber mines themselves on March 21, 1836, and he noted that the last three miles to the mines were marked with numerous abandoned pits, up to in depth, where amber had been dug in the past. The mining had moved over the hill to a series of 10 pits but no visible amber was seen, suggesting that miners possibly hid the amber found that day before the party arrived. Mining was being performed manually at the time through the use of sharpened bamboo rods and small wooden shovels. Finer pieces of amber were recovered from the deeper pits, with clear yellow being recovered from depths of The recovered amber was bought with silver or often exchanged for jackets, hats, copper pots, or opium among other goods. mixed and lower quality amber was sold from around ticals to 4 rupees per seer. Pieces that were considered high quality or fit or use as ornamentation were described as expensive and price varied depending on clarity and color. Women of the valley were noted to wear amber earrings as part of their jewelry. In 1885 the Konbaung dynasty was annexed to the British Raj and a survey of the area was conducted by Dr. Fritz Noetling on behalf of the Geological Survey of India. The final research before Burmese independence in 1947 was conducted by Dr. H.L. Chhibber in 1934, who provided the most detailed description of Burmite occurrences. History of research  The first research on the inclusions in the Burmese amber was published in 1916 by Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, who initially concluded that the amber was Miocene in age. However, he subsequently noted the archaic nature of the insects, and concluded that the amber must be older.  Modern exploitation and controversy  alt= Leeward Capital Corp, a small Canadian mining firm, controlled the deposit from the mid 1990s to c. 2000, though the history of exploitation during the 2000s is obscure. The Kachin Independence Army controlled the area during the early to mid 2010's. During the early 2010s, production rapidly increased. The working conditions at the mines have been described as extremely unsafe, down deep pits barely wide enough to crawl through, with no accident compensation. The presence of calcite veins are a major factor in determining the gem quality of pieces, with pieces with a large number of veins having significantly lower value. The main amber market in Myanmar is Myitkyina. Most amber is smuggled into China, primarily for jewelry, with estimates of around 100 tonnes passing through to the main market of Tenchong, Yunnan in 2015, with an estimated value between five and seven billion yuan. Burmese amber was estimated to make up 30% of Tenchong's gemstone market (the rest being Myanmar Jade), and was declared one of the cities eight main industries by the local government. In June 2017 the Tatmadaw seized control of the mines from the Kachin Independence Army. Sales of amber were alleged to help fund the Kachin conflict by various news organisations in 2019. Interest in this discussion rose in March 2020 after the highly publicised description of Oculudentavis, which made the cover of Nature. On April 21, 2020 the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) published a letter of recommendation to journal editors asking for ‚Äúa moratorium on publication for any fossil specimens purchased from sources in Myanmar after June 2017 when the Myanmar military began its campaign to seize control of the amber mining‚Äù. On April 23, 2020 Acta Palaeontologica Polonica stated that it would not accept papers on Burmese amber material collected from 2017 onwards, after the Burmese military took control of the deposit, requiring \\"certification or other demonstrable evidence, that they were acquired before the date both legally and ethically\\". On May 13, 2020, the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology published an editorial stating that it would no longer consider papers based whole or in part on Burmese amber material, regardless of whether in historic collections or not. On 30 June 2020, a statement from the International Palaeoentomological Society was published in response to the SVP, criticising the proposal to ban publishing on Burmese amber material. In August 2020, a comment from over 50 authors was published in PalZ responding to the SVP statement. The authors disagreed with the proposal of a mortatorium, describing the focus on the Burmese amber as \\"arbitrary\\" and that \\"The SVP‚Äôs recommendation for a moratorium on Burmese amber affects fossil non-vertebrate research much more than fossil vertebrate research and clearly does not represent this part of the palaeontological community.\\" The conclusion that Burmese amber funded the Tatmandaw was disputed by George Poinar and Sieghard Ellenberger, who found that the supply of amber collapsed after the 2017 takeover of the mines by the Tatmandaw, and that most of the current circulation of amber in Chinese markets was extracted prior to 2017. A story in Science in 2019 stated: \\"Two former mine owners, speaking through an interpreter in phone interviews, say taxes have been even steeper since government troops took control of the area. Both shut their mines when they became unprofitable after the government takeover, and almost all deep mines are now out of business, dealers here corroborate. Only shallow mines and perhaps a few secret operations are still running.\\"  Other Myanmar ambers  Other deposits of amber are known from several regions in Myanmar, with noted deposits in the Shwebo District of the Sagaing Region, from the Pakokku and Thayet districts of Magway Region and the Bago District of the Bago Region. Unlike the Hukawng deposit, none of these sources have produce notable quantities of amber.  Tilin amber  A 2018 study on an amber deposit from Tilin in central Myanmar indicated that deposit to be 27 million years younger than the Hukawng deposit, dating to approximately 72 million years old, placing it in the latest Campanian age. The deposit was associated with an overlying tuffaceous layer, and underlying nodules of brown sandstone yielded remains of the ammonite Sphenodiscus. Within a number of arthropod specimens were described though much more poorly preserved than specimens in the Hukawng amber. These include members of Hymenoptera (Braconidae, Diapriidae, Scelionidae) Diptera (Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae) Dictyoptera (Blattaria, Mantodea) planthoppers, Berothidae and bark lice (Lepidopsocidae) as well as extant ant subfamilies Dolichoderinae and tentatively Ponerinae, as well as fragments of moss.  Hkamti amber  The Hkamti site is located ca. 90 km southwest of the Angbamo site and predominantly consists of limestone, interbedded with mudstone and tuff, the amber is found within the unconsolidated mudstone/tuff layers. A crinoid was found attached to one amber specimen, alongside marine plant remains in the surrounding sediment, indicating deposition in a shallow marine setting. The amber is generally red- brown, and yellow colouration is rare, the amber is generally found as angular clasts, indicating short transport distance and is more brittle than other northern Myanmar ambers. Zircon dating has constrained the age of the deposit to the early Albian, c. 110 Ma, significantly older than the dates obtained from other deposits. Fauna found within the amber includes: Archaeognatha, Diplopoda, Coleoptera, Araneae,Trichoptera, Neuroptera, Psocodea, Isoptera Diptera, Orthoptera, Pseudoscorpionida, Hymenoptera and Thysanoptera.

They are not to be confused with either of the two American bands of the same name, one from the 1960s and the other who became a popular new wave act in the late 1970s. They were unable to achieve any hits in the UK or elsewhere, but in more recent years their work has come to the attention of music enthusiasts. History The band hailed from Ilford, a town north of London in 1964. Their membership included Paul Gurvitz, their leader, on guitar and vocals, Brian Morris on guitar, and Louis Farrel on drums. They made ventures to Germany and France to play for American servicemen. Upon returning to England, they were invited to play as backing band for 1950s rocker Gene Vincent, who had set up a base of operations in the UK. Paul Gurvitz's father, Sam Guvitz, who had previously worked as road manager for the Shadows, was currently Vincent's road manager. After several months as Vincent's backing act, the group were hired for a long term engagement at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany. Performing under the name, the Londoners, they became a top attraction and were even invited to record cut a single for the Star Club's in-house record label. The single, which paired their version of Elvis Presley's \\"That's My Desire\\" a rendition of Sam Cooke's \\"Bring It On Home To Me,\\" was issued strictly in Germany. The band returned to England in 1965. Shortly after their return, Paul Gurvitz convinced the other members of the group to change their name to the Knack, a move inspired by the Richard Lester movie of the same name. The band would now cultivate a decisively mod image. They brought in Gearie Kenworthy to play bass and Topper Clay to replace Louis Farrel on drums. With the new line-up quickly the band became a formidable live act. Sam Curtis, the Gurvitz brothers' father, was now the band's manager and used his leverage in the music industry to secure a contract with Decca. Their debut single was an energetic cover of the recent Kinks B-side, \\"Who'll Be The Next In Line,\\" which was backed with the equally frantic \\"She Ain't No Good.\\" Released in September 1965, it sold well enough to convince Decca to continue to work with the band. \\"Who'll Be The Next In Line\\" had been recommended to the group by former member of the Shadows, Tony Meehan. Later in 1965 the band released their second single for Decca featuring covers of two songs previously recorded by the Clique, \\"It's Love Baby (24 Hours a Day)\\" b/w \\"Time Time Time.\\" The record failed to reach the charts, and Decca terminated their contract. After leaving Decca, the band was signed with Piccadilly Records, a subsidiary of Pye Records. After their move to the new label, their music evolved away from its primitive beginnings and began to incorporate eclectic influences, such folk rock. Their first single with Picadilly would feature a version of the Lovin' Spoonful's \\"Did You Ever Have to Make up Your Mind.\\" Despite lack of airplay, Piccadilly remained committed to the Knack. They followed it up with \\"Stop\\" b/w another Lovin' Spoonful cover, \\"Younger Girl.\\" \\"Stop\\" turned out to be a modest success. Their next 45, \\"Save All My Love For Joey\\" b/w \\"Take My Love,\\" was issued in October 1966. The single failed to replicate its predecessor's success. Their next release was the largely acoustic and folk-inspired \\"(Man from the) Marriage Guidance & Advice Bureau\\" b/w \\"Dolly Catcher Man,\\" issued in February 1967. The Piccadilly label was in financial trouble and soon foundered, leaving the group without a label. Drummer Topper Clay departed and Louis Farrel returned to the drum throne. Guitarist Brian Morris left and was replaced not with a guitarist but a keyboardist, Tim Mycroft. During an interregnum in the summer of 1967, Paul Gurvitz did a brief stint with the group Rupert's People, but remained with the Knack. Though the Knack did not release any more material, they went to Olympic Studios in the fall of 1967 with producer Denny Cordell to cut a new song by Paul Gurvitz, the psychedelic \\"Light On The Wall\\"‚Äîlong thought to be lost but for which an acetate has recently emerged. They played their last gig at the Roundhouse on 6 October with former Moody Blues member and future Paul McCartney and Wings axeman, Denny Laine. Organist Tim Mycroft departed, leaving the Gurvitz brothers and drummer Louis Farrell. The Knack changed their name to the Gun and pursued a heavier rock direction. Gun scored a #8 hit on the British charts with \\"Race With the Devil.\\" Organist Tim Mycroft joined the group Sounds Nice, who recorded for Parlophone Records in the late 1960s. In the intervening years since their break-up, the Knack has come to the attention of music collectors and enthusiasts. Their complete recorded works have been compiled on the Time Time Time: The complete UK Singles and More anthology put out by Rev-Ola Records.

The faction was formed at a meeting of KMT leaders opposed to communist influence held at Biyun Temple in the Western Hills district of Beijing in November 1925.Gao, James, Z., Historical Dictionary of Modern China (1800-1949). \\"West Hill Group\\". The Scarecrow Press, 2009. About half the KMT leadership attended the meeting.Perkins, Dorothy, Japan Goes to War: A Chronology of Japanese Military Expansion from the Meiji Era to the Attack on Pearl Harbor (1868-1941) DIANE Publishing, 1997, p. 101. The group included Lin Sen, Ju Zheng, Zou Lu, and Xie Chi. In the three-way struggle for party leadership that followed the death of Sun Yat-sen, the group supported Hu Hanmin against leftist Wang Jingwei and centrist Chiang Kai-shek. Hu was Sun's intended successor, but he did not identify with the group. History The Nationalist Party had won a nationwide parliamentary election held in 1912. Lin Sen was selected Speaker in April 1913. In July, parliamentary government collapsed and the KMT leaders went into exile. Under Soviet sponsorship, the KMT and the Communist Party formed a \\"united front\\" in 1923. This agreement allowed the KMT to receive Soviet arms and establish a foothold in Guangzhou, a major city in southern China. The KMT and the communists were thus allies against the Beiyang warlords, who were backed by the Japanese. After the death of Sun in March 1925, the KMT swung to the left under Wang, who formed an alliance with the communists. Right-wing favorite Hu Hanmin was pushed out of the leadership and sent to the Soviet Union in August. The Western Hills Conference held on November 23 included fifteen KMT leaders. The group billed itself as the \\"Fourth CEC Plenum.\\" That is to say, it claimed to be acting as the KMT's executive committee.Clarence Martin Wilbur, Julie Lien- ying How, Missionaries of Revolution: Soviet Advisers and Nationalist China, 1920-1927, (1989), pp. 188-192. The group's first act was to pass a \\"Manifesto to Strike the Communist Faction from Party Register.\\" On December 2, it passed a resolution to expel the four communist members of the KMT executive committee, as well as the five communist alternate members. (This included Mao Zedong, at this time an alternate member.) On December 4, the group voted to terminate the contract of Soviet agent Mikhail Borodin. On December 5, Wang was expelled from the KMT for a period of six months. Former parliament Speaker Lin Sen was the best-known member of the Western Hills Group Wang's supporters did not recognize these decisions. They argued that the meeting in Beijing had failed to achieve a quorum. Under the KMT bylaws, a quorum was fifteen full executive committee members. Only fourteen of the Western Hills attendees were full members. Lin Sen lent his prestige to the meeting by acting as convener. But otherwise he was detached, refusing even to comment on the resolutions.ÊûóÊ£ÆÂú®Ë•øÂ±±‰ºöËÆÆÊ¥æ‰∏≠ÁöÑÂú∞‰Ωç, ÊûóÂèãÂçé, 2000-02 A \\"Society to Promote the Study of Sun Wenism,\\" modeled after the KMT's various communist leagues, was created to promote non-communist views among KMT members. Wang responded to the Western Hills meeting by convening a Second National Party Conference in Guangzhou on 1 January 1926. The resolutions of a party conference overridden those of the executive committee, regardless of the quorum issue. The conference expelled the Western Hills participants from the party.Chien-nung Li, Ssu-yu Teng, Jeremy Ingalls, The Political History of China, 1840-1928 (1956), p. 501. Although the conference was a triumph for Wang and the left, it also provoked a reaction from those concerned about communist influence. Afterward, the Western Hills Group set up a rival KMT headquarters in Shanghai. The KMT suffered another split in January 1927. Wang's supporters began meeting in Hankou while supporters of military commander Chiang Kai-shek began meeting separately in Nanchang. In March, Chiang's forces captured Shanghai and Nanjing. On April 19, a \\"National Government\\" was proclaimed in Nanjing with Hu as party chairman and Chiang as military commander. This government represented a merger of the Shanghai and Nanchang factions. It immediately conducted a purge of communists and their allies. After intercepting a message from Moscow calling for a coup, Hankou purged its communists on 15 July 1927. In August, the Western Hills Group brokered a reconciliation between the Wang's Hankou-based faction and Chiang's Nanjing-based faction. Chiang resigned his position and took a trip to Japan to facilitate the reconciliation. With Hu chairman of a reunited KMT and Chiang absent, the Western Hills Group was for a brief interval the party's dominant faction. The field commanders, however, remained the kingmakers. On 6 January 1928, they restored Chiang as commander in chief.Elleman, Bruce, Moscow and the Emergence of Communist Power in China, 1925‚Äì30: The Nanchang Uprising and the Birth of the Red Army, Routledge, (2009), p. 5. Hu, meanwhile, took an extended trip to Europe. In February, Chiang dismissed the Western Hills ministers and appointed the Chen brothers to prominent party organization and security positions. This \\"CC Clique\\" of Chen Guofu and Chen Lifu soon eclipsed and absorbed the Western Hills Group.Wakeman, Frederic, Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese Secret Service, University of California Press, 2003, p. 91 When Hu returned in October, he was appointed president of the Legislative Yuan with Lin Sen as vice president. The Hu-Chiang alliance lasted until February 1931, when Chiang put Hu under house arrest. Although the Western Hills Group is often labeled \\"extreme right\\" or \\"far right,\\" its resolutions called only for the expulsion of communists from the KMT. They did not exclude the possibility of cooperating with them. This position can be considered more moderate than that of Chiang, who pursued a series of \\"extermination campaigns\\" against the communists beginning in December 1930. Lin Sen served as Chinese president from 1931 to 1943. However, this was a nominal position without influence on policy. As for Ju Zheng, he administered China's court system from 1932 to 1947 as president of the Judicial Yuan.George Ernest Morrison, Hui-Min Lo, The Correspondence of G. E.

The museum was established in 1918 as a Museum of People University and renamed as a Central Arts Museum later. It was named as Tashkent Art Museum in 1924 and finally Museum of Arts of Uzbekistan in 1935. History The museum was established in 1918 and was located in former palace of prince Nikolay Romanov till 1935. It was moved to People's House in 1935. In 1974, the People's House building was demolished replaced by a current one. Building Tashkent. Museum of Arts of Uzbekistan till 1935. Tashkent. Museum of Arts of Uzbekistan till 1966. Tashkent. Museum of Arts of Uzbekistan Three Soviet architects Abdulov, Nikiforov and Rosenblum designed the new building of museum in the form of a huge cube, with all sides separated into even metal squares, lined with aluminum sheets on the outside. The lower part of the building and the entrance are decorated with polished gray marble. The upper part is glazed with chrom-brugnatellite, smoothing the sunlight and setting indoor matte illumination. Collection The initial collection of the museum consisted of a hundred works of art from prince Nikolay Romanov and other individuals private collections, nationalized in April 1918. Those were mostly paintings and drawings by Russian and Western European masters, sculptures, furniture and porcelain. Immediately after establishing the museum, its collection was enlarged with works from the collection of the Turkestan local history museum. Some works were transferred from museum collections in Moscow and Leningrad - for example, in 1920‚Äì1924 the museum received 116 works of Russian art from the 18th to 20th centuries, among them portraits by Vladimir Borovikovsky, Tropinin, Karl Bryullov, Yaroshenko, Repin and many others. The museum also purchased about 250 paintings of pre-revolutionary artists who were active in Central Asia: Igor Kazakov, Nikolay Karazin, Sommer. From the second half of the 1930s, the museum's collection was expanded mostly with works by Uzbekistan artists, including works of Usto Mumin, Pavel Benkov, Leo Bure. In addition to its permanent collection, the museum holds exhibitions of Uzbek and international artists. Museum Collections are divided into four departments: National applied art of Uzbekistan, Fine arts of Uzbekistan, Russian and Western art, Far East art. Controversy The chief curator of museum Mirfayz Usmonov was found selling artworks in black market for 15 years, replacing them with copies. He was caught in 2014, prosecuted and sentenced to 9 years in jail. Two other employees of museum were sentenced to eight years each.

Fort Willem I, known in Indonesian/Javanese as Benteng Pendem Ambarawa (Ambarawa's Sunken Fort), is a 19th-century Dutch fortress in Ambarawa, Central Java, Indonesia.A 19th- century lithograph showing the fertile Ambarawa plantation with European cemetery in the foreground and the extensive square-shaped Fort Willem I in the background. History During the Diponegoro War (1827-1830), Colonel Hoorn, Commander of the 2nd Division, assigned to the crossroads at Bawen, instructed the construction of a logistical supply point, as well several military barracks, to give immediate supply and forces for the war, as Bawen is a vital junction connecting the cities of Semarang, Yogyakarta, Salatiga and Surakarta. As a result, several sheds, made out of bamboo, were built at this strategic point during the war. After the war, during the reign of Willem II, a fort was constructed in Ambarawa between 1834-1853. In 1840, Ambarawa had become a strategic military outpost, serving as a choke point between Semarang and Surakarta. The Dutch had also established several military defense points along this route. Their purpose was to establish a relationship with the Sultanate of Mataram and to prevent native troop movements. From 1853 to 1927 KNIL military barracks were set up in the fort. The private Dutch East Indies Railway Company (NIS) received concession in 1862 to build a rail track connecting Semarang, Surakarta, Magelang and Yogyakarta with a branch toward Fort Willem I. Construction started in 1863 and was completed in 1873. An earthquake occurring on July 16, 1865 damaged some buildings inside the fort. In 1927, Fort Willem I changed its function from a juvenile penitentiary into an adult and political prison. During the period of Japanese occupation, Fort Willem I was converted into an internment camp. After the Indonesian declaration of independence, from October 14, 1945 to November 23, 1945, parts of the fort were also used as a military base by the Tentara Keamanan Rakjat (\\"People's Security Army\\"), a predecessor of the Indonesian National Army. During which time, around 3,500 Dutch civilians were interned by Indonesian freedom fighters inside the Fort Willem I; the internment camp used former prisoners and guards for camp security. In 1950, parts of the fort were converted into an adult penitentiary. In 1985, it was repurposed yet again as a juvenile penitentiary facility; in 1991, penitentiary class IIB; in 2003 and until now, penitentiary class IIA. Structure Fort Willem I is situated in the middle of a rice field. The main building is a pentagonal fort, sized around 178 x 178 meter. Small storage buildings are located around 94 meter away from the fort at each cardinal points. Unlike earlier 18th-century fort designs, the 19th-century Willem I Fort were designed for a mainly defensive and logistical purpose. As such, the fort contains no embrasures or bastions. Instead, there are many windows in the rampart, and the bastions are detached from the fort.

She inherited Arthur Rimbaud's estate after his death in 1891 and became his literary executor.  Biography  Isabelle Rimbaud was the youngest daughter of Marie Catherine Vitalie Cuif and Fr√©d√©ric Rimbaud, who left the marital home leaving his wife with four small children. These were Fr√©d√©ric at seven years, Arthur at six, Vitalie at two and Isabelle at eight months. Isabelle, like her siblings, grew up under the heelFrench: \\"le joug\\" of an authoritarian and conservative mother who instilled in her strict principles based on Christian morality. Among the known letters of Arthur Rimbaud, several were exchanged with his sister Isabelle. When Arthur Rimbaud returned to Marseilles on 23 August 1891, Isabelle went with him. In her letters to her mother, she described the last weeks of Arthur Rimbaud's life. She wrote down her brother's last letter [dictated] on 9 November 1891 and added his last words before the midday sun the following day. She witnessed his great sufferings and was present during his death throes on the night of 9/10 November 1891. In a letter to her mother she wrote: \\"This is no longer a poor outcast who is going to besides me. He is fair, a saint, a martyr, one of God's elect\\".French: Ce n‚Äôest plus un pauvre r√©prouv√© qui va mourir pr√®s de moi. C‚Äôest un juste, un saint, un martyr, un √©lu. She learned only at the death of her brother that he had written poems: \\"Without ever having read them, I know his works\\".French: Sans les avoir jamais lues, je connaissais ses ≈ìuvres. Isabelle was the last person to have sketched her dying brother. She married, in 1897, Paterne Berrichon. They both strove to be the guardians of the poet's good name. She died on 20 June 1917, aged 57, of cancer in Neuilly-sur-Seine.  Gallery  File:Arthur Rimbaud mourant par Isabelle Rimbaud.jpg|Arthur Rimbaud dying, drawn by Isabelle Rimbaud.

It was the royal mosque of the Sultanate of Langkat. History Construction of the mosque started in 1889 following the order of Tengku Sultan Abdul Aziz, late 19th-century ruler of Langkat Sultanate, and son of Tengku Sultan Haji Musa al-Khalidy al-Muazhzham Syah. The mosque was designed by a German architect. Many of the construction workers were the Chinese inhabitant of Langkat Regency. Material for construction were shipped from Penang and Singapore via the river Batang Serangan, and was transferred on site with 80 ox-carts. Abdul Aziz died before the completion of the mosque, so the construction was taken over by his son Tengku Sultan Mahmud Rahmat Syah. The mosque was completed on June 13, 1902. A minaret was added in 1926. The mosque was restored several times in 1978-1979, 1980‚Äì1981, and 1990-1991. The mosque The mosque stands on a complex of about . The main prayer hall is about 25 x 25 meter. Three Mughal styled entrances on the north, south, and east side of the main prayer hall provide entry points. It is equipped with Mughal-styled copper domes, the heaviest is around 40 tons. The interior is mainly of marble, with Italian crystal chandeliers. Within the mosque complex are several tombs of the royal family belonging to the Langkat Sultanate.

It is an erect and spreading shrub endemic to the south-west of Western Australia, common in moist areas and like most of the other members of its genus has bell shaped, star-like white flowers in the leaf axils. Description Myoporum tetrandrum is a shrub sometimes growing to a height of with young branches that are glabrous and rather flattened. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are usually long, wide, elliptic in shape and usually have small teeth or serrations in approximately the outer half. The leaves are a similar deep green colour on both surfaces and the lower surface has a distinct mid-vein. The flowers are borne in groups of about 5 to 7 (sometimes more or fewer) on a stalk long. The flowers have 5 egg-shaped sepals and 5 petals, joined at their bases to form a tube. The petals are white with purple spots on the lobes of the tube and the upper part of the tube. The tube is about long and the lobes are slightly shorter than the tube. The inside of the tube and part of the lobes are hairy. There are 4 stamens which extend beyond the petals. Flowers are often present from May to January and the fruits that follow are green and fleshy at first but dry when mature. Taxonomy and naming Myoporum tetrandrum was first formally described by Jacques Labillardi√®re in 1805 as Pogonia tetrandra. In 1923, Karel Domin changed the name to Myoporum tetrandrum, describing the change in Vestnik Kralovske Ceske Spolecnosti Nauk, Trida Matematiko- Prirodevedecke. The specific epithet (tetrandra) is derived from the ancient Greek tetra- (œÑŒµœÑœÅŒ±-), meaning \\"four\\" and anƒìr, genitive andros (·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ, genitive ·ºÄŒΩŒ¥œÅœåœÇ), meaning \\"male\\" or in this case \\"stamen\\".Backer, C.A.

Distribution and habitat Slender myoporum occurs in Western Australia in near-coastal areas between the Stirling Range and Israelite Bay in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Warren biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy soil, usually in damp places like floodplains and along streams, often in association with Melaleuca species. Ecology Myoporum tetrandrum contains a high percentage (up to 0.5%) of sesquiterpene essential oil making the plant toxic to livestock which suffer liver damage. Use in horticulture Slender myoporum is a hardy plant in well-drained soil in full sun and is most easily propagated from cuttings. It grows well in Portugal and is naturalised there.

Biography Due to his father's pressure, he joined the \\"√âcole des Arts et M√©tiers\\" (Arts and Sciences) of Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne in 1883, as an engineering student, and graduated in 1889. But then, he took courses at the Academie Julian and the √âcole des beaux-arts in Paris, being attached to the studios of Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant and Jules Lefebvre. In 1896 he was awarded second prize in the Prix de Rome, followed by a gold medal at the Salon des artistes fran√ßais in 1898. In that year he won a bursary which took him to Holland, Switzerland and Italy. He also won a silver medal at the great Paris 1900 \\"Exposition universelle\\". In 1904 he married H√©l√®ne Gla√ßon and they had a son, Michel, and a daughter, Annette. Michel was an engineer and worked on the Paris M√©tro. Annette was one of her father's favourite models. Michel was also an expert on musical organs. It was in Paris that he made the acquaintance of fellow artist, Fernand Legout-G√©rard, who introduced him into the artists' community at Concarneau where he purchased a villa called Kerdorlett, by the beach and facing west. This became his summer residence while winters were spent at his house in Neuilly-sur-Seine. He became the president of the \\"Union artistique des Amis de Concarneau\\" whose membership included painters such as Alfred Guillou and Thomas Alexander Harrison, an american painter who stayed frequently at Pont-Aven in the summer. He was an excellent pastellist and colorist and painted many portraits, mostly of women. He painted landscapes and marine views, mostly around Concarneau and the Pays Bigouden, as well as Le Faou√´t, Vannes, Paimpol and the √éle-de-Br√©hat.Jean-Marc Michaud, Henri Guinier, √©ditions du Chasse-Mar√©e, 2008 He painted many subjects: the allegorical, genre works, nudes, portraits and the countryside, and spent time in Italy, Holland, the Alps and the Pyr√©n√©es.Charles Wittmann et Paul Chabas, √Ä la m√©moire de Henri Guinier, artiste peintre...

The Ministry of War commissioned him to paint scenes from the battlefield at Verdun where he completed several pastels. From 1920 onwards, he passed part of the winters in the mountains and painted scenes in both Pau and Argel√®s-Gazost as well as in the valley of the Chamonix.

UPI Newstime was the second 24-hour all-news television network in the US for cable TV, following AP Newscable for 13 years and predating CNN by 2 years. UPI Newstime was unique in how it distributed its programming to local cable TV (CATV) headends via satellite, using a form of slow-scan television, or SSTV technology. Using SSTV reduced satellite transmission costs for UPI and was suitable at the time for the programming produced by UPI for the channel, which mainly relied on still slides and wirephotos acquired by UPI's own newsgathering operations. UPI Newstime's newscasts were broadcast interruption free in 15-minute blocks. On normal news days, an entirely new news segment was produced six times, sports four times, and business, finance and weather three times daily. It consisted of black & white still images & alphanumeric texts displayed in a slideshow fashion with each new slide building from the left to right of the screen, each taking 8.5 seconds to be shown on the air. The audio accompanying and annotating the stills was produced by UPI in a radio newscast style for each Newstime broadcast from studio and remote audio feeds provided by UPI Audio. The programming was produced initially by Newstime's studios in regular NTSC video format, with each 15-minute newscast being edited and mastered to U-Matic-format 3/4\\" videotape. The video from the tape was then converted into an audio-compatible narrow-bandwidth 8 kHz-wide black & white SSTV signal, using special narrowband SSTV video equipment designed & manufactured by Colorado Video, Inc. (CVI). From there, it was then uplinked via satellite (through the facilities of Satellite Syndicated Systems, Inc. (SSS)) on two audio subcarriers, both \\"piggybacked\\" on the satellite transponder carrying Superstation WTCG (now TBS) at the time (who also utilized SSS' satellite facilities); one for the SSTV-encoded video, and another for Newstime's program audio (along with WTCG's audio subcarrier and main video carrier on the transponder). From there, cable TV systems would, from the satellite's downlink, receive Newstime's SSTV video & audio signals from these subcarriers. The SSTV feed would then be converted using a SSTV decoder, also supplied by CVI, back into a conventional black & white RS-170 NTSC-standard video channel with audio to be distributed on a cable TV system's channel. UPI considered discontinuing Newstime sometime around 1981, after competing news networks like CNN which utilized regular full-motion color NTSC video like traditional TV channels, started to take away Newstime's viewership and thus made its operations less economically viable. UPI planned to discontinue Newstime and offer their existing text-based \\"Cable Newswire\\" service as a substitute for the CATV systems that carried Newstime. But UPI decided to hand over operations of Newstime on April 30, 1981 to an Atlanta- based television & radio production company, Eastern Broadcast Services (EBS), with the intention of EBS continuning the Newstime service. Shortly after EBS took over UPI Newstime in 1981, they merged the channel with another similar SSTV-transmitted cable TV network founded by Southern Satellite Systems (the corporate parent of Satellite Syndicated Systems, the uplink provider for UPI Newstime as mentioned earlier), called The Women's Channel.

She was completed in April 1941. She was adopted by the civil community of Southgate, then in Middlesex, as part of Warship Week in 1942. She earned eleven battle honours for extensive service during the Second World War. This included service in the Mediterranean where she was severely damaged in February 1942, and resulted in extensive repairs in the UK that year. She then saw service with Russian convoys, followed by work to support the allied landings in Italy. Towards the end of the war she was nominated for service in the Far East in support of Operation Zipper for landings in Malaya, which was cancelled with the end of the War.

Constructed in Rock-cut architecture, the temple is believed to have been built during the 8th century by Muttaraiyar kings, the cardinals of Pallavas, with later expansion from the Vijayanagar Empire. The rock-cut architecture in the temple is a specimen of the late Pallava Art and an early example of Chola Art. The temple has various inscriptions from Cholas, Chalukyas, Pandyas and Vijayanagar Empire. The temple is considered one of the oldest stone temples in South India. The temple is maintained and administered by Department of Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. History Kunnandarkoil derives its name from Kundru-Andan-Koil meaning the Lord of the hill in the temple. Kunnandarkoil and the region around it was ruled by the Mutharaiyars during the 7th to 9th centuries, where were lieutenants under the Pallavas. The region was later captured by Medieval Cholas. The cave temple was originally built by Muttaraiyar king who was the lieutenant of the Pallava king Nandivarman II (710-775 CE), who was also called Nandivarman Pallava Malla. The earliest inscription is from the period of Nandivarman and his son Dantivarman indicating generous contribution to Vedic people (learned) during the Thiruvadirai festival. Soundara Rajan identifies the temple to an addition during the early half of the 8th century. There are later inscriptions from Cholas, Chalukyas, Pandyas and Vijayanagar Empire. During the 14th century, the village had two divisions for the Kallar community. Some of the epigraphic studies reveal that there were strict punishments levied to people robbing in remote villages like Kunnandarkoil. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by Department of Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. Architecture The hall of hundred pillars The temple is located in Kunnandarkoil, a rockyhill in Pudukottai district in southern Tamil Nadu. The cave houses three life size sculptures of various forms of Shiva. The main shrine faces East and the sanctum houses the image of Lingam, an iconic representation of Shiva. Shiva is worshipped as Parvathagiriswarar. The walls of the sanctum are plain, unlike later Chola temples that have niches to house different images. The sanctum is approached through an Arthamandapa, a hall supported by pillars. The sanctum is guarded by Dvarapalas on either sides. The inscriptions are made on the base of the Dvarapalas. There are two portrait images, one of which is identified as the Mutharaiyar chief who built the temple and other being his assistant. Significance The temple in rock- cut architecture is an early example of Cholan Art, continuing the tradition of the Pallavas. The individual images retrieved from the place are maintained in the Pudukottia Government Museum. The hundred pillared Nrita Mandapa has sculpted pillars, a typical of Vijayanaagar art. The bronze images in temple are earliest specimen of exquisite sculpted images in South Indian art. The Somaskanda bronze with Shiva and Parvathi, with their child Skanda is the most prominent among the bronzes in the temple.

The story is demonstrated from a diary of Thi·ªÅu evolving his daily life and thoughts. Thi·ªÅu is a 7th grader who lives in a poor countryside with his younger brother named T∆∞·ªùng. T∆∞·ªùng is a lovely, generous and nice boy who loves his brother a lot; he especially loves playing with animals including bugs even. He is an introvert and loves reading many books and folk tales, especially the story of C√≥c T√≠a (Purple Toad), therefore he pets a toad under his bed and names it \\"Cu C·∫≠u\\". On the other hand, Thi·ªÅu is a mischievous, extroverted boy who has been unintentionally letting T∆∞·ªùng take all the blame for his tricks. Although being selfish on the outside, deep down Thi·ªÅu still loves his brother. The brothers often hang around playing many traditional games for kids and make many memories out of it. The story also broadens the relationship between the brothers and people in their village, including their classmates and families.

His only sorrow must be his ill fated love caused by losing one of his arms. Uncle ƒê√†n loves Vinh, a girl who is the daughter of Thi·ªÅu's scary teacher and also lives in the same village. One of Thi·ªÅu's classmates is S∆°n, who is 3 years older but still in the same class with Thi·ªÅu due to his bad grades. S∆°n is a muscular boy who is extremely naughty with much misbehavior.

He doesn't care enough to stop his brother's toad from being taken and killed for its meat. The incident haunts Thi·ªÅu as he watches T∆∞·ªùng mourn over the toad not knowing his big brother is partially responsible. The flood arrives and the village is drowned, once it withdraws, the village is left with poverty and a lack of crop. Thi·ªÅu, T∆∞·ªùng and M·∫≠n discover that Uncle ƒê√†n and Vinh have already planned for an escape from their family.

The locality is planned in a radial grid and the site for the school is curved along the longer edges. Of the 2-acre plot, the school occupies approximately 1,60,000 sq ft. of floor space.

Graphical representations of symbols, alphabets and numbers became an inspiration for the screen. Younger children relate to simple lines as letters of the alphabet and as they grow, abstractions of the same would start to look more like alpha, gamma and pi. Thus, Familiar shapes and symbols were used to create a bespoke stencil screen around the existing unremarkable building mass. The facade not only provides shade to the classrooms from the harsh sun but also lends the school a distinct identity. 488 panels, made of Fibre-Reinforced Plastic (FRP), measuring 3.2 x 3.2 meters envelop each of the two academic blocks. 13 different panels were designed with a combination of small and large alphabets, numbers and symbols.

The armies of Yohannes and Isma'il met at Gundet on the morning of 16 November 1875. After the defeat at Gundet, the Egyptians sent a much larger well-armed force to invade from the north.

It is in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin. This work is considered the most impressive of a dozen depictions Ruisdael made of Bentheim Castle. In the early 1650s he travelled with Nicolaes Berchem to Bentheim, in western Germany, just over the border. This work, called the Dublin version to distinguish it from the others, all with similar titles and all depicting the castle at various heights of hilltop, is significant in the series in that it puts the castle on top of a wooded mountain.

Schippers at the Amsterdam Municipal Poetry Award, 8 December 1967 K. Schippers (the pseudonym of Gerard Stigter) is a Dutch poet, prose writer and art critic. He was born in Amsterdam on 6 November 1936. Credited with having introduced the readymade as a poetic form, the whole of his work is dedicated to looking at everyday objects and events in a new way.Mourits, p.121 Career Together with J. Bernlef and other friends, Schippers founded the Neo-Dadaist magazine Barbarber (1958‚Äì71). In the years that followed the launch he co-operated with Bernlef in editing selections from the magazine and, in Een cheque voor de tandarts (A cheque for the dentist, 1967), in commenting on the ancestry of its literary stance. Another binding link with Bernlef is the fact that in 1960 they married twin sisters, the daughters of the Dutch poet Ed. Hoornik (1910‚Äì70). As an art critic, Schippers has also written studies of the history of Dada in the Netherlands (Holland Dada, 1974) and of the bride theme in the work of Marcel Duchamp (De bruid van Marcel Duchamp, 2010), as well as writing his own text inspired by the work of Man Ray (Het formaat van Man Ray, 1979) and editing the experimental poems of Theo van Doesburg (Nieuwe woordbeeldingen. Verzamelde gedichten van I.K. Bonset, 1975). Among the literary awards he has gained have been the 1966 Amsterdam Municipal poetry prize for his second collection of poetry, Een klok en profil; the 1983 Multatuli Prize for his third novel Beweegredenen; the 1995 and 1999 Silver Griffin for his plays for children; and the 1996 P.C. Hooft Award for his work as a whole. After his selected poems of 1980, he published no new collections until 2011. In 2014 his collection Buiten Beeld was chosen as the gift volume to accompany other poetry purchases during National Poetry Week in the Netherlands and Flanders.Poetry International Crossing boundaries When Schippers helped launch Barbarber, it was called a ‚Äòmagazine for texts‚Äô (tijdschrift voor teksten) and was distrustful of the work of the preceding 1950s generation of experimental poets on the grounds that their concern had been more with aesthetics than with the nature of reality, which ought to be the real focus of poetry. The anti-poetic gestures appearing there were inspired by Dada and eventually introduced ‚Äòliterary ready-mades‚Äô in order to call into question the boundary between art and reality. One item provided by Schippers was a newspaper item about a lost tortoise.Dutch National Library The same iconoclastic attitudes continued into his later work. In Buiten Beeld (Beyond the frame, 2014), for example, bare dots on the two-dimensional page are titled ‚ÄúThe position of moles in the sky‚Äù, drawing a parallel between a conventional star map and molehills in the earth merely by the suggestiveness of the title alone.Poetry International Though much of his later poetic work has an apparent form, it very seldom rhymes or makes use of metaphor and its main purpose is to draw attention to the ordinary and everyday. In ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù Schippers affirms that ‚Äúwhite is noticed/ because it‚Äôs not alone/ on the paper‚ÄùTranslated by Pieter Nijmeijer, 10 Lowland Poets, Dremples 7/8, 1979, , p.11; there is also a video interpretation of the Dutch text This same approach is confirmed too in Buiten Beeld in the poem ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù, with its final appeal to a child's vision: ‚ÄòLook at [letters]/ like a five- year-old/ who has never/ read a word‚Äô.Translated by David Colmer Such a fresh way of looking at ordinary things from unfamiliar angles was suggested by Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs saying that ‚Äòwhen a clock is seen from the side it no longer tells the time‚Äô, from which Schippers took the title of his second poetry collection, Een klok en profil (A clock in profile, 1965). An urban mural by Klaas Gubbels incorporating a poem by Schippers Eventually he also extended this vision into his novels. Eerste Indrukken (First impressions, 1979) is subtitled ‚Äòthe memoirs of a three-year-old‚Äô, where nothing unusual happens to the youngster, but it is related from an unusual, fresh perspective. Some poems were recycled into these novels. The sentence ‚ÄúTake a good look around you and you see everything is coloured‚Äù in his novel Bewijsmateriaal (Material Evidence, 1978) first appeared as a 4-line poem in his collection Een vis zwemt uit zijn taalgebied (A fish swims out of its meaning area, 1976).Mourits, p.122 The four sentences of De la grammaire anglaise et hollandaise avec un coup de th√©√¢tre triste,Dremples 7/8 (1979) p/13 which are the same in English as in Dutch, are repeated in Zilah (2002).Dutch Foundation for Literature In general, the fantastic situations in these novels flow from a single initial supposition or macguffin. In Zilah (2002) it is the consequences that follow when the heroine buys the rights to the Dutch language as a trademark name; in Waar was je nou (Where were you, 2005), it is the ability to enter a photograph and relive one's own past. In the case of the poem repeated in Bewijsmateriaal, there was another form of recycling when it was put to use by the artist Klaas Gubbels. There the lines accompany one of the artist's typical coffee pots on a Nijmegen house-end. The mural dates from 1991 and was the winner of the Jurylid Chabotprijs.Gubbels biography Later the two co-operated in a joint print-poem art publication, De kan (1995).Online description Prizes *1966 - Po√´zieprijs van de gemeente Amsterdam *1980 - Cestoda-prijs *1983 - Multatuliprijs *1990 - Jan Greshoffprijs for Museo sentimental *1995 - Zilveren Griffel for 's Nachts op dak *1996 - P.C.

These images are similar in style to those found in the British Library's Queen Mary Psalter, which is also from the early fourteenth century. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century the manuscript was owned by the Sherbrooke family of Oxton, Nottinghamshire, and it is from their library that the Sherbrooke Missal takes its name. It was then the property of the artist William Morris, before being sold twice by Sotheby's, first to Henry Yates Thompson in 1898, and then to Gwendoline Davies in 1920. It was donated to the National Library of Wales by Margaret Davies in 1951, and it is now part of the General Manuscript Collection, with the catalogue number NLW MS 15536E. File:F. 1r.

In a racing career which lasted from July 1981 until June 1982, she won four of her six races and finished second one. As a two-year-old she was rated the best filly of her age in Ireland after being unbeaten in four starts. After winning two minor races she was awarded the Moyglare Stud Stakes on the disqualification of Sweet Side and then traveled to England to win the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following year she finished second in the Irish 1,000 Guineas but was retired after running poorly in the Coronation Stakes. She had some success as a broodmare, although she produced no major winners. Background Woodstream was a \\"strong, very attractive\\" chestnut mare with a large white star and two white socks bred in Maryland by Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud. She was one of many important winners sired by Northern Dancer, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1964 before becoming one of the most successful breeding stallions in Thoroughbred history. Woodstream was the third foal of Rule Formi, an unraced daughter of the Argentinian champion Forli, making her a half-sister to Jaazeiro. Rule Formi's dam, Miss Nasrullah, was a half-sister to Prince John. The filly was sent to race in Europe where she was trained by Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Racing career 1981: two-year-old season Woodstream began her racing career in July 1981 when she contested a maiden race over six furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse and won by a length from Miss Lillian. In August she was moved up in distance for a minor race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse. Ridden by Pat Eddery she took the race by a neck from Prince's Polly, appearing to win more easily than the margin indicated. On her next appearance, Woodstream was moved up in class and started favourite for the Group Two Moyglare Stud Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh. She moved up to dispute the lead approaching the final furlong and looked the likely winner but was strongly challenged by the 50/1 outsider Sweet Side and beaten into second place. The winner however, had veered left and right in the closing stages, hampering both Woodstream and the third-placed finisher Santa Roseanna: after a stewards inquiry Sweet Side was demoted to third and the race was awarded to Woodstream. On her final appearance of the season, Woodstream was sent to England for the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 30 September, which, at the time, the race was the only Group One contest in either Britain or Ireland restricted to juvenile fillies. With Eddery again in the saddle, started the 5/2 joint-favourite alongside the British-trained On the House. The other fancied runners in the thirteen runner field were Hollow Heart, Plum Bold and Admiral's Princess. Woodstream raced in mid-division before moving forward in the last quarter mile and went to the front a furlong out alongside On the House. In the closing stages she drew away from the British filly and won by one and a half lengths with Admiral's Princess a length and a half away in third. 1982: three-year-old season Woodstream was aimed at the 1000 Guineas at The Oaks in 1982, but took longer than expected to reach full fitness and missed the former race, which was won in her absence by On the House. She made her seasonal debut in the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh on 22 May and started 7/2 second favourite behind On the House in a twenty-four runner field. Woddstream appeared to be going well when moving into fourth with a quarter mile left to run but then began to hang to the right and was beaten a length by Prince's Polly, with On the House a short head away in third place. Her connections opted to bypass the Oaks and the filly made her next appearance in the Coronation Stakes (then a Group Two race) at Royal Ascot in June. She sweated up badly before the race, fought against her jockey's attempts to restrain her in the early stages and eventually finished seventh of the eight runners behind Chalon. She never raced again and was retired at the end of the season. Assessment In the International Classification for 1981, Woodstream was the top-rated two-year- old filly trained in Ireland and the fifth-best filly of her age in Europe. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 113, nine pounds below their top-rated two-year-old filly Circus Ring. In the following year she was rated 108 by Timeform and was the third highest rated three-year-old filly in the Irish Free Handicap. Breeding record Woodstream was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She was exported to Japan in 1993. She produced at least sixteen foals and nine winners between 1984 and 2003: *Lord Chancellor, a chestnut colt, foaled in 1984, sired by Alydar. Unraced. *Alpine Stream, bay filly, 1985, by Seattle Slew. Failed to win in two races. *Seattle Centre, bay colt, 1986, by Seattle Slew. Won one race. *Tributary, brown filly, 1987, by Seattle Slew.

It was designed to valorise Raghunatha, situating his career as a type of the life of RƒÅma-Vi·π£·πáu-K·πõ·π£·πáa.Davesh Soneji, Performing Satyabhimi: Text, Context, Memory and Mimesis in Telugu-Speaking South India (unpublished PhD thesis, McGill University 2004), p. 53. The first few cantos of the poem invoke Raghunatha, seeking his patronage and assistance, and praise his generosity, piety, and intellect. In RaghunƒÅthƒÅbhyudaya Raghunadha Nayaka was praised as a Kamma Vakkana. Canto 4 presents Raghunatha's ancestry and the subsequent cantos discuss his early life and military successes. He succeeds his father Achuthappa Nayak in canto 8 and continues with his military exploits. The last two cantos focus on the cultural activities and artistic achievements of his court, with a colophon in which RƒÅmabhadrƒÅmbƒÅ emphasises her own merits. The poem was first brought to scholarly attention by S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar in 1919, after he found it in November 1916.RƒÅmabhadrƒÅmbƒÅ, 'RaghunƒÅthƒÅbhyudayam', in Sources of Vijayanagar History (Selected and Edited for the University), ed. by S.

The poem was fiercely criticised by an early reviewer of the first scholarly edition, who claimed that RƒÅmabhadrƒÅmbƒÅ 'had thoroughly assimilated the art of composing a poem of surpassing tediousness and consisting of the most abject flattery of her royal patron' and did not think the poem would have any interest to historians.J.

Other features include the creation of a bill of materials, Gerber files and pick and place files and documentary outputs in PDF, PNG and SVG formats. EasyEDA allows the creation and editing of schematic diagrams, SPICE simulation of mixed analogue and digital circuits and the creation and editing of printed circuit board layouts and, optionally, the manufacture of printed circuit boards. Subscription-free membership is offered for public plus a limited number of private projects. The number of private projects can be increased by contributing high quality public projects, schematic symbols, and PCB footprints and/or by paying a monthly subscription. Registered users can download Gerber files from the tool free of charge; but for a fee, EasyEDA offers a PCB fabrication service. This service is also able to accept Gerber file inputs from third party tools. History In June 2010, Dillon He and Eric Cui started a survey of EDA tools for a hardware project of their own. The search for an EDA tool capable of schematic capture, circuit simulation and printed circuit board layout saw limited success, and He concluded that designing their own EDA tool would be beneficial. Their key goals were that the tools be platform independent, free, easy to learn and to use. The first version of the toolsuite appeared online in August 2013 and since officially launching in March 2014 the tool has developed rapidly with several major revisions and enhancements EasyEDA first received external investment in January and attracted more in November 2015. Features EasyEDA is an integrated browser-based tool for schematic capture, SPICE circuit simulation, based on Ngspice, and PCB layout. Import from Altium Designer, CircuitMaker, Eagle, Kicad and LTspice file formats as well as generic SPICE netlists is supported. SPICE netlists can be exported to third party simulation tools and export of PCB netlists in Altium, PADS and FreePCB formats is also supported. The ability to import LTspice schematics and symbols provides a useful way to port schematics to PCB layout without having to redraw them from scratch. Once Gerber files of a completed PCB design have been downloaded and checked - using a third party Gerber viewer - the user is free to choose a PCB manufacturer or, for a fee, they can submit the Gerbers directly to EasyEDA for manufacture. Alternatively, printable PCB layer image output is also supported in PDF, PNG and SVG formats for home PCB etching.

Born in Nottingham, Proctor left school at the age of twelve, and when he was fifteen, he travelled to France and joined Giuseppe Garibaldi's Army of the Vosges; fighting in the Franco-Prussian War. Although he was captured and taken prisoner, he was deported back to the United Kingdom on the grounds of his nationality and youth.Grimsby Labour Party History, \\"Adoption of Labour's First Parliamentary Candidate \\" Proctor returned to Nottingham where he completed an apprenticeship in engineering, before travelling to Australia. He returned to Nottingham once more within a few years, and devoted much of his time to the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, becoming its chairman within a few years. He also joined the Social Democratic Federation.Mary Hilson, Political Change and the Rise of Labour in Comparative Perspective, p.109 In 1890, Proctor moved to Plymouth to work in the Devonport Dockyard. He had an immediate impact on local labour organisation, founding a trades council in 1892. Despite early disagreements over whether to support Liberal-Labour candidates or only independent labour ones, it gradually grew in strength and hosted the national Trades Union Congress (TUC) in 1899. Proctor had joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in the 1890s, and hosting the TUC enabled him to propose a special congress, early the following year, to discuss founding a new political party, independent of the Liberal Party, to contest local and national elections. This proposal gained support and, although Proctor had limited further involvement, the congress went ahead and founded the Labour Representation Committee (LRC).Logie Barrow and Ian Bullock, Democratic Ideas and the British Labour Movement, 1880‚Äì1914, p.128 In 1903, Proctor was adopted as the LRC candidate for the 1906 general election in Great Grimsby.

He served as a judge of the High Court of New Zealand from 1998 until 2009. He also served as a justice of the High Court of the Cook Islands from his appointment in April 2005 until his retirement in May 2012. In 2011, Nicholson became the first judge to prosecute citizens of the Cook Islands for counterfeit DVD piracy. Biography Nicholson was born in Turua, a small village on New Zealand's Hauraki Plains, on 21 June 1936. He received his education at St. Stephen's School in Bombay and at Thames High School, before studying at Auckland University College, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1960. Later that year he was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand (at that time known as the Supreme Court). He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1979, and served as the vice president of the New Zealand Law Society from 1989 to 1990. During his career as a barrister, Nicholson appeared in some of New Zealand's most high-profile cases, including the Bassett Road machine gun murders trials (as a junior to prosecutor Sir Graham Speight), and as defence counsel in the trial of David Wayne Tamihere for the murder of Urban H√∂glin and Heidi Paakkonen. Nicholson worked on commissions of inquiry, including the 1973 inquiry into the \\"Parnell fumes panic\\", and the inquiry into the cancer treatment methods of Milan Brych. He also represented the estates of passengers killed in the crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 at the subsequent Royal Commission in 1980, and reported on the fatal shooting of Paul Chase by police in 1983. He was appointed as a District Court judge in 1995 and a Youth Court judge in 1996. In 1998, Nicholson was appointed as a judge of the High Court of New Zealand, and remained on the bench until 2009. In the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours, Nicholson was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a judge of the High Court. In April 2005, Nicholson was appointed to the High Court of the Cook Islands, and oversaw a range of both civil and criminal trials during his tenure. He proposed a legislative amendment following a legal drafting error that almost led to the dismissal of charges against a defendant accused of growing cannabis. In 2009 and 2010, Nicholson presided over the longest criminal trial in the history of the Cook Islands, which became known as \\"Operation Slush\\". Three defendants‚ÄîNorman George, Chris Vaile and Charles Koronui‚Äîfaced numerous conspiracy and corruption charges spanning from 1999 to 2002, but were all acquitted in April 2010. In 2011, Nicholson became the first judge to prosecute Cook Islanders for DVD piracy. He also presided over the trial of Tea O Tangaroa Tekeu Uea, a Cook Islands Christian Church minister accused of the indecent assault of three teenage girls. Nicholson retired from the High Court of the Cook Islands in May 2012. He also served as the chairman of the Cook Islands Media Council. Nicholson died in Takapuna on 31 October 2015 at the age of 79.

This technique was originally conceived by Adolf Goetzberger and Armin Zastrow in 1981. The coexistence of solar panels and crops implies a sharing of light between these two types of production. Sheep and several crops can benefit from these systems, including fruit production.  History  In 1981, Adolf Goetzberger and Armin Zastrow were the first to propose the concept of a dual use of arable land for solar energy production and plant cultivation in order to improve overall production. They were addressing the ongoing discussion on the competition for the use of arable land between solar energy production and crop. The light saturation point is the maximum amount of photons absorbable by a plant species. As more photons won‚Äôt increase to the rate of photosynthesis, Akira Nagashima suggest to combine PV systems and farming to use the excess of light. He developed the first prototypes in Japan in 2004. The term ‚Äúagrivoltaic‚Äú was used for the first time in a publication in 2011. The concept is known under several names in the world: \\"agrophotovoltaics\\" in Germany, \\"agrovoltaics\\" in Italy, \\"solar sharing\\" in Asia. Facilities such as photovoltaic greenhouses can be considered as agrivoltaic systems. As one of the objectives of the agricultural systems is to preserve agricultural land, it is generally considered that agricultural production in agrivoltaic should not be neglected. The constraints on agricultural production vary from one country to another according to the legislation or according to the type of crop and to the objectives of the agrivoltaic system (optimization of the volume of agricultural production, quality of agricultural products, energy production...).  Agrivoltaics in the world   Asia  Japan has been the forerunner in the development of open field agrivoltaics worldwide since 2004. Between 2004 and 2017, more than 1,000 open field power plants were developed in Japan.  Japan  In 2004 in Japan, Akira Nagashima developed a demountable structure that he tested on several crops. Removable structures allow farmers to remove or move facilities based on crop rotations and their needs. Increasingly large plants with capacities of several MW have been developed since 2004 with permanent structures and dynamic systems. For example, a 35 MW power plant, installed on 54 ha of crops, was commissioned in 2017. The shading rate of this plant is 50%, a value higher than the 30% shading usually used on Japanese agrivoltaic power plants. Farmers cultivate, among others, ginseng, ashitaba and coriander. Soon, the island of Ukujima should host a solar power plant of 480 MW, part of which will be agrivoltaics. The project has been under study since 2013 and the various partners have signed an agreement for the start of construction in 2019. To obtain permission to exploit solar panels over crops, Japanese law requires farmers to maintain at least 80% of agricultural production.  China  In 2016, the Italian company REM TEC built a 0.5 MWp agrivoltaic power plant in Jinzhai County, Anhui Province. Chinese companies have developed several GWs of solar power plants combining agriculture and solar energy production, either photovoltaic greenhouses or open-field installations. For example, in August 2016, Panda Green Energy installed solar panels over vineyards in Turpan, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The 0.2 MW plant was connected to the grid. The project was audited in October 2017 and the company has received approval to roll out its system across the country. Projects of several tens of MW have been deployed. For instance, in 2016, in Jiangxi Province, a 70 MW agrivoltaic plant was installed on agricultural and forestry crops. In 2017 the Chinese company Fuyang Angkefeng Optoelectronic Technology CoÔºõLtd. established a 50 KWp agrivoltaic power plant test site in Fuyang city, Anhui Province. The system leverages a novel technology concept for agrivoltaic (see below0. It was developed at the Institute of Advanced technology of the university of Science and Technology of China in Hefei under the guidance of Prof. Wen Liu, who is the inventor of this new technology. For 30 years, the Elion Group has been trying to combat desertification in the Kubuqi region. Among the techniques used, agrivoltaic systems were installed to protect crops and produce electricity. Regarding the equipment for the desert areas, Wan You-Bao patented in 2007 on a shade system to protect crops in the desert. The shades are equipped with solar panels.  South Korea  South Korea is conducting initial tests of agrivoltaic power plants, drawing on the Japanese example since 2017. Agrivoltaic is one of the solutions studied to increase the share of renewable energies in Korea's energy mix. Their goal is to reach 20% renewable energy in 2030 against 5% in 2017. SolarFarm.Ltd has built the first agrivoltaic power plant in South Korea in 2016 and has produced rice. Since then, Korea adapted agrivoltaic power plant has been developed and is constantly being tested. In January of 2019 Korea Agrivoltaic Association was established to promote and develop South Korea's agrivoltaic industry.  India  Projects for isolated sites are being studied by Amity University in Noida, northern India. A study published in 2017 looks at the potential of agrivoltaism for vineyards in India. The agrivoltaic systems studied in this article consist of solar panels intercalated between crops to limit shading on plants. This study suggests that agrivoltaic systems can significantly increase the incomes of Indian farmers.  Malaysia  The Universiti Putra Malaysia, which specializes in agronomy, launched experiments in 2015 on plantations of Orthosiphon stamineus (Java tea). It is a fixed structure installed on an experimental surface of about 0.4 ha.  Vietnam  Fraunhofer ISE has deployed their agrivoltaic system on a shrimp farm located in Bac Li√™u in the Mekong Delta. According to this institute, the results of their pilot project indicate that water consumption has been reduced by 75%. Their system would offer other benefits such as shading for workers as well as a lower and stable water temperature for better shrimp growth.  Europe  In Europe in the early 2000s, photovoltaic greenhouses are emerging. Part of the greenhouse roof is replaced by solar panels. In Austria and then in Italy, open field agrivoltaic systems appeared from 2007, followed by France and Germany.  Austria  In 2004, G√ºnter Czaloun proposed a photovoltaic tracking system with a rope rack system. The first prototype is built in South Tyrol in 2007 on a 0.1 ha area. The cable structure is more than five meters above ground. A new system was presented at the Intersolar 2017 conference in Munich. This technology is potentially less expensive than other open field systems because it requires less steel.  Italy  In 2009 and 2011, agrivoltaic systems with fixed panels were installed above vineyards. Experiments showed a slight decrease of the yield and late harvests. In 2009, the Italian company REM TEC develops a dual-axis solar tracking system. In 2011 and 2012, REM TEC built several MWp of open field agrivoltaic power plants. The solar panels are installed 5 m above the ground to operate agricultural machinery. The cover of photovoltaic panels shadow is less than 15% to minimize the effect on the crops. They are the first to offer automated integrated shading net systems into the supporting structure. REM TEC also designs dual-axis solar tracking systems integrated into greenhouse structure. The control of the position of the solar panels would optimize the greenhouse microclimate.  France  = Photovoltaic greenhouses = Since the beginning of the 2000s, photovoltaic greenhouses have been built in France. Photovoltaic greenhouse designers continue to improve both agricultural production and power generation. For instance, the concept of Agrinergie has been developed by Akuo Energy since 2007. The first power plants consisted of alternation of crops and solar panels. The new power plants are greenhouses. In 2017, the Tenergie company began the deployment of photovoltaic greenhouses with an architecture that diffuses light in order to reduce the contrasts between light bands and shade bands created by solar panels. = Open field systems = Since 2009, INRA, IRSTEA and Sun'R have been working on the Sun'Agri program. A first prototype installed in the field with fixed panels is built in 2009 on a surface of 0.1 ha in Montpellier. Other prototypes with 1-axis mobile panels were built in 2014 and 2017. The aim of these studies is to manage the microclimate received by plants and to produce electricity, by optimizing the position of the panels. and to study how radiation is distributed between crops and solar panels. The first agrivoltaic plant in the open field of Sun'R is built in the spring of 2018 in Tresserre in the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales. This plant has a capacity of 2.2 MWp installed on 4.5 ha of vineyards. It will evaluate, on a large scale and in real conditions, the performance of the Sun'Agri system on vineyards. In 2016, the Agrivolta company specialized on the agrivolta√Øcs. After a first prototype built in 2017 in Aix-en-Provence, Agrivolta deployed its system on a plot of the National Research Institute of Horticulture (Astredhor) in Hy√®res. Agrivolta won several innovation prizes Agrivolta presented its technology at the CES in Las Vegas in January 2018.  Germany  In 2011, the Fraunhofer Institute ISE started a research project on agrivoltaics. Research continues with the APV- Resola project, which began in 2015 and is scheduled to end in 2020. A first prototype of 194.4 kWp is being built in 2016 on a 0.5 ha site belonging to the Hofgemeinschaft Heggelbach cooperative farm in Herdwangen (Baden- W√ºrttemberg). They estimate that such structures will be profitable without government fundings after 2022.  Denmark  The Agronomy Department of the Aarhus University has launched a study project of agrivoltaic system on orchards in 2014.  Croatia  In 2017, Work-ing d.o.o installed a 500 kW open field power plant near Virovitica-Podravina. The agronomic studies are supported by the University of Osijek and the agricultural engineering school of Slatina. The electricity production is used for the irrigation system and agricultural machinery. At first, shade-adapted cultures will be tested under the device.  Americas   USA  In the United States, SolAgra is interested in the concept in collaboration with the Department of Agronomy at the University of California at Davis. A first power plant on 0.4 ha is under development. An area of 2.8 ha is used as a control. Several types of crops are studied: alfalfa, sorghum, lettuce, spinach, beets, carrots, chard, radishes, potatoes, arugula, mint, turnips, kale, parsley, coriander, beans, peas, shallots, mustard ... Projects for isolated sites are also studied. Experimental systems are being studied by several universities: the Biosphere 2 project at the University of Arizona, the Stockbridge School of Agriculture project (University of Massachusetts at Amherst).  Chile  Three 13 kWp agro-photovoltaic systems were built in Chile in 2017. The goal of this project, supported by the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, was to study the plants that can benefit from the shading of the agrivoltaic system. The electricity produced was used to power agricultural facilities: cleaning, packaging and cold storage of agricultural production, incubator for eggs ... One of the systems was installed in a region with a lot of power outages. Methods There are three basic types of agrivoltaics that are being actively researched: solar arrays with space between for crops, stilted solar array above crops and greenhouse solar array. All three of these systems have several variables used to maximize solar energy absorbed in both the panels and the crops. The main variable taken into account for agrivoltaic systems is the angle of the solar panels-called the tilt angle. Other variables taken into account for choosing the location of the agrivoltaic system are the crops chosen, height of the panels, solar irradiation in the area and climate of the area. As for stilted solar arrays above the crops, there is since 2017 a new technology concept which combines concentration photovoltaic with agrivoltaic and wavelength division multiplexing.  Configuration of agrivoltaic systems  There are different configurations of agrivoltaic devices. Goetzberger and Zastrow have studied the conditions for optimizing agrivoltaic installations. Presented in the early 1980s, these conditions still serve as a reference in the definition of agrivoltaic systems: * orientation of solar panels in the south for fixed or east-west panels for panels rotating on an axis, * sufficient spacing between solar panels for sufficient light transmission to ground crops, * elevation of the supporting structure of the solar panels to homogenize the amounts of radiation on the ground. Experimental facilities often have a control agricultural area. The control zone is exploited under the same conditions as the agrivoltaic device in order to study the effects of the device on the development of crops.  Fixed solar panels over crops  The simplest approach is to install fixed solar panels on agricultural greenhouses, above open fields crops or between open fields crops. It is possible to optimize the installation by modifying the density of solar panels or the inclination of the panels. In Japan, agrivoltaic systems generally consist of dismountable light structures with light and small size solar panels to reduce wind resistance.  Dynamic Agrivoltaic  In more elaborate configurations, agrivoltaic system use a tracking system. Solar panels can be controlled to optimize their positioning to improve agricultural production or electricity production. The first dynamic agrivoltaic devices were developed in Japan. The panels are manually adjustable. Farmers can modify the position of the solar panels according to the season or stage of crop development to increase or decrease shading and power generation. Japanese companies have also developed several more sophisticated systems. For example, crops grow under systems composed of tables (25 solar panels) fixed dual axis tracker. In 2004, G√ºnter Czaloun proposed a photovoltaic tracking system with a rope rack system. Panels can be oriented to improve power generation or shade crops as needed. The first prototype is built in 2007 in Austria. The company REM TEC has deployed several plants equipped with dual axis tracking system in Italy and China. They have also developed an equivalent system used for agricultural greenhouses. In France, Sun'R and Agrivolta companies are developing single axis tracking systems. According to these companies, their systems can be adapted to the needs of plants. The Sun'R system is east-west axis tracking system. According to this company, complex models of plant growth, weather forecasts, calculation and optimization software are used. The device from Agrivolta is equipped with south-facing solar panels that can be erased by a sliding system. The Artigianfer company developed a photovoltaic greenhouse whose solar panels are installed on movable shutters. The panels can follow the course of the Sun along an east-west axis. In 2015, Prof. Wen Liu from the university of science and technology in Hefei, China proposed a new concept for agrivoltaic: curved glass panels covered with a dichroitic polymer film transmit selectively wavelength from the sun light, which are necessary for plant photosynthesis (blue and red light). All other wavelengths are reflected and focused on concentration solar cells for power generation. A dual tracking system is comprised for this concentration photovoltaic type of setup. Shadow effects as arising from regular solar panels above the crop field are completely eliminated since the crops receive always the blue and red wavelength necessary for photosynthesis. Several awards have been granted for this new type of agrivoltaic, among others the R&D100; price in 2017. The difficulty of such systems is to find the mode of operation to maintain the good balance between the two types of production according to the goals of the system. Fine control of the panels to adapt shading to the need of plants requires advanced agronomic skills to understand the development of plants. Experimental devices are usually developed in collaboration with research centers. Effects The solar panels of agrivoltaics affects crops and land they cover in ways more than providing shade. Two ways are affecting water flow and heat. They also allow for more revenue per acre to be created. For example, grape farms with appropriate spacing could increase revenue 15 times. Water Flow In experiments testing evaporation levels under PVP for shade resistant crops cucumbers and lettuce watered by irrigation, a 14-29% savings in evaporation was found. Agrivoltaics could be used for crops or areas where water efficiency is imperative. Heat A study was done on the heat of the land, air and crops under solar panels for a growing season. It was found that while the air beneath the panels stayed consistent, the land and plants had lower temperatures recorded. With rising temperature from climate change this may become important for some food crops. Also the solar panels might work better because of the cooling provided by the plants.Solar panels cast shade on agriculture in a good way Ecological Society of America, 2019 Advantages Simulations and studies on agrivoltaics indicate electricity and shade- resistant crop production do not decrease in productivity, allowing both to be simultaneously produced efficiently. Dinesh et al. found lettuce output was found to be comparable in agrivoltaics to monocultures. Agrivoltaics work best for plants that are shade resistant, with potential functioning crops being \\"hog peanut, alfalfa, yam, taro, cassava, sweet potato\\" along with lettuce. Simulations performed by Dupraz et al. found the potential of land productivity to increase by 60-70%. Furthermore, Dinesh et al. found that the value of solar generated electricity coupled to shade-tolerant crop production created an over 30% increase in economic value from farms deploying agrivoltaic systems instead of conventional agriculture.Harshavardhan Dinesh, Joshua M. Pearce, The potential of agrivoltaic systems, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 54, 299-308 (2016). It has been postulated that agrivoltaics would be beneficial for summer crops for the microclimate they create and the side effect of heat and water flow control. Pollination may be improved with insects such as bees. Disadvantages Shade resistant crops are not typically grown in industrial agricultural systems. For instance, wheat crops do not fare well in a low light environment, meaning they would not work with agrivoltaics. Agrivoltaics do not yet work with greenhouses. Greenhouses with half of the roof covered in panels were simulated, and the resulting crop output reduced by 64% and panel productivity reduced by 84%.

The site was excavated between 1976 and 1989 by French archaeologists under the direction of Jean-Louis Huot. The excavations have revealed occupation layers predating those of Eridu, making Tell el-'Oueili the earliest known human settlement in southern Mesopotamia. History of research The site was first noted and surveyed by French scholar Andr√© Parrot, who at the time was working at nearby Larsa. Two small excavation seasons took place in 1976 and 1978, and regular excavations commenced in 1981. Four more seasons took place in every uneven year until 1989. All excavations were directed by French archaeologist Jean-Louis Huot. Tell el-'Oueili and its environment The site measures in diameter and is approximately high. It is located ca. southeast of Larsa in Dhi Qar Governorate, southern Iraq. The environment of 'Oueili is characterized by temperatures that can reach more than 50 ¬∞C in summer and less than 250 mm of annual rainfall, making the area unsuitable for rainfed agriculture. Occupation history Tell el-'Oueili was occupied during the Ubaid period. The excavations have revealed occupation layers dating from Ubaid 0 (6500-5400 BCE) to Ubaid 4. The phase Ubaid 0 was first discovered at this site and was hence provisionally termed 'Oueili-phase.

Early life and education  Born Doris Howes in Canton, Ohio, to Earl Howes and Lillian Roberts, both private investigators, she went to high school in East Canton and graduated as valedictorian. Though she wanted to study medicine, her family could not afford it and she studied dietetics at Ohio State University, graduating in 1943 with a bachelor's degree. She attended the University of Chicago for her doctoral studies and earned her Ph.D. in nutrition in 1947.  Career and research  After obtaining her bachelor's degree, Calloway interned at the Johns Hopkins University Hospital as a dietician in 1944. The following year, she was a research nutritionist at the University of Illinois at Chicago medical school. At UIC, she researched how protein intake and exercise influenced the time people took to recover from surgery. Patients who ate sooner after surgery and had physical activity recovered faster than those who did not. From 1948‚Äì1951, she was a consulting nutritionist at the Medical Associates of Chicago. She then moved to the QM Food and Container Institute, where she was a nutritionist from 1951‚Äì1958, head of the metabolism lab from 1958‚Äì1959, and chief of the nutrition branch from 1959‚Äì1961. While at QM, she worked with the US Army to research the potential of foods to protect against dangerous radiation. She discovered that broccoli can have a protective effect against cancer caused by radiation. She also researched food irradiation and discovered that its effects on nutrient content were similar to heat processing. In 1961 she took a position at the Stanford Research Institute in the department of food science and nutrition, where she stayed until 1963. At Stanford, she created a freeze-dried orange juice product that eventually became Tang. She also worked on developing packaging for space food, gut microbiota, flatulence, and the potential of unicellular organisms as food. During the course of this research, Calloway discovered that lactose intolerance could be diagnosed by a breath test. In 1963, Calloway took a position as a professor of nutrition at the University of California, Berkeley; she retired in 1991 and stayed a professor emerita until she was too affected by Parkinson's disease to work. Her research there focused on diets at different stages of life, particularly the role of nitrogen and the needs of pregnant, menstruating, and lactating people. She also researched malnutrition in Kenya, Egypt, and Mexico, and influenced the nutritional aid policies of organizations and governments worldwide. In particular, she showed that the US food assistance programs for people in poverty and Native American people were not providing adequate nutrition. Her most well-regarded work, the \\"Penthouse Study\\", investigated the metabolism of volunteers living in isolation for weeks at a time and used innovative, meticulous methods to measure their metabolism over 17 years of experiments. This research was used to set the Recommended Daily Intake values for nutrients and helped NASA determine dietary needs in space. Her research showed that previous nutritional requirements for protein were an overestimate and that excess protein was excreted. Doris was a leader in her profession and advised many students of nutrition at UCB. She remains as a leader in nutrition. She served a turn as a provost at the university from 1981‚Äì1987, the first woman to take that role at Berkeley, and consulted for the United Nations in 1971 and 1981. Calloway also consulted for the National Institutes of Health with the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolic, and Digestive Diseases, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, and the United States National Research Council. While a provost at Berkeley, she founded its program in Peace and Conflict Studies and worked to mentor and hire more women and people of color at the university, hiring its first woman dean and its first African-American dean.  Personal life  Doris Calloway married her first husband, Nathaniel Calloway, in 1946. She had a son, David, while in graduate school and a daughter, Candice, shortly after earning her Ph.D. Nathaniel became a politician in Chicago and the couple divorced in 1956. She married nutritionist Robert Nesheim in 1981.  Death and legacy  Calloway died of Parkinson's disease in 2001, survived by her husband, Robert Nesheim, and their two children. She was remembered by her colleagues for her groundbreaking research, professionalism, and public service. The University of California, Berkeley created an endowed chair in her name in 1999.  Honors and awards  Calloway held several positions in academic societies and with scientific journals and won \\"all of the most notable awards in nutrition\\": * \\"Man of the Year\\", US Army (1959) * Associate editor, Nutrition Reviews (1962‚Äì1968) * President, American Institute of Nutrition (1982‚Äì1983) * Honorary doctorate, Tufts University (1992) * Berkeley Citation, University of California, Berkeley (1992) * Faculty Research Lecture, UC Berkeley (1992) * Bristol-Myers Squibb/Mead Johnson Award for Distinguished Achievement in Nutrition * Conrad Elvehjem Award, American Institute of Nutrition * Fellow, American Institute of Nutrition * Fellow, International Union of Nutritional Sciences * Fellow, National Academy of Medicine * Member, Human Biology Council  Publications   * Editor, Nutrition and Physical Fitness (1966‚Äì1984)  References  Further reading * 1923 births 2001 deaths People from Canton, Ohio Diet food advocates American women nutritionists Ohio State University alumni University of Chicago alumni University of California, Berkeley faculty 20th-century American women scientists 20th-century American scientists ","title":"Doris Calloway"},{"id":"48680645","text":"Jean-Baptiste Natama in 2015.

Encyclopedia of Indian Wars: Western Battles and Skirmishes, 1850-1890. Mountain Press Publishing Company (August 10, 2003). pp. 163-164. The raid was one of the numerous January raids committed by the Cheyenne and their Indian allies as retaliation for the Sand Creek massacre that happened on November 29, 1864 during the Colorado War. After their victory at the Battle of Julesburg, the Indians raided up and down the South Platte River valley. Among the ranches the Indians attacked was the American Ranch, in which a white family and some of their workers perished before the Cheyenne set their sights on Godfrey's ranch nearby. Godfrey learned of the Indian's upcoming attack and fortified his ranch together with his family and ranch hands. At night, Godfrey estimated that 130 Indian warriors surrounded and attacked his ranch. The men inside managed to hold off them off the whole night. By morning, one of Godfrey's men managed to sneak out of the siege and call for help from the U.S. cavalry, which forced the Indians to finally retreat. The ranch, though burned and having lost some of its horses, remained standing and Godfrey's stand was successful. Godfrey christened his ranch as Fort Wicked. Background The attack was part of a larger conflict in Colorado between white settlers and their neighboring Indian tribes. Tension arose when both parties started arming themselves because of distrust that stemmed from atrocities committed by both sides. Many Indians, who sided with the Dog Soldiers society, started raiding military outposts and settlements throughout the territory.Hyde, George E. (1968). Life of George Bent Written from His Letters. Ed. by Savoie Lottinville. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press. pp. 168‚Äì195 . In retaliation, a Colorado militia consisting of white volunteers attacked a Cheyenne village and killed over 200 Indians, including women and children. This would set up many of the war‚Äôs future events, and enraged the Indians who further increased their raids, focusing much of them on the Colorado ranching business. Ranches, farms and cattle drives were soon raided upon in the span of a month. The raids weren't just a retaliation in the Indian's part, they were also important for them to gather resources such as horses. Holon Godfrey heard of the Indian's warpath coming towards them after a raid on American Ranch occurred a night before which killed almost an entire family of white settlers. Godfrey quickly took action to fortify his ranch in order to avoid suffering the same fate. He surrounded his ranch with 6-foot tall adobe walls and fireports, as well as well-placed shooting nests and bucket brigades in case of fire. Together with his wife, cowboys and others who sought refuge, they prepared themselves to stand their ground. Battle In the night of January 15, Godfrey estimated that a band consisting of 130 Lakota and Cheyenne warriors besieged his Ranch. On horseback and encircling the ranch, the Indians tried to punch their way through the well-fortified position. Godfrey's fort repulsed the Indians‚Äô numerous attempts. The women inside loaded the guns, even melting lead bars to make bullets, and the men fired from well-stationed gun ports. November 29, 2015 The Indians managed to break into the corral and steal the horses inside, but Godfrey insisted that his men leave it be as their main priority was to defend those inside. Having their attacks on the main house repulsed, the Indians tried setting fire to the dry grass surrounding the ranch to burn the building down. The defenders quickly put the fire out with buckets of water that were already prepared. At one point, as Godfrey and his men were trying to put out a fire, a warrior suddenly ambushed the rancher by the front. Godfrey shot and kill the Indian with his rifle, before continuing to defend. When the initial attacks failed, the Indians started shooting flaming arrows at the ranch's roof, but these too were extinguished quickly by the ranchers. One of the ranch hands named Perkins volunteered to get help from the outside. He was able to sneak out during the night and sent a telegraph message to Denver asking for help. He managed to contact the military, though only four soldiers accompanied him to the ranch. By morning, the Indians finally gave up and departed before Perkins' reinforcements arrived. Aftermath Between 3-17 Indians were estimated to have been killed by Godfrey and his men during the defense.McDermott, John Dishmont. Circle of Fire: the Indian War of 1865, p. 27 Godfrey christened his ranch as Fort Wicked. His story was published in the New York Tribune and today a historical marker stands near Merino to commemorate the event.Patten, Jennifer.

Cheyenne warrior George Bent, a participant, described the raids and destruction by the Indians of many ranches in the South Platte River valley but he did not mention an attack on Godfrey's Ranch.

He is noted primarily as a pioneer of the first man-made fibre which later became known as Viscose Rayon. The first stocking of \\"artificial silk\\" was made in his Kew laboratory. During the First World War he prospected in India for fresh sources of industrial minerals (particularly tungsten) since the Germans had cornered essential supplies almost everywhere else. He located vast deposits of limestone suitable for making cement, which became a profitable export for India. Elected to the Geological Society of London, he later became the senior fellow. H G Wells and several other notables from that period were among his friends.Daily Telegraph obituary 18 October 1986Devonshire Association obituary 1986 Personal life and family Edwin Beer was born on his grandfather's estate at Hounslow, the son of Samuel Beer, Commodore of the Clan Line, with whom the young Beer travelled more than once to India as a boy. His first voyage was at the age of 7. He was registered at St Dunstan's College, Catford on the opening day of that establishment, and later attended St Paul's School, where G K Chesterton was among his seniors. He was expelled for returning late one autumn term from Calcutta. Beer married his first wife, Margaret Finney in 1922, who accompanied him on all his trips around the world but died of tuberculosis after ten years of marriage. In 1927 he eventually settled in Devon and in 1934, married Phoebe Hill, born in the Prestwich area. The couple had two sons, Michael (born 1935-2020) and Lionel (born 1940). Edwin Beer died on 24 September 1986 aged 107¬Ω, and was reputedly the oldest member of the National Trust. Phoebe died aged 99 on 18 September 2008. Viscose Rayon After a short time working in a public analyst's office and for an East India merchant in the city, Beer joined C F Cross's Viscose Spinning Syndicate at Kew in 1897. He became the chief works chemist, housed in a mews near Kew Gardens railway station and played a key role in the conversion of viscose from a chemical curiosity to a valuable commercial material. The team had discovered viscose but were unable to discover how it might be spun. Beer solved that puzzle with acid fixing treatment to secure the requisite strength, softness and lustre. The silken substance could then be used to create thread suitable for numerous applications in the clothing trade, though further development was needed to make the process reliable. In addition, pyroxyline was introduced from which collodion could be produced in thin sheets, which when shaped and carbonised would be used in electric lamps, textile fabrics and even insulating thread. The first artificial silk stocking was produced in his laboratory there. He exhibited the material in the Paris Exhibition of 1900, where the German Empress ordered a gown made from the new material. In addition he made viscose filaments for electric lamps designed by Edison and Swan. Sir Joseph Swan said the substance looked like artificial silk and it was he who suggested we should manufacture it.Western Morning News, 8 Feb 1982, page 3 Courtaulds eventually bought the patent rights on 22 August 1904 from The Syndicate and Beer found himself redundant without any compensation. At the time, Courtaulds did not appreciate Beer's painstaking efforts in experimenting with Viscose over seven years and almost failed to consolidate their acquisition. As it was a new industry, no textbooks existed to guide them, but the situation was saved when someone found in a cupboard, all the exact and detailed records of Beer's experiments. Later, Edwin Beer became disgruntled by what he perceived as all the \\"incorrect histories\\" of the man-made fibre industries, and in 1962 he and his wife Phoebe published \\"The Beginning of Rayon\\". This book evokes a world where the practice of science was not yet a respectable profession. Beer had to work for long, irregular hours, at even more irregular pay, in a laboratory, formerly a stable, slimy with caustic soda, and reeking of carbon di-sulfide. His Viscose Rayon samples were donated to the Science Museum, Kensington, in 1997. Geology By 1899, aged 20, Edwin Beer was already an established geologist as well as an industrial chemist. In 1908 he took a post in Bombay analysing manganese ores and assaying gold. For a while he was unemployed. \\"Nothing\\", he said, \\"was supposed to be more demeaning in the days of the British Raj than for a white man to be employed in India\\". The following year, on the way to a new job as prospector in India, he was suspected of being a French spy, and arrested. During the First World War, and harassed by further arrests, he continued prospecting in India for fresh sources of industrial minerals (particularly tungsten) vital for Britain's war effort since the Germans had cornered essential supplies almost everywhere else. He also filled in the last blank space of the geological map of India for which he was awarded the Silver Medal of the Mining & Geological Institute of India in 1918. Beer located 13 vast deposits of limestone suitable for making cement, which became a profitable export for India. In 1924 he visited Tasmania, New Zealand and the Cook Islands. In 1926, after spending some months with a mineral dealer in California, he returned to Devon for a \\"look around\\", and settled there, marrying Phoebe Hill in 1934. He took an interest in the Torquay Natural History Society, taking over the Geological section in 1928. Edwin Beer was elected President of the TNHS for two years in 1949, and in 1965 became Senior Fellow of the Royal Geological Society of London. A reminder of the extraordinary span of Beer's geological career is the story of the specimen from a Devonshire cave that he sent to London for identification, and which evoked a response more than 70 years later that he had indeed identified it correctly as palygorskite. Beer's considerable collection of rocks and minerals went to the Geology Department of the University of Leicester. H G Wells Edwin's first love was Amy Robbins, a girl who afterwards became notorious as the pupil and then the mate of H G Wells, at a time when he was already married to his own cousin. \\"He [HG] never called her Amy, disliking the name,\\" recalled Beer, \\"so invented various names for her, mostly pet-names such as \\"Bits\\". .... A golden girl, to me she was the prettiest one in the world, though I admit that upon re-meeting her during the confused time when HG had both Mrs Robbins and Amy in his house without having broken with his wife and cousin - I did not even recognise her. \\"After my return from India in 1895, Amy wrote me to come down to Woking 24/1/96. I went straight away for HG knew all about the Royal College of Science, and that is where I so much wanted to be, but couldn't afford it. He had brilliantly taken a scholarship, but he warned me of the horrid way the authorities had there - after your free first year. If you assed about and wouldn't work, and wasted in their view the opportunities given you, remembering others more eager but too poor, they would say, 'We simply won't stand it,' and weed you out. \\"This didn't concern me. I was a swot, and only recognised the poignancy of this cautionary tale long after when I read his [HG's] candid biography and learned that HG himself proved a waster and had too late realised with dismay that he was stranded. Hence his struggles, he became a tutor in biology, imbued pupil Amy with unorthodoxy, indoctrinated against marriage. They lived together without any quarrel with his wife, but ostracised by former friends and relations, so that when eventually his cousin got a divorce, against all their principles, they immediately married and through all his eccentricities and unfaithfulness she made him a dutiful efficient wife. 'His early writings in the Jules Verne tradition were written, he said, to gain popularity, and money so that he could let himself go later and give full expression to his freelove and Socialist ideas. Stretching a point, Ann Veronica - if I dare mention such a naughty book - was believed by many to be Amy Robbins. Though most of his books were best-sellers he writes to me in 1896 of his struggles with 'with publishers and such-like evil men.'\\" References Further reading  1879 births 1986 deaths 20th-century British chemists British geologists ","title":"Edwin John Beer"},{"id":"48680904","text":"Pterygoid nerve may refer to: * Medial pterygoid nerve * Lateral pterygoid nerve ","title":"Pterygoid nerve"},{"id":"48680957","text":"Raphespinal tract may refer to: * Anterior raphespinal tract * Lateral raphespinal tract ","title":"Raphespinal tract"},{"id":"48680971","text":"The Clonin Earthworks, also called the Bull Ring, are a series of earthworks, and a National Monument, located in County Offaly, Ireland.

Description and history Gorham Academy was chartered in 1803, and opened its doors in 1806 in the Academy Building as a boys school. Female students were admitted the following year. In 1838 the male and female schools were formally separated, creating the Gorham Female Seminary. In 1847 the school was renamed the Gorham Academy and Teachers Institute, and in 1850 the boys school was closed. It was restarted in 1861, the two schools combining as the Gorham Seminary.

It is based on the viral song \\"Unbelievable\\" and was released in cinemas in Singapore on December 3, 2015, and in Malaysia on January 14, 2016. Plot Eric Kwek Hock Seng (Chen Tianwen), born on the same day as Singapore (August 9, 1965), is abandoned as a baby in a basket with a broccoli, and is taken in by Master Lo Man (Marcus Chin). Lo Man trains Eric to perform in the getai industry, although his looks has caused setbacks. Through the years, he becomes one who is a patriotic Singaporean, and is hugely supportive of national campaigns. When Lo Man's getai business becomes unable to keep up with the times, he decided to add English lyrics to Chinese songs, much to the dismay to Master Lo Man, his friends, Ah Hua and Ah Fei (Jaime Teo and Li Feihui), and frequent getai-goers. At the same time, his poor command of the English language made it worse, resulting in certain phrases, such as \\"stunned like vegetable\\", sounding relatively wonky. However, his disciple, Lawrence (Tosh Zhang), is extremely supportive of this decision, as he is encouraged by his mother to listen to Eric's songs. To show his strong will and persistence in order to fulfil his dreams, Eric is determined to go on an unbelievable musical journey, even at the ripe age of 50.

The film was shot in 15 days starting from 14 September 2015. In order to sing Hokkien songs in the film, Jaime Teo had to watch online videos to brush up on the dialect. Soundtrack It was announced that Mr. Unbelievable would have three to four original songs, as well as other cover songs thrown in. With the release of the teaser trailer, the song \\"ABC\\" was revealed.

Marcus Goh of Yahoo! Movies called it \\"intentionally cheesy and corny, which works well given the subject matter of the film and the different language mediums it spans\\". At the same time, \\"it definitely appeals to the older crowd, but there are elements for the younger audience\\". Jocelyn Lee of The New Paper rated Mr. Unbelievable a 2 out of 5, as it \\"is hindered by a thin plot, and relies on slapstick humour, making it utterly forgettable\\". Box office Mr. Unbelievable collected $25,000 on its opening day, making it the biggest opener among Singaporean films, excluding Chinese New Year- related films.

He was the last Tahirid governor of Tabaristan, ruling there until he was expelled by the rebellion of al-Hasan ibn Zayd in 864, and was afterwards appointed governor of Baghdad and the Sawad in 869, a position which he held until his death in 879.  Governorship of Tabaristan  Sulayman was the son of Abdallah ibn Tahir, the governor of Khurasan from 828 until 845. According to Ibn Isfandiyar, he was appointed as governor of Tabaristan in either 851 or 854, and served there on behalf of the Tahirids of Khursasan, under whose jurisdiction the province fell. During his time in Tabaristan, Sulayman came under the influence of his deputy Muhammad ibn Aws al-Balkhi, who was able to appoint members of his family as governors of the cities and districts of the province. These last dealt with the local inhabitants in an extremely harsh manner, and Sulayman's administration soon became accused of excessive taxation and tyranny.; . By 864, Tahirid misrule in Tabaristan caused the residents of the western districts of the province to rise up in revolt. The rebels, who proclaimed the 'Alid al-Hasan ibn Zayd as their leader, quickly gained strength, drawing support from the people of Tabaristan as well as the Daylamites of neighboring Daylam. After defeating Ibn Aws in a battle they were able to enter Amul in November 864 and then marched on Sariyah, where Sulayman was stationed. Sulayman's troops set out to defend the city, but al-Hasan was able to send a second force to sneak past them and enter Sariyah unopposed. Sulayman then abandoned Tabaristan for Jurjan, leaving al-Hasan in control of the province.; ; ; . Following his flight to Jurjan, Sulayman reassembled his troops and requested reinforcements from his nephew Muhammad ibn Tahir, the governor of Khurasan. He then marched back toward Tabaristan and won a victory over the rebels in early 865, forcing al-Hasan to retreat and allowing him to reoccupy much of the province. His fortunes soon reversed again, however, and after a fresh defeat he again fled to Jurjan. Another expedition was soon after undertaken against the rebels, but this also ended in failure, and Sulayman thereafter gave up his attempts to reclaim the province for good.; .  Governorship of Baghdad  In 869 Sulayman made his way to Iraq, and presented himself before the caliph al- Mu'tazz in Samarra. On March 24, he was appointed as chief of security (shurtah) in Baghdad and the Sawad, replacing his brother Ubaydallah ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir in that position.; . Upon receiving his appointment, Sulayman was forced to deal with the extremely tumultuous state of affairs in Baghdad. News of the forced abdication of al-Mu'tazz and the accession of al- Muhtadi in July 869 was met with hostility by the city's residents, who demanded that the oath of allegiance be given to Abu Ahmad ibn al-Mutawakkil instead, and it was only after a spell of violence that the prayers were made in al-Muhtadi's name. Sulayman also suffered from a shortage of available funds, and found it difficult to meet the demands of the soldiers for the pay of their salaries. Before long, a rivalry broke out between the Baghdadi commanders and Muhammad ibn Aws, who was in charge of the troops that had come with Sulayman from Khurasan and al-Ray, further complicating matters in the city. After several incidents, the Baghdadi troops grew fed up with the depredations and payment demands of Muhammad's soldiers and rioted. A fierce battle broke out between the two factions, ending with Muhammad being defeated and forced to flee the city. Sulayman then stepped in and mollified the Baghdadi commanders, while sending a message to Muhammad instructing him to return to Khurasan. The latter, however, rejected this command and set about plundering the neighborhoods of Baradan and al-Nahrawan to the north of Baghdad, which continued until the central government appeased him by appointing him over the Khurasan Road two and a half months later. Sulayman died in August or September 879, and his positions were assigned to 'Ubaydallah ibn Abdallah in his place.. Excepting the account of his death and a mention at v. 36: p. 72, al-Tabari is silent on Sulayman's activities between 869 and 879. According to , Sulayman was dismissed as governor by 873.

He was often described as an English Utrillo. Hawthorne was born Elwin Hawthorn in Poplar, London, in 1905. one of six sons and a daughter, whose father was a painter and decorator. He left school aged 14, without obtaining any qualifications. With no job, he took art courses at Bethnal Green Men's Institute and the Bow & Bromley Evening Institute. He adopted the spelling \\"Hawthorne\\" from 1928, having being catalogued as such at an East London Art Club exhibition held at Whitechapel Art Gallery. He subsequently worked, for three years, as assistant to Walter Sickert. He exhibited regularly at Lefevre Galleries, who paid him a retainer and had first refusal on his works, and hosted two solo exhibitions. He painted a number of buildings in London, including St John-at-Hampstead, and the since- demolished St Andrew's church in Vanbrugh Park. Further afield, his subjects include North Foreland Lighthouse. One of his painting was shown in the British pavilion at the 1936 Venice Biennale. He served in the army during World War II, which conflict saw the end of his exhibiting. After discharge, he became a wages clerk for Plessey and taught art part-time. Hawthorne died in the King George Hospital at Ilford, Essex, on 15 October 1954 and was survived by his wife, Lilian (ne Leahy; they married in 1937 and she died in 1996), who was also an East London Group artist, and their two children. By the time of his death, aged 49, he had become so disenchanted with the art world that he had used one of his paintings, on board, as a shelf in a coal bunker. It was later recovered by his wife. HIs estate at probate was worth ¬£1442 8s. The author David Buckman has described him as: A number of Hawthorne's works are in public collections in the United Kingdom, including Manchester Art Gallery, the Laing Art Gallery, Ulster Museum, St. Anne's College (University of Oxford), Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum, Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museums, Herbert Art Gallery & Museum, Camden Local Studies and Archives Centre, and the Harris Museum & Art Gallery.

She first appeared in the series sixteen episode \\"My Name Is Joe\\", broadcast on 6 May 2014. Essie arrives at Holby City employed as an agency nurse working on the hospital's AAU and Keller wards. She is characterised as an opinionated nurse who is not afraid to challenge the healthcare system. She is also played as a warm person who makes a good friend for fellow characters and strives to provide excellent patient care. Her introduction to the show was controversial and featured the discovery that her grandfather Joe Goodridge (Julian Glover) was an escaped Nazi war criminal. Essie's main stories have been centric to her relationship with registrar Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett). The show's producer Simon Harper was fond of the pairing but tasked his writing team to create a series of dilemmas for them. Their romance is over-shadowed because Sacha and his family are Jewish and they struggle to accept her due to Joe's actions. Her need to have a child of her own also causes problems. Essie has been involved in other relationship stories featuring registrar Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden), which resulted in marriage, and locum consultant Ben Sherwood (Charlie Condou). Despite this, Sacha always plays a key role in the stories and the pair eventually reunite. Other stories include being held hostage by a patient, unauthorised parenting and a promotion to the hospital's transplant coordinator. One of the character's prominent stories during her later tenure focused on her ovarian cancer diagnosis which resulted in a hysterectomy for her survival. Producers decided to revisit the story in 2020, when Essie learns her cancer has returned. The story was run alongside another cancer storyline featured in Holby City, a decision taken to raise awareness of the statistically high occurrence of cancer in society. The plot leads to Wragg's character being killed off in the show's 1033rd episode, broadcast on 11 August 2020. Casting Wragg's casting was publicised in February 2014. Wragg decided to accept the role because she liked Essie's introduction into the series. The character made her on-screen debut during the series sixteen episode \\"My Name Is Joe\\", which was broadcast on 6 May 2014. Wragg was originally employed by the show as a recurring cast member but was later invited back to play the role on a permanent basis. Wragg also appears as Essie in a two-part crossover episode with Holby City sister show, Casualty, originally broadcast in March 2019. Development Characterisation Essie is characterised as warm nurse with a rebellious side and is not afraid to challenge the healthcare system. She makes a great friend for other characters and a writer from BBC Online branded her \\"a rock\\". She is an independent female with \\"spontaneous, emboldening and fun\\" characteristics. Wragg has labelled Essie as having \\"a big heart\\" and being \\"fantastic\\" at her nursing job. The actress told Hannah Verdier from TV Magazine that she was enjoying playing the character. She explained that \\"Estelle's brilliant at her job and she's trying to get on with it, but now she's starting to question herself. She seems really sorted and then all these cracks appear, which makes her great to play.\\" Essie is an opinionated character and does not shy away from voicing them in medical scenarios. Holby City writers clearly demonstrate this when she is played getting herself into trouble with hospital management for interfering with a high-profile patient's choice of surgery. Introduction Julian Glover who played Essie's grandfather Joe Goodridge. Essie is introduced into the show as the granddaughter of sick patient Joe Goodridge (Julian Glover). Wragg was happy that her character's arrival was not linked to nursing. While Joe is being treated on the ward junior doctor Zosia March (Camilla Arfwedson) becomes suspicious of his role in World War II and makes allegations against him. Zosia wants to discover the truth and prevents Joe from signing a form instructing doctors not to revive him. Essie notices the tension between the two but is relieved when Joe is revived. It is then revealed that he is an escaped Nazi war criminal which shocks Essie because she was completely unaware. Wragg told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that Essie and Joe's storyline was unusual and this attracted her to take the role. The story held consequences for Essie as she is forced to deal with the reality of her grandfather's past. Wragg explained \\"what you find out about Joe is very dramatic, and there are lots of layers for Essie to unravel.\\" Essie was raised by Joe, so she considers him to be her hero and the revelation throws \\"Essie's world into complete disarray\\". Holby City Producer Simon Harper personally decided to create the storyline because he had a European upbringing and studied the Holocaust extensively. He was particularly interested in stories of escaped war criminals and he believed it was inevitable that he would cover the subject during his career. Harper explained to a representative of the Holocaust Educational Trust, that Holby City thrives from stories of character's professional ethics being challenged by their personal demons. He noted that Joe's story worked well against pitted Jewish registrar Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett) having to treat a patient pretending to be \\"a sweet old man\\" despite him helping to kill Jews in World War II. The production team was also keen to portray antisemitism in the spotlight. Harper added Kate Verghese, the story producer, pitched the idea of a Jewish doctor being conflicted by a Nazi. Holocaust survivor Kitty Hart-Moxon visited the set to talk to cast and crew of the storyline's importance. The storyline concluded on-screen as Sacha decided to cancel surgery on Joe because of his Jewish background, despite medical professionals being required to treat all patients equally regardless of their views. Joe's final scenes see Essie and Sacha witness him voicing hateful opinions about the Jewish community. Harper explained that a \\"final act of repentance\\" for the character would have been insulting to survivors. Essie is then offered a job at Holby City hospital and she develops a friendship with colleague Sacha. Wragg described their interactions as \\"lovely\\" and warned their \\"spark\\" could develop into a romance. Rosa Doherty from The Jewish Community said that it was an \\"unlikely bond\\" under the circumstances with her grandfather. But they added that the storyline had viewers \\"gripped\\" to the show. Essie begins working on the AAU ward. But the newspapers become aware of her situation and run the story. A writer for What's on TV stated that \\"Essie is plagued with guilt over Josef's past\\". Sacha decides to take Essie to Wales to escape the negative press attention. Sacha's Jewish mother Esther Levy (Frances Cuka) is furious and orders Sacha to stop seeing Essie. Relationships Sacha Levy When Wragg finished filming her original stint on Holby City, producers discussed the possibility of a future return. In October 2014, it was announced that Wragg had been asked to return to the show on a permanent basis. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy reported that Essie would resume her nursing duties at the hospital and her relationship with Sacha. Of her return Wragg stated: \\"Essie is a such a layered character that I can't wait to see how things unfold once I return. She's a fantastic nurse with a big heart, but a broken life that leaves her unsure of who she is and where she's going. I adore working with Bob Barrett and am very excited to work alongside his big hearted Sacha again, ups and downs regardless. Essie returned to the show during the series seventeen episode titled \\"Squeeze the Pips\\" (7 April 2015). Essie's independent nature is sometimes a problem for Sacha because he likes to feel depended upon. Her \\"slatternly domestic ways\\" annoy him because it reminds him of his daughters. A BBC Online reporter also revealed that Essie secretly struggles to deal with Sacha's two demanding ex-wives and children. When she returns Essie reveals that she slept with another man and Sacha no longer wants to be with her. Essie decides to convince Sacha they should be together. Wragg believed that Essie really loves Sacha and she makes him realise that they want the same things out of life, to be \\"settled and happy\\". Essie later secures a job as the hospital's new Transplant coordinator. The duo's relationship faces fresh problems when Sacha wants Essie to meet his children. She confides in friend and colleague Dominic Copeland (David Ames) that she is not ready. Essie is convinced that Sacha's Jewish family will not accept her because of her grandfather's past. Barrett told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that Sacha underestimates the situation when he asks her. He also does not consider how his relationship may effect his family. The actor added that Sacha needs to stop being possessive and give Essie some space. Sacha's Wragg told a What's on TV reporter that Essie knows it will be inevitable that Sacha's children will be a part of her life but she is not ready. She is enjoying having Sacha to herself in the early stages of their romance. The actress added \\"the idea of being the 'stepmum' is a bit frightening for her.\\" Essie tries to make excuses not to see them and Dominic notices her reluctance and makes it more difficult for her to be dishonest. Essie realises she must tell Sacha the truth. Wragg added \\"Essie realises the situation isn't going to go away. She just wanted to enjoy being in love for a bit longer before the reality of family life kicked in.\\" Essie decides to forget her doubts and go ahead with spending time with Sasha's family. Months later on-screen Essie's feelings completely changed and she announces that she wants a baby. A What's on TV reporter said the development left Sacha \\"stunned\\". Wragg told Laura- Jayne Tyler of Inside Soap that the realisation was unexpected for Essie, but she is of the age and she realises the joy having children creates for women. The actress added that Essie is \\"madly in love with Sacha\\" and the physical need for a child takes over. Sasha had already been married twice and shares children with both ex-partners. Wragg believed Sacha has \\"the best of both worlds\\" and does not want to ruin his \\"fantastic\\" relationship with Essie. In an interview with Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy (October 2015), producer Simon Harper declared of his love for the pairing, but warned of his intention to develop the \\"will they / won't they?' dynamic\\" further. He explained that writers had planned \\"big questions\\" for them to face. The first questioning whether or not Essie has left having children too late in her life. The second being whether Sacha's family will ultimately be able to accept Essie. In September 2016, writers took Essie in a new direction when they decided to end Essie and Sacha's relationship. The scenes featured Essie struggling with the fact she is unable to get pregnant. Sacha admits he never wanted another child and they decide to break-up. Wragg was shocked when she learned that writers ended the relationship. Raf di Lucca Essie was later paired with registrar Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden) as they embark on a casual relationship. Sacha soon discovers they are involved with each other and confronts them. He does not realise their romance is not serious and in his angst he collapses with chest pain. Barratt told Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap that their romance played a part in Sacha's despression because it \\"knocked him for six\\". McFadden told Tyler that he was surprised when he learned Essie and Raf would become romantically involved. He revealed that he and Wragg enjoyed the playing story with Sacha's jealously. He added that it was interesting that the two characters had both been \\"longing to have a family of their own.\\" McFadden was also keen for their relationship to be fully explored. Wragg told Tyler that each time they filmed as scene as Essie and Raf infront of Sacha, \\"it felt like such a betrayal.\\" She added that the crew agreed with her and after several months had pass, the feeling on-set remained the same. Wragg acknowledged that some viewers were \\"excited\\" about Essie's relationship with Raf. While others remained loyal to her pairing with Sacha. Wragg liked that the story divided viewer opinion. The pair end their romance and Raf has a short-lived relationship with drug addict Kim Whitfield (Louisa Clein). Writers soon revisited Raf and Essie's story, with McFadden confirming it would be a serious relationship. The actor stated that Raf develops feelings for Essie because he is not \\"sophisticated enough\\" for a friends with benefits arrangement. McFadden stated that Raf is \\"a bit of a sentimentalist and got attached to her.\\" Essie's professionalism in her nursing role also attracts Rafs to her. McFadden later told Wilson from What's on TV that Essie and Raf are compatible because they are \\"both traditional\\" and want a serious relationship. He also thought it would be inevitable that they would clash at times, which he was looking forward to portraying. Essie fosters teenager Parker Whitfield (Louis Davison), who is the son of Raf's ex-girlfriend Kim. Essie struggles to bond with him, so Raf tries to support Essie and help them. Wragg told What's on TV's Wilson that Essie is inexperienced with caring for a teenager and \\"doesn't really know how to deal with them.\\" When Raf tries to talk to Parker about Essie, he accidentally reveals that they are in a relationship. Parker is angry with Essie and she feels a failure for not being honest with him. The pair later get along better and her fostering becomes a success. Parker's mother Kim returns and asks Parker to move to Gibraltar with her. He decides to leave and Raf supports Essie through her distress. Of Essie's fostering success, Wragg stated \\"when Essie took on Parker, it was a big shock for her to suddenly have this very different life, but I always knew she'd be a great mum.\\" Writers remained committed to developing the couple and in later episodes Raf decides to ask Essie to marry him. Raf reaches his decision when he learns that his brother Giuseppe Di Lucca (Iain Robertson) is being unfaithful to his wife. He realises he could never behave like his sibling. McFadden explained that Raf \\"realises just how much he loves Essie and how much he wants to commit.\\" McFadden commented that the proposal added \\"jeopardy\\" to their relationship because Raf is unsure if she will accept. Essie surprises Raf and agrees to marry him. McFadden explained that their wedding would be low-key because of Raf's need for privacy after his previous failed marriage. Essie and Raf marry in a registry office and do not tell their friends. McFadden told Wilson that the pair did not want any drama at their wedding. When their colleagues find out they make a spectacle of the wedding news. McFadden added that Sacha eventually accepts that Essie marrying Raf is in her best interests. He believed Essie felt \\"torn\\" because she does still have feelings for Sacha but cannot be with him. Raf was later killed off when McFadden chose to leave the series. His departure sees him shot dead by Fredrik Johanssen (Billy Postlethwaite). Ben Sherwood Charlie Condou plays Essie's love interest, Ben Sherwood.Essie's next relationship is with newly introduced character, locum consultant Ben Sherwood (Charlie Condou). The development was first teased in an advance spoiler trailer. Essie and Ben share a kiss during his debut episode. Condou told Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy that the duo get into a relationship \\"fairly quickly\\". Like with Raf before him, Ben has to contend with Essie's on-off relationship with Sacha. Condou commented that their relationship causes tension between Essie and Sacha. Ben and Sacha become \\"competitors\\" which is difficult and \\"very awkward\\" because Sacha is a \\"genuinely lovely guy\\" just like Ben. The situation \\"tricky\\" especially as Ben believes he has a long-term future with Essie. Condou added that Ben \\"definitely falls for Essie in a big way. He really likes her. It's not going to be plain-sailing and very complicated for everyone involved.\\" Ben was originally scripted as a new \\"bad guy\\" in Essie's life, but the production decided to change his personality and play more comedy in the story. Condou told Metro's Calli Kitson that Ben sees himself as \\"quite confident\\" and a \\"ladies man\\". As scenes air viewers realise that he is not confident. He tries hard to impress Essie but often often says the wrong things. Essie initially does not like Ben's flirting due to struggles in her personal life. Condou explained that Ben behaves a \\"little bit smarmy\\" and Essie thinks he is behaving like a \\"twat\\". She soon realises Ben is just trying to get acquainted with his new colleagues and begins to like him. The actor added that \\"the relationship is really lovely actually but obviously there's Sacha in the background as the two of them have had an on-off relationship for years.\\" Writers soon introduced issues into their relationship. Sacha and Dominic reveal a rumour that Ben got a nurse pregnant at his previous hospital after a one-night stand. In another episode, Ben gets close to Dominic and kisses him. Condou told Lorraine Kelly that the situation is \\"awkward\\" because Dominic is Essie's best friend. Then Dominic learns that Ben is going to propose to Essie despite their kiss, which makes it \\"all the more awkward\\". Ben decides to be honest about his sexuality and comes out as gay. Condou told Sue Crawford of the Metro that \\"I genuinely believe Ben was in love with Essie and wanted to marry her. I don't think he was conscious of the fact he was living a lie ‚Äî it's so deeply buried.\\" The story ends with Ben leaving the hospital and Essie getting back together with Sacha. Condou said Ben leaves because he also feels \\"awkward\\" and finds it \\"difficult\\" that Essie left him for another man. Hostage situation Ryan Sampson plays Ivor Weiland, who takes Essie hostage.In July 2016, Holby City aired a dramatic hostage situation for Essie. The story begins when Essie treats patient Ivor Weiland (Ryan Sampson) on AAU and she gets along well with Ivor's comedic personality. The following week, Ivor is readmitted to hospital and diagnosed with a pseudoaneurysm and sepsis. He is also suffering from effects of drug withdrawal and he bonds with Essie over his drug addiction. Wragg told What's on TV's Wilson that her character \\"likes to champion the underdog\\" and those who appear beyond help. One of Essie's personality traits is her ability to recognise people's \\"inner turmoil\\" and help them. Wragg believed that Essie \\"wants to fight their corner because she knows they've probably had a lot of people turn their back on them, so she immediately keeps the doorway open for them to talk.\\" Despite his appearance, Ivor is a \\"very charismatic\\" character and Essie finds his comedy \\"really charming\\". She added that \\"she finds him really endearing\\" and \\"sees a really vulnerable person, who needs care and attention.\\" The scenes become sinister when Ivor decides to seek out morphine to treat his addiction. He goes to the hospital pharmacy where he finds pharmacist Mel Watson (Jocelyn Jee Esien), takes her hostage brandishing an infected needle and pleads for drugs. Essie manages to locate Ivor and tries to convince him to let Mel go, but he takes her hostage too. Wragg explained that Essie puts herself in danger because \\"she's like a dog with a bone\\" and thought she could help Ivor. Mel suffers an asthma attack but he forbids Essie from helping her colleague. Despite this, Wragg believed Essie was in control and not frightened of Ivor despite his violent threats. The story helped to showcase Essie's backstory as she tries to talk Ivor down and discloses her own past addictions. Wragg explained that \\"Essie ends up having to divulge details of her personal life to him. We know Essie was a bit wild in her younger years, but it‚Äôs revealed she had drug problems; not to the same level as Ivor, but she certainly understands addiction. But where Essie had support, Ivor‚Äôs got nobody. So she wants to be the person that helps him.\\" Essie manages to convince Ivor to set them free. As he does Sacha rushes into the room and pushes Ivor onto broken glass and he ruptures his aneurysm. Wragg praised Sampson's performance and spoke her amazement of his change from comedy character to \\"real ragged monster\\". The story also served as a catalyst for relationship problems between Essie and Sacha. Wragg concluded that \\"this incident wakes Essie up to a lot of home truths.\\" Cancer Wragg took a three-month break from the series in 2018 and teased on Twitter that Essie's story was \\"not quite over\\". The show's producer's decided to write Essie out to protect the character. They felt that if Essie had become too involved in John Gaskell's (Paul McGann) evil story, they would have had to kill her off. Essie returns to the series in July 2018 after spending time with Raf's family in Scotland. Wragg told Sue Crawford of Daily Express that Essie left to \\"catch up with her life\\". Essie begins to feel unwell while staying with them. Essie decides to return to London to visit a doctor but tries to avoid Holby City hospital. She ends up being taken there after other hospitals are over capacity. Wragg explained that Essie did not want to see her former colleagues and the move was accidental. Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) treats Essie and she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Wragg believed that Essie had a \\"unique relationship\\" with Henrik, she felt able to confide in him and she wanted him to treat her. He tells Essie that she will need to undergo a hysterectomy to survive. Essie is upset because it is a final confirmation that she will never be able to conceive a child of her own. She added that \\"at this particular point in her life she‚Äôs less afraid of the word cancer and more fearful of losing the chance of becoming a mum.\\" The actress found playing a patient very different; she filmed many scenes in a hospital bed and wanted to sleep after finding it hard to focus. In 2020, producers decided to revisit Essie's cancer story with the disease returning once again. In addition writers decided to portray another cancer story alongside Essie's, featuring Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw). Wragg released a statement regarding the plot stating that \\"showing the real struggle of two nurses sharing an illness together yet being alone in their own torture of what their futures hold is Holby at its best.\\" She described it as \\"tough\\" to watch but believed it would resonate well with cancer sufferers. They go on a journey together and learn \\"their worst fears\\" and \\"lost opportunities\\" amidst an uncertain future. The show's executive producer Simon Harper said that his team originally thought they could not have two cancer stories running concurrently. They later realised they should because cancer statistically affects many people during their lifetime. He described the story as \\"two most caring nurses now have to care for each other\\" in their cancer battle. He also hoped it would raise awareness of cancer and praised Wragg and Walkinshaw's \\"heart-breaking performances\\". Essie's cancer story resumed during an episode where she attends a regular cancer check up. Dominic attends the appointment with Essie to spare Sacha the worry. Dominic views the scan and tells a devastated Essie that her cancer has returned. Unauthorised parenting In 2019, producers devised an unauthorised parenting story for the character. When Frankie Rendell (Sophie Harkness) is admitted to Keller, she reveals that she is Raf's relative. Frankie tells Essie that she is unable to cope with her baby, Isla and wants Essie to take care of her, which she agrees to. Wragg told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that \\"Essie became a mum in a very unconventional manner. Technically, she has a child that isn't hers, and by law, shouldn't still have. There are going to be future complications with that and also future happiness.\\" Viewers wrote on the social networking website Twitter that they were worried for Essie during the story. She commented that they \\"see the goodness in the story and Essie cares for Isla for \\"the right reasons\\". Essie does not want Isla taken into care and knows she can offer a good home. The actress added that \\"despite the good reasons behind it, it is legally and ethically wrong.\\" In one episode Isla becomes ill and Essie is unaware of her medical history. Wragg branded it \\"tiny highlight\\" of the issues that arise from unauthorised parenting. The need for Isla's medical history leads Essie to tell Sacha the truth. He decides to keep quiet and let her continue to care for Isla. Essie tells other characters that she has adopted Isla. Wragg said that even Essie is beginning to believe Isla is her own child. She envisions a \\"little family unit\\". Wragg added \\"Sacha is the only one that is in cahoots and when someone is part of your lie and they keep it a secret, you can believe it even more.\\" As the story progresses, Essie begins dating Ben and eventually decides to tell him the truth about Isla. Essie eventually tells Fletch the truth who decides to involve social services to make a final decision about Isla's care.  Departure  McFadden confirmed in July 2020 that Essie would be leaving Holby City at the conclusion of her cancer story. Appearing in a behind-the-scenes video released by the show, the actor revealed that the story forms Wragg's exit from the show. Laura Denby, writing for the Radio Times, hoped that Essie's death would have \\"a profound effect on every character\\" and expected it to \\"change the show forever\\". Essie departs in the twenty-fifth episode of series 22, broadcast on 11 August 2020. The character is killed-off as she prepares for her wedding to Sacha and her death featuring in the episode had not been revealed prior to transmission. Wragg's departure were one of the final scenes filmed before Holby City paused production due to the coronavirus pandemic and feature in the show's final episode before going on a transmission break. Reception For her portrayal of Essie, Wragg was nominated for Best Drama Star at the 2020 Inside Soap Awards. Tyler (Inside Soap) wrote that she and audiences \\"were thrilled\\" that Essie returned to the series. She noted that Essie and Sasha had a turbulent relationship, adding \\"it's not always been plain sailing for the pair.\\" A writer from What's on TV similarly stated that \\"Essie and Sacha's relationship has certainly had its ups and downs.\\" Their colleague, Victoria Wilson was delighted that Essie chose Sacha over Ben following a proposal of marriage. She commented that upon watching \\"We were like a proud mum at the school nativity play.\\" References External links * Essie Harrison at BBC Online Holby City characters Fictional English people Television characters introduced in 2014 Fictional nurses Female characters in television Crossover characters in television ","title":"Essie Harrison"},{"id":"48681275","text":"Conus sogodensis is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.Bouchet, P.

Radonja's father Petar was a middle child of Vojvoda Iliko Lalev and held the title until his death when it was passed to his brother priest Mirƒçeta. Radonja, thus, succeeded his uncle Mirƒçeta as the duke of Kuƒçi, being the great-great-grandson of Drekale, eponymous founder of Drekaloviƒái. He came to be the leader of a group of tribes in what is today eastern Montenegro (known as Brda, \\"the Hills\\") that together with Habsburg Serbian troops fought against the Ottomans, and was granted the title Guvernadur of all the Hills by Venetians, for whom he managed the postal traffic with the Ottomans. Prince- bishop Vasilije in his \\"History of Montenegro\\" mentions him as one of the Montenegrin commanders who rose to arms under the influence of Prince-bishop Danilo in 1711. In the talks with Austrian representatives in the village of Te≈°iƒái near Ni≈°, held on 24 July 1737, Radonja and Patriarch ≈†akabenta promised field marshal Seckendorff that they would mobilise the Highlanders. The Kuƒçi would ready 500 armed men, vojvoda Vuksan Vojvodiƒá of Vasojeviƒái 200, vojvoda To≈°ko of Piperi 200, etc. The Serbian Patriarch and Radonja called on Metropolitan Sava to join the war against the Ottomans, but he was under the influence of the Republic of Venice, and stayed inactive during the war. Radonja requested from the Austrian feltmarschal that in case the rebels won, they would continue in his service. When talks were underway, an uprising broke out in Montenegro. Radonja's rebels and Serbian troops, and an auxiliary force of Stani≈°a Markoviƒá-Mlati≈°uma, attacked the local Muslims. According to Serbia's plan, they were to take over Novi Pazar, Ro≈æaje, Bijelo Polje and Peƒá. A Serbian detachment attacked Bihor, and penetrated to Godijevo, where they set up a headquarters in the house of Mustafa Sijariƒá. Radonja heard that the Ottomans would in their future actions first attack ≈Ωupljani, which had already crossed to the Venetian side. At the same time, Radonja informed Cattaro intendant Jerolim Buƒáa that Dervi≈°-pa≈°a ƒåengiƒá was ordered to turn with his army from the Sanjak of Herzegovina towards Knin, which they were to attack; and that vezir-Mustafa-pa≈°a with the armies of other sanjaks and 4,000 Tatars, as was planned, turn in the direction of Zadar. That information was likely exaggerated. Radonja died on the Jelica mountain in 1737 and was buried there. In 1766, his son Grigorije, who became the arhimandrite of Ni≈°, transported his remains and reburied them in the village of Bo≈°njace near Leskovac.

Unlike the multinomial probit and multinomial logit estimators, it makes no assumptions about the distribution of the unobservable part of utility. However, its statistical properties (particularly its asymptotic distribution) are more complicated than the multinomial probit and logit models, making statistical inference difficult. To address these issues, Joel Horowitz proposed a variant, called the smoothed maximum score estimator.  Setting  When modelling discrete choice problems, it is assumed that the choice is determined by the comparison of the underlying latent utility.For more example, refer to: Smith, Michael D. and Brynjolfsson, Erik, Consumer Decision-Making at an Internet Shopbot (October 2001). MIT Sloan School of Management Working Paper No. 4206-01. Denote the population of the agents as T and the common choice set for each agent as C. For agent t \\\\in T , denote her choice as y_{t,i} , which is equal to 1 if choice i is chosen and 0 otherwise. Assume latent utility is linear in the explanatory variables, and there is an additive response error. Then for an agent t \\\\in T , : y_{t,i} = 1 \\\\leftrightarrow x_{t,i}\\\\beta + \\\\epsilon_{t,i} > x_{t,j}\\\\beta + \\\\epsilon_{t,j} , \\\\forall j eq i and j \\\\in C where x_{t,i} and x_{t,j} are the q-dimensional observable covariates about the agent and the choice, and \\\\epsilon_{t,i} and \\\\epsilon_{t,j} are the factors entering the agent's decision that are not observed by the econometrician. The construction of the observable covariates is very general. For instance, if C is a set of different brands of coffee, then x_{t,i} includes the characteristics both of the agent t, such as age, gender, income and ethnicity, and of the coffee i, such as price, taste and whether it is local or imported. All of the error terms are assumed i.i.d. and we need to estimate \\\\beta which characterizes the effect of different factors on the agent's choice.  Parametric estimators  Usually some specific distribution assumption on the error term is imposed, such that the parameter \\\\beta is estimated parametrically. For instance, if the distribution of error term is assumed to be normal, then the model is just a multinomial probit model; if it is assumed to be a Gumbel distribution, then the model becomes a multinomial logit model. The parametric model For a concrete example, refer to: Tetsuo Yai, Seiji Iwakura, Shigeru Morichi, Multinomial probit with structured covariance for route choice behavior, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, Volume 31, Issue 3, June 1997, Pages 195-207, ISSN 0191-2615 is convenient for computation but might not be consistent once the distribution of the error term is misspecified.Jin Yan (2012), \\"A Smoothed Maximum Score Estimator for Multinomial Discrete Choice Models\\", Working Paper.  Binary response  For example, suppose that C only contains two items. This is the latent utility representation of a binary choice model. In this model, the choice is: Y_{t}=1[X_{1,t}\\\\beta+\\\\varepsilon_1>X_{2,t}\\\\beta+\\\\varepsilon_2], where X_{1,t},X_{2,t} are two vectors of the explanatory covariates, \\\\varepsilon_1 and \\\\varepsilon_2 are i.i.d. response errors, :X_{1,t}\\\\beta+\\\\varepsilon_1 \\\\text{ and } X_{2,t}\\\\beta+\\\\varepsilon_2 are latent utility of choosing choice 1 and 2. Then the log likelihood function can be given as: :Q=\\\\sum_{i-1}^N Y_t \\\\log(P[X_{1,t}\\\\beta-X_{2,t}\\\\beta>\\\\varepsilon_2-\\\\varepsilon_1])+(1-Y_t) \\\\log(1-P[X_{1,t}\\\\beta-X_{2,t}\\\\beta>\\\\varepsilon_2-\\\\varepsilon_1]) If some distributional assumption about the response error is imposed, then the log likelihood function will have a closed-form representation. For instance, if the response error is assumed to be distributed as: N(0,\\\\sigma^2), then the likelihood function can be rewritten as: :Q=\\\\sum_{i-1}^N Y_t \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\Phi\\\\left[\\\\frac{X_{1,t}\\\\beta-X_{2,t} \\\\beta}{\\\\surd2\\\\sigma} \\\\right]\\\\right) + (1-Y_t) \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\Phi \\\\left[ \\\\frac{X_{2,t}\\\\beta- X_{1,t}\\\\beta}{\\\\surd2\\\\sigma} \\\\right] \\\\right) where \\\\Phi is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the standard normal distribution. Here, even if \\\\Phi doesn't have a closed-form representation, its derivative does. This is the probit model. This model is based on a distributional assumption about the response error term. Adding a specific distribution assumption into the model can make the model computationally tractable due to the existence of the closed-form representation. But if the distribution of the error term is misspecified, the estimates based on the distribution assumption will be inconsistent. The basic idea of the distribution-free model is to replace the two probability term in the log-likelihood function with other weights. The general form of the log-likelihood function can written as: :Q= \\\\sum_{i-1}^N Y_t \\\\cdot\\\\log(W_1(X_{1,t}\\\\beta,X_{2,t}\\\\beta))+(1-Y_t)\\\\log(W_0 (X_{1,t} \\\\beta, X_{2,t} \\\\beta))  Maximum score estimator  To make the estimator more robust to the distributional assumption, Manski (1975) proposed a non- parametric model to estimate the parameters. In this model, denote the number of the elements of the choice set as J, the total number of the agents as N, and W (J -1) > W (J - 2) > \\\\dots > W (1) > W (0) is a sequence of real numbers. The Maximum Score Estimator is defined as: : \\\\hat{b}={\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\max}}_b \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\sum_{i=1}^J y_{t,i} W (\\\\sum olimits_{j \\\\in C, j eq i} 1 (x_{t,i}b > x_{t,j}b)) Here, \\\\textstyle \\\\sum olimits_{j \\\\in C, j eq i} 1 (x_{t,i}b > x_{t,j}b) is the ranking of the certainty part of the underlying utility of choosing i. The intuition in this model is that when the ranking is higher, more weight will be assigned to the choice. Under certain conditions, the maximum score estimator can be weak consistent, but its asymptotic properties are very complicated. This issue mainly comes from the non-smoothness of the objective function.  Binary example  In the binary context, the maximum score estimator can be represented as: :W_1(X_{1,t}\\\\beta,X_{2,t}\\\\beta)=w_1[X_{1,t}\\\\beta-X_{2,t}\\\\beta>0]+w_0 1[X_{1,t}\\\\beta-X_{2,t}\\\\beta<0], where :W_0(X_{1,t}\\\\beta,X_{2,t}\\\\beta)=1-W_1(X_{1,t}\\\\beta,X_{2,t}\\\\beta) and w_1 and w_0 are two constants in (0,1). The intuition of this weighting scheme is that the probability of the choice depends on the relative order of the certainty part of the utility.  Smoothed maximum score estimator  Horowitz (1992) proposed a smoothed maximum score (SMS) estimator which has much better asymptotic properties. The basic idea is to replace the non-smoothed weight function \\\\textstyle W (\\\\sum olimits_{j \\\\in C, j eq i} 1 (x_{t,i}b > x_{t,j}b)) with a smoothed one. Define a smooth kernel function K satisfying following conditions: # |K(\\\\cdot)is bounded over the real numbers # \\\\lim_{u\\\\to -\\\\infty} K (u) = 0 and \\\\lim_{u\\\\to +\\\\infty} K (u) =1 # \\\\dot {K} (u) = \\\\dot {K} (-u) Here, the kernel function is analogous to a CDF whose PDF is symmetric around 0. Then, the SMS estimator is defined as: : \\\\hat {b}_{SMS} = {\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\max}}_b \\\\frac {1}{N} \\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\sum_{i=1}^J y_{t,i} \\\\sum olimits_{j \\\\in C, j eq i} K ( X_ {t,i}b - x_{t,j} b / h_N) where (h_N, N = 1,2, ...) is a sequence of strictly positive numbers and \\\\lim_{N\\\\to +\\\\infty} h_N = 0 . Here, the intuition is the same as in the construction of the traditional maximum score estimator: the agent is more likely to choose the choice that has the higher observed part of latent utility. Under certain conditions, the smoothed maximum score estimator is consistent, and more importantly, it has an asymptotic normal distribution. Therefore, all the usual statistical testing and inference based on asymptotic normality can be implemented.For a survey study, refer to: Jin Yan (2012), \\"A Smoothed Maximum Score Estimator for Multinomial Discrete Choice Models\\", Working Paper.

Life Birth and education (1916‚Äì36) Manuel Azc√°rate Diz was born in Madrid on 7 October 1916. He was grand-nephew of Gumersindo de Azc√°rate, who introduced Krausism to Spain, and nephew of Justino de Azc√°rate, a liberal Republican senator in the 1930s. His father was Pablo de Azc√°rate, deputy secretary general at the League of Nations and later Spanish ambassador in London. During Manuel's childhood his father was based in Geneva, where Manuel was educated at an elite school, the Free Institution of Education. When he was 18 Manuel Azc√°rate attended courses at the London School of Economics, where he met professor Harold Laski. In 1933 he began to study law and economics at the University of Madrid. The PCE created the Union of Communist Students in 1933. Azc√°rate, Fernando Claud√≠n, Manuel Tu√±√≥n de Lara and Luis Send√≠n became members. Azc√°rate joined the Communist Youth in 1934. Writing in the preface to his father's book Mi embajada en Londres durante la guerra civil espa√±ola Manuel Azc√°rate said \\"In spite of the serious discussions and differences between us, he always respected the choice I had made to join the Communist party in 1934.\\" Another source says that Manuel Azc√°rate always had \\"great political influence\\" on his father, who \\"always collaborated closely with the Russians.\\" Civil War and World War (1936‚Äì45) Azc√°rate married Ester Jim√©nez, who was depicted on a UGT poster during the civil war holding a work tool. They had two children, a girl and a boy. Azc√°rate fought in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) with the 11th division of the Republican army from 1937 to the end of the war. After the fall of Barcelona in January 1939 Azc√°rate was sent to Madrid to help the propaganda campaign. He wrote later, \\"War weariness was written in the emaciated faces. The mood had become dark, sad and tragic. There was a generalized anti-communist resentment because many believed the communists to be responsible for the war's prolongation.\\" At the end of the war Azc√°rate went into exile in Paris. The PCE leadership left France after the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact between Russia and Germany in August 1939 just before the outbreak of World War II. They moved to Mexico or the Soviet Union, safer countries that supported the Republic. Azc√°rate remained behind with the younger and lower-ranking PCE exiles in France, and in the summer of 1939 helped Jes√∫s Monz√≥n form the \\"Delegation of the PCE Central Committee in France\\", along with Carmen de Pedro, Manuel Gimeno and Jaime Nieto. They reorganized and rejuvenated the PCE in France, improvising policy as needed. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) Azc√°rate was in charge of organizing the Communist Party of Spain in the zone occupied by the Germans, and reorganized the Unified Socialist Youth (Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas). Post-war politics and journalism (1945‚Äì98) Azc√°rate wrote for El diario de la juventud junto, Mundo nuevo and Nuestra bandera, and for the clandestine Mundo obrero. He lived in Moscow from 1959 to 1964, where he helped write a history of the Communist Party of Spain and contributed to the book Guerra y revoluci√≥n en Espa√±a. Azc√°rate became a member of the PCE executive committee in 1964. From 1968 to 1981 Azc√°rate was head of the party's Department of International relations. He had to deal with the awkward question of peaceful coexistence with non-communist regimes, which the Soviet Union considered to be advantageous to socialist countries by helping anti-imperialist movements while avoid the risk of war. The PCE could not, however, accept that this meanf abandoning the struggle against Franco's regime in Spain. In 1973 Azc√°rate praised the contribution the USSR had made towards d√©tente, but said the PCE must fight all attempts to confuse d√©tente with maintenance of the status quo, \\"wherever they may come from, even from our friends.\\" The communist parties of Western Europe must cooperate to develop d√©tente and eliminate the \\"systems of blocs\\". Azc√°rate returned to Spain in 1976. On 22 December 1976 he was arrested along with Santiago Carrillo and other PCE members. Azc√°rate ran for election as a deputy for the province of Le√≥n in 1977 in the first general elections after the return to democracy, but did not win. Azc√°rate said in a 1977 statement to Radio Free Europe that only Eurocommunism lay outside the two blocs, a position that the French and Italian communist parties did not share. In a March 1979 interview in Encounter Azc√°rate said, Azc√°rate led a project by the group called the renovadores to introduce democracy into the PCE, which took effect after he had been expelled. In November 1981 Azc√°rate was among the group of PCE leaders who were expelled from the Central Committee of the party for their criticism of Carrillo's policy of sanctions. Carrillo himself was forced to resign after the 1982 elections. Azc√°rate began working for the newspaper El Pa√≠s in the early 1980s as a columnist and analyst for the international section. In his last days he composed an essay of more than fifty pages on his father, (Semblanza de Pablo de Azc√°rate y Fl√≥rez, 1890‚Äì1971), dated May 1998. Manuel Azc√°rate Diz died from cancer on 24 August 1998 in a clinic in Madrid at the age of 81.

Early years  Although Parvaneh Milani never attended college, she was able to educate herself and learned the English language. She translated a number of articles and books on the subject of psychology. She co-translated two books called 'The Psychology of Phantasy' and 'Dreams and the growth of personality' along with a number of other articles.  Activism  After the 1979 Iranian uprising Milani's brother -Rahim Milani-, who had been imprisoned for his Communist political activities during the Pahlavi period, was executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran's government. Milani became a vocal opponent against the treatment of the mourning families by the Islamic Republic. Milani's brother Rahim Milani, was a member of Organization of Revolutionary Workers of Iran (Rahe Kargar) who was executed in prison while serving a prison term. Since the early 80‚Äôs Parvaneh Milani became a vocal advocate against state violence. By writing a number of pamphlets, essays, letters and interviewing the international media outlets; she gained the attention of the security forces, especially Iran‚Äôs Ministry of Intelligence, who threatened her life on multiple occasions and eventually forced her and her family into exile. In addition to her efforts to keep the memory of the victims of the 1980s massacre alive, she authored many letters to domestic and international institutions demanding justice for the families of the victims. In 1997, after the election of Mohammad Khatami to the office of presidency in Iran; she wrote a letter of grievances to the reformist opposition and asked the government to stop harassing the mourning relatives of the 80‚Äôs massacres when they visit the graveside of their loved ones and allow them to rightfully mourn their loved ones who were buried in Khavaran cemetery and elsewhere. She asked the City Council of Tehran and Islamic Consultative Assembly‚Äôs Article 90 Commission, inter alia, to allow the unmarked graves of those politically executed to be inscribed. She had also asked them to allow the mourning relatives to be able to visit the gravesides without the fear of intimidation, molestation and reprisal.[ ÿ¨ŸÜÿ®ÿ¥ ÿØÿßÿØÿÆŸàÿßŸá€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿØÿ± ÿ≥Ÿà⁄Ø ŸÅŸÇÿØÿßŸÜ Ÿæÿ±ŸàÿßŸÜŸá ŸÖ€åŸÑÿßŸÜ€å.-http://justice4iran.org/persian/publication/call-for-action/parvaneh- milani.html-] ÿØÿ± Ÿàÿ®⁄ØÿßŸá ÿπÿØÿßŸÑÿ™ ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å She never received a response from any of these authorities and institutions.

Gauzza Public Library, formerly known as the Upper Tampa Bay Regional Public Library, is part of the Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Library System (THPL), as well as a member of the Hillsborough County Public Library Cooperative (HCPLC). It is a 26,000 square foot facility located at 11211 Countryway Blvd. in Tampa, Florida. In addition to books, newspapers and magazines, the library provides DVDs, music, and internet access, as well as a variety of programs and activities and meeting rooms. History The 1,500 square foot Upper Tampa Bay Regional Public Library was dedicated and opened to the public on January 8, 2005. Construction of the $4.5 million building was funded by the Hillsborough County Board of County Commissioners and a grant from the Florida Department of State, Division of Library Services. Construction on an 114,300 square foot expansion and 2,200 square foot renovation began in January 2013 and was completed in February 2014 at a cost of $2.2 million. The additional space was needed to accommodate and serve the growing population of the community. The expansion added additional reading space, a new children's area, multi-purpose space, a larger community room, a pantry, additional bathrooms, and storage. The renovation concentrated on installing a vending cafe, and revamping the Friends of the Library bookstore and teen area. Long & Associates Architects/Engineers, Inc. served as the designers for the project with the Williams Company serving as general contractor. On Wednesday, May 28, 2014 a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held to celebrate the expansion of the library. On August 2, 2017 the library was renamed after Maureen Gauzza, founder of the Upper Tampa Bay chapter of the Friends of the Library. Maureen Gauzza [n√©e Beirne] was born in Yonkers, New York and relocated to central Florida in 1981 before moving to Westchase in 1998. She began advocating for a public library to serve the growing population of the area, including but not limited to Westchase. She worked alongside District 5 County Commissioner Ken Hagan, whom she had met while he going door-to-door campaigning for office, and original library architect Sol Fleischman to complete the project. She was the founder of the Upper Tampa Bay Friends of the Library and served at the group‚Äôs president from 2005-2015. She died on July 3, 2017 at the age of 75. Friends of the library Gazebo in front of library The Friends of the Maureen B. Gauzza Public Library operate the Gazebo bookstore inside the library lobby. Money raised by the Friends is used to support library programming and events. The Friends purchased all the art for the library, aside from the sculptural elements donated by the nearby Westfield Mall at Citrus Park and the Majolica Tile Project, donated by the Westchase Artists Society. In the lobby of the main entrance, The Friends have installed a large bronze tree that is inscribed with the names of donors (on the leaves, acorns, and stones) who have contributed to the library. The Friends of the Maureen B. Gauzza Public Library meet on the first Monday of the month at 4pm.

Created as a vehicle for Miami Herald sportswriter and ESPN contributor Dan Le Batard, who also hosts his own radio show for the network, the show premiered on September 12, 2011. It airs on weekdays at 4:30 PM Eastern and then repeats later at 5:30 on ESPN2 as well as throughout the night on ESPNews. From its premiere until May 10, 2013, the show bore Le Batard's name and was called Dan Le Batard Is Highly Questionable (DLHQ), and from its premiere until March 23, 2015 the show aired on ESPN2. The program is based in Le Batard's hometown of Miami, Florida, and produced via satellite in Washington, D.C.. It was created by the same people behind Pardon the Interruption (PTI), which Le Batard has appeared on multiple times as a substitute host. The show is hosted by Le Batard. His father, Gonzalo \\"Papi\\" Le Batard, was his daily co-host until November 2019; after taking a 3-month break, Papi now makes occasional appearances. Bomani Jones also co host for 5 years until his departure and since 2017 a rotating guest has served as a second co-host. The arrangement became necessary after Bomani Jones, who joined the show in 2013, relocated to New York to co-host High Noon with Pablo S. Torre. Highly Questionable emanates from ESPN's studio at the Clevelander Hotel in South Beach, where Le Batard's radio program also is broadcast. Previously the show taped at a studio set in suburban Miami designed to resemble a stereotypical Miami kitchen. As a nod to the previous set, a bowl filled with plastic fruit is always on the table where the hosts sit. History The show was announced on August 19, 2011, as a creative project between Dan Le Batard and the producers of Pardon the Interruption. The show, and the introduction of Le Batard's father Gonzalo to the project, was part of an effort by ESPN to attract more Latino viewers. DLHQ premiered on Monday September 12, 2011 at 4:00 PM Eastern. Beginning in 2012, other ESPN personalities including Bomani Jones and Bill Simmons appeared as contributors to the show. On May 13, 2013, Le Batard got a second co-host when frequent guest Bomani Jones, who had been based in North Carolina, joined the now- renamed Highly Questionable. In June 2017, Le Batard said that was the moment the show found its footing, as Jones' addition helped it gain enough viewers to avoid what was considered to be a near certain cancellation. On March 23, 2015, Highly Questionable was moved from ESPN2 to ESPN weekdays at 4:30 PM Eastern, leading into sister shows Around the Horn and PTI. In May 2017, ESPN announced that Jones would leave HQ in June 2017 while a new show featuring him and Pablo S. Torre (titled High Noon) was developed. His last show was on Thursday, June 22, 2017, and he received an emotional send off from both of his colleagues. Since then, the show has employed a variety of co-hosts as opposed to a permanent replacement for Jones. Guest hosts Throughout its run, Highly Questionable has needed to employ guest hosts whenever Le Batard is unavailable, such as when he took time off for his wedding and honeymoon. Jon \\"Stugotz\\" Weiner, Le Batard's radio co-host, would frequently fill a slot, as would Miami-based journalists like Israel Gutierrez. Guest hosts became a permanent fixture for the show after Jones left; some of the more frequently seen guests included Amin Elhassan, Sarah Spain, Mina Kimes, Pablo S. Torre, and Domonique Foxworth among various others. Beginning during football season in 2019 Monday programs began carrying a football-centric series of topics, featured Le Batard and Papi broadcasting from Miami and two guest contributors. Usually these spots would be filled by Domonique Foxworth, who joined via satellite from Washington, and Mina Kimes, who joined via satellite from Los Angeles. In November 2019, Papi took a leave of absence from Highly Questionable in order to get some rest; Le Batard said that after working non- stop for over 50 years it was time for him to take a break. His role was filled by the show's producer, who would ask the questions before each segment. Papi returned to the show on January 31, 2020, and Le Batard said that he would show up whenever he felt like doing so. Since November 2019, most of the guest hosts appear via satellite instead of in studio; for example, Torre, Jones, and Katie Nolan appear from ESPN's studio complex at the South Street Seaport, Foxworth and Clinton Yates appear from Washington, and Sarah Spain appears from her native Chicago. The set The original set for the show was located in Hialeah, Florida just outside of Miami. The set was designed to resemble a 1950s-era Miami/Cuban kitchen, in the spirit of a television sitcom. The set also featured old Le Batard family photos. In late summer, 2014, the show moved to a new set on the second floor of the Clevelander Hotel in Miami's South Beach. The new studio is designed as a more conventional set, while retaining Miami-themed colors, and featuring a window looking out to South Beach. The new set premiered on September 8, 2014. The Clevelander studios are also used for Le Batard's radio program as well as serving as the home for Miami-based panelists on Around the Horn.  Segments  The show is broken into 4 segments. Each segment utilizes a question-answer format, with questions for the non-guest segments coming from fans. Each show begins with Le Batard introducing the panel, Jones offering a pithy commentary on one of the discussion topics, and Le Batard telling his father \\"vamos, Papi,\\" (or more recently \\"dale, Papi\\") which kicks off the show.  Opening questions  A series of viewer submitted questions begin the proceedings. Papi reads each of them from an Apple iPad in front of him when papi doesn't the producer ask the question, and Le Batard and Jones each take turns addressing the audience with their takes while Papi chimes in with a random non sequitur. Occasionally, Dan and Papi sometimes find questions humorous or ignorant enough in nature to the point where they are not worth answering, and just simply laugh instead. Once in awhile, Papi will say something completely ridiculous and potentially damaging; when he does this, a technical difficulty bumper will play for several seconds and Le Batard will prompt Papi to apologize. On certain Mondays, particularly during the National Football League regular season, the \\"Questions\\" segment will continue into the second segment.  Guest interview  During the second segment, a pretaped interview with a guest airs. The questions are usually related to a current issue or event in sports, and Dan and Bomani often ask about the guest's life outside of sports. Papi asks the final question, usually about topics unrelated to sports. On days when no guest is available, one of several things will happen. One of \\"Papi's famous interview medleys\\", with highlights from past interviews shown, might play or a second set of questions might be asked. \\"Do You Question\\" (see below) may also serve as the second segment, and more and more frequently does serve that purpose.  \\"Do You Question\\"  The third segment is essentially a repeat of the first segment, and is introduced by Jones by saying, \\"you give us topics and events, we question 'em.\\" The only difference is that they begin with \\"Do you question...\\" and often feature humorous video clips that do not necessarily have anything to do with sports.  \\"¬øS√≠ o No?\\"  The final segment of the show relates to television programming. The three hosts are given the name of a program airing that evening and offer their opinions on whether or not they are intrigued. Each responds with \\"S√≠\\" or \\"No\\" while holding up a placard with his response. Most of the programs are sports related but at least one is a general interest program such as a documentary or reality program such as The Bachelor, which Le Batard hates and leaves the set whenever it is featured. Papi has the on- show reputation for responding \\"S√≠, s√≠, I'm very intrigued!\\" to just about everything and often comes up with odd reasons for doing so, such as a team with a \\"Latino player\\" (sometimes an actual Latino player, but other times one with a Spanish-sounding name or even one he completely makes up, like \\"Miguel Verde\\" or \\"Bernardo Bishopo\\") who is going to have a \\"helluva game\\" or who will be a \\"name you'll never forget\\" (which he promptly forgets), or humorous misunderstandings of the shows in question. The Banana Phone One of the show's most frequently used running gags is the Banana Phone, where Papi imitates a ringing telephone and picks up the banana out of the plastic fruit bowl to (pretend to) speak to someone on the other end. To further the gag a cord is attached to the banana. Usually, Papi calls his bookie \\"Juanito\\" and tells him to \\"put everything\\" on the team he thinks will win. Juanito takes bets on virtually any sporting event known to man, from the America's Cup to middle school basketball. Papi is also known to thank Juanito for a tip he allegedly gave him or implying that he had a role in a certain event's outcome, including horses crashing at the finish line of a race, or other bloopers. In more recent episodes the gag has expanded to having Papi pretend to speak to other people besides Juanito. During the 2017 NBA playoffs, Papi frequently received \\"calls\\" from Fred Hoiberg, the head coach of the Chicago Bulls who complained frequently about traveling calls not being made against Isaiah Thomas of the Boston Celtics; to this effect, Hoiberg always \\"phones in\\" when he believes a traveling call anywhere was missed. The number to call Papi from the Banana Phone is 1-800-BANANA.  End of the show  After \\"S√≠ o No\\", the show comes to an end with Papi thanking the viewers for watching. Le Batard follows with his own goodbye, reminding the viewers when to catch the show again and occasionally promoting either his or Jones' radio show. Le Batard's co-host has the last word, saying \\"Gracias, see ya ma√±ana\\" or \\"see ya el lunes\\" depending on the day of the week (lunes being Spanish for Monday; this is usually said to close the Friday show). After this, there is a brief interlude where something from the previous segment or from earlier in the show is revisited humorously before the show cuts out  On-set guests  Occasionally during the commercial interlude, a special guest would appear on the set. During the use of the kitchen-themed set, the guest could be seen utilizing the kitchen, supposedly without Dan or Gonzalo noticing. On the Clevelander set, the guests have appeared in studio, sometimes joining the panel for the \\"¬øS√≠ o No?\\" segment. Special guests have included Lil Wayne, Pat Riley, Jason Taylor, Kimbo Slice, Sebastian the Ibis, NBA Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas, Ron Magill, Steven Bauer, Pedro Mart√≠nez, Micky Arison, Mike Lowell, Lil Dicky, Robert Smith, and Pat Sajak among others.  \\"Papi Awards\\"  Since 2014, Highly Questionable presents the \\"Papi Awards\\", an end of the year special which consists of a series of awards based on video clips that were usually visited in Do You Question. Papi dresses in a tuxedo while Le Batard and Jones served as his co-hosts, and each category has a winner and at least two runners-up. Each \\"winner\\" receives the \\"Golden Banana\\", a trophy made for the occasion. A constant running gag for the awards is that the winners are not able to receive the award in person for various reasons, so the trophy is held over for each subsequent award.ESPN's Highly Questionable - The 2015 Papi Awards December 25, 2015. Retrieved January 23, 2016. There was no Papi Awards special in 2019, due to Papi's sabbatical from the program.

It is the second letter of its kind, the first one having been published in January 2015. Both were distributed via his accounts on various social media, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, using the hashtag #CommonWorry. The second letter deals with Khamenei's views on the causes of recent terrorism. It was written in response to the November 2015 Paris attacks and other contemporary terrorist actions, such as the Metrojet Flight 9268 crash and the 2015 Beirut bombings. As of December 26, 2015, the letter has been translated to 62 languages in a collaborative effort conducted by The Representative of the Supreme Leader in the University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Al-Mustafa International University graduates, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the IRIB World Service and the countries' respective embassies. Contents In about two thousand words, Khamenei discussed the reasons for the worldwide wave of terrorism, calling it \\"our common worry\\".The original word used in the Persian text is ÿØÿ±ÿØ (dard) which means \\"pain\\" in English. However, official translations have used the word \\"worry\\" instead. Among them he noted the impact that major Western powers had with their military operations in the Islamic world. He mentioned United States's alleged role in the evolution of terroristic groups like al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and ISIL‚Äî\\"the spawn of such ill-fated pairings with imported cultures.\\" Khamenei also pointed out the \\"oppressed people of Palestine\\", who \\"have experienced the worst kind of terrorism for the last 60 years.\\" For this, he criticised Israel, its allies and international organisations. Twitter Twitter accounts that tweeted the letter were reported to have been temporarily suspended for sending spam messages. Some were reactivated with apologies from the network and a warning about sending similar messages again. This sometimes led to multiple resuspensions.

History Gothic portal of the 14th century Construction of the church between 1372 and 1390 was patronized by Fina Buzzaccarini, wife of the Prince of Padua, Francesco Da Carrara the Elder. The building was built on the site of the razed palace of Nicholas Carrara razed, who in 1327 betrayed Francesco by conspiring with Cangrande I della Scala. In 1378, after his death, he left to his sister Anna Fina, abbess of the monastery of St Benedict, the task of completing the construction of the church. In 1393 Francesco Novello, son of Fina and lord of Padua gave the church to the Servites. The church in the sixteenth century was the subject of major refurbishments mainly by Bartolomeo from Campolongo who built in 1511 the porch toward the street; for the refurbishment, he utilized ten octagonal columns of red marble from the demolition of the 14th-century Chapel of the Saint in the Basilica of St. Anthony of Padua. The Servi church was part of a convent of the Servants of Mary, the Oratory of St. Omobono and that of the guild of Santa Maria del Parto. In 1807 the Servite Fathers were expelled and the church was confiscated and forfeited in state assets. It was established as a parish church, run by secular clergy. In the 1920s the interior of the church was restored to the austere 14th-century appearance. The building was reconsecrated in 1963 . In June 2014, the Bishop of Padua accepted the request of the Superior of the Order of Servants of Mary to be able to return to their historic church after 207 years of regency by the secular clergy.The Servite return to Padua after 207 years / Church / Home - The Defence of the People The delivery charge is on 6 September of the same year.Marco Carminati, Donatello forgotten, on arteconomy24.ilsole24ore.com, Gruppo 24 ORE, 30 August 2009.

The arcade covers a 1510 porch commissioned by Bartolomeo Campolongo. The 10 octagonal columns were reutilized from a 14th- century chapel in the nearby basilica church of St Antony. On the porch there is a large Gothic portal (last decades of the 14th century), made from blocks of white and red marble. The 15th-century wooden doors are carved in the Lombard Romanesque style.

According to the royal chronicles, Sithu II overthrew his brother King Naratheinkha after his brother seized his wife Weluwaddy in 1174. Early life According to the chronicles, the future queen was born in Myinsaing to a commoner family, and grew up to be a great beauty.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 312 When King Naratheinkha came to power in 1171, the chief of Myinsaing sent her as part of his tribute to the new king. At the palace in Pagan (Bagan), the king was not impressed by the country girl before him. He is said to have particularly disliked her ears, deeming them too large. He passed, and gave her to his younger brother Crown Prince Narapati who made her a junior wife. At Pagan Chronicles say that the former country girl blossomed into a sophisticated beauty in the next few years. Her transformation was orchestrated by the dowager queen Myauk Pyinthe. The queen mother had the girl's ears surgically reduced, sent her to finishing school, and personally taught her court etiquette. The junior princess is said to have emerged more beautiful and sophisticated than all other princesses at the palace.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 312‚Äì313 She was finally noticed by the king himself one day when she accompanied the queen mother to a party at the palace. There, the king was taken by her beauty, and now coveted his brother's wife.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 313 Naratheinkha's attempt to seize her in the next few months would alter the course of history. The king hastily came up with a scheme: He had a minister falsely report a rebellion in the extreme north of the kingdom at Ngasaunggyan (present-day Dehong, Yunnan), and ordered his brother, commander-in-chief of the royal army, to march there. As ordered, Narapati left with the army. When the army reached Thissein (modern Shwebo District), about 210 km north of Pagan, Naratheinkha raised his sister-in-law to queen. But the news reached Thissein within a few days as a cavalry officer loyal to the crown prince came up to deliver the news. Narapati turned around, and sent an elite company of 80 troops led by Commander Aung Zwa with the order to assassinate the king.Harvey 1925: 53‚Äì54 Queen of Pagan In 1174, Narapati became king as Sithu II. All three main chronicles say that she became the chief queen consort with the title of Weluwaddy (Pali: Veluvati).Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 211Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 133Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 315 However, a contemporary inscription from Sithu II's reign places her last in a list of six senior queens.Than Tun 1964: 129 The couple had a son, Zeya Thura.

The highest organ of both the government and the party, it was the last Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. It was attended by delegates from all the republics and provinces, as well as a party delegation from the Yugoslav People's Army. The meeting was chaired by President of the Presidium of the Central Committee Milan Panƒçevski from Macedonia. Background During the 1980s, Yugoslavia has faced a growing political and economic crisis that threatened the very survival of the federation. Conflicting strategies of the future of the nation, based both in republic's capitals, Belgrade, the power of the League of Communists, and its debt crisis finally separated on the 14th extraordinary Congress in January 1990. Preparations for congress The regular congress of SKJ should be held in 1990, but it was suggested earlier, at the 18th session of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, when this proposal was rejected. Then, on the 20th session, the delegation of Vojvodina again proposed the holding of an extraordinary congress, which was again rejected, while the same proposal at the 22nd session was not accepted. There was no single stance on whether this congress should be called extraordinary. Such a name was especially opposed by Slovenian delegation. On the issues to be addressed, especially those who referred to the future organization of Yugoslavia, the congress was indeed remarkable. Number of participants The elected delegates of the congress were 1,457, as follows: *Serbia - 564 (including delegates of Vojvodina: 137 and Kosovo: 94), *Bosnia and Herzegovina - 248, *Croatia - 216, *Macedonia - 141, *Slovenia - 114, *Montenegro - 99 *Yugoslav People's Army - 68, *Federation authorities - 7 members *SKJ authorities - 198 delegates That was the total of 1,655 Congress delegates.Today, January 30, 1990: 8 Number of participants of the 1st plenary session According to the report of the Verification Commission, submitted after the 1st plenary session, 1,601 delegates with voting rights participated in the work of the congress.Politika, 21. 1.1990: 1). Number of participants of the 2nd plenary session At the beginning of the 2nd plenary session, 1,612 delegates voted in the work of the congress.Vjesnik, 23.1.1990 .: 5. The Congress During the Congress, any illusions about a united LCY front that could bring the country out of crisis were dispelled. Instead the Congress was dominated mostly by clashes between the Serbian and Slovenian delegations over the power and decision making process of the Constituent republics of Yugoslavia. The Serbian delegation advocated for the introduction of a policy of \\"one man - one vote\\", with a more centralized Yugoslavia. The Slovenes, however, suggested a confederation party and state, giving more power to the republics. All proposals of the Slovenian delegation, led by Milan Kuƒçan, were rejected. At the same time, Serbian proposals were accepted on a majority vote, helped by Serbia's domination of the votes in Kosovo, Vojvodina and Montenegro. After two days with a sharp verbal conflict, the Slovene delegation walked out of the Sava Center 22nd January. Immediately thereafter, the head of the delegation from Serbia, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, suggested that Congress continue to work and move on to decision-making. However, this was strongly opposed by the delegation from Croatia, who argued this was unconstitutional. At the prompting of Slobodan Lang, Ivica Raƒçan, head of the Croatian delegation approached the speaker and declared that \\"we (the SKH delegation) can not accept the Yugoslav party without the Slovenes\\". When Milo≈°eviƒá asked what it would take to recommence the meeting, the Croatian delegation remarked \\"the Slovene delegation\\", and that if the meeting was recommenced they too would leave the proceedings. When attempts were made, the Croatian delegation were true to their word, and they too left, joined by the delegations of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. At 22.45 Milan Panƒçevski called the day's proceedings to a close, and an adjournment for the following day, however, this did not happen, and the congress was never recalled.http://magazinplus.eu/142236/ Yugoslavia faced an uncertain period after the Congress, without any significant cohesive force or individual that would lead to some kind of compromise or conciseness. Soon after, the LCY was dissolved after 81 years of existence, ending 45 years of uninterrupted rule and paving the way for free elections. This event was one of the key moments for the beginning of the breakup of Yugoslavia.Joviƒá, B.

It was established in 1912 and is affiliated to Indian Council of Agricultural Research. It was established to promote research efforts in sugarcane production and is the only sugarcane research institute in the country. History The Sugarcane Breeding Institute was established by the British Raj in 1912. The institute was established as a sugarcane research station under the Department of Agriculture, Madras Presidency funded by the then British Government. In 1932, a new center at Karnal was established with the funds sanctioned by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. In 1962, a new research center was established in Kannur to house the world collection of sugarcane germplasm. The institute got affiliated to Indian Council of Agricultural Research in 1969. In 1999, a new research center at Agali, Palakkad became operational. Work The sugarcane varieties introduced by the institute occupy more than 90% of total sugarcane cultivated area in India. The institute was involved in early research into hybridization, a first attempt to improve the subtropical types of sugarcanes. The first variety Co 205 was developed in 1918 based on wild sugarcane species Saccharum spontaneum and Saccharum officinarum resulted in 50 percent improvement in cane yield. The sugarcane varieties introduced were exported to Cuba and the United States. In 2012, the institute developed transgenic sugarcane introducing new molecular technologies. In 2014, the institute introduced high energy sugar canes with high sucrose content which can be used for both commercial sugar extraction and biomass energy production. In 2015, a new sett treatment device was developed in collaboration with the Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering for treating the setts under reduced pressure to prevent them from fungal diseases. The institute introduced seven new varieties of sugarcane in 2015.

It is the third volume in the Amulet series. It was written and drawn by author Kazu Kibuishi.  Plot  The Elf King, believing that Emily is too dangerous to be left alone, sends Gabilan, an assassin to hunt her down. At the same time, elf soldiers continue to hunt down Trellis, who is continuing his quest to recruit Emily. Meanwhile, Trellis finds Luger in a cave, who has become weak and crippled due to using the amulet too much in The Stonekeeper's Curse. Trellis, instead of getting revenge and finishing him off instead takes pity on him and they begin to travel together. Trellis notices that Luger is surprisingly gentle and polite compared to how he was in Book 2. As Trellis and Luger continue to travel, Emily, her mother and Navin look for leaves to help the robot Cogsley to cover up their robotic house. Emily, who noticed that the humanoid fox Leon was missing, finds him in her great grandfather Silas's study. He explains to her that they are heading to Cielis, despite the fact that it was destroyed by elves long ago. Cielis was a city where stonekeepers would be trained to control and use their amulet's power. These stonekeepers would be part of the Guardian Council, a group of leaders that would rule Alledia. But ever since The Elf King took over, he has been ruling Alledia with unfair rules, and so Leon and his crew's plan would be to seek help from the Guardian Council. Leon mentions that some people have claimed to have seen Cielis among the clouds in the sky. The crew goes to a nearby city, and arrives at a bar to hire an airship crew so they can look for Cielis. They find two humanoid cats, Enzo and Rico, who claim to have seen Cielis in the sky, but elves enter the bar searching for their wanted prisoners. The crew believes they are after Emily and try to hide her, but they find out the prisoners are Trellis and Luger, whom elves from outside of the bar have already found. Emily, remembering events from the first book, remembers how Trellis wanted her to join him to kill the Elf King, decides to save him, and attacks the other elves with her amulet. They head to where Enzo and Rico's airship is docked with the elves in pursuit, and are able to escape in it. Navin offers to fly the ship due to his experience with the robotic house, but Enzo rejects the offer, thinking him to be too young, yet later on in the book he flies it through a storm while the automatic pilot robot is knocked out. As the ship continues to fly, Leon begins teaching Emily how to defend with the Amulet rather than attack. When Trellis uses his amulet to wrap energy around Emily's mother, Emily, thinking that he was trying to attack her, shoots a blast of energy at him, but finds out that he was really protecting her from a wyvern (A type of bird in the Amulet series). The wyvern damages the ship's wings, but Cogsley and Miskit fix it, but are swept off the ship in doing so, much to Emily's depression. Later, Emily asks Trellis why he wants to kill his father (The Elf King). He explains that when he was growing up, he was raised by his uncle. Once he decided to spy on what happened in his father's room, and saw his father wearing a mask to hide the fact that he is dead. In that very moment, he found out that his father was being possessed by someone or something. The crew arrives at an island floating in the sky, where they have to solve a pattern of stones which are being held in midair due to the power of an amulet's energy. After doing so, the elf that The Elf King has sent attacks them, but Emily and Trellis work together to defeat him. Three mysterious people appear, one of them a teen stonekeeper named Max Griffin. The book ends with Max telling Emily that she will be tested by the Guardian Council to see if she will be worthy enough to be part of them.

As a two-year-old in 1983 she won on her debut and then took the Princess Margaret Stakes on her second appearance. After finishing second in the Lowther Stakes and the Moyglare Stud Stakes she recorded her biggest victory in the Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following year she failed to win but was placed in the 1000 Guineas and the Nassau Stakes as well as finishing fourth in the Coronation Stakes and the Irish Champion Stakes. After her retirement from racing she became a very successful broodmare, producing the 1000 Guineas winner Shadayid and several other good winners. Background Desirable was a \\"lightly made\\", \\"rather narrow\\" grey mare bred in Ireland by Mrs. W. Brannigan. She was sired by Lord Gayle, an American-bred stallion who won the Prix Perth in 1970. Lord Gayle's other winning progeny included Carroll House, Blue Wind, Gay Lemur (Jockey Club Stakes) and the leading hurdler Pollardstown. Her dam Balidaress was an outstanding broodmare whose other descendants have included Park Appeal, Russian Rhythm and Cape Cross. As a yearling, Desirable was offered for sale and was bought for 10,000 Irish guineas. During her racing career she competed in the blue and silver colours of the Gloucestershire-based Catherine Corbett and was trained at Lambourn in Berkshire by Barry Hills. Racing career 1983: two-year-old season Desirable made her racecourse debut in the twenty-eight runner Princess Maiden Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in July. She accelerated clear of her rivals in the final furlong and recorded an impressive five length victory over the Ian Balding-trained Inspire. After the race a half- share in the filly was bought by Robert Sangster. Later that month she was moved up in class and made 4/6 favourite for the Princess Margaret Stakes over the same distance at Ascot Racecourse. Ridden by Lester Piggott she stayed on well in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Rocket Alert. In August she was stepped up again for the Group Two Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse in which Steve Cauthen rode the filly for the first time. She was beaten two and a half lengths into second place by the Henry Cecil-trained Prickle (ridden by Piggott), with the Cherry Hinton Stakes winner Chapel Cottage in third and Pebbles in fourth. Hills reportedly felt that the filly had been unsuited by the slow pace. On 10 September, Desirable was sent to Ireland and started the 9/4 favourite for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh. With Cauthen again in the saddle she finished second of the twenty runners, beaten three quarters of a length by the locally trained Gala Event. Eighteen days later, she ended her season in the Cheveley Park Stakes (then the only British Group One race restricted to two-year-old fillies) over six furlongs at Newmarket and started at odds of 12/1 in a twelve-runner field. Prickle started favourite ahead of Gala Event, the French challenger Island Smile and the previously unbeaten Jameelapi, whilst the other contenders included Rocket Alert and Pebbles. Cauthen tracked the leader Prickle and moved up to challenge for the lead in the final furlong. The race produced a very close and exciting finish, with Desirable taking the lead in the final strides and winning by a neck and a short head from Pebbles and Prickle, with Gala Event, Malaak and Rocket Alert close behind. 1984: three-year-old season As a three-year-old, Desirable failed to win in six races but ran consistently well in defeat. On her racecourse debut she contested the classic 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket and finished third of the fifteen runners behind Pebbles and Meis-El-Reem. In the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh she finished fifth of twenty-three behind Katies, beaten one and a half lengths by the winner and in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in June she took fourth place behind Katies, Pebbles and So Fine. In July she was moved up in distance to contest the Group Two Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and finished second to Optimistic Lass. On her next appearance Desirable was matched against colts and older horses for the first time when she contested the inaugural Irish Champion Stakes (the most valuable race ever contested in Ireland up to that time) over ten furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse in September. She produced arguably the best performance of her career as she finished fourth behind Sadler's Wells, Seattle Song and Princess Pati. She ran poorly in her only subsequent start and was retired from racing at the end of the year. In December 1984, Desirable was auctioned at Newmarket and bought for 1 million guineas by the Coolmore Stud. Assessment In the International Classification for 1983, Desirable was given a rating of 75, making her the seventh-best two-year-old filly in Europe behind Almeira, Shoot Clear, Masarika, Satinette, Treizieme and Eastern Dawn. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 115, six pounds below their top juvenile filly Treizieme. In their annual Racehorses of 1983 Timeform described her as a \\"thoroughly dependable\\" filly who \\"most certainly won't be found wanting for courage\\". In 1984 Timeform rated her on 119, twelve pounds behind their top three-year-old filly Northern Trick. Breeding record Desirable was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She was acquired by the Shadwell Stud and produced at least nine foals between 1988 and 1997: *Shadayid, a grey filly, foaled in 1988, sired by Shadeed. Won five races including the Prix Marcel Boussac, Fred Darling Stakes and 1000 Guineas. *Badie, grey colt, 1989, by Blushing Groom. Won two races. *Jihaad, bay colt (later gelded), 1990, by Chief's Crown. Won two hurdle races. *Dumaani, grey colt, 1991, by Danzig.

Description B. kraepelini is a long and thin snake that can grow to a total length (including tail) of . Its head and eyes are large (the head is twice the width of the neck), hence the Chinese name meaning \\"big-headed snake\\" (). The pupils are cat-like, as is typical for the genus. The colouration of the upper surface of the body and tail is usually amber or brown to copper brown, with irregular brown to diffuse black cross bands along the vertebral line. Reproduction B. kraepelini is oviparous. Females lay 5‚Äì14 eggs per clutch in summer. Behaviour and venom B. kraepelini can be quite aggressive, forming a defensive coil and striking in a viper-like fashion when threatened. The properties of the venom are poorly known, but it is considered only mildly venomous. Geographic range B. kraepelini is found throughout Taiwan to asl, large parts of eastern, central, and southern China (Anhui, Chongqing, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Zhejiang provinces), Laos, and northern Vietnam. Habitat and ecology B. kraepelini inhabits both primary and secondary forest habitats, often near villages. It is a nocturnal snake that is largely arboreal, although it may descend to the ground to cross roads. It preys upon small birds and lizards, and sometimes bird eggs. Conservation status B. kraepelini is a widespread and common species. It can be locally threatened by habitat loss. It occurs in many protected areas. References Further reading *Smith MA (1943).

He played a leading role in the politics of both Germany and France, and especially of the Lotharingian territory in between. He was a patron of scholars and writers and a reformer of monasteries. Rise If Robert was the canonical age of thirty when elected bishop, he would have been born in 901 or earlier. This is most likely, since he was already the chancellor of the see of Trier under his predecessor, Rudgar. (In 938 he granted a lifetime precaria to his predecessor's niece, Ada, and her two sons.) Robert was originally from the Batavian region, perhaps a member of the Saxon nobility. His brother, Ansfried the elder, was said to have been the count of fifteen counties, including Toxandria, and his nephew's daughter was said to be related to the Unrochinger family. Robert was described by some records as a kinsman of Bruno the Great, a member of the Ottonian royal family. Alberic of Trois Fontaines wrote that Robert was even a brother of Queen Mathilda, wife of King Henry I of Germany and mother of Bruno,MGH SS XXIII, anno 921, p.756 However, this is no longer considered possible. According to the Chronicle of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg, Robert personally educated his nephew who would one day be Bishop of Utrecht, Ansfried the younger, in law and theology. Another possible brother sometimes proposed is Lambert (nobleman of the Maasgau), the proposed father of his nephew the younger Ansfried. Robert's predecessaro, Rudgar, died on 27 January 931 and Robert became archbishop probably towards the end of the year. He owed his elevation to the influence of King Henry, and shortly afterwards was appointed archchancellor of Lotharingia, a post also held by Rudgar. On 1 June 932, jointly with Archbishops Unni of Hamburg and Hildebert of Mainz, he presided over the synod of Erfurt, a synod of all the bishops of Germany outside of Bavaria. This synod decided to stop paying tribute to Hungary. On 7 August 936, Robert and Archbishops Wigfried of Cologne and Hildebert of Mainz jointly crowned and consecrated Henry's successor, Otto I, in the palatine chapel at Aachen. Lotharingian affairs Robert continued in the favour of the new king. He is attested as archchancellor in Lotharingia from 937 to 953 and he served one term as the archchaplain of Otto's court. As archchancellor he frequently acted as an intervenor with the king on behalf of Lotharingian petitioners. Saint-Maximin in the 18th century Robert's influence in Lotharingian brought him into conflict with Duke Conrad the Red, who in May 944 at an assembly in Duisburg accused him of disloyalty (infidelitas) to the king. Conrad tried by violence to seize the abbey of Saint-Maximin in Trier, the lay abbacy of which had only been renounced by Conrad's predecessor, Duke Giselbert, in 934, and where the king's brother, Bruno, was being educated under Israel the Grammarian. The newly built church of Saint-Maximin had only been consecrated by Robert on 13 October 942. In 950, Pope Agapetus II confirmed Robert's possession of Saint-Maximin. In 946 Robert obtained from the king a confirmation of his archdiocese's control of the basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht, one of the four largest and richest abbeys in Lotharingia. This settled in the diocese's favour a longstanding dispute. In June 949 he attended an assembly of the leading men of Lotharingia at Nijmegen in the presence of King Otto. In 953, Conrad rebelled and was deposed. The king confirmed Robert's rights in Saint-Maximin on 20 August. At the same time, the archbishopric of Cologne fell vacant and Otto elevated his brother Bruno to both the archbishopric and the duchy of Lotharingia simultaneously in September 953. Otto also removed the Lotharingian chancellery from Robert and bestowed it on Bruno. Nonetheless, Robert attended the consecration of Bruno and also that of Bishop Rather of Li√®ge that year. In the spring of 955, however, he conspired with Count Reginar III of Hainaut to have Rather, a prot√©g√© of Bruno's, deposed and exiled‚Äîwithout himself ever entering into open rebellion. Reims controversy In 946, Robert became embroiled in a controversy over the archdiocese of Reims. He was possibly motivated by a desire to increase his prestige in Germany. Although he was considered the senior archbishop in 936, he was forced to crown Otto jointly with his counterparts of Mainz and Cologne, and Archbishop Frederick of Mainz had recently been confirmed as the apostolic vicar in the German kingdom by the pope. In 931, King Ralph of France deposed the uncanonically elected Archbishop Hugh and imposed his own candidate, Artold. In 940, Hugh returned and forced Artold into exile. The historian Flodoard was a close associate of Artold and accompanied him into exile, four weeks of which were spent at Trier. In 946, with the military support of King Otto I of Germany and King Louis IV of France, Artold returned to Reims and was formally re-enthroned by Archbishop Robert and Archbishop Frederick of Mainz. Hugh did not submit, and a series of synods were held under the presidency of the archbishop of Trier to settle the matter. The first met at Verdun in November 947. In attendance were, besides Robert and Artold, bishops Odalric of Aachen, Adalbero I of Metz, Goslenus of Toul and Hildebald of M√ºnster, and abbots Bruno of Lorsch, Agenoldus of Gorze and Odilo of Stavelot. The scholar Israel the Grammarian also attended. Hugh was summoned, but did not appear. The synod confirmed Artold as the legitimate archbishop of Reims and adjourned, scheduling another synod for 13 January 948. The second synod was held, as scheduled, \\"in the church of Saint Peter, within sight of the castrum of Mouzon\\". All the bishops of the province of Trier attended along with some bishops from the province of Reims. Hugh arrived and spoke with Robert in the church but did not attend the sessions. Robert allowed a letter Hugh presented, from Pope Agapetus II, to be read out loud. In it the pope ordered Hugh to be restored, but the bishops refused to heed the command, citing as their reason that the pope had previously mandated Robert of Trier and Frederick of Mainz to resolve the matter canonically and that his latest letter was drawn up at the behest of Hugh's messengers. They confirmed in a charter that Artold was the canonical bishop of Reims, but Hugh still refused to submit. In light of the failure of the Verdun and Mouzon synods to resolve the matter, Pope Agapetus dispatched a legate, Marinus, to Germany ordering King Otto to call a general synod. On 7 June 948 this synod opened under the presidency of Robert in the chapel dedicated to Saint Remigius in the royal palace at Ingelheim. The kings of Germany and France were both in attendance, as were 32 German bishops, plus Artold and Bishop Ralph II of Laon. Robert opened the synod with a statement of the \\"public matters of Gaul\\" (Galliae rem publicam). He later urged that reason be used to persuade Hugh to submit, and if that failed that he be excommunicated. When Hugh refused to submit, King Otto ordered Duke Conrad and Archbishop Robert to gather a large army, enter France and force his surrender. The army of Trier, augmented by the forces of bishops of Laon and Metz, took four weeks to assemble. The mere approach of this army forced the commander of the castle at Mouzon, where Hugh was holed up, to surrender. Hostages were taken, but Hugh was not imprisoned. The castle was razed. Robert then led the army to join up with that of Conrad and besiege the fortress of Montaigu, which had been constructed by Theobald, count of Tours, in rebellion against King Louis. It was quickly captured, and the army moved on to Laon, where Theobald was staying. There, in the abbey of Saint-Vincent, they excommunicated Theobald. After the successful summer campaign in France, Robert held a provincial synod at Trier in September 948. No Lotharingian or German bishops attended, only Artold of Reims, Ralph of Laon, Guy I of Soissons and Wicfred of Th√©rouanne. Bishop Transmarus of Noyon sent a messenger to explain his absence due to illness. The legate Marinus was present. Through the formal intercession of Robert and Artold, Marinus absolved Guy of Soissons for having previously backed Hugh. On 8 September the synod excommunicated Duke Hugh the Great, one of Archbishop Hugh's supporters and a thorn in the side of Louis IV. Pastor and patron Robert was a careful administrator of his diocese. He pushed forward with the reformation of monasteries, many of which were still at that time under lay ownership and some of which, like Saint-Maximin in Trier and Mettlach in the Saar, had suffered Viking and Hungarian raids. He reorganized the ecclesiastical structures of his diocese down to the level of the parish, especially in the northern Eifel region. He rebuilt the southern church of the cathedral district, today the Liebfrauenkirche, which he consecrated on 9 September 955. He also erected an altar over the tomb of his sixth-century predecessor, Magneric, in the abbey of Saint-Martin in Trier. His contemporary, Bishop Berengar of Verdun, depicts him as one of the inspiring reformers of Lotharingia. In 951, Robert accompanied Otto on his Italian expedition. From Italy he brought back some relics of Saint Severus of Ravenna in February 952. Robert was a scholar and a patron of scholars. Before his relationship with Rather of Li√®ge soured, they had a correspondence, wherein Rather credits Robert with an interest in the ancient Greeks and Romans and Robert in turn sent him some of his own writings. Israel the Grammarian obtained Robert's patronage by dedicating his De arte metrica to him. He went on to live as a monk at Saint-Maximin. Flodoard dedicated his Historia Remensis Ecclesiae (History of the Church of Reims) to \\"the venerable lord and delectable illustrious prelate, R., beloved in Christ\\" (Domino venerabili et in Christi karitate admodum diligibili preclaro presuli R), almost certainly the archbishop of Trier. While Flodoard goes on to say that Robert \\"commanded\\" him to write his history, it is more likely that Robert merely encouraged him. Flodoard also dedicated his poetic trilogy De triumphis Christi (The Triumph of Christ) to Robert. Robert died while attending a Hoftag in Cologne, during an epidemic of plague. His body was brought back to Trier. Older authorities place his burial in Saint-Paulinus, but he was interred in his own Liebfrauenkirche, where his tomb was discovered in 1950.

Appropriations for the trail were authorized by the U.S. Congress on July 22, 1856. It was the first road built in Dakota Territory. The Fort Ridgely Road began in southwest Minnesota near present-day New Ulm and entered the Dakota Territory near Lake Benton. It crossed the Big Sioux River near Lake Campbell, continued south of Lake Thompson, and crossed the James River near present-day Forestburg before continuing on to the Missouri River south of Fort Lookout (near present-day Chamberlain).

Since the marketing of the first model, several upgrades and improvements have taken place, each with a subsequent model number and designation attached. H107 The H107 was the first model. All subsequent models are based on this basic design. Like all Hubsan X4s, the H107 operates with four propellers and a lithium-polymer battery. It was very inexpensive compared to the available set of other quadcopters, making it appealing to first-time hobbyists and therefore a very popular product. However, it had no built-in LED lights, no camera, was easily damaged when crashing, and could easily blow away in light winds. H107L and H107P The H107L was the next Hubsan X4 model. It included a set of four LEDs on the ends of its four arms (hence the \\"L\\" designation), allowing the operator to determine its facing direction even in daylight settings. It also was given shorter blade axles on its propellers to help stabilize flight. It was eventually re-designated H107P (for \\"plus\\", though not with the same meaning as the plus symbol, \\"+\\", about which see below). H107C The H107C included a 720p digital on-board camera, allowing the user to record flights onto a micro SD card and then download the recordings to a computer for viewing. The plus model, H107C+, while still being equipped with the same 720P camera as its predecessor, was given an altitude hold mode, allowing it to maintain a given altitude without further input from the controller. The plus version also included screws along the undersides of the arms to prevent the arms from popping open which was a frequent problem in previous models. Upon its release, it was recognized as the smallest publicly available \\"drone\\" to contain a camera. H107D The H107D was the first Hubsan to have a first person view. It retained the same 720P quality as the H107C, but broadcast it to a video screen on the controller so that the pilot of the craft could see what the craft was \\"seeing\\" in real-time. During the 2015 CES Show, the Hubsan X4 H107D Plus (+) was unveiled to the public as the next generation of Hubsan's flagship line. The H107D+ also had the altitude mode upgrade. H109 The H109 included a set of brushless DC electric motors with a larger transmitter to harness the resulting power. It also has a 20-minute flight time, which is nearly three times longer than most of the previous models. It did not come in a \\"plus\\" variety (there is no H109+) which meant that it lacked the altitude hold function. H109S The Hubsan X4 Pro H109S, is the Pro version of drone from Hubsan. It featured a 1080P HD camera, GPS with return-to-home function, altitude stabilization, and internal compass. The GPS and compass work to keep the drone stable and able to fly in less than perfect conditions. The H109S Pro comes in 3 versions. * Standard edition or Low Edition, which comes with all of the above features as well as a parachute. This version has only a 1 axis Gimbal allowing it to tilt the camera down only. * The second version is the same except for an upgraded transmitter. * The third version is the top end or High Edition. It comes with the Hubsan H7000 Smart Transmitter which has a 7-inch 1200x800 screen and is powered by android. The camera gimbal is also upgraded to 3 axis from 1 meaning that it can control pitch, roll and yaw instead of just pitch. H111 The H111, also marketed as the \\"Q4 Nano\\" quadcopter, is the smallest quadcopter Hubsan manufactures: it is about 45 mm on a side (excluding propellers), and weighs 11.5 grams. Marketed as more of a toy than other models, it includes few of the features of other Hubsan quadcopters: although it does have the LED lights for orientation, there is no camera, no altitude hold, and it has only a five- minute flight time per charge (battery is built-in and must be charged with a USB cable for 40 minutes to obtain a full charge). Also, unlike most other Hubsan models, the H111 has no pre-designed propeller guard, which means the propellers are more exposed and likely to be damaged in a crash. H111 Q4 FPV The Hubsan H111 Q4 FPV follows the pattern that Hubsan use with their other ranges and adds a First Person View capable model to this nano quad. The H111 FPV is the same as the standard H111 in terms of features but it has a FPV camera on the front and a 5.8 GHz video transmitter to send the real time images back to the screen on the controller (transmitter). The battery is a 180 mAh LiPo which, while tiny, is almost twice the size of the standard H111's 100 mAh battery. That results in a slightly increased flight time, even considering the bigger power drain. H501S The H501S, also marketed as the \\"Hubsan X4 FPV brushless\\" quadcopter, has 20 minutes' flight time, first- person view (FPV), altitude hold, Headless mode, GPS mode, follow-me mode, circle mode, orbit mode, and auto return home. H502E The H502E, also marketed as the \\"H502E X4 DESIRE CAM\\" is a smaller version of the H501S quadcopter. Uses brushed motors, has 12 minutes' flight time, 7.4V (2S) 610 mAh Li-Po battery, GPS Positioning, altitude hold, 720P High Definition Camera and return to home.

Education  Naegamvala received his BA from Elphinstone College, Bombay; he received his MA in physics and chemistry in 1878. He was awarded the chancellor's gold medal, the highest honor of Bombay University. He joined Elphinstone College as lecturer in experimental physics, in 1882. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (FRAS), in 1885; and in 1888, he joined the College of Science, Pune, College of Engineering, as professor of astrophysics.  Contributions to astrophysics  Naegamvala's work included observations of nebulae, solar flash spectrum, and the transit of Mercury on 9 May 1891. His independently organised, and conducted, expedition to Jeur, in western India, to observe the solar chromosphere and corona, during the 1898 eclipse, broke a psychological barrier to the entry of Indian scientists to the study of astronomy. His observations were published in several scientific journals; one paper in The Astrophysical Journal, 5 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and two in The Observatory. His spectroscopic observations of the Orion Nebula, using several spectroscopes and the 16¬Ω-inch Grubb telescope at several magnifications, showed that its green nebular line is sharp, symmetrical, and narrow, and not \\"fluted\\", thus refuting Norman Lockyer's \\"meteoric hypothesis\\" of the nebulae, according to which the spectrographic lines arise from the collisional heat of the meteoric particles, and require the nebular line to be fluted (extended or shaded like molecular bands‚Äìthe likely molecular band at this wavelength being that of MgO). Before Naegamvala's observations, others‚Äînotably Huggins, Vogeland, and James Keeler at Lick‚Äîshowed the lines to be sharp, but there was still a major controversy. As Osterbrock says, > although Keeler‚Äôs paper convinced most of his contemporaries, Lockyer and > his partisans could not accept the result, and at a meeting of the Royal > Astronomical Society on 8 May 1891, with neither Huggins nor Lockyer > present, an argument welled up. It began with the reading of a paper from > K.D. Naegamvala of Poonah, India, who had been observing the Orion nebula > with his 16¬Ω-inch telescope and three prism spectroscope and found that the > chief nebular line was sharp under all circumstances, and therefore not the > remnant of magnesium fluting, as Lockyer had suggested. Captain William > Noble, a friend and partisan of Huggins, rose and smoothly congratulated > Naegamvala, through the Secretary who had read the paper. Noble is supposed to have said, > The theory (meteoric)... has been already three times killed by Dr Huggins > in England, Dr Vogel in Germany and Professor Keeler at Lick observatory, > and I think that we must look on Mr Naegamvala as having finally killed and > buried it. He was a member of British scientific team that went to Norway, in 1896, to observe a total solar eclipse. The six-inch refracting telescope, from Lerebours and Secretan, of 1850, was remodelled and installed for daily photographs of the Sun and is still being used (one of the oldest telescopes still in use) sent by Greenwich on permanent loan to the photoheliograph. These observations produced plots showing that the shape of the Sun's corona, with respect to sun spot numbers over the years, varies with the solar cycle. This work of Naegamvala might be considered the highlight of all his astronomical achievements.  Takhtasingji Observatory  In 1882, The Maharaja of Bhavnagar visited Elphinstone College and funded, offering a sum of and hoping for a matching grant by Bombay Government, the Maharaja Takhtasingji Observatory, in Pune, which Naegamvala helped develop; in 1900, becoming director. The observatory's twenty-inch Grubb telescope remained the largest in India for eight decades to come. When Naegamvala retired in 1912, the observatory was shut down, with all equipment being transferred to the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory.

The banking system in Nigeria is regulated through the Central Bank of Nigeria. This apex bank started operation on July 1, 1959.  Background  In 1892, the African Banking Corporation and the Bank of British West Africa, now First Bank of Nigeria, were established in Nigeria. In 1925, the Anglo-Egyptian Bank and National Bank of South Africa gave birth to Barclays Bank in Nigeria. In 1948, the British and French Bank for Commerce and Industry started operations in Nigeria, which metamorphosed into the United Bank for Africa. The first domestic bank In Nigeria was established in 1929 and called Industrial and Commercial Bank. The bank liquidated in 1930 and was replaced by Mercantile Bank in 1931. The African Continental Bank was created in 1949 as the only sustainable indigenous bank after the liquidation of the Industrial and Commercial Bank. The year 1947 shows the emergence of an agricultural bank called the Nigerian Farmers and Commercial Bank.  The modified universal banking model  In 2010, the Central Bank of Nigeria re-modified the existing universal banking model that permits a commercial banking license holder to operate in other non-core banking, either directly or indirectly, through designated subsidiaries. The introduction of this scheme classifies banking licenses into commercial, Merchant and Specialised/Development Banking Licenses.  Nigeria banking reform  Nigeria banking reform can be divided into two main phases, 2004 and 2009. Each phase had significant economic effects:  Banking Reform of 2004 and its effect  This reform focused on bank consolidation through the mechanism of merger and acquisition. This resulted in rebasing of commercial banks from ‚Ç¶2 billion to ‚Ç¶25 billion, while the 89 existing commercial banks in the country became 25. The apex bank apart from capitalization also invested in banking automation which enhances banking returns. The reform established a reporting portal for bank customers for the purpose of information sharing. Under this reform, deposits from public sectors and government-owned agencies can be collected by the commercial banks in order to enhance their level of liquidity.  Banking Reform of 2009 and its effect  The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria AMCON was established in 2009 by the National Assembly of Nigeria. The institution acquires non-performing loans of commercial banks. The financing of AMCON is composed of a ‚Ç¶50 billion CBN fund and 0.3% of total assets of participating commercial banks. It also supports the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for global reporting compliance in terms of reporting. This reform reviewed the universal banking model by restricting commercial banks to banking activities only. The reform also addresses excessive banking interest by the creation of a non-interest bank.https://www.cbn.gov.ng/OUT/SPEECHES/2012/GOV_WARWICK_150211.PDF Sarah Alade, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, announced that five Nigerian bank CEOs were being dismissed in August 2009.

Forecasting can be both expected price value and probabilistic forecasting.  Background  When electricity sectors were regulated, utility monopolies used short-term load forecasts to ensure the reliability of supply and long-term demand forecasts as the basis for planning and investing in new capacity. However, since the early 1990s, the process of deregulation and the introduction of competitive electricity markets have been reshaping the landscape of the traditionally monopolistic and government-controlled power sectors. In many countries worldwide, electricity is now traded under market rules using spot and derivative contracts. At the corporate level, electricity load and price forecasts have become a fundamental input to energy companies‚Äô decision making mechanisms. The costs of over- or undercontracting and then selling or buying power in the balancing market are typically so high that they can lead to huge financial losses and bankruptcy in the extreme case. In this respect electric utilities are the most vulnerable, since they generally cannot pass their costs on to the retail customers. While there have been a variety of empirical studies on point forecasts (i.e., the \\"best guess\\" or expected value of the spot price), probabilistic - i.e., interval and density - forecasts have not been investigated extensively to date. However, this is changing and nowadays both researchers and practitioners are focusing on the latter. While the Global Energy Forecasting Competition in 2012 was on point forecasting of electric load and wind power, the 2014 edition aimed at probabilistic forecasting of electric load, wind power, solar power and electricity prices.  Benefits from reducing electric load and price forecast errors  Extreme volatility of wholesale electricity prices, which can be up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of any other commodity or financial asset, has forced market participants to hedge not only against volume risk but also against price movements. A generator, utility company or large industrial consumer who is able to forecast the volatile wholesale prices with a reasonable level of accuracy can adjust its bidding strategy and its own production or consumption schedule in order to reduce the risk or maximize the profits in day-ahead trading. Yet, since load and price forecasts are being used by many departments of an energy company, it is very hard to quantify the benefits of improving them. A rough estimate of savings from a 1% reduction in the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for a utility with 1GW peak load is: * $500,000 per year from long-term load forecasting, * $300,000 per year from short-term load forecasting, * $600,000 per year from short-term load and price forecasting.  Main areas of interest  The most popular (in terms of the number of research papers and techniques developed) subfields of energy forecasting include: * Load forecasting (electric load forecasting, electric demand forecasting). Although \\"load\\" is an ambiguous term, in load forecasting the \\"load\\" usually means demand (in kW) or energy (in kWh) and since the magnitude of power and energy is the same for hourly data, usually no distinction is made between demand and energy. Load forecasting involves the accurate prediction of both the magnitudes and geographical locations over the different periods of the planning horizon. The basic quantity of interest is typically the hourly total system (or zonal) load. However, load forecasting is also concerned with the prediction of hourly, daily, weekly and monthly values of load and of the peak load. * Electricity price forecasting * Wind power forecasting * Solar power forecasting  Forecasting horizons  It is customary to talk about short-, medium- and long-term forecasting, but there is no consensus in the literature as to what the thresholds should actually be: * Short-term forecasting generally involves horizons from a few minutes up to a few days ahead, and is of prime importance in day-to-day market operations. In load forecasting, very short-term forecasting with lead times measured in minutes is often considered as a separate class of forecasts. * Medium-term forecasting, from a few days to a few months ahead, is generally preferred for balance sheet calculations, risk management and derivatives pricing. In many cases, especially in electricity price forecasting, evaluation is based not on the actual point forecasts, but on the distributions of prices over certain future time periods. As this type of modeling has a long-standing tradition in finance, an inflow of \\"finance solutions\\" is observed. * Long-term forecasting, with lead times measured in months, quarters or even years, concentrates on investment profitability analysis and planning, such as determining the future sites or fuel sources of power plants.

Bracing may be applied both internally and externally, and may take the form of strut, which act in compression or tension as the need arises, and/or wires, which act only in tension. In general, bracing allows a stronger, lighter structure than one which is unbraced, but external bracing in particular adds drag which slows down the aircraft and raises considerably more design issues than internal bracing. Another disadvantage of bracing wires is that they require routine checking and adjustment, or rigging, even when located internally. During the early years of aviation, bracing was a universal feature of all forms of aeroplane, including the monoplanes and biplanes which were then equally common. Today, bracing in the form of lift struts is still used for some light commercial designs where a high wing and light weight are more important than ultimate performance. Design principle Bracing works by creating a triangulated truss structure which resists bending or twisting. By comparison, an unbraced cantilever structure bends easily unless it carries a lot of heavy reinforcement. Making the structure deeper allows it to be much lighter and stiffer. To reduce weight and air resistance, the structure may be made hollow, with bracing connecting the main parts of the airframe. For example, a high-wing monoplane may be given a diagonal lifting strut running from the bottom of the fuselage to a position far out towards the wingtip. This increases the effective depth of the wing root to the height of the fuselage, making it much stiffer for little increase in weight. Typically, the ends of bracing struts are joined to the main internal structural components such as a wing spar or a fuselage bulkhead, and bracing wires are attached close by. Bracing may be used to resist all the various forces which occur in an airframe, including lift, weight, drag and twisting or torsion. A strut is a bracing component stiff enough to resist these forces whether they place it under compression or tension. A wire is a bracing component able only to resist tension, going slack under compression, and consequently is nearly always used in conjunction with struts. Bracing methods Interplane struts and bracing wires on a de Havilland Tiger Moth A square frame made of solid bars is not rigid but tends to bend at the corners. Bracing it with an extra diagonal bar would be heavy. A wire would be much lighter but would stop it collapsing only one way. To hold it rigid, two cross-bracing wires are needed. This method of cross-bracing can be seen clearly on early biplanes, where the wings and interplane struts form a rectangle which is cross-braced by wires. Another way of arranging a rigid structure is to make the cross pieces solid enough to act in compression and then to connect their ends with an outer diamond acting in tension. This method was once common on monoplanes, where the wing and a central cabane or a pylon form the cross members while wire bracing forms the outer diamond. Bracing wires Most commonly found on biplane and other multiplane aircraft, wire bracing was also common on early monoplanes. Unlike struts, bracing wires always act in tension. The thickness and profile of a wire affect the drag it causes, especially at higher speeds. Wires may be made of multi-stranded cable, a single strand of piano wire, or aerofoil sectioned steel. Bracing wires primarily divide into flying wires which hold the wings down when flying and landing wires which hold the wings up when they are not generating lift. (The wires connecting a basket or gondola to a balloon are also called flying wires.) Thinner incidence wires are sometimes run diagonally between fore and aft interplane struts to stop the wing twisting and changing its angle of incidence to the fuselage.de Havilland Aircraft Company. The de Havilland DH82A Tiger Moth - Maintenance and Repair Manual, Third Edition . Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The de Havilland Aircraft Company Ltd. (Date unknown) In some pioneer aircraft, wing bracing wires were also run diagonally fore and aft to prevent distortion under side loads such as when turning. Besides the basic loads imposed by lift and gravity, bracing wires must also carry powerful inertial loads generated during manoeuvres, such as the increased load on the landing wires at the moment of touchdown. Rigging Bracing wires must be carefully rigged to maintain the correct length and tension. In flight the wires tend to stretch under load and on landing some may become slack. Regular rigging checks are required and any necessary adjustments made before every flight. Rigging adjustments may also be used to set and maintain wing dihedral and angle of incidence, usually with the help of a clinometer and plumb-bob. Individual wires are fitted with turnbuckles or threaded end fittings so that they can be readily adjusted. Once set, the adjuster is locked in place.Halliwell 1919, p.107. Internal bracing Internal bracing was most significant during the early days of aeronautics when airframes were literally frames, at best covered in doped fabric which had no strength of its own. Wire cross-bracing was extensively used to stiffen such airframes, both in the fabric-covered wings and in the fuselage, which was often left bare. Routine rigging of the wires was needed to maintain structural stiffness against bending and torsion. A particular problem for internal wires is access in the cramped interior of the fuselage. External bracing Often, providing sufficient internal bracing would make a design too heavy, so in order to make the airframe both light and strong the bracing is fitted externally. This was common in early aircraft due to the limited engine power available and the need for light weight in order to fly at all. As engine powers rose steadily through the 1920s and 30s, much heavier airframes became practicable and most designers abandoned external bracing in order to allow for increased speed. Biplanes Biplane with interplane and cabane struts cross-braced by flying and landing wires. Nearly all biplane aircraft have their upper and lower planes connected by interplane struts, with the upper wing running across above the fuselage and connected to it by shorter cabane struts. These struts divide the wings into bays which are braced by diagonal wires. The flying wires run upwards and outwards from the lower wing, while the landing wires run downwards and outwards from the upper wing. The resulting combination of struts and wires is a rigid box girder-like structure independent of its fuselage mountings. Interplane struts Interplane struts hold apart the wings of a biplane or multiplane, also helping to maintain the correct angle of incidence for the connected wing panels. Parallel struts: The most common configuration is for two struts to be placed in parallel, one behind the other. These struts will usually be braced by \\"incidence wires\\" running diagonally between them. These wires resist twisting of the wing which would affect its angle of incidence to the airflow. N-struts replace the incidence wires by a third strut running diagonally from the top of one strut to the bottom of the other in a pair. V-struts converge from separate attachment points on upper wing to a single point on the lower wing. They are often used for the sesquiplane wing, in which the lower wing has a considerably smaller chord than the upper wing. I-struts replaces the usual pair of struts by a single, thicker streamlined strut with its ends extended fore and aft along the wing. Bays Handley Page V/1500 multi-bay biplane The span of a wing between two sets of interplane or cabane struts is called a bay. Wings are described by the number of bays on each side. For example, a biplane with cabane struts and one set of interplane struts on each side of the aircraft is a single-bay biplane. For a small type such as a World War I scout like the Fokker D.VII, one bay is usually enough. But for larger wings carrying greater payloads, several bays may be used. The two-seat Curtiss JN-4 Jenny is a two-bay biplane, while large heavy types were often multi-bay biplanes or triplanes ‚Äî the earliest examples of the German Albatros B.I, and all production examples of the DFW B.I two- seater unarmed observation biplanes of 1914 were two of the very few single- engined, three-bay biplanes used during World War I . Some biplane wings are braced with struts leaned sideways with the bays forming a zigzag Warren truss. Examples include the Ansaldo SVA series of single-engined high-speed reconnaissance biplanes of World War I, and the early World War II-era Fiat CR.42 Falco. Other variations have also been used. The SPAD S.XIII fighter, while appearing to be a two bay biplane, has only one bay, but has the midpoints of the rigging braced with additional struts, however these are not structurally contiguous from top to bottom wing. The Sopwith Strutter has a W shape cabane, however as it doesn't connect the wings to each other, it doesn't add to the number of bays.

Cabane N-struts and torsion wires on a de Havilland Tiger Moth Where an aircraft has a wing running clear above the main fuselage, the two components are often connected by cabane struts running up from the top of the fuselage or crew cabin to the wing centre section. Such a wing is usually also braced elsewhere, with the cabane struts forming part of the overall bracing scheme. Because cabane struts often carry engine thrust to the upper wing to overcome its drag, the loads along each diagonal between fore and aft struts are unequal and they are often formed as N-struts. They may also have cross- braced torsion wires to help stop the wing twisting. A few biplane designs, like the British 1917 Bristol Fighter two-seat fighter/escort, had its fuselage clear of the lower wing as well as the upper one, using ventral cabane struts to accomplish such a design feature. Monoplanes Wire braced monoplane with wires from central mountings to wings, i.e. Fokker Eindecker Early monoplanes relied entirely on external wire bracing, either directly to the fuselage or to kingposts above it and undercarriage struts below to resist the same forces of lift and gravity. Many later monoplanes, beginning in 1915, have used cantilever wings with their lift bracing within the wing to avoid the drag penalties of external wires and struts, Cabanes In many early wire-braced monoplanes, e.g. the Bl√©riot XI and Fokker Eindecker (both wing warping designs), dorsal and sometimes ventral strut systems or cabanes were placed either above, or above and below the fuselage. This could be used both to provide some protection to the pilot if the craft overturned on the ground, and also for the attachment of landing wires which ran out in a slightly inclined vee to fore and aft points near the wing tips. In parasol wing monoplanes the wing passes above the fuselage and is joined to the fuselage by cabane struts, similarly to the upper wing of a biplane.Crane 1997, Page 379 On some types the cabane is replaced by a single thick, streamlined pylon. Lift struts On a high-wing aircraft, a lift strut connects an outboard point on the wing with a point lower on the fuselage to form a rigid triangular structure. While in flight the strut acts in tension to carry wing lift to the fuselage and hold the wing level, while when back on the ground it acts in compression to hold the wing up. For aircraft of moderate engine power and speed, lift struts represent a compromise between the high drag of a fully cross-braced structure and the high weight of a fully cantilevered wing. They are common on high-wing types such as the Cessna 152 and almost universal on parasol-winged types such as the Consolidated PBY Catalina. A Piper Pawnee low-wing monoplane with V lifting strut Less commonly, some low-winged monoplanes like the Piper Pawnee have had lift struts mounted above the wing, acting in compression in flight and in tension on the ground. Sometimes each wing has just a single lift strut, as on the Cessna 152, but they often come in pairs, sometimes parallel as on the Catalina, sometimes splayed or as V-form pairs (e.g. Auster Autocrat) joined to the fuselage at a single point. Many more complicated arrangements have been used, often with two primary lift struts augmented by auxiliary interconnections known as jury struts between each other or to the wing or the fuselage. Each pair of the inverted V struts of the Pawnee, for example, is assisted by a pair of vertical support struts. From early times these lift struts have been streamlined, often by enclosing metal load bearing members in shaped casings. The Farman F.190, for example, had its high wings joined to the lower fuselage by parallel duralumin tubes enclosed in streamlined spruce fairings and the Westland Lysander used extruded I section beams of light alloy, onto which were screwed a fore and aft pair of duralumin fairings. Later aircraft have had streamlined struts formed directly from shaped metal, like the extruded light alloy struts of the Auster AOP.9, or from composites, for example the carbon fibre lift struts of the Remos GX eLITE. Designers have adopted different methods of improving the aerodynamics of the strut-wing and strut-body, using similar approaches to those used in interplane struts. Sometimes the streamlining is tapered away close to the wing, as on the Farman F.190; other designs have an extended, faired foot, for example the Skyeton K-10 Swift. Lift struts are sometimes combined with other functions, for example helping to support the engines as on the Westland IV or the undercarriage as on the Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer. Lift struts remain common on small (2/4-seat) high-wing light aircraft in the ultralight and light-sport categories. Larger examples include the Pilatus Porter 10-seat STOL passenger aircraft and the de Havilland Twin Otter 19-seater. Jury struts Complex jury struts on a Fleet Canuck A lift strut can be so long and thin that it bends too easily. Jury struts are small subsidiary struts used to stiffen it.Crane 1997, Page 294. Problems which jury struts prevent include resonant vibration and buckling under compressive loads. Jury struts come in many configurations. On monoplanes with one main strut, there may be just a single jury strut connecting the main strut to an intermediate point on the wing. A braced monoplane with 'V' struts such as the Fleet Canuck may have a complicated assembly of jury struts. History Bracing, both internal and external, was extensively used in early aircraft to support the lightweight airframes demanded by the low engine powers and slow flying speeds then available. From the very first Wright flyer of 1903, the fuselage was no more than a braced framework and even fore-aft diagonal bracing was used to hold the wings at right angles to it. Some very early aircraft used struts made from bamboo. Most designs employed streamlined struts made either from spruce or ash wood, selected for its strength and light weight.Taylor, 1990. p.71. Metal struts were also used, and both wood and metal continue in use today. The need for fore-aft wing bracing disappeared with the advent of more powerful engines in 1909, but bracing remained essential for any practical design, even on monoplanes up until World War I when they became unpopular and braced biplanes reigned supreme. From 1911, the British researcher Harris Booth working at the National Physics Laboratory and the engineer Richard Fairey, then working for J.W. Dunne's Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate, began to develop and apply the engineering analysis of individual bays in a biplane, to calculate the structural forces and use the minimal amount of material in each bay to achieve maximum strength.Ledeboer, J.H.; Aeronautics, Vol. 18, 1920, page 81. Analytical techniques such as this led to lighter and stronger aircraft and became widely adopted. At the same time, the amount of bracing could be progressively reduced. At low speeds a thin wire causes very little drag and early flying machines were sometimes called \\"bird cages\\" due to the number of wires present. However, as speeds rise the wire must be made thinner to avoid drag while the forces it carries increase. The steady increase in engine power allowed an equally steady increase in weight, necessitating less bracing. Special bracing wires with flat or aerofoil sections were also developed in attempts to further reduce drag. The mid-1915 origin, all-metal Junkers J 1 pioneered unbraced cantilever wing design. The German professor Hugo Junkers was seriously interested in doing away with drag-inducing struts and rigging around the start of World War I, and by mid-1915 his firm had designed the Junkers J 1 all-metal \\"technology demonstrator\\" monoplane, possessing no external bracing for its thick-airfoil cantilever wing design, which could fly at just over 160 km/h with an inline-six piston engine of just 120 horsepower. By the end of World War I engine powers and airspeeds had risen enough that the drag caused by bracing wires on a typical biplane was significantly affecting performance, while the heavier but sleeker strut-braced parasol monoplane was becoming practicable. For a period this type of monoplane became the design of choice. Although it was outpaced during the 1930s by the true cantilever monoplane, it has remained in use ever since where ultimate performance is not an issue. Post-WWII Braced high aspect ratio wings were used by French Hurel-Dubois (now part of Safran) with the Hurel-Dubois HD.10 demonstrator in 1948, and then the HD.31/32/34 airliners, still used by the French Institut Geographique National until the early eighties. A turbojet-powered HD.45 was unsuccessfully proposed to compete with the Sud Aviation Caravelle, maybe due to the high-speed turbojet mismatched to a slower airframe.

He is known as the person who provided women for the king's house in Parc-aux-Cerfs.  Biography  One of his main assignments was to select young women as mistresses for his master. The tactic for this was to invite the young woman to a supper in a dining room in the palace of Versailles, and the monarch could examine her through a hole in the wall next door. If the king would find the girl sweet to his palate, she would then be informed and examined by Lebel, and later she was led into the boudoir of the king. They were otherwise housed at the Parc-aux-Cerfs. Among the lovers he provided for the king was Marguerite-Catherine Haynault, Lucie-Madeleine d'Estaing, Louise-Jeanne de Tiercelin de La Colleterie and Anne Couppier de Romans. An account of this technique is found in most of the biographies of Jeanne B√©cu, later to become Madame du Barry, when the Comte du Barry introduced her to Lebel through the Mar√©chal de Richelieu. Jeanne was at the time in the employment of the count as courtesan entertaining his guests in his gambling house. As soon as Richelieu and Lebel spoke of the king's need for a new mistress to save him from his depression, the count pounced on the opportunity. Jeanne was invited to the palace, and the king became entranced by her beauty, nature, and ample bosom. When the king began all the more falling deeper in love with her, Lebel began to become alarmed, knowing the king might not be amused of Jeanne's past. When Lebel's conscience could take no more, he divulged all about Jeanne to the king, who scolded him harshly to have her married off to gain a title in order for her to become next royal mistress. This he did, but died soon after in 1768, some say either by poisoning or for taking the king's scolding too badly. During her time in Versailles awaiting a date for her official presentation, Jeanne was given Lebel's quarters as living space.

Early life  Fraser was born and grew up in Long Beach, California in a basketball family. Fraser's father, Bill Fraser, was a basketball coach for Wilson High School in Long Beach, the same high school Bruce later attended, for more than 15 years. In 1973, Bill replaced famed coach Lute Olson as the head coach for Long Beach City College, and would eventually become the college's winningest head coach by the time he retired in 1990.  College and early career  Fraser played basketball for the Long Beach City College team, coached by his father, for one year before transferring to the University of Arizona in 1984. He was the backup point guard for Arizona's basketball team for three years, from 1984 to 1987, before going into coaching upon graduation. Arizona was in the midst of a period of success on the national level under longtime head coach Lute Olson. In Arizona, Fraser saw little playing time as a reserve, but became known as a team player. Because he typically played short minutes late in games, Fraser referred to himself as a \\"Gumby\\" for his stiffness, and began carrying a small Gumby doll in his sock as a charm during games. Eventually, the entire Arizona bench in this era became known collectively as \\"Gumbies\\", taking on Fraser's label, and known for their exuberance. Also in Arizona, Fraser met and played alongside Steve Kerr, where they became close friends. Kerr reportedly gave Fraser his nickname, \\"Q\\", abbreviated from \\"Question Man\\", because he asked so many questions during his first week. After graduating, Fraser served as a graduate assistant for Arizona under coach Lute Olson from 1987-1989, including for the top-seeded 1988 team that made Arizona's first Final Four appearance. Fraser later recalled that appearance as his favorite memory during his time in Arizona. After leaving Arizona, Fraser left basketball and returned to the Los Angeles area spending 3 years working in sound and music for 20th Century Fox. Fraser worked on such films as Home Alone and Schindler's List. While visiting friend and former Arizona basketball teammate Sean Elliott during his tenure for the San Antonio Spurs, Fraser was introduced to then-head coach‚Äîand future Hall of Famer‚ÄîLarry Brown. Missing basketball, Fraser returned to the sport with his first NBA job as a volunteer coach under Brown, now coaching the Indiana Pacers, for the 1994‚Äì1995 season that ended with an Eastern Conference Finals appearance. After his season with the Pacers, Fraser moved on to leverage his knowledge of the basketball world as the sports marketing manager for Oakley from 1995 to May 1999. Fraser managed many high-profile accounts for Oakley, including Michael Jordan and Alonzo Mourning, as well as leading the company's relationships with many college athletics departments. Fraser joined the University of Missouri coaching staff as an assistant coach for the 1999-2000 season under head coach Quin Snyder.  NBA career  In 2004, Fraser joined the Phoenix Suns as a scout, reuniting with former Arizona teammate Steve Kerr, who was part of the team's new ownership group and later became general manager. As scout, Fraser was primarily responsible for scouting the west coast college players for the Suns. After several years as scout, Fraser, a former point guard himself, also became the personal coach and workout partner for Steve Nash under Kerr's management. According to Kerr, Fraser trained Nash over summers during the last four years of Nash's NBA playing career. In May 2014, Kerr was hired as head coach for the Golden State Warriors. Kerr brought on an entirely new coaching staff, and on July 3, 2014, the team announced Fraser was being hired as an assistant coach. As the player development coach, Fraser's primary role is working with players on improving skills. With his experience working with Nash, a top point guard, one of Fraser's main roles has been working out with Stephen Curry. Curry‚Äîwidely considered the best shooter in NBA history‚Äîworks with Fraser after every practice, especially focusing on the mechanics of his shot; Fraser typically works with Curry on the court, including facilitating Curry's workout routine of taking 500 3-point shots every practice. Fraser was also described as the \\"emotional barometer of the team\\", and sees himself as tracking the team's mental state and able to communicate the feelings of the team to Kerr, due to their closeness. All of the Warriors assistant coaches share advance scouting duties for the other NBA teams of upcoming games, with Fraser responsible for six teams. Fraser won his first NBA Championship with the 2014‚Äì2015 Warriors team, which defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4‚Äì2 in the NBA Finals. In September 2015, it was reported that Steve Nash was joining the Warriors as a player development consultant to work alongside Fraser training Curry and other guards. Nash's friendship with Fraser and Kerr from their time in Phoenix was important in attracting him to Golden State. Fraser won his second NBA Championship in three years with the 2016‚Äì2017 Warriors team, which defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4‚Äì1 in the NBA Finals. Fraser won his third NBA Championship in four years with the 2017‚Äì2018 Warriors team, which defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4‚Äì0 in the NBA Finals. Fraser currently lives in San Diego, as does fellow Warriors coach Steve Kerr.

It has been translated into English, French, German, Hungarian, Japanese and Russian.  Background and publication  Lao She Lao She had lived in England for six years before returning to China in 1930. In 1931, while living in Jinan, he wrote a novel about the Jinan incident called Lake Daming. However, the manuscript was lost when the Shanghai-based publisher, Commercial Press, was attacked by the Japanese in the January 28 incident. Lao She then turned to a new project and started Cat Country, which had been commissioned by Shi Zhecun. The novel first appeared in serialised form between August 1932 and April 1933 in the journal Xiandai (Áèæ‰ª£ / Les Contemporains)Isaacson, p. 125 and then as a standalone book in August 1933, published by Xiandai Shuju (Áèæ‰ª£Êõ∏Â±Ä) in Shanghai. It was reprinted seven times until 1949, and then no edition appeared in the PRC until 1984.  Plot  The unnamed first-person narrator's spaceship crash-lands on Mars. His companion perishes in the crash, and he is stranded alone on Mars. He soon meets the planet's inhabitants, who have the faces of cats but otherwise appear human, and is captured by some of these cats and meets the leader of the group, called Scorpion, a landlord who owns a plantation of \\"reverie leaves\\", an addictive drug reminiscent of opium that is used by all cats.Isaacson, p. 129 The narrator is employed by Scorpion to guard his reverie leaves and eventually learns Felinese and gets acquainted with the country and its culture, guided by Scorpion and his son Young Scorpion. He encounters many problems in society, including ill-treatment of women, lack of hygiene and poor building standards, culminating in a visit to a school where a single gunshot makes the walls collapse.Isaacson, p. 130-133 The schools give out university diplomas on the first day, and the museums are filled with empty rooms as the contents have been sold off to foreigners. The political debate is dominated by \\"brawls\\", political parties modeled after foreign systems, with the currently leading ideology being \\"Everybody Shareskyism\\", whose leader killed and then replaced the cats' emperor,Johnson, Introduction and slogans composed of pseudo-Russian gibberish.Isaacson, p. 142 Many cat people are killed in a revolution, and finally the country is invaded by a foreign power. The invaders lock up the remaining cat people in a cage, and they end up biting each other to death. Some months later, the narrator is rescued by a passing French spacecraft.  Analysis and interpretation  The novel is a dystopian satire. It has been described as critical of Kuomintang's rule, and the corruption in society in that time, but also more generally suspicious of political indoctrination in China. The critique of political parties (called \\"brawls\\") has been seen as applicable to KMT and communists alike. Overall, many purported weaknesses of the Chinese national character are examined, and the satire criticises conservatives as well as radicals. The novel shows the influence of European utopian literature and is reminiscent of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, both in its exaggerated satirical tone and in the use of animal-like creatures. While the setting on Mars, the acknowledged influence of H. G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon and the dystopian content have led to Cat Country being classified as science fiction, there is little interest in technology, and some authors have declared it to not be science fiction. Nevertheless, it has been seen as almost the only example of Chinese science fiction between 1910 and 1949.  Critical reception  Lao She declared his attempt at satire a failure, lamenting its lack of humour, and critics have described the book as not a great novel. Cyril Birch describes it as sound in structure and fun, but very uneven. Koon- Ki Timmy Ho argues that many critics evaluated Cat Country by standards not applicable to utopian fiction, and states the book \\"placed [Lao She] among the successful modern writers of dystopia in world literature.\\" References Bibliography  Johnson, Ian.

Data onboarding is mainly used to connect offline customer records with online users by matching identifying information gathered from offline datasets to retrieve the same customers in an online audience. Process The onboarding process involves ingesting, anonymizing, matching and distributing a customer's data. Offline data used in onboarding efforts include information such as customer names, email addresses, physical addresses and phone numbers as well as CRM and sales transaction data. Part of the data onboarding process is anonymizing personally identifiable information to protect consumer privacy. Another key step involves matching offline data to online devices, such as a desktop browser cookie or mobile device ID. Offline data like a customer's email address or postal address can also be used as an identifier to match to digital ID's, such as a Facebook or Twitter account. Matched data is finally delivered to a technology platform for use in programmatic marketing. Data onboarding is primarily used to reach a company's customers with more relevant marketing messages. Companies can also use onboarded data to assess the effectiveness of a marketing campaign or the purchasing trends of their customers. Overall, the process allows data-driven marketers to optimize the impact of online campaigns. Application The data onboarding industry consists of marketing technology companies like LiveRamp, FullContact, Datalogix (now part of Oracle Data Cloud), Throtle, Neustar, El Toro, Circulate, and TrueData, which develops onboarding services for marketers. Businesses use data onboarding companies to determine whether their ads were seen on digital platforms and if they were effective in driving sales.

History Thomas Smeaton was born in London \\"within sound of Bow Bells\\", and trained as an engineer. He was sponsored by the South Australian Company to emigrate to South Australia, but finding no opening for an engineer joined the Company's financial institution, the Bank of South Australia as a clerk sometime before 1856, later as the bank's accountant. In 1864 he was appointed manager of the newly formed branch in Robe, where he was an active as President of the Robe Institute, and where his wife, a popular Sunday-school teacher, died in childbirth.

It is entirely a maritime border, along Kattegat and √òresund, and in the Baltic Sea between Bornholm and Scania. The territorial waters (12 mile zone) of the two countries meet exclusively along the √òresund, extending to about , approximately between H√∂gan√§s and Falsterbo.Karts√∂k och ortnamn There is one road and rail connection, the long √òresund fixed link, opened in 2000, besides a number of ferry links. History Scandinavia in the Middle Ages. Exclusive economic zone (200 nautical miles zone) of Denmark Sweden and Denmark‚ÄìNorway became separate countries with the breakup of the Kalmar Union in 1523. Until 1658, the historic provinces of Scania, Blekinge and Bohusl√§n (and until 1645 also Halland) belonged to Denmark, so that the Denmark‚ÄìSweden border ran across what is now southern Sweden. In 1645 and 1658 respectively, these provinces were ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde, establishing the √òresund as national boundary. The modern Norway‚ÄìSweden border remained the border between Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Sweden until the breakup of Denmark and Norway in 1814. The modern Denmark‚ÄìSweden border then became the border between the Union between Sweden and Norway and Denmark until the breakup of Sweden and Norway in 1905. It became a border of German-occupied Europe from 1940 to 1945 (Denmark was still a country although under practical control by Germany). The Nordic Passport Union of 1958 removed passport checks at the border. However, custom checks remained in force between Denmark and other Nordic countries until the Schengen acquis of 2001. There was no land border with Denmark before July 2000 when the √òresund Bridge was opened, which had relaxed customs checks from the start. With the European migrant crisis, Sweden re-introduced stricter border controls in November 2015. Beginning 4 January 2016, Sweden required carriers to perform identity checks on the Danish side of the Denmark‚ÄìSweden border, while still keeping the border controls on the Swedish side. This law was decided in an extreme haste with 35 days from government decision to practical use, including public consultation, parliament decision, practical implementation and Christmas period. This carrier requirement has been more successful than the formal border controls, and diminished the stream of refugees to Sweden. At the same time this has disrupted train traffic and causing longer travel time for work commuters. In May 2017 the European Commission decided that this type of carrier's responsibility is not legal in the EU so they were abandoned, but the border control for arrivals on the Swedish side remained. As a reaction to the Swedish control, Denmark also strengthened its border controls at the German border. Sweden-Denmark border checks to be extended, The Local, 7 January 2016. Denmark's border controls extended for third time The Local, 23 February 2016. In November 2019, Denmark started to impose temporary border controls due to serious crimes including bombing perpetrated by Swedish residents.

He and his spies found most of the North Korean targets destroyed by U.S. bombing during the war.Futrell, p. 502. Nichols also warned his superiors far in advance that North Korea was planning the surprise invasion that started the war, although his many warnings were ignored.Harden (2017), pp. 48-56. In the first months of the war, Nichols and his men broke North Korean battle codes, which helped U.S. forces survive the invasion, halt the enemy's momentum, and destroy most of the North's army.Harden (2017), pp. 81-92. Nichols created the Air Force's first covert intelligence unit, Detachment 2 of the 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron, which he commanded during most of the Korean War.Harden (2017), p. 99. His intelligence outfit, sometimes known as \\"Nick,\\" saved American lives by going behind enemy lines to find vulnerabilities in Soviet tanks and MiG fighter jets.Harden (2017), pp. 65-76, 99-102. His intelligence achievements won him the Silver Star and the Distinguished Service Cross. An extraordinary element of Nichols's 11-year tenure as a spy in South Korea (from 1946-1957), was his close personal relationship with South Korean President Syngman Rhee. Nichols was just 23 when he met the 71-year-old Rhee, but the inexperienced American spy (a 7th grade dropout) and the worldly Korean politician (a master's degree from Harvard, a doctorate from Princeton) found each other useful. Rhee used Nichols to transmit intelligence leaks to senior U.S. commanders, which helped speed Rhee's rise to power in South Korea, and Nichols boasted to his superiors that in Rhee he had cultivated a uniquely powerful and well-informed source in Seoul.Harden (2017), pp. 31-47. There was a dark side, though, to Nichols's long run as a spy commander in Korea, as well as to his postwar life in Florida, where he repeatedly committed sexual crimes involving young boys.Harden (2017), pp. 174-191. His friendship with Rhee and his collaboration with the South Korean security apparatus immersed Nichols in a brutal world of anticommunist purges, where he witnessed torture, beheadings, and the mass shootings of thousands of South Korean who were perceived as enemies of Rhee's government.Harden (2017), pp. 39-41, 77-80. Nichols did not report these atrocities to his superiors, and his senior intelligence clerk, Sergeant Serbando Torres, later said that \\"slaughtering all these people...didn't seem to bother him that much.\\"Harden (2017), p. 80. As the creator and commander of his own spy unit, Nichols had near-complete autonomy from the Air Force command structure. For many years, he reported only to Air Force General Earle E. Partridge, who was in charge of the air war in Korea.Harden (2017), pp. 107-108. The lack of supervision gave Nichols freedom to indulge his sexual interest in young Korean airmen, who were periodically brought to him in the evenings at his spy base outside of Seoul.Harden (2017), pp. 104,152. His spy command also gave Nichols unsupervised access to large amounts of cash, which he used to pay off agents and some of which he later brought back to the United States, where he kept tens of thousands of dollars in cash in his brother's freezer in Florida.Harden (2017), pp. 150-151, 180. The intelligence career of Nichols came to a secretive and tragic end in 1957, when the Air Force suddenly relieved him of his command, removed him from Korea, and sent him to psychiatric wards at U.S. military hospitals, first in Tachikawa, Japan, and then at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.Harden (2017), pp. 146-169. His military service record indicated no history of mental illness, and Air Force colleagues said he showed no such symptoms, but Air Force doctors quickly diagnosed Nichols as a \\"deteriorating schizophrenic.\\" Harden (2017), p162. He was given large doses of Thorazine and then forced to undergo at least 14 rounds of electroshock.Harden (2017), pp. 162-165. Nichols later told relatives \\"that the government wanted to erase his brain‚Äîbecause he knew too much.\\"Harden (2017), p. 165. Nichols was forced to retire from the military on a medical disability in 1962.Harden (2017), pp. 167-168. He was later charged in Florida with repeated sexual assaults on young boys and pleaded nolo contendere in 1987 to two felony counts of lewd behavior in the presence of a child.Harden (2017), p. 189. He died in the psychiatric ward of a veteran's hospital in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where he had gone in lieu of imprisonment in Florida as a sexual predator.Harden (2017), p. 188-191. He was inducted into the Air Commando Hall of Fame in 1995. Nichols wrote an autobiography, How Many Times Can I Die?, that is notable for exaggerating his achievements and omitting key elements in his life. A biography entitled King of Spies was published in 2017 by Blaine Harden, author of two earlier books about North Korea. Early life and service Nichols was born on 18 February 1923 to Walter Isaac and Myra Stewart Nichols at 105 Main Street, Hackensack, New Jersey. He was the youngest of four sons.Nichols, p. 9. Nichols only completed elementary school before joining the military. He grew up poor in a welfare family, and occasionally had to resort to theft of neighbors' farm equipment to survive.Harden (2017), p. 3. Nichols served in Pakistan early in his military career.Haas (2000), p. 91. He was a sergeant assigned to the motor pool before being detailed to Sub-detachment K, 607th Counter Intelligence Corps in South Korea in 1946. As a master sergeant, he rose to command the unit. He spoke Korean somewhat fluently. Nichols was burly in build, casual in dress, often out of uniform, and seldom displayed his rank. He was noted for his gruffness. He formed an extensive net of approximately 600 civilian spies throughout Korea. There was an assassination attempt on him by communists in 1948. Nichols survived; the would-be assassins did not.Haas (2002), pp. 54‚Äì55, 64.Haas (2000), pp. 78‚Äì79. In 1948, Nichols moved beyond the passivity of counter-intelligence and began intelligence/spy operations that could later be defined as positive intelligence. He began active collection of military intelligence; for the next two years, he briefed General Earle Partridge on possible North Korean communist actions.Haas (2000), pp. 78‚Äì80. In May 1950, Nichols enticed a communist pilot into defecting to the south, along with his IL-10 strike aircraft. As this was the first airplane of its kind to fall into American hands, Nichols disassembled it for removal to the U.S. In the meantime, he was warned of an impending attack by the North Koreans. Sergeant Nichols claimed that he predicted the beginning date of the Korean War to an accuracy within 3 days of its actual occurrence (June 25, 1950) in his last report on the subject, but his forecast was ignored.Haas (2000), p. 80. Korean War service As the war began After the North Koreans invaded at 0400 hours on 25 June 1950, Nichols telephoned the news to General Douglas MacArthur's headquarters at 0945. Then newly promoted chief warrant officer Nichols destroyed the IL-10 and other airplanes and equipment before fleeing Seoul, clinging to the side of a small boat.Haas (2002), pp. 54‚Äì55.Futrell, pp. 4‚Äì5. When Nichols rejoined the battered United Nations formations, he bore a map with annotated targets of the invaders.Futrell, p. 29. He was asked by Ambassador John J. Muccio to temporarily serve as liaison to the Republic of Korea's military heads. In July 1950, Nichols was assigned to the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations; this assignment was designed to grant him autonomy. General Partridge wanted one of the \\"new\\" Russian T-34 tanks the North Koreans were using. Air strikes against them had been unsuccessful, and the general was seeking information to plot counter-measures against the communist armor. Nichols scrounged up a tank transporter and retrieved a stranded T-34 while under fire. For this action, Partridge recommended, and the U.S. military awarded, Nichols a Silver Star.Haas (2002), p 55. Partridge mentioned communist guerrillas harassing Taegu Air Force Base and interrupting UN flight operations. Nichols led a band of 20 South Korean soldiers in a night-time raid into the hills, and returned with grenade fragments in his leg. The harassment ended. Nichols established a makeshift jump school that would turn out spy teams that parachuted behind communist lines. When a planeload of trainees in his ad hoc training failed to jump, Nichols headed them back into the drop aircraft. Although he had never had parachute training, he led the queue of trainees out the aircraft door once they were over the drop zone; all his trainees followed.Haas (2002), p. 56. Although air drops served to introduce espionage teams into the interior of North Korea, their only means of exit was on foot. Nichols also turned to amphibious insertions and retrievals, using the 22nd Crash Rescue Boat Squadron, and later, scrounged Korean fishing boats. The numerous islands offshore of North Korea served as sanctuaries for guerrillas who would host his teams.Haas (2000), pp. 87‚Äì88.Haas (2002), pp. 62‚Äì64. 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron The MiG-15 salvaged by UN forces in July 1951 By March 1951, the Air Force decided to gather Nichols' ad hoc activities into \\"Special Activities Unit Number One\\". The new unit was officially given a wide brief that charged them with gathering military intelligence. They were directed to coordinate their activities with other intelligence agencies. The unit evolved into Detachment 2 of the 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron either later that month or the next. The unorthodox new unit contained commandos, scholars, linguists, and saboteurs along with its more usual intelligence specialists.Haas (2002), pp. 55‚Äì56.Haas (2000), p. 84. Nichols' next intelligence coup came on 17 April 1951. The Chinese communists had introduced Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s into the war. The United States desperately wanted one of the MiG-15s, so they could devise counter-measures against the most technologically advanced plane in communist possession. However, the MiG-15 had yet to fall into UN hands. Nichols and five technical intelligence experts flew to Baengnyeongdo. From there, they penetrated into communist territory in an unarmed helicopter through enemy ground fire. The intruders landed at a MiG-15 crash site some behind the lines and near an enemy supply depot. The intelligence team rapidly photographed the MiG-15 wreckage, and transcribed all instructions and markings. After scalping as many smaller parts as it could from the fighter, the team departed despite the chopper's battle damage to its rotor blade. They managed to struggle back to Baengnyeongdo. Nichols was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his valor and enterprise. The award citation stated that he had retrieved \\"information of inestimable value\\".Haas (2000), pp. 82‚Äì83. Nichols founded Detachment 2, with an American strength of seven officers and 26 enlisted. Its brief was to infiltrate behind communist lines and personally reconnoiter for air strike targets. Given the impossibility of Caucasians remaining undetected in the Asian populace of communist rear areas, there was a minimal need for Americans in this U.S. Air Force detachment.Haas (2000), pp. 85‚Äì86.Haas (2002), pp. 58‚Äì59. Between 14 and 21 July 1951, Nichols and his men managed to retrieve a crashed MiG-15 from behind enemy lines. The MiG-15 in question had crash-landed onto mud flats south-west of Hanch'on. The intelligence coup was considered so important that it was supported by a small multi-national fleet of South Korean, U.S., and British vessels under the command of British Rear Admiral A. K. Scott-Moncrieff. Despite his relatively junior rank, Nichols was credited with organizing the operation.Edwards, p. 224. In 1953, Major Nichols was once again targeted by enemy agents, but again escaped fatality, unlike the unsuccessful killers.Haas (2000), pp. 55, 64‚Äì65. Nichols is credited by some anonymous sources in the intelligence community with originating Operation Moolah; this operation offered $50,000US to any defecting pilot for his fighter.Futrell, pp. 652‚Äì653. Certainly, Nichols was the first to debrief the defecting pilot, No Kum-sok, and the first to submit an intelligence report based on interrogating the defector. Postwar career In September 1953, after the fighting ceased, Nichols' 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron was dubbed the \\"primary military intelligence collection agency of the Far East Air Force (FEAF)\\". Despite the fact that the Air Force effort was as large as the CIA and Naval intelligence units in Korea, the relatively junior Nichols remained entrusted with command. However, throughout the war, agent casualties had steadily climbed as the communists increased their security measures. From the end of 1952 onwards, insertions into the north had become virtual suicide missions. Nichols was haunted by the situation: \\"I hate to call myself a man. I had to be the one to give the orders when I knew someone was going to be killed.\\"Haas (2000), pp. 86, 90, 100‚Äì101.Haas (2002), p. 62.

Most of her academic career has been devoted to teaching and writing about human rights, and she retired to Wellfleet, Massachusetts, where she continues to teach. Education and career Judith was awarded a BA from the University of Chicago in 1964 and a MA, also from Chicago, in 1967, and a PhD in 1972, from Northwestern University. Blau taught at Baruch College as an assistant professor from 1973 to 1976, held a post-doctoral fellowship at Albert Einstein College of Medicine (1976‚Äì1978), taught at the State University of New York at Albany (1978‚Äì1982), and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1982‚Äì2013) where she founded and chaired the Social and Economic Justice minor within the Sociology department. She founded and directed the Human Rights Center of Chapel Hill and Carrboro in 2009, which was an NGO that advocated for the rights of refugees and migrants. Her husband, Peter Michael Blau taught in the same department, as emeritus professor, until his death March 12, 2002. She has two daughters, Reva Blau and Pamela Blau. Blau also taught at Nankai University in Tienjin, China, Hunter College, New York University, Mary Baldwin College and spent an academic year at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study. Her early career was devoted, first to a study of scientists and, then, to a study of architects. In the early 1970s, both physics and architecture were undergoing dramatic transformation. Physicists had early access to the internet, allowing them to participate in international scientific exchanges, in defiance of the Cold War. Postmodernism was displacing modernism in architecture, just as postmodernism affected philosophy and art theory. She has worked in several sociological specialties, and gradually discovered that she could wed her passion for social and economic justice with the same scholarly discipline she brought to her study of communications among scientists. In her current research on constitutions, she has found that the U.S. is an outlier in two respects: it never ratifies human rights treaties and has not revised the Constitution's Bill of Rights. The United States is in a small minority of states that do not recognize economic, social and cultural rights. The US is also an outlier on economic inequality, with immense gaps between the 1 percent and the 99 percent.

Cary was the son of Edward Cary (1656‚Äì1692), of Caldicot, Monmouthshire, and his wife Anne, the eldest daughter of Charles Lucas, 2nd Baron Lucas. In 1694, he succeeded as Viscount Falkland upon the death of his third cousin once removed, Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount Falkland. Early in life, his guardian sued on his behalf to obtain the estate of Stanwell, Middlesex. Upon the death of Falkland's first cousin once removed, John Cary, in 1686, he had left that estate in trust to his great-niece, Elizabeth Willoughby, provided that she would marry Lord Guilford within three years of his death; the inheritance was otherwise to go to the 5th Viscount and his heirs, then to Edward Cary and his heirs. Elizabeth's trustees came to an agreement with Falkland and Edward Cary to allow her to enjoy the estate for life, notwithstanding her failure to marry Lord Guilford, and she afterwards married James Bertie. However, the agreement ended upon the deaths of Edward Cary and Falkland, and Lucius' guardian sued in the Court of Chancery, which found in his favor, to obtain the estate. The Berties appealed to the House of Lords, and obtained a compromise which gave Elizabeth a life interest in the estate, with reversion to Lucius. On 5 October 1704, he married Dorothy Molyneux (d. 26 June 1722) in Chiswick, Middlesex. They had four sons and two daughters: *Lucius Charles Cary, 7th Viscount Falkland *General Hon. George Cary (d. 11 April 1792), married Isabella (d. 1799), daughter of Arthur Ingram of Barrowby *Hon. Leeke Cary (d. 20 March 1729/30), died at Cadiz *Hon.

Dorothy Cary (bur. 9 February 1719/20) He served under General Stanhope in Spain, but after the death of Queen Anne, he became a Jacobite. Falkland became an agent of the Old Pretender, under the orders of Arthur Dillon, Count Dillon. He inherited Stanwell upon Elizabeth Bertie's death in 1715, but sold it in 1720 to John Murray, 2nd Earl of Dunmore. Falkland was sent to England in disguise in July 1722 to sound out English Jacobite leaders in conjunction with the Atterbury Plot. Returning to the Pretender's court in Rome, he was created Earl of Falkland in the Jacobite Peerage as a reward. Around this time, he also seems to have been a patron of James Ogilvie, who prepared the first English translation of Pietro Giannone's Civil History of the Kingdom of Naples. Falkland returned to live at the Jacobite court at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and married Count Dillon's daughter Laura (1708‚Äì1741). They had one daughter: *Hon.

He competed in the 5000 meters at the 1936 Summer Olympics and held world bests in the 3000-meter indoor and two-mile outdoor steeplechase races. Biography Deckard was born in Bloomington, Indiana on April 6, 1916. He studied at Bloomington High School and later Indiana University; he won the mile run at the 1934 Indiana high school state meet in a meeting record 4:26.3. At Indiana he was a teammate of leading distance runner Don Lash; as a sophomore, he placed second behind Lash in the 5000 meters at the 1936 NCAA championships. Deckard placed fourth in the 10,000 meters at the 1936 AAU outdoor national championships; the race also served as a national qualifier for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and Deckard missed making the team by one place. The main U.S. Olympic Trials were held the following week, with Deckard entered in the 5000 meters; he received help from Lash, who was the early leader but slowed down to offer his teammate encouragement and support. Running with Lash, Deckard climbed to third place and eventually finished a clear fifty yards ahead of the next man; he clinched a place on the American team, together with Lash and Louis Zamperini. At the Olympics, Deckard placed ninth in his heat and was eliminated. With the encouragement of his coach at Indiana, Billy Hayes, Deckard turned to the 3000-meter steeplechase; he won the AAU indoor championship in that event in 1937. His winning time, 8:48.6, was a new indoor world best; it was faster than the world outdoor best, though due to differences in tracks and the rules the indoor and outdoor records could not be fairly compared. In 1939 he regained the title in an only slightly slower time, 8:49.4, outkicking defending champion Joe McCluskey on the final lap. Deckard never won an outdoor AAU title; his best finish was second in the 5000 meters in 1937. He set a long-standing American record and world best for the outdoor two-mile steeplechase (9:55.2) in New Orleans on January 1, 1939. In addition, he ran on a record-setting 4 √ó 1 mile relay team at the 1937 Penn Relays; the Indiana University team (Mel Trutt, Jim Smith, Deckard and Lash) won in 17:16.2, breaking the U.S. national team's world record from the previous year by one second. This world record was officially ratified.The actual time was 17:16.1, but in accordance with the official rules it was rounded up to the next fifth of a second. Deckard graduated from Indiana, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in 1939 and a Master of Science degree in 1940. The cancellation of the 1940 Summer Olympic Games due to World War II cost him the opportunity to attempt to qualify for a second Olympics. He was track coach at Bloomington High in 1941‚Äì42 before joining the U.S. Navy, where he served for the duration of the war. Deckard returned to Indiana University in 1946 as head coach of the cross-country team and assistant coach of the track team. In 1948 Deckard moved to Drake University, where he was track head coach and director of the Drake Relays; he resigned the job in late 1954 to become a businessman. Deckard, an entrepreneur, built a highly successful business, Flasher Light and Barricade in Indianapolis, which dominated the Central Indiana construction market for three decades. He routinely hired Indiana University students, living in Indianapolis, as summer employees as well as men from the largely Black Martindale neighborhood where his business was located. His office was a small museum of memorabilia from the 1936 Berlin Olyimpics. He never stopped reliving his \\"Glory Days\\" as one of the world's top middle distance runners in the 1930s. Deckard received the Z. G. Clevenger Award in 1971. He died in Indianapolis in July 1982.

It was raced on Tuesday 9 October 2007 in the province of Siena in Tuscany, Italy. The race was won by Russian rider Alexandr Kolobnev, who completed a 40 km solo, narrowly staying ahead of his teammate Marcus Ljungqvist at the finish. It held a 1.1 UCI rating on the 2007 continental calendar. The professional race was spun off the granfondo L'Eroica, a recreational bike race for vintage bikes, on the white gravel roads around Siena, an event that continues to this day. The inaugural edition was the only time the race was held mid-week and in autumn; before moving to early March in 2008. Monte dei Paschi, the world's oldest still existing bank and headquartered in Siena, served as the race's title sponsor. As a newly created race, organizer RCS - Gazzetta dello Sport asked local Tuscan cycling icons Fiorenzo Magni and Paolo Bettini to promote the event. Route The Piazza del Campo in Siena served as the finish location The race started in Gaiole in Chianti and ended in Siena, and was run entirely within the boundaries of the province of Siena, in southern Tuscany. The course ran over the undulating hills of the Chianti region and included seven sectors of gravel roads (strade bianche or sterrati), totaling 60 kilometres of dirt roads on a 181 km distance. The race finished on Siena's illustrious Piazza del Campo; the finish came after a particularly steep and narrow ascent over a roughly-paved road into the heart of the medieval city. Report Eight riders forced the decisive break on the sterrato climb to Montalcino at 107 km from the finish, facing the remaining four sectors of dirt road. Alexandr Kolobnev and Marcus Ljungqvist (Team CSC), Eros Capecchi (Liquigas), Jos√© Alberto Ben√≠tez and Manuele Mori (Saunier Duval-Prodir), Jos√© Enrique Gutierrez (Team LPR), Jure Golƒçer (Tenax-Salmilano) and Ricardo Serrano (Tinkoff Credit Systems) were the men to fight out the race as it wound its way back north to Siena. Kolobnev used his Worlds' form to attack and drop his companions on the penultimate sector. The Russian kept his bike upright on the technical gravel descents that comprised the final strada bianca. After the final sector, 11 km from Siena, he held a 40-second advantage over the chase. Saunier put the most into the chase with two men but were discouraged by Ljungqvist sitting on. The Swede used his stored strength on the final stretches into Siena to attack and take second place behind his teammate Kolobnev.

The roller coaster is significant for a variety of reasons. It is one of the largest roller coasters ever built and was Houston's first major roller coaster. It was later relocated to Houston's Playland Park with involvement by John A. Miller and H. S. Smith before ultimately being closed in the early 1960s.  History  The roller coaster was designed and fabricated at Lake Contrary Amusement Park in 1924 in St. Joseph, MO by Ingersoll before being shipped to Houston for assembly and construction. It is an \\"in and out\\" design with a long flat stretch after leaving the platform until the first lift hill. It had a height of 110 feet and a 90-foot drop with pictures suggesting an exceedingly steep angle. It continued through three more hills until turning approximately 90 degrees left and following a series of hills and turns before returning to the platform to form an 'L' layout. A second lift hill has been suggested in its original configuration but not confirmed. The length was stated to be \\"a mile and a quarter\\" or 6,600 feet. At the time of its opening it was reportedly the largest roller coaster in the United States.  Luna Park  1924 - ca. 1932 While Luna Park, Houston Texas originally scheduled to open in May 1924, a storm damaged the park including the roller coaster which was still under construction. After final construction delays, the Giant Skyrocket opened to the public on Friday June 28, 1924, 3 days after the park itself had opened. The cost of construction was reported to be $75,000. While the park changed owners and was renamed Venice Park, the roller coaster is believed to have operated until the park was finally closed some time in the early 1930s. From Luna Park advertisement placed in Houston Post June 26, 1924. thumbUndated photograph of roller coaster at Playland Park Houston Texas  Playland Park  1941 - ca. 1963 Playland Park, Houston, Texas opened in the early 1940s. Sometime in 1941, Playland Park undertook the project to relocate the nearby roller coaster to its final location. It is known that John A. Miller, a noted roller coaster designer, passed away in Houston in 1941 while working on a project. Playland credited H. S. Smith for its construction. Period photographs show the Playland Park coaster to not have retained the full coaster as it was apparently modified and shortened though specific dimensions are not available. The roller coaster opened September 5, 1941. It was advertised as the \\"largest roller coaster in the South\\". Playland appears to have only referred to it as the \\"Giant Roller Coaster\\". However local residents generally continued to refer to it as \\"The Skyrocket\\". While the park remained open, the roller coaster ceased operations sometime between 1962 and 1964. By 1964 it was partially removed to make room for a new commercial building. By 1973 only an empty lot remained.  Accidents  In October 1924 two passengers were killed from a fall. In 1962 a passenger fell and was seriously injured.  Legacy  By 1964 the roller coaster had been partially removed at the turn hill. This portion of land had been sold by Playland Park and a new commercial building was constructed at what would become 2525 Murworth Drive. By 1973 only an empty lot remained. Built during the original Golden Era of wooden coaster design, the Giant Skyrocket is one of the few that survived well beyond the Great Depression albeit in a shortened form at a new location. Today the Giant Skyrocket along with both parks is generally forgotten or sometimes confused with another roller coaster (The Rocket, located at a different the Playland Park in San Antonio, Texas in the 1940s). It was ultimately succeeded in the Houston area by the Texas Cyclone at AstroWorld in 1976. Coincidentally, prior to constructing the Texas Cyclone, AstroWorld considered relocating an existing wooden roller coaster to Houston in the early 1970s.

The fountain is located across from Via Pantaneto #19. History Fountain Fonte di Pantaneto, Siena The first fountain at the site was built in 1457 using funds from the Comune of the city. The first fountain was merely an unceremonious niche in the wall with a basin. In the niche a sculpted head of an old lady, called the vecchia di Pantaneto was placed. In 1807, the aristocrat Vinceslao Malavolti, after refurbishing his nearby Palazzo Sozzini, commissioned the architect Agostino Belli to embellish the fountain, and he drew up a Neoclassic-style project with doric columns, central basin and a statuary group with Neptune surrounded by four tritons, sculpted by Antonio Zini. But staining and leaching of the marble led to degradation of this pompous tableaux, and by 1866, a new fountain was commissioned from the engineer Girolamo Tarducci. The engineer dismissed artistry, and reformulated the fountain as a basic functional public water source. In 1997, the Contrada del Leocorno reconstructed the fountain under the designs of Carlo Nepi as two basins fed from the horns of two modern bronze unicorn (leocorno) heads, cast by the sculptor Francesco Carone. While in the center of the niche, surrounded by doric columns, is a round window, and below a plaque with the shield of Siena, are an announcement of the 1866 reconstruction. Below a droll mask also can provide water. The fountain's location in a narrow alley and the non- potable nature of the water detracts from the potential for either scenography or amenity. The eclectic ensemble with formal elements and marble basins but also with playful decoration, seems as confused as the history of its formulations. It main dignity is found in intimacy, a short caesura on a street that leads to the Loggia del Papa, which like this architectural structure, seems at loss for purpose, but unlike the present fountain, is not adrift in artistic style.Eco Museo di Siena, entry on fountain by Simone Carloni.

He worked with other chiefs and bands to participate in raids with enemy tribes. While a chief, Sweet Grass noticed the starvation and economic hardship the Cree were facing. This propelled him to work with the Canadian and eventually sign Treaty Six. Sweet Grass believed that working alongside the government was one of the only solutions to the daily hardship the Cree were faced with. The Sweet Grass Reserve west of Battleford, Saskatchewan was named in his honor and is still functioning today. Life Early life Sweet Grass or Wikaskokiseyin was born in a Cree Camp in the area near Fort Pitt, Saskatchewan. The exact date and place of his birth is unrecorded. His mother was kidnapped during a war with the Cree from a tribe, which was located around Missouri. Due to this, Sweet Grass was not Cree and was Crow. There is no record of his father. Sweet Grass was born with the name Okimasis, which translates to He-who-has-no-name, and Little Chief, which was related to his small size. Warriors consistently taunted him due to his stature within the village. His name, ‚ÄúSweet Grass‚Äù was inspired by an audacious feat that he attempted as a youth. He ventured into the Blackfoot territory, completely alone with the goal of capturing a herd of horses. Approaching the pasture, he hid in a bush and as a man advanced towards him, he took out his bow, killed and scalped him; proceeding to raid the pasture to return forty horses back to his tribe. His tribe was presented with a collection of grass dipped in the blood of the man he had killed. This was met with chants of ‚ÄúSweet Grass‚Äù, which would eventually become his name as a Chief in 1870. Later that year, Sweet Grass converted to Roman Catholicism by Father Albert Lacombe and was baptized with the Christian name, Abraham. Cree Childhood Due to the fact that Sweet Grass' Mother was captured by a Cree tribe, it is unknown if she partook in the established birthing and naming traditions. However, the Cree had a process to which they named their children. The father of the child would ask Cree Shamans with spiritual powers to help with the naming process. The Shaman's decision would be based on a character or incident that they saw in their vision. Once a name was decided, the child was passed around the group where each individual blessed the child. This ceremony generally took place when the child reached the age of one. From this moment on, a special bond was formed between the child and whoever named them. There is no record of whether Sweet Grass and his mother took part in this ceremony. However, this likely happened because he was born in a Cree Camp. Children typically lived a carefree and adventurous childhood. Children did not wear much clothing and boys wore nothing until the age of five. Children did not spend much time with their parents growing up, rather with their grandparents. Sweet Grass‚Äô childhood most likely went against this Cree norm because of his Mother's capture. Young men would attach themselves to a hunter or warrior that they admired and followed or shadowed them in performing tasks. Sweet Grass most likely did not partake in this tradition or many other childhood ones. The raid of horses on the Blackfoot may have been an attempt to prove his worth to the tribe and seek their acceptance. The Cree The Cree were located in the plains of Canada. The Cree are divided into several different tribes in Saskatchewan and Alberta. The name Cree represents a general ethnic group, however, there are several different tribes based on region and dialect. When Sweet Grass was chief, the different bands of the Cree were loose in a wide-ranging areas and usually named for the territory in which they operated It was not uncommon for different bands to hunt and perform rituals together as seen with Sweet Grass‚Äô relationship with Big Bear. Families had the ability to break away from their current band and join another elsewhere. Cree societies were split into different roles, such as the Chief, which was the title Sweet Grass held. There were also village elders and warriors. There typically was a large number of warriors within a band and these men held extremely high prestige. Cree religion believed in a single powerful creator which they based their ideology and ceremonies on. This figure held no real identity and did not appear to anyone in visions or contact. However, this almighty creator appeared to individuals through various sprits such as the bear and horse. Sweet Grass‚Äô spiritual helper was the mosquito, which he would often seek for guidance. He believed that the insect had taken pity on him which guided him to become a chief. The Cree believe that the creator spirit was in every living thing around them. An individual acquired a spiritual helper after they appeared to them in a vision. This spirit did not provide aid or direct help in anyway but instead provided guidance. The Cree believe that every individual has a soul which is located at the back of their neck. The soul was able to leave the body during visions where it would accompany their spiritual helper. After death, the soul would wonder the earth for four days, and then would travel to the land of the dead, which was believed to be in the Milky Way. Position as Chief The position of chief within the Cree varied from tribe to tribe and each had varying levels of authority over the band. Chiefs within Cree society were chosen by the consent of the band. While it sometimes would go to the eldest son of the previous chief, an incompetent man would not be given the position. A chief needed to be an active leader both in peace and war. It was required to distinguish themselves during a war, as a provider, and as a generous giver to gain this position. The most vital contributions of a chief was to keep the peace during the day to day living by settling arguments between the other members of the band. Sweet Grass understood the sacrifices that needed to be made for the bettering of the band. During one hunt Sweetgrass's horse was unable to remain calm, which was affecting the hunting of buffalo. Despite it being a highly valuable horse Sweetgrass traded it for an inferior one, understanding the importance of the group over the individual. It was not uncommon for there to be more than one chief who would have various levels of prestige. The amount of power wielded by Cree chiefs varied from person to person. Sweet Grass during the signing of the treaty was one of the most well- regarded plains Cree chiefs and was given a position of importance during negotiations. Relationship with Big Bear Sweet Grass often worked closely with the fellow Cree chief Big Bear. They hunted in the same territory and would often hunt and camp together. Sweet Grass was ten years older, so Big Bear recognized him as the superior chief. They bonded over sharing the characteristic of being small, but mighty warriors. Moreover, Big Bear was part Ojibwa which meant both chiefs were not completely Cree. Big Bear admired Sweet Grass for his bravery and guidance that he would often receive from his spiritual helper. Both Chiefs would work together in multiple raids on the Blackfoot. An example of this would be when Sweet Grass and Big Bear assembled 18 Cree warriors that attempted to raid Blackfoot hunting territory. After being forced to set up camp along a river due to a snow storm, a member of their war party left to collect food and spotted a lone member of the Blackfoot on foot rounding up horses. Upon reporting his sighting back to the others, they decide to kill the man and steal his horses. The attempted raid went wrong as Sweet Grass and Big Bear nearly stumbled upon Blackfoot main camp. Days of fighting ensued however, both chiefs managed to survive. Buffalo Hunting and Fur Trade Buffalo hunting and fur trading were a vital part of Cree survival. Cree Tribes would move according to their migration habits. At the beginning of 1870, buffalo were plentiful within the plains. In 1870, there were hundreds of thousands, which provided an immense amount of resources for the Cree to a point where they were able to only take the choice parts of the Buffalo. However, as European settlers came to the plains, that number dwindled significantly. In 1881, there was only a couple hundred Buffalo left within the plains. The Cree relied on the buffalo so heavily that they were pushed to a point of starvation. Additionally, as the Hudson's Bay Company moved into the prairies, the fur trade offered an extremely important source of income and goods for the Cree. However, over- trapping forced tribes to move west to find suitable forest areas. The lack of trapping territory, along with the decline of the buffalo left the Cree helpless. Both of these issues became an extremely important topic discussed in treaty negotiations which Sweet Grass was heavily involved in. Cree Religious Conversion Different tribes of the Cree held their own stories and traditions passed down orally through the generations. As Europeans began to set up colonies in North America, missionaries went among the indigenous people to spread their religion. While traditions within tribes remained significant, the Cree became more receptive to different denominations of Christianity. In 1852 the priest Father Lacombe moved to the Red River Colony with plans to live with the Metis and Cree. His goal was to spread the Roman Catholic faith to the Western parts of Canada. During this time Lacombe would become familiar with the Cree language and the culture, even writing a Cree dictionary in 1874. During the 1860s he moved farther west and would come into contact with Sweet Grass and his band. With diseases and famine rampant in the Cree community, they were more receptive to new religious ideas. It was due to both Lacombe's understanding of Cree culture and the growing desperation of the Cree, he would be able to convert many of the Cree to the Roman Catholic faith. Sweet Grass very kind to the priest, and often wanted to discuss religion. In 1870 Sweetgrass allowed himself to be baptized and was given the name Abraham.  Relationship with Canadian Government  Throughout the 19th century, it appeared as though the federal government of Canada, situated in Ottawa, worked very hard to increase the dependency that aboriginal people had on it. The government wanted tribes to become more democratic in its governing of the reserves and rely less on the chiefs who traditionally were the leaders of the community. Naturally, this angered many indigenous communities who were more inclined to fight back than work with the government. Sweet Grass was one of the Chiefs who was more willing to work with them. One of the requests that Sweet Grass made to the government was to teach the Cree better farming techniques. Another was that the government should stop supplying weapons to the Blackfeet who were his tribe's enemy. These were just a few of the aspects that Sweet Grass worked with the government on. The overall goal that Sweet Grass wanted to achieve was an end to factionalism that had been plaguing the Plains Cree for years. Sweet Grass‚Äô hope to work with the federal government was challenged by other prominent Cree leaders. At the time when Sweet Grass was Chief, The Canadian government had pictured what the Indigenous communities were and never changed them. This type of thinking immediately damaged Indigenous communities as they were self-governing cultures that evolved much like any other. Sweet Grass along with three other Chiefs attempted to get ahead of government control by meeting with the representative of the Canadian government in the west Lieutenant Governor Archibald to petition the Hudson's Bay Company's (HBC) sale of land to the government. This land was not the HBC's to sell which is a problem that would occur several times to indigenous groups all over Canada. They also wanted the government to be held accountable for the depleted food supplies within the indigenous territories. Sweet Grass had also requested that the government provide supplies as needed so that they may sustain themselves when traditional hunting was not an option. whoever was responsible for conveying these concerns did not do so effectively as many of the requests were not met, at least not when they needed it most.  Treaty 6  Treaty 6 was the biggest piece of legislation between Plains Cree Leaders and the colonial government. Signed in 1876, Treaty 6 was the agreement between the government of Canada and the Indigenous people living in parts of modern-day Saskatchewan and Alberta. Sweet Grass‚Äô beliefs clashed with that of Big Bear who believed that a Confederacy needed to be formed as a united front in order to get the best terms for all. To be fair to Big Bear, he was mindful of what the government promised as he was not invited to the original negotiation and signing of Treaty 6. What Treaty 6 did deliver was more division and segregation between European settlers and Indigenous people. Indigenous people were forced to choose between living on reserves, receiving a fixed amount of money every year for the rest of their lives and trying to assimilate and lose their status. The language used to refer to indigenous people who elected to not settle on reserves also did not help ease tensions. The specific word used was ‚Äústragglers‚Äù which gave the impression that the government did not see these people as any more than falling behind in Canada's idealized picture of what life of Indigenous people would be. The unpreparedness or perhaps unwillingness of the Canadian government to deal with the problems of indigenous peoples continued long after the signing of Treaty 6 but it was Sweet Grass‚Äô firm belief that this was the best way to ensure that indigenous culture survived.  Tribal Conflict  The signing of Treaty 6 was not the only reason for conflict between the Cree and other prominent Indigenous tribes in the region. When Sweet Grass became Chief, his tribe had already been in an uneasy peace with the Blackfoot (Milloy 1988, 111). Sweet Grass had endeavored to maintain this peace even though many of his people resented it. As stated previously, part of what the Cree wanted to be reflected by the terms of Treaty 6 was an end to the factionalism that had pitted the younger members of the Cree community against the older Indigenous Leadership. The result of this factionalism was the revival of conflict between Sweet Grass‚Äô tribe and the Blackfeet. The peak of the conflict came in 1861 when the Blackfoot had threatened to kill any Cree, Metis, or a white man that they stumbled upon. Whenever a Cree war party was formed to go hunting in Blackfoot territory, caution had to be exercised, especially after the threat had been established. Sweet Grass and Big Bear had formed a war party for this exact purpose as stated previously. Sweet Grass himself killed a Blackfoot Chief who had been using a hollow tree as a shield by shooting through it and piercing his heart. Although it is not impossible, it is highly unlikely that the Cree escaped from their entrapment with as few casualties as they claimed. The Plains Cree were not always the victims of this conflict. In 1860, a member of the Plains Cree killed a Blackfoot chief which had sparked a war against them. Although it is not known which of the Cree Chiefs supported an unexpected attack on a Blackfoot Chief, it is known that Sweet Grass was not among them. They had sent a war party to a Blackfoot camp and killed 18 Blackfeet in addition to stealing horses. Some of the Plains Cree simply could not accept peace with the Blackfoot. In another instance, Sweet Grass had invited the Blackfoot into his camp in an attempt to begin a long-standing peace with them. The result of this was more hostility from his people who had harassed Sweet Grass‚Äô Blackfoot guests. In 1862, Sweet Grass accompanied Broken Arm, who was known for his ability to broker peace, along with fifty escorts to finally make peace with the Blackfoot. As history has demonstrated, peace between the Blackfoot and the Plains Cree does not last very long. Even after Treaty 6 was signed, the Blackfoot and Plains Cree continued to quarrel over hunting as the number of buffalo faded with each passing year. Death On January 11, 1877, Sweet Grass had an argument with his brother after the signing of treaty six. His brother believed that they had given too much to the government in the treaty. He attempted to take the Sweet Grass‚Äô pistol and it accidentally discharged, resulting in his death. Legacy  Sweet Grass through both policy and action would have a lasting impact on the Plains Cree. As a well respected Cree leader during a time of strife, Sweet Grass attempted to lead his people as best as he could. By 1870 chief Sweet Grass would begin to become more integrated into Canadian society. Due to missionaries moving into the interior, there was more significant pressure to convert to European religions, which many Cree did. Sweet Grass himself converted to Catholicism in 1870, following a general shift of Cree towards Christianity. With encroaching settlers and other indigenous groups, the dwindling of traditional hunting, and disease rampant, Sweet Grass and his band of Cree were desperate for support. When Treaty 6 was put forward by the Canadian government in 1876, Sweetgrass was profoundly influential in bringing the Plains Cree into the agreement. This would be Sweetgrass's last significant influence on his people, as he would die shortly after signing the Treaty. While the signing of the treaty can be seen as selling away indigenous rights, it did bring much- needed medication and food to the Cree who had insufficient options.  Treaty 6 Impacts   Short-term Effects  The impact of the signing of the treaty had a significant effect on Cree life for both those who signed the treaty and those who did not. Those who did began to move onto the reserve land and being affected by the agreements made in the treaty. Not all Plains Cree would sign the treaty at first, and many would become disillusioned after signing. Big Bear resisted signing of the treaty, hoping that he could hold out for a better deal with the Canadian government. The Canadian government could hold out for longer than any of the Cree groups who were slowly dying from starvation and disease. Even though Big Bear publicly and consistently spoke against sighing treaties, by 1882 starving, he would sign Treaty 6. After signing the treaty, some of the Cree remained unsatisfied with the situation they had been forced into. Using this discontent, Chief Wandering Spirit gathered support and began to purses more aggressive policies towards settlers. When the Metis under Louis Riel started the Northwest-Rebellion in 1885, Wandering Spirit would lead a group of Cree to raid the Frog Lake Settlement. The primary goal of the raid was to get supplies, but it after some pushback from the settlers it quickly became violent. The group would then move to capture Fort Pit. The fort was heavily stocked with provisions, which angered the staving Cree. After the raid, they moved back to the reserve with the captured supplies without another incident. The perpetrators of the massacre would be apprehended and tried for murder and hung in 1885. Debate of the Treaty The legacy of Treaty 6 continues to affect the Cree till the modern day. Issues arise from the mixed interpretations of the Treaty by both the Indigenous groups and the Government. As this agreement is the first legal agreement between these Indigenous groups and the new Canadian government, which continued to impact and facilitate interactions between them. This has led to conflict over the clauses of the agreement. The disagreement on Treaty 6 stems from three major issues; language barriers, verbal agreements made during the negotiation, and the rights for chiefs to sign the agreement. In Cree cultural the chiefs do not always hold the legal right to make choices for the entire band. As the treaty process never included women in the discussion it ignored an important cultural pressure. Many of the Cree who participated in the treaty were unable to understand legal English. While there was a Cree verbal translation, the Treaty was made in English. The next biggest problem comes from a lack of follow through on verbal agreements. To the Canadian delegation, the only legally binding contracts were what was written into the treaty. In Cree culture, verbal agreements hold the same amount weight as any other agreements. Those who signed Treaty Six argue that understanding the treaty can only be understood when put into a context of the discussions that occurred during the treaty- making process. The meaning of land and the surrender of it was not entirely understood by those who were signing the agreement. There was limited understanding on the level of Canadian settlement that was going to happen, and limited knowledge on how indigenous people would be restricted from the land.  Sweet Grass's Band  When Sweet Grass died in 1877 his son was left to hold together the Band who followed his father. Under the leadership of Young Sweet Grass, the band began to fall apart due to internal conflict. At this point, Young Sweet Grass would lead a fragment of the band to join with other Cree, who had signed Treaty 6. Young Sweet Grass would eventually become chief and would name the new group the Sweetgrass First Nation in honour of his father. The Sweetgrass Nation was settled into the land West of the township Battleford, Saskatchewan in 1884. From here the group made income from farming and lumber sale, supplemented with traditional methods as much as possible. In the years after settlement, the Sweetgrass reserve would continue to be affected by famine and disease. Many people would leave the reserve due to government policies to limit food rations. This would lead high mortality rates within the community. On the Sweetgrass reserve, the mortality rates would grow after 1885 to 185 per every 1000 people on the reserve. The tactic of withholding food from reserves will be used by the Canadian government to force cooperation. After resisting sending children into the Canadian school system, the Cree living on the reserve received no food rations, until they capitulated. In 2010 the Sweetgrass nation had over 1500 registered members who primarily live outside of the Sweetgrass Reserve. See also A picture of Sweet Grass is in the archives of the Glenbow Museum.
