Its first location opened in Lower Manhattan of New York City in 1990. There were eight City Bakery locations in Japan: Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka. City Bakery Detroit was its last expansion. City Bakery also owned and operated six eco-minded bakeries called Birdbath Neighborhood Green Bakery in New York. The City Bakery closed on October 20, 2019 due to debt-related financial difficulties. History City Bakery was established in New York in 1990 by Maury Rubin, a television producer and director at ABC Sports, after studying pastry making in Lyons with Denis Ruffel of Patisserie Millet in Paris and having served as an apprentice p√¢stissier in Paris.  Locations  = Union Square, Lower Manhattan= City Bakery opened in the Union Square neighborhood of Lower Manhattan on December 8, 1990. Its menus are determined by the foods supplied by small family farms in the New York region, much of which was purchased at the nearby Union Square Greenmarket. Suppliers have included Glensfoot Dairy of Cherry Valley and Community Mill & Bean of Ithaca, for certified organic flour and oats. Its baked goods include Lemon Tart in a Chocolate Crust, Milky Way Tart, Chocolate Custard infused with Ethiopian Coffee Beans, Passion Fruit Tart with a Raspberry Polka Dot, Orange Tarts Made out of Apples, Bunch of Nuts in a Tart, World's First Stuffed Raspberry Tart, Fresh Ricotta Tart with Fruit and Edible Flowers. A cookbook, designed by Rubin, Book of Tarts: Form, Function and Flavor at City Bakery, won the 1996 International Association of Culinary Professionals Cookbook Design of the Year Award. The Pretzel Croissant was created in 1996 by combining a traditional French croissant with some of the ingredients of a classic German pretzel. In 2015, The New Yorker magazine produced a video on how the Pretzel Croissant is made. City Bakery makes what it calls \\"Real Hot Chocolate\\" from high-quality couverture chocolate, melted to create an intensely rich chocolate drink. It established the City Bakery Annual Hot Chocolate Festival, held every February, with a different flavor of hot chocolate every day of the month. The New York Times attributed a trend in high-quality hot chocolate in city eateries to the influence of City Bakery: \\" ... what is no mystery is the effect Mr. Rubin's hot chocolate had on the city's hot chocolate landscape. He opened the floodgates for the sea of serious hot chocolate contenders that exist in New York today.\\" City Bakery also offers savory foods, salad, sandwiches, pizzas and soup. City Bakery operated at 22 East 17th Street from 1990 until April 2001, when it moved one block west across 5th Avenue to 3 West 18th Street, a space five times larger than the original. City Bakery's design was unique, featuring 22-foot-high ceilings with stark white walls decorated only with cake boxes - a playful homage to the landmark Chrysler Building, decorated with hubcaps near its spire. = Birdbath Neighborhood Green Bakery = In 2005, Maury Rubin designed and built an experimental 240-square-foot bakery that had no formal name, but featured the words \\"Build A Green Bakery\\" on the front window. The concept for the bakery was to run an environmentally-friendly food business in a big city. It offered only ten pastries and four drinks, priced at $2 and $1, respectively. The bakery was built out of sustainable building materials like wheat board - a plywood-like material made from surplus straw and wheat - a cork floor and LED lights. The bakery, at 223 First Avenue, was located on a newly built bike path by New York City, and bike riders were offered a 50% discount if they entered with their bike helmet. Due to popularity, the discount was reduced to 15%. Other green initiatives: the bakery used wind-power; the staff wore shirts, hats and jackets that were either vintage or made from bamboo or hemp; and food waste composting. The intention of not naming the bakery in the early days was to entice customers to ask questions about the design materials the bakery was built from and hopefully discuss the environmental mission of the business with staff. Of the bakery with no name, New York magazine wrote: \\"When is a bakery not a bakery? When it‚Äôs a political statement, an architectural pioneer, and a bit of performance art, all wrapped in one.\\" After six months, the bakery was formally named Birdbath Neighborhood Green Bakery, and has since expanded to five locations in SoHo, Midtown and the Upper West Side of Manhattan. = City Bakery Japan = In 2013, City Bakery Osaka, a licensed operation, opened in Grand Front Plaza. City Bakery Osaka opened with long lines for several months, and was forced to establish a limit of two Pretzel Croissants only for each customer. Since then, City Bakery has opened locations in Tokyo, including Shinagawa Train Station and Tokyu Plaza in the Ginza Shopping District. = Detroit = The Detroit location of City Bakery, in the Fisher Building in New Center, opened January 29, 2018. Critical response The New York Times Magazine called Maury Rubin \\"a baking impresario.\\" Smithsonian magazine has called the City Bakery croissant \\"the best croissant...in New York City.\\" When City Bakery expanded to a new space in 2001, New York magazine wrote \\"you'll never have to leave.\\" The Los Angeles Times called Maury Rubin \\"[a baking] master.\\" The New York Times Food Section, writing about Maury Rubin and the pursuit of the perfect chocolate chip cookie, said: \\"what he's doing is brilliant.\\"  References  Bakeries of the United States Bakeries of Japan Companies based in New York City Food and drink companies established in 1996 Retail companies established in 1996 ","title":"The City Bakery"},{"id":"53506903","text":"Jean-Fran√ßois Richard (born 1943 in Belgium) is a Belgian-American economist, who is currently the distinguished university professor of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh.

Cook, Civil War Nurse, Union Army Betsey Cook was a nurse for the Union Army during the American Civil War, serving from 1861 to 1863.  Civil War service  Not much is known about Cook's early life, except that she was living in Augusta, Illinois at the outbreak of the Civil War. Cook's husband enlisted initially, beginning his service with the 2nd Illinois Cavalry in July 1861. His enlistment initially prompted Cook to relocate to her father's home. In a letter to Mary Holland, Cook writes that her father's home was in Jackson, and though she does not specify which state, the context leads readers to suggest she was referring to Jackson, Michigan. It was actually Cook's husband who encouraged her to become a nurse, asking her to enlist as a part of \\"Delano's Dragoons\\", the nickname for Company L of the 2nd Regiment, for its commander, S. G. Delano. Ultimately, Cook was stationed at Fort Halt [sic], Kentucky, arriving in the middle of October. Cook served under Dr. Kendall at this location; she remained under his guidance throughout most of her army career. Like the soldiers, Cook lived and worked in tents throughout most of her time in the service, and experienced much of the same hardships as the soldiers. Though the group built cabins for shelter as the winter months came, rising water levels forced the unite to leave their cabins behind and head up the Ohio River towards Camp Pain. Cook remained at this location until returning to Michigan in February 1862. In Michigan, she served at Island Number 10 with Doctor Kendall once again, in charge of clothing, hospital supplies, and preparing food for the sick. During her time at Island Number 10, Cook was well-loved by the soldiers particularly because she was able to cook much more appetizing bread than what was served previously. In June 1863, Cook followed her husband to Columbus and remained there until late August. In Columbus, Cook oversaw cooking and hospital supplies. Soon, however, her husband was ordered to his company, and Cook returned to her home in Augusta.  After the war  After the war, Cook applied for a pension for her wartime services but she was denied; apparently, the women who recruited Cook was not legally authorized to appoint nurses. In her aforementioned letter to Mary Holland, Cook wrote that \\"if I never receive any pay, I have the satisfaction of knowing that I did what I could to help in the great struggle for Union and the flag.\\" Notes  References  Women in the American Civil War People from Hancock County, Illinois American Civil War nurses ","title":"Betsey Cook"},{"id":"53507003","text":"Tibit or tibits may refer to: * Tibit - the unit symbol of tebibit *Tibit/s, a data rate of tebibit per second *Tibits (restaurant chain), vegetarian restaurant chain in Switzerland See also ","title":"Tibit"},{"id":"53507010","text":"Photography in Bangladesh began with the creation of Bangladesh through the liberation war of 1971, against Pakistan.

The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 12, 2017, and released in the United States a year later on March 30, 2018, by Neon. Synopsis In Los Angeles, Jill LaBeau is a friend and personal assistant to movie star Heather Anderson. Heather has decided to drop out of an upcoming film, upsetting numerous people, as the movie will not go forward without her in it. Late one night, at Heather‚Äôs request, Jill walks into a diner to break the news of Heather‚Äôs decision to Greg, the director. After he leaves, Heather enters, joins Jill, and is then joined by Sierra, an awkward fan. Sierra asks to take a picture with Heather, and she reluctantly agrees. Sierra posts the photo on social media. As they leave the diner, paparazzi ask questions and take photos of Heather. One of them, Stan, asks Heather about Devin, her ex- boyfriend, and Tracy, her rumored new love interest. The two women go to Jill‚Äôs apartment. Heather asks Jill to lend her gun to her, a .22 snub nose. Jill is hesitant, but Heather says she doesn‚Äôt feel safe with so many people angry at her. Jill loads the gun with bullets and gives it to her. They then go out to a nightclub where they meet up with Tracy. Before they leave, Tracy tells Heather she will be at the cabin the next day. Tracy and Heather kiss before parting ways. Jill and Heather drive to Heather‚Äôs mansion, where Jill ends up spending the night. Before they go to sleep, Heather notices a motion light turn on outside, but Jill dismisses it, saying it is probably just a coyote. Jill wakes up the next morning and takes the gun out of Heather‚Äôs purse. It accidentally goes off, shattering a nearby coin case. Jill confesses to a startled Heather that she thought about taking the gun away, but she leaves it with Heather. After running some errands that morning, Jill returns to the mansion where she is shocked to discover Heather lying dead on the floor from gunshot wounds, with Jill‚Äôs gun nearby. The coin collection is also gone. Police arrive at the mansion, and Detective Ahn makes Jill some tea as he interviews her. Jill later goes to the beach and tries calling Tracy, but she is only able to leave a message. After meeting with Heather‚Äôs agent, Jill returns to her apartment, but sees several police officers in the complex. As she tries to get away without being noticed, she is caught by Detective Ahn, who takes her to a nearby diner. He informs her that all the evidence points to her so far: her fingerprints are on the gun and shell casings, and her hands tested positive for gun powder residue. They both notice that someone next to them is recording their conversation‚ÄîStan. While Ahn is briefly distracted by Stan, Jill slips away. Jill gets her hair dyed blonde and goes to talk with Greg. While he packs his bags for a trip to Scotland, the two discuss who might have killed Heather. Police knock on the door, and Greg answers while Heather slips out the back. Jill then tracks down Devin to a bar. She talks to him and tries to find out where he was the night before and that morning, but Devin avoids the question and asks Jill about Heather‚Äôs relationship with Tracy. Devin leaves without giving any answers, but leaves his hotel key at the bar. Jill takes it and searches his hotel room while Devin and his girlfriend are at the desk getting another key. In Jim‚Äôs belongings, she finds a rare coin similar to the ones that were at Heather‚Äôs house. When Devin and his girlfriend come back, Jill hides in the closet and overhears Devin asking his girlfriend to provide him with an alibi for Heather‚Äôs murder. Though he maintains his innocence, he claims an alibi will make everything easier. After sneaking out of Devin‚Äôs room, Jill calls Tracy for help. She arrives and takes Jill to her house. Jill shows Tracy the rare coin she found in Devin‚Äôs belongings, thinking it could be one of the ones that was taken from Heather‚Äôs house. Tracy thinks it's just another one that Devin already owns. Late that night, Jill overhears Tracy talking to someone on the phone; she hears her say ‚ÄúI can get her to come up to the cabin,‚Äù ‚Äúshe‚Äôs asleep now,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI just really think I should bring her up there before something happens.‚Äù While exploring the other rooms in the house, Jill finds the coins taken from Heather‚Äôs mansion. She decides to sneak out of the house. Jill rides a motorcycle away from Tracy‚Äôs house and manages to lose a police car that is tailing her. She stops at a laundromat and listens to a message from Detective Ahn. She then sees a breaking news report that the police have retracted their ID of Heather as the murder victim. Jill then looks at social media accounts and sees that not only does Sierra, the fan they met at the diner, look like Heather, she even has the same Gemini tattoo on the back of her neck. Early the next morning, Jill rides the motorcycle up to the cabin. Inside, she finds Heather, alive and well. The dead girl is Sierra; Heather shot Sierra when she broke into the house the morning before, but was too scared to go to the police. Jill is furious and Heather apologizes. For all that she has been through, Heather lets Jill punch her in the face. Sometime later, Jill is helping Heather prepare for a TV interview about the incident. Detective Ahn stops by to watch.

Early life and education  Elizabeth Denny Pierce was born June 26, 1888 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania to Flora McKnight and William Lemmex Pierce. She attended Vassar College from 1906 to 1910, and in 1912 she obtained an MA in Latin.  Academic career  In her first year at Vassar, Pierce met Ida Thallon, who was to have a profound influence on her life and work. Thallon was a Professor in the Department of Greek and Roman Studies. The two women formed an intimate student/mentor relationship that developed into an intimate personal relationship which continued after Pierce left for graduate work at Columbia University. When Pierce returned to Vassar to teach art history in 1915, the couple started living in adjacent rooms in Davidson house on campus; their relationship at this time has been described as a 'Boston marriage'. From 1915 until 1922, Pierce taught Art History at Vassar. She was granted her PhD from Columbia in 1922. Her dissertation as well as her Master's thesis was on the intellectual life of Gaius Asinius Pollio, a Roman Consul (40 BC) and historian. She also was an assistant curator at Vassar's Art Gallery for that seven-year period. She travelled to Greece with Thallon in 1921. Her time in Greece inspired her to enroll in the American School of Classical Studies (ASCSA). Pierce attended ASCSA from 1922 to 1923 where she became friends with the school's director, Bert Hodge Hill, and archeologist Carl Blegen. Carl Blegen taught prehistory and general topography classes at the school. Pierce and Blegen's friendship quickly turned into romance and Blegen proposed marriage; Pierce initially accepted but then broke off the engagement as she did not wish to end her relationship with Thallon. Pierce returned to the United States and spent the spring of 1924 working at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Meanwhile, a plan was formed by Blegen, Pierce, and Hodge Hill (who appears to have had unreciprocated romantic feelings for Blegen) that Hodge Hill and Thallon would marry at the same time as Pierce and Blegen, and the four would live together; Thallon agreed on condition that she and Pierce would continue to travel and spend time together away from their husbands, and the two couples married in 1924.  Archeological career  The four archeologists, who referred to themselves as \\"the Family\\", \\"the quartet\\", and \\"the Pro Par\\" (short for \\"Professional Partnership\\"), had a strong and interconnected relationship both professionally and personally. Thallon Hill and Pierce Blegen often worked together on excavations, cataloguing materials and publishing findings from excavations run by both their husbands. During her first year of marriage, Pierce Blegen taught sculpture classes at ASCS. One of her first projects with Thallon Hill was assisting her in the cataloguing of new finds from the excavation of Corinth, in collaboration with Elizabeth Van Buren, a specialist in terracottas. Pierce Blegen participated in Carl Blegen's excavations at Prosymna (1927‚Äì1928), Troy (1932‚Äì1938) and Pylos (1939, 1952‚Äì1958). Beginning in 1925 and continuing until 1952, Pierce Blegen authored the \\"Newsletter from Athens\\", a regular contribution to the American Journal of Archaeology. In the personal correspondence of archeologist Lucy Shoe Merritt (May 4, 1997) she described Blegen's newsletter: \\"Her reports were the results of close, careful understanding, first-hand observation and discussion with the excavators whom she grew to know so well and who admired and trusted her with their latest discoveries and thoughts about them (the excavations). In 1929, Pierce Blegen purchased a house on 9 Ploutarchou Street in Athens as a home for the family. The house became a popular meeting place for archeologists, students of all foreign schools, diplomats, Vassar alumnae, Greek scholars, Fulbright scholars, and the staff of the American embassy. During World War II, Hodge Hill remained in Athens to look after the home on Ploutarchou Street while Thallon Hill moved to the United States with the Blegens for the duration of the war. The three lived in Cincinnati where Carl Blegen was a professor of classical archeology at the University of Cincinnati. Pierce Blegen's final work in field excavation was at Pylos in 1958. That year she had a debilitating stroke that confined her to a wheelchair for the remainder of her life. Thallon Hill had died four years previously in 1954. Hodge Hill died in 1958. In 1963, Elizabeth Pierce Blegen deeded their home to the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. She died Sept 21, 1966 in Athens. Carl Blegen died in 1971. The four members of the Quartet are buried next to each other in the First Cemetery of Athens.  Legacy  In 2011, Rachel Kitzinger, professor of classics and dean of Planning and Academic Affairs summarized Pierce Blegen's importance and influence on Vassar's Department of Greek and Roman Studies: \\"Of all the distinguished women classicists who were involved early on with the Vassar department, Elizabeth Pierce Blegen has had the most long-lasting effect on the department. Her will bequeathed an endowment to the department to support research in classical antiquity and has allowed the department to bring a research fellow or distinguished professor to the college every year to teach a course and do research.\\"  Selected bibliography  * \\"A Roman Colony in the Alps: Aosta\\", Art and Archeology, (1922), p. 83‚Äì90 * \\"A Daedalid in the Skimatari Museum\\", American Journal of Archaeology, Vol 28.

Hill had a strong interest in the relationship between history, geography, and archaeology, which was reflected in her research and publications over her fifty-year career.  Early life and education  Ida Carleton Thallon was born on August 11, 1875 to John and Grace Green Thallon. She attended Packer Collegiate Institute for Girls in Brooklyn, New York. She obtained a Bachelor of Art Degree (AB) from Vassar College in 1897.  Early archaeological and academic career  Hill attended the American School of Classical Studies in Athens from 1899 to 1901. Joining her at the school was fellow Vassar alumni Lida Shaw King. King and Hill were friends who travelled together for three months in Europe before starting classes. They would later collaborate on archaeological publications. While at school, archaeologist Wilhelm D√∂rpfeld's lectures on the topography of Athens had a strong influence on Hill. She was also inspired by friend and fellow student Harriet Boyd. Boyd was a strong advocate for allowing women students to participate in excavations and was successful in gaining permission from the school director to excavate a site of her choosing. In 1900 when Hill returned for her second year, school director Rufus Richardson offered King and Hill the publication of the terracottas from Corinth. They began this project together, but Hill completed the project twenty four years later. During this time in Athens, Hill also studied geometric vases for her Master's thesis at Vassar. Hill's first experience of fieldwork was in February 1901, when she participated in the excavation at Varie Cave under the direction of Charles Weller. Hill and King worked again together as part of his team. Hill kept a journal during her time in the field and in the journal she describes the \\"day by day progress which yielded several inscriptions, hundreds of lamps and coins, and several reliefs of Pan, Hermes and the Nymphs\\". Hill was assigned the study of the marble reliefs, which she published in 1903. In 1901 Hill finished her master's degree (AM) at Vassar. She then accepted a position from her alma mater as an instructor in the Greek and Roman Studies Department. She spent two years teaching Greek, from 1901 to 1903. In 1903 she enrolled at Columbia University for graduate work and completed her PhD in 1905. Her dissertation was Lycosura and the Date of Damophon, which was published in the American Journal of Archaeology. From 1906‚Äì1907 she returned to Vassar and taught Latin classes. In the next year Hill moved to the history department where she was promoted to associate professor of ancient history. She taught history classes from 1907 to 1924. While at Vassar, Hill published her first book, Readings in Greek History, From Homer to the Battle of Cheronea; a Collection of Extractions from the Sources (1914). The book was very well received. Hill had a strong interest in the study of history, with an emphasis on the relationship between history and geography and also between history and archaeology and during these years started to research and publish her findings. In 1916, Hill published an article discussing the connections between archaeology and history and the mutual dependence of the two sciences. In 1919 and 1921 she published two articles focusing on the connection between history and geography. Her 1919 publication compared the city of Troy's historical and physical connection with the Balkans and the Danube. In 1921, she wrote about the connection of history and geography in an article on prehistoric and classical Greece and Italy, where she said \\"we are learning also that despite man's ingenuity certain fixed conditions in the physical characteristics of an area have made him follow the same routes from time immemorial either by land or by sea and have determined his economic, if not always his political, fate.\\"  Later archaeological career  In 1923, Hill travelled to Italy and Greece to work on a publication on pre-Roman Italy with the focus being the relationship between archaeology and history. The next year, she resigned from Vassar and made Athens her permanent home, where she lived with Bert Hodge Hill, then Director of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, whom she had married in 1924; her long-term partner Elizabeth Pierce Blegen; and Pierce Blegen's husband Carl Blegen. In 1924, Hill began working on a writing project for Harold N. Fowler, the editor-in-chief of the Corinth publications. She was enlisted in publishing volumes that would cover all the excavation finds and buildings. Hill committed to publishing the terracotta's of Corinth, the project she and Lida Shaw King had initiated and not completed in 1900. With the assistance of Elizabeth Van Buren, a specialist in terracottas, Hill and Elizabeth Pierce Blegen catalogued the new finds from the excavation. In 1925. Hill participated in an excavation directed by Carl Blegen at Heraeum in Argos. Blegen had discovered Prosymna, an important Bronze Age settlement. In 1927‚Äì1928 she participated in excavations at Prosymna and in 1932‚Äì1938 the excavation at Troy and then Pylos. At Pylos, Hill supervised the excavation of a pillaged Tholos tomb. Hill and Elizabeth Blegen were given the task of inventorying the excavation materials for Troy and Prosymna along with B. Hill's excavation finds at Lapithos on Cyprus. During this time, Hill began work on a textbook on Greek archeology, which was a summary of archeological findings in Greece for the prior fifty years. The outbreak of World War I interrupted archeological work being done in Greece and both the Blegens and Thallon Hill moved back to the United States. During the War, Hill worked on the college textbook. In the 1940s, excavations of the Athenian Agora, the North Slope of the Acropolis, and the Karameikos provided Hill with the opportunity to start work on a new book on Athenian topography. This work was a guidebook as well as scholarly textbook and was published in 1953, the title was Ancient City of Athens. Hill died in 1954 at the age of seventy nine. In June of that year, she was participating in an excavation with Carl Blegen at Pylos. Also at the time of her death, she was working on her unpublished manuscript, 50 years of Excavations.  Personal life  Hill met Elizabeth Pierce when she was Pierce's professor at Vassar in 1906. The two women formed an intimate student/mentor relationship that developed into an intimate personal relationship which continued after Pierce left for graduate work at Columbia University. When Pierce returned to Vassar to teach art history in 1915, the couple started living in adjacent rooms in Davidson house on campus; their relationship at this time has been described as a 'Boston marriage'. In 1921, Pierce travelled to Greece to attend the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. While in Athens, her budding relationship with archaeologist Carl Blegen led to a marriage proposal from Blegen. Pierce initially accepted but then broke off the engagement as she did not wish to end her relationship with Thallon; a plan was formed by Blegen, Pierce, and Bert Hodge Hill (who appears to have had unreciprocated romantic feelings for Blegen) that Hodge Hill and Thallon would marry at the same time as Pierce and Blegen, and the four would live together; Thallon agreed on condition that she and Pierce would continue to travel and spend time together away from their husbands, and the two couples married in 1924, Thallon and Hill marrying on August 15 at Weston-super-Mare in England. The four archaeologists, who referred to themselves as \\"the Family\\", \\"the quartet\\", and \\"the Pro Par\\" (short for \\"Professional Partnership\\"), had a strong and intertwined relationship both professionally and personally. Thallon Hill and Pierce Blegen often worked together on excavations, cataloguing materials and publishing findings for both their husbands. In 1929 the four moved to 9 Ploutarchou Street, which became their permanent family home. The house became a popular meeting place for archaeologists, students of all foreign schools, diplomats, Vassar alumnae, Greek scholars, Fulbright scholars, and the staff of the American embassy.

Early life and education  Myrtle Florence Broome was born on 22 February 1888 in Muswell Hill, London, England to Eleanor Slater and Washington Herbert Broome. She received her art training at a school in Bushey founded by Sir Hubert von Herkomer. From 1911 to 1913 she attended University College London and obtained a Certificate in Egyptology. Her teachers were Sir Flinders Petrie and Margaret Murray.  Epigraphy career in Egypt  In 1927, Broome was invited to participate in a project being conducted in Egypt by the British School of Archeology. The participants, including archeologist Olga Tufnell, copied tomb inscriptions at Qua-El-Kebi, Egypt. In 1929, Broome returned to Egypt to work as an artist with Canadian epigrapher Amice Calverley. Calverley had been hired by the Egypt Exploration Society in 1927 to copy the wall scenes in the Temple of Seti I, c. 1300 BC at Abydos. In the winter of 1928, a visit to Abydos by Mr. and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller Jr. changed the scope of the work being done. Rockefeller was so impressed with the painted reliefs and Calverley's photography like reproductions, that he decided to finance the entire project. As a patron of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, he was also responsible for the Oriental Institute joining efforts on the temple endeavor with the Egypt Exploration Society. Example of a relief in Temple Chapel of Osiris, Temple of Seti I, Abydos, Egypt Calverley was appointed director of the Temple project. With the increased funds, Broome was hired as Calverley's assistant in 1929. During eight seasons at the Temple, the two women were responsible for all the paintings and replications, with the help of a small staff of artists. Besides using large photographs to record the reliefs, the artists penciled over lines and inscriptions for a completely accurate rendering. Broome and Calverley also used watercolor paintings to provide color to the reproductions, because only black and white photography was available at the time. The result of that effort is four volumes with coloured plates published by the University of Chicago between 1933 and 1958. The artists lived together in a mudbrick house near the temple with two local servants. Broome and Calverley were actively involved in the life of the village, participating in feasts and ceremonies and often providing medical assistance to the villagers. The two women traveled together throughout Egypt, taking trains and often driving across the desert in a Jowett car they named Joey; Broome's impressions from that time are noted in letters and illustrations that were sent to her parents. Broome retired from Egyptology in 1937 and returned to England due to her father's illness. She later painted a number of watercolours of Egyptian villages and the surrounding landscape. Over seventy of her paintings are on permanent exhibit at the Bushey Museum in Bushey, England. Broome's letters and papers are at the Griffith Institute in Oxford, England.  Design and craft career in England  Broome's father, Washington Herbert Broome was a music and book publisher. He was a contemporary of William Morris, an influential designer in the British Arts and Crafts movement. W. Broome worked with Morris at the Kelmscott Press before establishing The Old Bourne Press with James Guthrie. In 1907, W. Broome built a house in Bushey that is now listed as a historically interesting building with Historic England. The Broome house \\"Avalon\\" was designed and built in the late Arts and Crafts Style. Myrtle Broome created painted panels and decorations throughout the house. She is also mentioned as being a designer and a craft worker, who designed for Liberty. Avalon is also listed as the home of Myrtle and Washington Broomes' business ‚Äì \\"Designers and Workers in Metal and Enamel\\". Historic England describes the house as being \\"of special interest as a building created for a designer and craftsman of the Arts and Crafts movement, containing a rich variety of decorative elements of the period designed by Broome and his daughter.\\"  Selected bibliography  *Calverley, Amice M. and Myrtle F.

Trump nominated Shanahan to lead plans to increase the size of the military. Shanahan's Senate confirmation hearing took place on June 20, 2017. During the hearing, Senator John McCain, a proponent of providing arms to Ukraine, threatened to block Shanahan's nomination over his response in a written statement about whether or not the U.S. should provide such weapons to Ukraine. Shanahan said he did not have access to classified military information in order to make a decision on the matter. Robert O. Work, the Deputy Secretary of Defense at the end of the Obama administration, remained in the position until Shanahan's confirmation. Shanahan was confirmed by the United States Senate with a vote of 92‚Äì7 on July 18, 2017, and became the 33rd Deputy Secretary of Defense on July 19, 2017. = Acting Secretary of Defense = Shanahan in Afghanistan, February 11, 2019 President Trump initially announced that Shanahan would be elevated on February 28, 2019 to Acting Defense Secretary, when the Jim Mattis resignation was originally to become effective. But a follow-up Trump Twitter announcement on December 23, 2018 stated that Shanahan would be elevated two months prior to the resignation date announced by Mattis. Trump accelerated Mattis's departure date after reportedly becoming angered by the media coverage of his resignation letter, due to language in Mattis‚Äô resignation letter which criticized Trump's worldview. Shanahan assumed the office on January 1, 2019. Shanahan made an unannounced trip to Afghanistan on February 11, 2019 meeting with President Ashraf Ghani, the country's chief executive Abdullah Abdullah, and defense minister Asadullah Khalid during the first few hours of his trip. Shanahan visited the US‚ÄìMexico Border on February 23, 2019 with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff USMC General Joseph Dunford and Commander of the United States Army Corps of Engineers Lt. Gen. Todd T. Semonite for joint assessments with Border Patrol, DHS, and others. In late March 2019, news sources reported that Shanahan was under investigation by the Pentagon's Office of Inspector General because of allegations he improperly advocated on behalf of his former employer, Boeing Co. In a May 2019 internal memo, Shanahan ordered new restrictions on how information about global operational plans and orders are shared with Congress, such that summaries are provided rather than an actual plan or order that was requested. On May 9, 2019, the White House announced that President Trump would nominate Shanahan as his second defense secretary, despite skepticism and even hostility from lawmakers and officials within the Department of Defense. However, Shanahan withdrew from the confirmation process in June, following increased public scrutiny of several incidents and allegations of domestic violence involving Shanahan's ex-wife and son. In a tweet addressing the withdrawal of the nomination, President Trump said that Shanahan intended to \\"devote more time to his family.\\"  Awards and memberships  Current positions * Fellow, Royal Aeronautical Society * Fellow, Society of Manufacturing Engineers, 2004 * Associate Fellow, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Former positions * Secretary and Treasurer, American Helicopter Society International Board of Directors * Chair of Board of Regents at University of Washington * Regent, University of Washington 2012‚Äì2017 * Board of directors, American Parkinson Disease Association * Member, Washington Roundtable Awards * Distinguished Service (2019), University of Washington College of Engineering  References  External links * - 1962 births American business executives Bishop Blanchet High School alumni Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society Living people Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni MIT Sloan School of Management alumni Trump administration personnel United States Deputy Secretaries of Defense University of Washington College of Engineering alumni ","title":"Patrick M.

He attended theological training courses at Wyoming Seminary, Kingston, and the Western Theological Seminary, Allegheny. In 1862 he was ordained minister of Emmet and Ixonia. By 1872 he was living in New York, where he formed a company promoting emigration, which purchased the ship 'Rush' on which twenty-nine emigrants were sent off to Patagonia. They made it no further than Montevideo, where they dispersed. A number of further failed voyages followed, although a few are known to have managed to reach Patagonia, despite shipwreck, though penniless including D. S. Davies himself. He returned from the colony to Wales just four months later, being invited in 1875 to become minister of Ebenezer, Bangor. In 1886, he transferred to Union Street church, Carmarthen, remaining there until his death, in 1898. His writings include Ystyr Bedydd (The Meaning of Baptism) (1891), and Adroddiad (1875), which provided information about Patagonia. He also edited Y Celt.

She was an advocate of women's rights, formed one of the first women's political organizations in the country and served as one of the first women to be elected as a Member of British Guiana Parliament. She was recognized with the national service honor, the Cacique Crown of Honor in 1975. Early life Jane Henrietta Phillips was born on 2 November 1913, in Georgetown, British Guiana, to James Adolphus Phillips She attended St. Ambrose Primary, Brickdam Roman Catholic School and Christ Church Anglican School, winning the primary school scholarship in 1925, which allowed her to continue her schooling. She attended Collegiate High School, completing her Junior Cambridge certification in 1929. Career That same year, Phillips preached her first sermon, \\"Blessed are thou among women\\", at St. Stephens Church. She began preaching regularly and laid the foundation for her own church. In 1933, she was ordained as a Baptist preacher in Barbados. She joined the African Development Association, a Guyanese organization formed in 1938 to empower and improve the lives of Afro-Guyanese. In 1942, Phillips married Ivan Gay and affixed his surname to her own, becoming Phillips-Gay. Labor disputes in the sugar industry of British Guiana had historically led to shootings on various plantations. One such incident at the Emerald plantation in the 1940s, led Phillips-Gay to seek out Joseph P. Lachmansingh, who would become the head of the Guiana Industrial Workers Union (GIWU) to try to understand the roots of the problem. He invited her to participate with him at a meeting on one of the plantations. She began working with Lachmansingh as a volunteer, visiting plantations throughout the colony and recording grievances and injuries of the cane workers. Phillips-Gay joined the Women's Political and Economic Organization (WPEO) when it formed in 1946. The first political organization of women in British Guiana, the group sought civic, economic and political parity for women. The following year, when the People's Progressive Party (PPP), formed she joined it as well. In 1948, Phillips-Gay became the assistant general secretary of the GIWU and was an active participant in the Enmore strike, which resulted in workers being martyred for their involvement. The following year, Phillips-Gay, a recognized labor leader, became the general secretary of GIWU, with the responsibility of managing the organization. In 1953, she was one of the group of women of the PPP, who formed the Women‚Äôs Progressive Organisation (WPO). That same year, she ran for a seat in the House of Assembly for the East Central Demerara district and successfully gained 63 percent of the sugar constituent's vote. Ironically, her voting base was predominantly Indo-Guyanese, while another successful politician in the race, Chandra Persaud, was elected by a predominantly Afro-Guyanese constituency. The election marked the first time women were allowed to vote, and Phillips-Gay, along with Janet Jagan and Jessica Burnham became the first three women elected to the parliament. In 1955, the PPP split and Phillips-Gay joined the faction led by Forbes Burnham, which became the People's National Congress (PNC). She led an unsuccessful bid to keep her seat on the PNC ticket in 1957, and lost both subsequent attempts in 1961, and 1964. In 1957, she led the founding of the Women's Auxiliary of the PNC and served as the chair of the group for the next nineteen years. Phillips-Gay continued her community service work becoming involved in various measures aimed at protecting children and the elderly, as well as continuing her efforts with workers and the unemployed. Her work with women‚Äôs organizations expanded region wide and in 1970, she helped found Caribbean Women‚Äôs Association (CARIWA). In 1975, she was awarded Guyana's second highest national honor, the Cacique Crown of Honor (CCH). Death and legacy Phillips-Gay died on 21 February 1994 in Georgetown. At the time of her death, the legislature recognized her commitment to her service to the nation and she is remembered each International Women's Day for her contributions.

He is the first amputee jockey to win a horse race at a professional race-course in Britain. He won the Royal Artillery Gold Cup, on his horse, Rathlin Rose, at Sandown Park Racecourse, in Esher in Surrey, on 17 February 2017. Disney's horse was trained by racehorse trainer David Pipe. As a former serviceman in the British Army, Disney said his thoughts turned to his fallen colleagues in Afghanistan when he won. Education From the years 1995‚Äì2000, Disney was educated at Malvern College, a co-educational boarding and day independent school in the town of Malvern in Worcestershire, in the West of England, followed by the Royal Agricultural University in the market town of Cirencester in Gloucestershire, also in the West of England. Life and career Guy Disney served in The Light Dragoons, a cavalry regiment of the British Army, in Afghanistan. He suffered a life-changing injury, leading to leg amputation, and the fitting of a prosthetic leg, when his vehicle was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade while on patrol in Babaji in Helmand Province, in July 2009. Disney has since worked for the charitable organisation Walking With The Wounded, which helps wounded former British Armed Forces servicemen and women to transition to civilian life. In March 2014, he returned to his former boarding school, Malvern College, to talk about his successful expedition with the organisation, accompanied by other wounded former service personnel, to both the North and South Poles. Disney was initially rejected in his application to ride with a prosthetic limb by the British Horseracing Authority, but was eventually granted a licence in 2015, finishing third place on the horse Ballyallia Man at Sandown Park's Royal Artillery Gold Cup on 13 February in the same year.

It was published by Hamish Hamilton of Penguin Books in 2016 and features illustrations by Cree artist Kent Monkman. It was part of a collaborative effort to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Chanie's death. The book follows Chanie Wenjack, a 12-year-old Ojibwe boy, as he escapes from a Northern Ontario residential school in the futile hopes of returning home to his family and two dogs. It alternates between Chanie's perspective and the perspectives of Manitous, who take on different animal forms to keep a silent watch on Chanie as he walks on foot to a home he does not know is hundreds of kilometers away.  Plot  The story begins with Chanie describing his experiences of abuse from residential school teachers, who he and his friends (two brothers) call \\"Fish Bellies\\" or \\"Sucker Bellies\\" for their pale skin. On an October afternoon, Chanie and the two brothers decide to run away. Because of a lung infection, Chanie struggles to keep up with his friends. Eventually the three boys reach a river, where they run into the two brothers' uncle. They are given a meager meal of freshly- caught fish in the cabin where the uncle, his wife, and his daughter are staying. That night, Chanie sleeps on the floor by the wood stove. In the morning, the uncle tells his wife to send Chanie away, while he takes his two nephews to the trapline to look for food. When Chanie gets up to join them, the uncle tells him that it would be dangerous to have four people in his canoe. The mother sends Chanie on his way with dried moose meat and tells him to turn right at the tracks to head back to the school. The girl gives him a glass jar that holds seven matches. Chanie leaves the cabin, resolved to find his two friends and their uncle. However, when he reunites with them, the uncle tells him he cannot stay and that he must return to the school. He tells Chanie he can beat the impending bad weather if he travels quickly. At the railroad tracks, Chanie turns in the direction away from the school and toward where he thinks his home will be. When it is dark, he decides to sleep next to a beaver pond, lighting a small fire with the matches given to him by the girl. However, the fire gives him little to no protection against the extremely cold temperatures that night. He ends up dreaming about the sexual abuse he experienced at the hands of one of his teachers. Back on the tracks, Chanie continues to slowly make his way on his journey, weakened from exhaustion and exposure. He falls a number of times before finally succumbing to the cold. After his death, a mother lynx lifts Chanie's spirit and carries him into the forest, away from the tracks. In the morning an engineer comes across Chanie's frozen body by the tracks and notifies the authorities. The story ends with Chanie, warm and happy, dancing in the forest with all of the animals featured throughout the novel.  Background  Wenjack was released for the 50th anniversary of Chanie \\"Charlie\\" Wenjack's death as part of a collaborative effort to, as Boyden put it, \\"put Charlie out into the world\\". The book's release coincided with the release of Canadian Rock musician Gord Downie's fifth album, Secret Path, a concept album also based on Wenjack's story along with a graphic novel of the same name by Canadian cartoonist Jeff Lemire and an animated film produced by CBC Arts. Boyden also contributed two spoken word tracks to A Tribe Called Red's 2016 album, We Are the Halluci Nation. Prior to the release of the book, Boyden wrote a Heritage Minute narrated by Chanie's sister, Pearl Achneepineskum. Boyden obtained Pearl's permission over the phone to go ahead with the novella. She also shared the only existing photo of Chanie, which appears at the end of Boyden's book. He also collaborated with M√©tis filmmaker Terril Calder to produce SNIP, an animated short, based on Wenjack's story. This collaborative gesture was initiated by Gord Downie's brother, Mike Downie, who foregrounded an article by Ian Adams published in Maclean's in 1967 titled \\"The Lonely Death of Chanie Wenjack\\", documenting Chanie's escape from a residential school at the age of 12 and the subsequent discovery of his body by a set of train tracks. Boyden also acknowledged the influence of the ballad \\"Chanie Wenjack\\" by the Canadian singer-songwriter Willie Dunn. On October 22, 2016, imagineNATIVE hosted \\"A Night for Chanie\\", a special multimedia presentation of film, music, and performance related with a reading of the book by Boyden and introductory remarks by Senator Murray Sinclair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The event was dedicated to honouring the memory of Wenjack and all other children of residential schools. In an interview about the book, Boyden reflected that he \\"want[ed] us as Canadians to understand the fuller history of our country, to take it upon him or herself to learn beyond what you weren't taught in school. And the importance of that. It's not so we feel guilty or bad for what people we never met did, it's beyond that. It's how do we come together as a nation and move forward together.\\"  Reception  Wenjack had moderately positive reception from the mainstream media.. John Bemrose of Maclean's described the book as \\"spellbinding\\", and \\"a novella that deftly suffuses Chanie's tragedy with traditional Aboriginal beliefs.\\" Denise Balkissoon of The Globe and Mail described it as \\"slim but heart-wrenching\\". In conjunction with the release of Boyden's book and Secret Path, Maclean's put out a call for stories of other runaways from residential schools. The Brock Press, a student newspaper of Brock University in Ontario, Canada, writes that the novella \\"is short, but vast in its significance\\", claiming that \\"the book continues to make strides in its telling of Wenjack's story, pushing for the history of residential schools, the attempts to destroy First Nations cultures and forced assimiliation through violence and hate to be more widely viewed and discussed as a part of Canada's history.\\" Reception to Wenjack was later overshadowed by the controversies around Boyden's genealogy and tribal affiliations. Debbie Reese, an Indigenous author and researcher of Native American portrayal in children's literature, had an overall negative perception of Boyden's novella. In a series of tweets a few months after the release of Wenjack, she criticizes Boyden's act as just one of many that \\"[make] Native ancestry ‚Ä¶ the centerpiece of who they are\\", and the belief that \\"they can speak/write of things they ought not.\\" Pieta Woolley, in an article titled \\"Cultural thieves\\" for the United Church Observer, mentioned Wenjack as an introduction to labelling Boyden as \\"the latest alleged offender\\" in the midst of social questions regarding cultural thievery. The Wenjack novel has received criticism for containing many fictionalized elements about Wenjack's known history in an attempt to portray the horror of residential schools, when instead factual survivor stories could have been used.

N-CNTs can also be prepared by a CVD method of pyrolyzing melamine under Ar at elevated temperatures of 800‚Äì980 ¬∞C. However synthesis by CVD of melamine results in the formation of bamboo-structured CNTs. XPS spectra of grown N-CNTs reveal nitrogen in five main components, pyridinic nitrogen, pyrrolic nitrogen, quaternary nitrogen, and nitrogen oxides. Furthermore, synthesis temperature affects the type of nitrogen configuration. Nitrogen doping plays a pivotal role in lithium storage, as it creates defects in the CNT walls allowing for Li ions to diffuse into interwall space. It also increases capacity by providing more favorable bind of N-doped sites. N-CNTs are also much more reactive to metal oxide nanoparticle deposition which can further enhance storage capacity, especially in anode materials for Li-ion batteries.

Yu et al. reported on \\"chemically bonded graphene leaves\\" growing along the sidewalls of CNTs. Stoner et al. described these structures as \\"graphenated CNTs\\" and reported in their use for enhanced supercapacitor performance. Hsu et al. further reported on similar structures formed on carbon fiber paper, also for use in supercapacitor applications. Pham et al. also reported a similar structure, namely \\"graphene-carbon nanotube hybrids\\", grown directly onto carbon fiber paper to form an integrated, binder free, high surface area conductive catalyst support for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells electrode applications with enhanced performance and durability. The foliate density can vary as a function of deposition conditions (e.g. temperature and time) with their structure ranging from few layers of graphene (< 10) to thicker, more graphite-like. The fundamental advantage of an integrated graphene-CNT structure is the high surface area three-dimensional framework of the CNTs coupled with the high edge density of graphene. Graphene edges provide significantly higher charge density and reactivity than the basal plane, but they are difficult to arrange in a three-dimensional, high volume-density geometry. CNTs are readily aligned in a high density geometry (i.e., a vertically aligned forest) but lack high charge density surfaces‚Äîthe sidewalls of the CNTs are similar to the basal plane of graphene and exhibit low charge density except where edge defects exist. Depositing a high density of graphene foliates along the length of aligned CNTs can significantly increase the total charge capacity per unit of nominal area as compared to other carbon nanostructures.

Description PDO Pelion apples covers a small, hilly area in the eastern part of mainland Greece, situated east of the coastal city of Volos. Its area coincides partially with than of PDO Volos olives and it neighbours PDO Stylida olives to the northeast. This region is characterized by a mild climate with cool summers, high humidity and slight seasonal variations in temperature. These conditions are suitable for growing apples, which tend to do best in temperate zones with cold winters, moderate summer temperatures and high levels of humidity. This appellation covers apples of the Firiki variety. The trees starts bearing fruit 6 years after planting and produce a crop once in every 2 years. To replace unproductive trees or create new orchards, producers use seedlings, grown from seeds, produced within the area of the appellation, or saplings, produced from grafting seedlings. The fruit is harvested by hand. All steps of the production process have to take place within the designated geographical area. Re-packing outside the area is permitted. The apples are small to medium in size and have an elongated, cylindrical shape. The circumference of the fruit ranges between 14 and 18 centimeters. The skin is yellow-green in color with red tones, visible on the side that has been exposed to the sun. These apples have a juicy flesh, a high sugar content and low acidity levels. It is believed that the Firiki apple variety originated in the Black Sea region. It has been grown in the foothills of Pelion since the 18th century. Pesticides A 2014 study showed that samples of the apples contained flufenoxuron among other substances, which has a potential for bio-accumulation. ‚ÄúThe presence of pesticide residues in PDO/PGI apples is not unexpected since this labeling does not necessarily mean that such products are free of contaminants. Indeed, PDO/PGI labeling guarantees only the authenticity of products and their agricultural practice does not avoid the use of pesticides, as does organic farming practice.‚Äù References Apples Appellations Firiki piliou ","title":"Firiki Piliou"},{"id":"53507636","text":"Jeffrey Adam Rosen (born April 2, 1958) is an American lawyer who is the current United States Deputy Attorney General. Prior to assuming his current role, he was a senior partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis and was the United States Deputy Secretary of Transportation. Education Rosen graduated from Northwestern University with a Bachelor of Arts in economics in 1979. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, receiving his Juris Doctor in 1982. Career Rosen joined Kirkland & Ellis in 1982. He left the firm in 2003 and began working for the U.S. government. From 2003 to 2006, Rosen was general counsel at the United States Department of Transportation and acted as counsel for Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta. In 2006, Rosen moved to the Office of Management and Budget where he was general counsel and senior policy advisor until 2009. While at the OMB, he criticized \\"regulatory overreach\\" and opposed EPA plans to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. He also served as a representative of the U.S. government on the board of directors of Amtrak. Rosen returned to Kirkland & Ellis in 2009. From 2015 to 2016, Rosen chaired the American Bar Association's Section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice. On May 16, 2017, Rosen was confirmed as United States Deputy Secretary of Transportation by a 56‚Äì42 vote. There he served under Secretary Elaine Chao. On February 19, 2019, President Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Rosen for the position of United States Deputy Attorney General, succeeding Rod Rosenstein upon his departure from the Department of Justice. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on May 16 by a vote of 52‚Äì45. His nomination to become the second-highest law enforcement official was unusual, as Rosen had no previous prosecutorial experience. Attorney General William Barr had urged Trump to choose Rosen as his deputy. Rosen was sworn in on May 22, 2019. In June 2019, Rosen sent a letter to New York state prosecutors inquiring into the case of Paul Manafort and indicating that he would be monitoring where Manafort would be held in custody. Shortly thereafter, federal prison officials informed New York state prosecutors that Manafort would not be held in Rikers Island. Current and former prosecutors described this decision as unusual, because most individuals held in custody while awaiting federal trial are held in Rikers Island, a prison with a reputation for violence and mismanagement. On July 30, 2020, Rosen wrote a letter to the president of the Puerto Rico Elections Commission denying the Commission's petition to the U.S. Justice Department to recommend the disbursement of $2.5 million‚Äîearmarked under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 for an educational campaign regarding the political future of the Island‚Äîto be used in connection with the plebiscite on the political status of Puerto Rico slated to be held in November 2020.

She was the first woman to rise from factory work to leadership in the Socialist party. Her 1910 novel, The Diary of a Shirtwaist Striker, is credited with helping to reform New York state labor laws. As head of the Woman's National Committee of the Socialist Party of America (SPA), she established an annual Woman's Day which was the precursor to International Women's Day. In 1911, while on a speaking tour of the American South, she called attention to the problem of white supremacism within the party. She spent her later years promoting adult education for women workers.  Early life  Theresa Serber was born in Bar, Russia (now Ukraine) on May 1, 1874, one of seven sisters. The family moved to the Lower East Side of New York City in 1891, and seventeen-year-old Theresa went to work as a cloakmaker in a garment factory.Miller (1978), p. 190.  Activism  Soon after her arrival in New York she joined the Russian Workingmen's Club. In 1892 she organized the Infant Cloakmaker's Union of New York, a group of mostly Jewish women, and became its first president.Miller (1978), p. 191. Over the next few years she represented her union in the Knights of Labor, the Central Labor Federation, and the United Hebrew Trades. Her exposure to the radicalism of the latter two groups reinforced her socialist beliefs, and in 1893 she joined the Socialist Labor Party (SLP). She was an active member of the SLP for six years, representing her union at the first convention of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance.Miller (1978), pp. 192-193. In 1899 she left the SLP and joined the Socialist Party of America (SPA). Malkiel believed that only socialism could liberate women, and that socialism, in turn, could not survive without the full participation of women. In theory, the Socialist party was committed to equal rights for men and women, but in practice, it made no effort to reach out specifically to women workers and showed little interest in their concerns. Malkiel concluded that socialist women would have to fight their own parallel battle for equality.Miller (1978), pp. 192-3, 197-8, 204. Her 1909 essay, \\"Where Do We Stand on the Woman Question?\\" expresses her frustration with this state of affairs: > For the workingwoman of today finds herself between two fires--on the one > hand, she faces the capitalist class, her bitterest enemy; it foresees a > far-reaching danger in her emancipation and with all the ability of its > money power tries to resist her eventual advent into the civilized world. In > her anguish the workingwoman turns towards her brothers in the hope to find > a strong support in their midst, but she is doomed to be disillusioned, for > they discourage her activity and are utterly listless towards the outcome of > her struggle.Malkiel (1909), pp. 160-161. In 1905, Malkiel organized the Women's Progressive Society of Yonkers, which became a branch of the Socialist Women's Society of New York. Although the socialist party was officially opposed to separatism, Malkiel believed a women's organization was necessary to attract women to the party, and as a practice ground for women activists. Women were tired of their limited positions in the party as \\"official cake-bakers and money-collectors,\\" she said.Miller (1978), p. 194. Meanwhile, she wrote socialist propaganda leaflets and published numerous articles on socialism and the woman question in journals such as the Progressive Woman, Machinists' Monthly, and the International Socialist Review. She also contributed to the New York Call, a socialist journal she co-founded with her husband. = Woman's National Committee = Malkiel was elected to the Woman's National Committee of the Socialist party in 1909. She served as a delegate to several conventions, campaigned, wrote pamphlets, and, like Rose Pastor Stokes, helped raise awareness of immigrant women's concerns. She established suffrage clubs designed to appeal to working women and bring them into the party. She also established an annual Woman's Day, starting on February 28, 1909, which was observed by several European socialist parties as well as the SPA.Miller (1978), pp. 195, 197. Woman's Day was the precursor to International Women's Day which is celebrated each year on March 8. In 1909 she worked closely with the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) to support the New York shirtwaist strike with publicity and fundraising. = The Diary of a Shirtwaist Striker = In 1910, Malkiel published The Diary of a Shirtwaist Striker, a fictionalized account of the shirtwaist strike. She depicted the strike from the point of view of an American-born worker who is initially wary of her immigrant co-workers. Over time she grows closer to them and becomes increasingly aware of the need to win the ballot as well as the strike, and of the need for more solidarity between male and female workers.Miller (1978), p. 198. After the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire the following year, the book garnered public attention and helped trigger legislative reforms. Later scholars tended to dismiss the book as propaganda.Basch (1990), p. ix. In 1990 it was reprinted by Cornell University Press with an introduction by historian Fran√ßoise Basch, and received positive reviews from Alice Kessler-Harris, Mari Jo Buhle, and the ILR Review.Basch (1990), back cover. = Tour of the American South = During a speaking tour of the American South in 1911, Malkiel was appalled to learn that white socialists were practicing racial segregation. In one Arkansas town, she was invited to speak at a gathering of over a thousand African Americans, but party organizers would not allow it. In another, the Socialist local refused to allow African Americans to join. At one event in Mississippi she gave a speech in the pouring rain to a group of dues-paying African-American socialists who were denied entry to the local meeting hall. Her scathing report in the New York Call created a stir:Perry (2013), p. 149. > Lord preserve us from this kind of Socialists....We must not preach > Socialism to the negroes because the white workingmen are foolish enough to > allow their masters to arouse their prejudices against their fellow workers > in order to keep them divided so as to play off one against the other. Despite her occasional use of terms that are now considered ethnic slurs, it is clear she was vehemently opposed to segregation and considered it incompatible with socialism. Her disillusionment in this regard echoes her earlier laments about the party's treatment of women. In modern terms, she supported an early form of intersectionality. = Other activist work = In 1914, as head of the Socialist Suffrage Campaign of New York, Malkiel organized a mass meeting at Carnegie Hall. In 1916, she was one of three women appointed by the National Executive Committee to travel across the country campaigning for suffrage. Although the Socialist party was officially opposed to cooperating with suffragist organizations such as the National Woman Suffrage Association, Malkiel supported the idea, stipulating that socialists should always present their views from a socialist perspective.Miller (1978), pp. 200-201. She was suspicious of well-to-do suffragists such as Alva Belmont,Adickes (2000), p. 52. and warned against being distracted by the \\"false consciousness\\" of bourgeois feminism. Malkiel went on two national tours for the Socialist party during World War I, speaking on women's rights and against American involvement in the war. In 1920 she ran for the New York State Assembly on the Socialist ticket and was narrowly defeated.  Adult education  Malkiel spent the last two decades of her life promoting education for immigrant women and assisting them with naturalization. She founded the Brooklyn Adult Students Association and directed its classes and summer camp.Miller (1978), p. 204.  Personal life  She married attorney and fellow socialist Leon A. Malkiel in 1900 and moved to Yonkers. She gave birth to a daughter, Henrietta, in 1903.Basch (1990), p. 50. Although no longer a factory worker herself, she remained committed to improving the lives of working women. She died on November 17, 1949.

History The earliest ideas eventually taken up in the Chamber Symphony date back to a sketch for a septet for winds and piano, dating from around the time of the Octet for strings, Op. 7 (1900). The score is dated May 1954, a year before his death but less than two months before Enescu suffered the cerebral stroke in July that made all work impossible. The final markings to the score had to be dictated to Marcel Mihalovici . The score is dedicated to the Association of Chamber Music Concerts of Paris and its permanent conductor Fernand Oubradous . The work was performed for the first time in a concert commemorating the first anniversary of the composer's death, at the Romanian Athenaeum in Bucharest. Constantin Silvestri conducted the performance and, when it received only a tepid response from the audience, announced, \\"This work is Enescu's masterpiece; it is more difficult to grasp than others, because of its very advanced language. Therefore, we shall perform it once more in its entirety.\\" After this second hearing, it was a great success . Instrumentation The work is scored for twelve instruments: flute, oboe, cor anglais, clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, violin, viola, cello, contrabass, and piano. Analysis The Chamber Symphony transcends the cyclical principles of Enescu's earlier works, in that the entire composition is constructed as a single sonata-allegro overarching entity, cast in four movements : #Molto moderato, un poco maestoso: a double exposition, leading to the combined thematic synthesis that will be developed in the following movements #Allegretto molto moderato: a combined scherzo and theme and variations #Adagio: unites the materials worked out in the previous movement into a vast melodic line #Allegro molto moderato: a first section continues working out the thematic synthesis, and a second provides the recapitulation of the first-movement material.

In 2004, Lerrick acted as leader of the negotiations team of the individual bondholders in the Argentine debt restructuring negotiations regarding a default by Argentina on its $110 billion debt held by the IMF. Lerrick is credited with devising a plan to provide representation of those individual bondholders in the face of concern that retail investors would be partial the IMF and its large institutional investors. Lerrick was an emeritus professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he also held the position of the \\"Friends of Allan H. Meltzer Chair in Economics\\" from 2001 to 2010. On March 14, 2017, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Lerrick for Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Finance. Once confirmed, Lerrick was expected to report to David Malpass, who is the Under Secretary for International Affairs in the United States Department of the Treasury. On May 10, 2018, President Trump withdrew Lerrick's nomination over concerns regarding his financial disclosures, specifically special purpose vehicles set up by Lerrick in Ireland to hold the restructured bonds of Argentina. From September 2018 to May 2019, Lerrick served as Acting United States Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund. In June 2019, he was appointed as Counselor to the Secretary of the Treasury.  Policy positions  Lerrick has been called a \\"creative thinker in the world of sovereign debt crises,\\" particularly in connection with his criticism of government bailouts by the IMF. Starting in the late 1990s, he became a critic of the IMF's handling of currency runs in Southeast Asian countries, also writing a paper arguing that U.S. taxpayer funds could be saved if the IMF were able to rely on international bond market funds instead of looking only to major nation creditors, such as the United States.

Based in the United Kingdom, it is owned by Andrea Radrizzani's Aser Ventures. Eleven Sports' business model initially centred around the acquisition of major international sports rights in smaller countries. The company operates linear television and/or digital services in Belgium, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Myanmar, Taiwan, and the United States.  History  Eleven Sports first launched in Belgium and Luxembourg in 2015 with a linear and OTT service. In February 2016, Eleven Sports acquired Polish rights to Formula One. In July 2016, Eleven Sports acquired rights to the English Premier League in Taiwan. Both of the properties were marketed by Radrizzani's sister company MP & Silva. On 16 March 2017, Eleven Sports announced that it had acquired \\"certain distribution assets\\" of the fledgling U.S. international sports channel One World Sports, which had been replaced by a U.S. version of Eleven Sports Network in advance of the announcement. Financial details of the sale were not disclosed. In May 2017, Eleven Sports acquired a majority share of Italian provider Sportube, which was renamed in September. As of 2019, it offers pay-per-view basis events, such as Italian Serie C of football, Superliga Argentina and Men's Italian Volleyball League, but also free events to registered users such as Italian waterpolo, handball and selected UEFA Nations League group stage matches. On 9 January 2018, Eleven announced that it would televise 120 games in the 2017‚Äì18 NBA G League season in the United States. In May 2018, Eleven Sports secured a three-year deal to broadcast La Liga football matches in the UK and Ireland, which had been previously broadcast on Sky Sports. Two months later, they secured exclusive UK three year deals to screen Serie A matches, previously broadcast by BT Sport, the Eredivisie and the Chinese Super League (both previously televised by Sky Sports) and Sweden's Allsvenskan but in January 2019, Eleven Sports dropped its rights to Serie A and Eredivisie football, passing on the rights to Premier Sports. Premier Sports also won the rights to the Chinese Super League and Swedish Allsvenskan, leaving Eleven with exclusive La Liga, Segunda Division play-offs, Copa del Rey, and Supercopa rights until at least the end of the season.Eleven Sports to lose some football rights; Premier Sports steps in Radrizzani later admitted that the attempt to expand into Britain was a \\"mistake\\", as it was difficult to compete with or secure cooperation from the existing duopoly of Sky and BT. Also in May 2018, Eleven sold a 50% stake in its Polish operations to Telewizja Polsat for around ‚Ç¨38 million. In 2018, Eleven Sports launched services in Myanmar under the brand MY Sports, which broadcasts fixtures of Myanmar national team, U-23, U-21, U-18 teams and also exclusively broadcast Myanmar National League, General Aung San Shield, Serie A, FA Cup and Chinese Super League. They also have partnerships with MRTV-4, Channel 7, MRTV, Mizzima TV and Fortune TV for broadcasting football matches under MY Sports. In March 2019, Eleven renewed its rights to Formula One in Poland through 2022, also sub-licensing highlights to Polsat and race replays to TVP. It also launched services in Japan as its eleventh market, streaming games from NPB Farm League teams with associated digital coverage. In July 2019, nearly the remainder of Eleven Sports Poland was sold to Polsat, with Radrizzani maintaining a single share. In June 2020, Eleven acquired rights to Pro League, Division B, and Women's Super League football in Belgium through the 2024‚Äì25 season, and later announced a partnership with Mediapro for the rights as part of a larger series of projects. In August 2020, the company announced a repositioning referred to as \\"Eleven 2.0\\", including a refocus (initially in Belgium, Italy, and Portugal) to include more \\"premium\\" sports rights, and also launching new verticals for women's sports, local sports (\\"Eleven Next\\"), and esports. A new logo rebranding the broadcaster as \\"Eleven\\" was also introduced.

Davis contributed to the measurement of electrodermal activity, gastric reflexes, and muscle action potentials. Davis published over 70 articles on psychophysiology and related topics across a 30-year career and mentored many graduate students at Indiana University Bloomington from 1931 through 1961. Personal history Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts on December 30, 1902,\\"Massachusetts Births, 1841-1915,\\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FXHJ-3BT : 10 March 2018), Robert Clark Davis, 30 Dec 1902, Cambridge, Massachusetts; citing reference ID #p345 ln1376, Massachusetts Archives, Boston; FHL microfilm 2,057,388. Roland Clark Davis was the eldest child of William Chalmers Davis and Effie Estelle Clark. Davis earned his A.B. in English from Harvard in 1924 and his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1930. Upon leaving Columbia, Davis briefly worked as a research associate for the University of Virginia. Davis married Francis Oliver Meacham on September 12, 1927, in Petersburg, Virginia. They had two children, Susan Oliver and Christopher Meacham. In 1931, Davis was hired as an Acting Associate Professor at Indiana University where he established his psychophysiology laboratory in Science Hall. Davis died on February 23, 1961, at the age of 58 in Yellow Springs, Ohio. He was returning home from a meeting at the Fels Research Institute when he suffered a heart attack. Professional contributions At Columbia, Davis was mentored by Robert Sessions Woodworth and Albert Poffenberger. In his 1930 dissertation, ‚ÄúFactors Affecting the Galvanic Reflex,‚Äù Davis reviewed hundreds of published articles on the galvanic skin response (GSR), producing an extensive and systematic review of GSR. Davis was the first to use a vacuum tube as a way to control the electrical current during measurement of the GSR. Davis also developed a device that provided an uninterrupted measurement of arterial blood pressure that would not interfere with the subject‚Äôs true blood pressure, and he is credited with introducing the cathode-ray oscilloscope technique for measuring muscle action potentials. In collaboration with Douglas Ellson, Irving Saltzman, and Cletus Burke, Davis also developed a lie- detection device. Using gastric balloons and a landmine detector to track the progress of steel balls through the gastrointestinal tracts of volunteers, Davis produced evidence that stomach contractions were largely absent when the stomach was empty, a finding that directly refuted the popular hypothesis of the time that hunger produced the most intense stomach contractions. Davis also used the electrogastrogram (EGG) to study the effects of particular drugs on gastric activity. Davis also challenged the theory of homeostasis, arguing that the relevant terms needed to be more precisely defined and that responses could be adaptive even if they were not homeostatic:‚ÄúHomeostasis can be maintained for one variable only at the expense of heterostasis in at least one other‚Äù. Teaching and Leadership Davis was recognized as a leader in the Department of Psychology, and he was one of the few members of the senior faculty to remain in his position through World War II. Davis was also one of the founding members of the Society for Psychophysiological Research. At Indiana University, Davis directed the master's and doctoral theses of 29 graduate students, including Oran Wendle Eagleson.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and one or two white flowers with dark glandular tips on the sepals and fine reddish-brown lines along the sepals and petals. Description Caladenia rigida is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf long and wide. One or two white flowers with fine reddish-brown lines and across are borne on a spike tall. The sepals, but not the petals, have red, reddish-black or yellow-green glandular tips long. The dorsal sepal is erect near its base then gently curves forward and is long and about wide. The lateral sepals are long and wide and spread stiffly apart. The petals are long, wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long and wide, and white. The sides of the labellum have many red, linear teeth up to long with white tips, and the tip of the labellum curves downwards. There are four or six rows of red calli with white tips along the labellum mid-line. Flowering occurs from August to October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia rigida was first formally described in 1930 by Richard Sanders Rogers and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden from a specimen collected near Golden Grove. The specific epithet (rigida) is a Latin word meaning \\"stiff\\", \\"rigid\\" or \\"inflexible\\". Distribution and habitat The stiff spider orchid is only known from the Mount Lofty Ranges where it grows on the upper slopes of hills in open forest with an open shrub layer. Ecology This orchid appears to attract pollinators both by sexual deception of thynnid wasps and by offering food rewards to other insect species. The species does not require fire to flower but some populations appear to benefit from fire, possibly due to the reduction of competition from other species, including grasses. Conservation Caladenia rigida is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the South Australian Government National Parks and Wildlife Act (1972). The main threats to the species include grazing, especially by kangaroos and weed invasion.

Her work has appeared in LGBT publications such as The Pink Paper, Gay News, Strip AIDS, Dyke's Delight, and AARGH, as well as The Guardian, The Independent, and New Internationalist. Lesbian and Gay Studies: A Critical Introduction (Bloomsbury Publishing) calls her a \\"notable by-and-for lesbian\\" cartoonist. In 2015, her graphic novel Sally Heathcote: Suffragette (with Mary and Bryan Talbot) was included in a list published by The Guardian of the \\"top 10 books about revolutionaries\\". Sensible Footwear: A Girl‚Äôs Guide, her autobiography and history of gay and lesbian culture in England and Scotland from the end of World War II to the present, was published in 2018.  Early life  Charlesworth was born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, England in 1950 to Joan and Harold Charlesworth. Her parents ran a local corner shop during her childhood. She attended Wombwell High School in Barnsley and attended Manchester College of Art and Design for graphics and stage design from 1968 to 1973. Charlesworth is an only child.  Career  Charlesworth‚Äôs career in comics began in 1973, when she pitched a daily strip called \\"Twice Nightly\\" with two gay characters and suffragette themes to Manchester Evening News. The strip ran for six months. In 1976 she moved to London, after which she was published in gay and lesbian newspapers including The Pink Paper, Gay News, and Sappho, LGBT comic books including Strip AIDS, Dyke's Delight, and AARGH, and mainstream publications like The Guardian and City Limits (magazine). Her strips and cartoons often addressed contemporary issues in the lesbian and LGBT community, including presentation, socio-political issues including oppressive legislation, and stereotypes in a humorous manner. In 1995 her work appeared in Dyke‚Äôs Delight issues 1 and 2, introducing some of her most popular characters, including Auntie Studs, to an American audience. She has produced science comics for New Scientist (\\"Life, the Universe and (Almost) Everything\\") and The Independent, as well as illustrations for several books published by the National Museums of Scotland. She describes her art style as not overly cartoonish or caricature, but emotionally realistic. In an interview she stated that she uses photographic reference and tries to get in the mind of each character to accurately portray their emotions on the page. More recently, Charlesworth has shifted to working on graphic novels. She illustrated Sally Heathcote: Suffragette by Mary Talbot, published in 2014. Her illustrations were highly praised by Neel Mukherjee in The Guardian as \\"beautifully executed in black-and-white, with perfectly judged touches of colour.\\" In 2011 she contributed to Blank Slate‚Äôs Nelson, a collaborative graphic novel with 54 British comic artists. Nelson was chosen as The Guardian's graphic novel of the month by Rachel Cooke and one of 2011's best graphic novels by The Times. Charlesworth spent four years working on her autobiographical work Sensible Footwear: A Girl's Guide, which was published in 2019. Charlesworth has also worked as a storyboard artist for shows including Bob the Builder (Hot Animation), Pingu (Hot Animation), and Timmy Time (Aardman Animations). She has created several cards for Cath Tate Cards, run by fellow cartoonist and friend Cath Tate. She created the CD cover for Fast Talk by Kay Grant and Alex Ward. She also produces various forms of 3-D art, including birthday cards, maps, board games, and shadow boxes, featured on her website. Her future plans include a joint comic project with her partner, Dianne, as well as moving into different mediums, including animation.  Personal life  Charlesworth is a lesbian and has stated that she embraced her identity as a dyke in college when she entered a relationship. She has opined that she feels the lesbian community of the time heavily self-policed behavior and look, which prevented her from fully realizing her identity and influenced much of her work. Charlesworth has been politically active in British and Scottish politics and pushes for equal rights. When Clause 28 of the Local Government Act was being pushed in 1988, aiming to ban the promotion of and education about homosexuality by local authorities, including schools, Charlesworth teamed up with Viv Quillin, Cath Jackson, and Cath Tate, three other local cartoonists, to produce a series of postcards to campaign against it. More recently, she has notably been outspoken against Brexit and President Trump, arguing that their popularity represent a backslide for LGBT rights. She has also been involved in many efforts to increase awareness of LGBT history. In 2006 she illustrated a guide for a walking tour of 500 years of Edinburgh‚Äôs LGBT history, published by the LGBT Centre for Health and Wellbeing and Remember When. In the same year she participated in the City of Edinburgh Council's \\"Rainbow City\\" exhibition at the City Art Centre. She also participates in Edinburgh's Loud and Proud choir, which sang at Equal Marriage lobbies of the Scottish Parliament. She currently lives with Dianne, her partner of 13 years, a dog, and a cat in the Borders in Scotland.

He was known for his teaching skill and his authorship of widely used textbooks. His research interests were wide-ranging and involved the characterization of perchloric acid and periodic acid salts. Early life and education Willard was born on June 3, 1881 in Erie, Pennsylvania. His family relocated to Union City, Michigan in 1883 and he spent the rest of his early life there. His father and later his high school teachers encouraged his interest in chemistry, which he pursued as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. He received his A.B. in 1903 and his M.A. in 1905. Meanwhile, he was briefly hired as an instructor of chemistry, but at the encouragement of coworkers he decided to pursue his Ph.D. at Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. in 1909 under the supervision of Theodore William Richards. Academic career After finishing his Ph.D., Willard returned to Michigan to rejoin the faculty; he became a full professor in 1922 and retired from the university, assuming professor emeritus status, in 1951. He was designated the Henry Russel Lecturer in 1948, noted as the university's highest distinction. He was known for his strong teaching skills and continued teaching at a variety of institutions after his retirement. During his tenure at Michigan, Willard wrote several widely used and positively reviewed chemistry textbooks and laboratory course manuals, often with former students as coauthors. He also performed consulting work for local industry throughout his career, serving as the Director of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Laboratories for Detroit's Bureau of Aircraft Production in 1917-18 and as a long-term consultant for the Parker Rust-Proof Company. Willard served as a director of the American Chemical Society from 1934 to 1940 and received the ACS' Fisher Award in Analytical Chemistry in 1951. He was the inaugural recipient of the Anachem Award given by the Association of Analytical Chemists in 1953. Research Willard's research interests focused on analytical chemistry and quantitative analysis of inorganic substances. With student G. Frederick Smith, he was particularly productive in studying perchloric acid and periodic acid salts. In addition, he is credited with important work in determining precise atomic weights of chemical elements such as lithium, silver, and antimony, and with development of metal alloy techniques. Personal life Willard and his wife Margaret had two daughters, Ann and Nancy. Willard was a photography enthusiast and hobbyist who occasionally sold his work. He died in Ann Arbor, Michigan on May 7, 1974. Michigan holds a named professorship in his honor; the current Willard Professor of Chemistry is Robert T. Kennedy.

He was also the head of Los Cuinis, an organization allied to the CJNG. Along with his brother-in-law Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), one of Mexico's most-wanted men, Gonz√°lez Valencia reportedly coordinated international drug trafficking operations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. He was also responsible for managing the financial operations of the CJNG and Los Cuinis. He worked for the Milenio Cartel in the 1990s, and eventually formed part of the original group that founded the CJNG and Los Cuinis in the 2010s. He was arrested on February 28, 2015, in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. The Mexican government is working on extraditing him to the U.S., where he is accused of drug trafficking and money laundering. Prior to Gonz√°lez Valencia's arrest, Los Cuinis was regarded by government sources as one of Mexico's and the world's wealthiest drug trafficking organizations. Early life Abigael Gonz√°lez Valencia was born in Aguililla, Michoac√°n, Mexico on October 18, 1972. His parents were J. Abigael Gonz√°lez Mendoza (father) and Estela Valencia Far√≠as (mother). According to the United States Department of the Treasury, he has an alternative date of birth, October 28, 1979, and has alternative places of birth, Guadalajara, Jalisco, and Apatzing√°n, Michoac√°n. He has other legal names, including \\"Luis √Ångel G√≥mez Flores\\", \\"Abigail Gonz√°lez Valencia\\", \\"Luis √Ångel Gonz√°lez Valencia\\", \\"Jonathan Paul Tak Toledo\\", and \\"Paul Jonathan Tak Toledo\\". His last alternative legal name was the one he used for his Canadian passport, which he obtained through fraudulent methods. According to the Mexican government, the Gonz√°lez Valencia clan was made up of 18 siblings. The males are Abigael, Jos√© Mar√≠a, Arnulfo, Ulises Jovani, Elvis, √âdgar Ed√©n, Mauricio, Gerardo, Jos√© and Luis √Ångel. The females are Rosalinda (also known as Rosal√≠a), Noem√≠, Berenice, Marisa Ivette, Mar√≠a Elena, √ârika and Abiga√≠l. People in their hometown nicknamed the clan \\"Cuinis\\" in reference to a squirrel (spermophilus adocetus) from the area that is known as \\"Cuinique\\". It is common for this squirrel to have over a dozen babies each time the mother gives birth. In the 1980s, he immigrated illegally to the U.S. and settled in California, where he operated a drug distribution ring with Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"). He was working on the behalf of the Milenio Cartel, a criminal group from Jalisco that was originally formed by the Valencia clan. On May 2, 1996, Gonz√°lez Valencia was arrested on drug charges in San Diego, California. He was charged with manufacturing, being in possession, and distributing methamphetamine and cocaine in Fresno and Madera, California. On November 22, 1996, however, the court approved a US$80,000 parole for Gonz√°lez Valencia. He then reached an agreement with the court, where he declared himself guilty of the charges. On January 13, 1997, Gonz√°lez Valencia was released after the fee was paid by four people who identified in court as Miguel Pimentel, A√≠da Pimentel, Ed√©n God√≠nez, and Mar√≠a Od√≠nez. The court ordered him to appear in court on April 28, but Gonz√°lez Valencia fled to Mexico and joined organized crime. Rise to leadership After returning to Mexico, Gonz√°lez Valencia worked for the Milenio Cartel along with his brother-in-law Oseguera Cervantes. Gonz√°lez Valencia helped expand the criminal group's presence throughout the 1990s in several states across Mexico. In the early 2000s, however, the Gulf Cartel joined forces with La Familia Michoacana to fight the Milenio Cartel from its home turf, Michoac√°n. The violent conflict forced the Valencia clan to retreat to Jalisco, where they regrouped. In Jalisco, the Valencia family joined forces with a Sinaloa Cartel bloc headed by Ignacio \\"Nacho\\" Coronel, a high- ranking leader and ally of Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, another Sinaloan drug lord. Under Coronel, Gonz√°lez Valencia and Oseguera Cervantes held leadership positions and helped their criminal group expand to southeastern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas, Campeche, and Yucat√°n. On October 28, 2009, √ìscar Orlando Nava Valencia (alias \\"El Lobo\\"), a high-ranking leader of the Milenio Cartel, was arrested. His brother Juan Carlos (alias \\"El Tigre\\") was arrested the following year on May 6, 2010. Two months later, Coronel was killed in a shootout with the Mexican Army. The leadership voids left from their arrests and/or deaths caused the Milenio Cartel to experience an internal power struggle as the remaining leaders tried to take control of the criminal group. As a result, the Milenio Cartel's divisions split into two. One side was known as La Resistencia; the other was Los Torcidos, which was headed by Oseguera Cervantes and Gonz√°lez Valencia. A war broke out between both groups for the drug smuggling turfs in Jalisco and its surrounding states. Los Torcidos eventually won the war and consolidated their influence in western Mexico. The group then changed its name to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (Spanish: C√°rtel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci√≥n, or CJNG).  Leadership tenure  When the Milenio Cartel ruptured in the 2010s, Gonz√°lez Valencia created the group known as Los Cuinis. It went from a small criminal group to one of Mexico's leading criminal organizations, partly due to its relationship with the CJNG and Oseguera Cervantes. The exact role of Los Cuinis in Mexico's organized crime landscape is not completely understood, however. According to the Department of the Treasury, Los Cuinis is an independent criminal organization and does not form part of the CJNG's subgroups. They alleged that it maintains a close relationship with the CJNG because of Gonz√°lez Valencia's family line with Oseguera Cervantes. The U.S. government alleged that both Gonz√°lez Valencia and Oseguera Cervantes worked together in international drug trafficking operations. On the other hand, several Mexican sources stated that Los Cuinis acted as a financial and money laundering bloc under the CJNG. When he was arrested, sources identified Gonz√°lez Valencia as a \\"plaza boss\\" (regional leader) of the CJNG and top financial operator. One source, citing intelligence reports from the government, stated in 2014 that most accounts consider Oseguera Cervantes the leader of the CJNG. However, it alleged that the CJNG was actually controlled by Los Cuinis and the Valencia clan, specifically Gonz√°lez Valencia. The source also stated that Los Cuinis has an armed branch known as Los Viagras, made up of former members of the Knights Templar Cartel. Another Mexican source stated that Gonz√°lez Valencia was the principal operator of the CJNG and that Oseguera Cervantes was his deputy despite the generally accepted notion of Oseguera Cervantes being the top leader of the CJNG. Gonz√°lez Valencia was able to make the CJNG and Los Cuinis one of Mexico's most profitable organized crime groups. The government estimates that the CJNG has about US$50 billion in total assets. This success was shared with Oseguera Cervantes. Part of Gonz√°lez Valencia's success was due to his understanding of how to engage in illegal business without attracting unwarranted attention from law enforcement and the media. His strategy consisted of disengaging from acts of violence that could bring him or his criminal enterprise under a spotlight. In addition, Gonz√°lez Valencia was successful in establishing a market share in European and Asian drug markets by forging alliances with foreign traffickers, instead of solely focusing on importing narcotics in the U.S. drug market. He acknowledged that importing drugs to the U.S. meant competing with rival criminal groups in Mexico violently. He also established relationships with Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Peruvian drug groups and guerrillas, particularly the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), to provide him with cocaine and assist him in his endeavors overseas. In 2015, a high-profile anonymous official in the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spoke to a Mexican investigative newspaper on the role of Los Cuinis in the international market. The source stated that Los Cuinis was the richest drug trafficking organization in the world. This statement countered the widely perceived notion of the Sinaloa Cartel being the most profitable organized crime from Mexico in terms of net profit. The source attributed Los Cuinis' success to their control of the cocaine and methamphetamine trade in Europe and Asia, since foreign authorities encountered difficulties in stopping the flow of narcotics or seizing the drug proceeds that the Valencia clan receives from the importations. The source also stated that it is difficult to infiltrate the inner circles of Los Cuinis through undercover informants because the Valencia clan is wary of outsiders. Arrest On February 28, 2015, Gonz√°lez Valencia was arrested in a restaurant in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, following a joint operation led by the Federal Police, the National Security Commission (CNS), and the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR). He was arrested with four other people: a Mexican, two Colombians, and a Venezuelan. The arrest was a result of an intensive investigation by the SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency. Prior to his arrest, the investigation led a Mexican court to issue a subpoena, an order that asked for Gonz√°lez Valencia to appear in court to testify against the accusations. He was accused of being a financial operator for the CJNG in Jalisco, managing international drug trafficking shipments to the U.S., and overseeing arms trafficking to Mexico from the U.S. At the scene, investigators seized a grenade, a package with about 1 kg (2.2 lbs) of cocaine, several cellphones, a vehicle, and fake IDs. According to a CNS report, Gonz√°lez Valencia offered law enforcement MXN$50 million to not appear on television or have pictures of him released to the press, but his offer was turned down. Criminal charges In the 2000s, the DEA office in Los Angeles, California, began to investigate Gonz√°lez Valencia and Oseguera Cervantes for their alleged involvement in international drug trafficking through the CJNG and Los Cuinis. In 2000, investigators discovered that Gonz√°lez Valencia was reportedly involved in a US$10 million cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine operation. Five years later, he was accused of using firearms in one or more occasions to facilitate his smuggling operations. In 2007, the DEA discovered that Gonz√°lez Valencia was involved in another international smuggling operations that imported at least 5 kg (11 lb) of cocaine into the U.S. from Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico. That same year, Gonz√°lez Valencia allegedly coordinated a second cocaine shipment from Ecuador to the U.S. that was imported through Mexican territory. In 2009, the DEA discovered again that Gonz√°lez Valencia imported at least 5 kg (11 lb) of cocaine to the U.S. via Ecuador and Mexico. In 2013, he was allegedly involved in two methamphetamine and cocaine shipments respectively from Mexico to the U.S. The following year, however, DEA investigators noticed a radical shift in the modus operandi of the CJNG and Los Cuinis; they discovered that Gonz√°lez Valencia was responsible for coordinating a drug smuggling operation from overseas. The methamphetamine operations extended from Mexico, Australia, and the U.S. This overseas operation was facilitated by Gonz√°lez Valencia's relationship with Chinese gangs that helped introduce the shipment to Oceania. In March 2014, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia indicted Gonz√°lez Valencia through a federal grand jury. The investigation was carried out by the DEA office in Los Angeles. He was charged with a number of crimes, including his alleged participation in leading a Continuing Criminal Enterprise. =Kingpin Act= On April 8, 2015, Gonz√°lez Valencia was sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (also known as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his role in international drug trafficking. As a result, all of his U.S.-based assets, of CJNG and Los Cuinis, or of U.S-based people associated to him or his criminal group, were frozen. The act also prohibited U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions with him. The DEA office in Los Angeles stated that this measure was done as a result of the rapid expansion of the CJNG and Los Cuinis, which had grown to become one of Mexico's leading criminal groups through wealth, drug trafficking, violence, and corruption. On August 19, 2015, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned 15 businesses in Mexico and 6 Mexican nationals under Gonz√°lez Valencia through the Kingpin Act. Among the businesses sanctions was Hotelito Desconocido, a luxurious resort in Tomatl√°n, Jalisco, real estate companies in Guadalajara and Zapopan, and shopping centers in Zapopan and Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo. The individuals sanctions were Gonz√°lez Valencia, his wife Jennifer Beaney Camacho C√°zares, suspected money launderers Fernando Torres Gonz√°lez, Mar√≠a Elena M√°rquez Gallegos, Silvia Romina S√°nchez Carl√°n, Diana Mar√≠a S√°nchez Carl√≥n, and Wendy Dalaithy Amaral Ar√©valo (married to Gonz√°lez Valencia's brother Gerardo). In December 2015, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned another close associate of Gonz√°lez Valencia, Naim Libien Tella, along with 4 other business entities. The companies sanctioned were the Mexico City newspaper Unom√°suno, another daily newspaper based in Toluca, an investment firm in Guadalajara, and an air taxi company. These companies are money laundering fronts and are owned by Gonz√°lez Valencia and/or Libien Tella. On April 4, 2016, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned 7 companies linked to Gonz√°lez Valencia through the Kingpin Act in an attempt to disrupt Los Cuinis' business network. Their companies were alleged to be owned or controlled by Gonz√°lez Valencia, Jeniffer Beaney Camacho C√°zares, Fernando Torres Gonz√°lez, Silvia Romina S√°nchez Carl√°n, and/or Diana Mar√≠a S√°nchez Carl√≥n. These individuals had been sanctioned the year before for managing over businesses owned by Gonz√°lez Valencia. Four of the companies were agricultural firms in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area, one was a tourism agency headquartered in Mexico City, and one was a biomedical technology consulting firm in Guadalajara. On October 27, 2016, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned 9 more individuals linked to the CJNG and Los Cuinis through the Kingpin Act. According to the report, the individuals were sanctioned because they provided material assistance to Gonz√°lez Valencia for his drug trafficking operations. The individuals were Antonio Oseguera Cervantes, Julio Alberto Castillo Rodr√≠guez, businessman Fabi√°n Felipe Vera L√≥pez, attorney Mar√≠a Teresa Quintana Navarro, and five of Gonz√°lez Valencia's siblings: Arnulfo, √âdgar Ed√©n, Elvis, Marisa Ivette, and Noem√≠. This sanction against Gonz√°lez Valencia's family members was an attempt by the U.S. government to disrupt his inner circle. On April 20, 2017, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned two companies linked to Gonz√°lez Valencia that operated as property managers for two shopping centers in Zapopan and Playa del Carmen that were sanctioned in 2015. According to investigators, the two shopping centers were previously managed by two other property management firms that were sanctioned by the OFAC that same year as well. They believe that the Gonz√°lez Valencia created these two new property management firms to circumvent the sanctions imposed and conceal their money laundering interests. On September 14, 2017, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned four Mexican companies and three people linked to Gonz√°lez Valencia, Los Cuinis, and the CJNG. The first entity was a business tied to a sushi restaurant in Guadalajara. The sushi restaurant was a successor entity to another sushi restaurant that was sanctioned by the OFAC in September 2015 for being a front for the CJNG. The owners of the entity tied to the successor sushi restaurant were Alfonso Corona Romero (alias \\"Chef Poncho Corona\\") and √âdgar Alfonso Corona Robles (alias \\"Ponchito Corona\\"), father and son. Both of them were sanctioned and accused of being front persons for Los Cuinis and the CJNG. Other business entities sanctioned were two cake businesses in Guadalajara; these shop were co-located in the same shopping center that was sanctioned by the OFAC in August 2015. Gonz√°lez Valencia's wife manages Camacho C√°zares the first cake shop along with Salime Abouzaid El Bayeh. Abouzaid El Bayeh worked at the first sushi restaurant, was involved with Unom√°suno, and owns a Guadalajara pharmaceutical distributor and the two cake shops. Imprisonment On March 3, 2015, federal judge Vicente Antonio Berm√∫dez Zacar√≠as approved Gonz√°lez Valencia's 40-day preventative detention. On April 12, the detention time ran out and the PGR transferred him to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as \\"Altiplano\\"), a maximum- security prison in Almoloya de Ju√°rez, State of Mexico. The PGR confirmed that they were working with a State of Mexico court to formalize an extradition process and send Gonz√°lez Valencia to the U.S., where he is wanted for drug trafficking. Gonz√°lez Valencia was kept in prison under a temporary status and was not charged with crimes in Mexico because the PGR wanted to extradite him quickly. On June 4, 2018, federal judge Juan Mateo Brieba de Castro from State of Mexico rejected a motion to move Gonz√°lez Valencia from Altiplano to another prison in Mexico. The request to move him to another jail was done by a prison administration committee, but Gonz√°lez Valencia appealed the move and had it approved by a court under the rationale that the move put his personal integrity at risk. In addition to the prison transfer, the court agreed to review the motion he made against his possible extradition to the U.S. On August 29, this motion was ignored and he was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 14 (also known as \\"CPS Durango\\"), a maximum- security prison in G√≥mez Palacio, Durango. complained about the transfer and stated that the prison was not giving him adequate healthcare conditions and was keeping him segregated from the rest of the prison population. He asked a court to transfer him back to Altiplano because he stated that he feared for his life. His defense explained that most of the convicts in CPS Durango were charged with kidnapping, a high-impact crime in Mexico. On February 15, 2019, Gonz√°lez Valencia was transferred to Reclusorio Norte, a penitentiary in Mexico City. His transfer caused tensions after several prison guards complained to their management about receiving death threats and seeing vehicles with gunmen outside the prison. The guards asked their management to change the area of the prison their work in and their work schedules. Under fears of a prison escape, authorities transferred Gonz√°lez Valencia back to Altiplano on 27 July. A week earlier, a video circulated on social media that the CJNG was planning to help Gonz√°lez Valencia escape from prison. Gonz√°lez Valencia's defense stated that authorities violated a writ of amparo he issued days earlier, which prevented Gonz√°lez Valencia from being transferred from Reclusorio Norte. = Extradition process = On April 16, 2015, Gonz√°lez Valencia's defense issued a writ of amparo to prevent the speedy extradition of their client. A judge agreed to shut down the possibility for a speedy extradition and granted Gonz√°lez Valencia the opportunity to have an extradition trial. On October 11, a federal court in Mexico City stated Gonz√°lez Valencia was to be extradited, but left it up to Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (SRE). On December 21, 2016, Gonz√°lez Valencia was approved for extradition, but his defense issued another writ of amparo. On March 14, 2017, SRE issued a communiqu√© where it approved the extradition, but cited that they would have to wait until the writ of amparo case was solved to extradite him. On January 19, 2019, a tribunal court approved Gonz√°lez Valencia's writ of amparo from December 2016, effectively stopping any extradition efforts against him. In order to extradite him to the U.S., the plaintiff would have to issue a new request and have it be validated by the court. The court made this decision because the SRE did not mention the charges Gonz√°lez Valencia was facing in Mexico in the extradition request, and was told that if they were to request a new process, they would have to include the charges in Mexico. The court also asked the SRE to analyze the charges he faces in Mexico and decide upon that if an extradition to the U.S. was required. His defense had argued that authorities violated the legal rights of Gonz√°lez Valencia and that his extradition to the U.S. was unconstitutional, but the court stated the previous extradition requests did not violate his rights and were constitutional.

The game tasks players with building a city one plot of land at a time, with zoning and pixelated buildings that vaguely resemble previous games from the developer, such as Tiny Tower or Disco Zoo. Bit City also includes some features similar to Egg, Inc such as an upgrade shop and the ability to prestige. The game's initial reception has been overwhelmingly positive, with the game reaching the #1 spot for free games on App Store. , the ratings for Bit City are 4.5 stars on the App Store and 4.3 on the Google Play Store.  Gameplay  A screenshot of Bit City The player is tasked with building a city with the goal of having the city reach a certain population. The city has a predetermined number of plots which can be small or large plots. When a player decides to buy a plot they are prompted to pick one of the three \\"zones\\", Residential, Business, or Service. Once a plot is built on, it will add 1000 residents per 1x1 square to the city and will provide a certain number of coins to the player per second. Cars can also be bought and will sometimes have a coin bonus on them which, when clicked, gives the player coins or will have bux bonus (which when tapped gives the player bux). Later in the game, boats and planes can be bought and will also sometimes give a coin bonus. Each city also has a government building which allows the player to upgrade certain aspects of their city. Upgrades can apply only to the player's current city or can be permanent (applies even when the player prestiges or moves on to the next city). The player can also prestige which sends them back to the first city with a certain number of Keys (each gives a 1% permanent earnings boost). However, the player keeps all of their bux and all of the game (permanent) upgrades the player has made.  Reception  GameZebo gave Bit City a 4.5/5 star rating, noting the \\"upbeat, jazzy soundtrack\\", the \\"huge selection of building types\\", calling it a \\"solid, highly addictive game that is as close to as perfect a blend of clicker and city builder as you‚Äôre likely to find anywhere\\". 148Apps gave an overall rating of 3/5 stars, praising the user interface and sound track, but stating \\"in 2017, it feels really uninspired\\", and \\"it doesn't really offer anything new to the genre\\". Pocket Gamer gave 6 out of 10 saying the game was \\"an empty clicker disguised as SimCity\\".

The episode was written by Thomas Ian Griffith and was directed by series regular David Giuntoli, making his directional debut. In the episode, Nick decides that in order to stop Renard, he needs to become him to finally destroy what he was looking for. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised Giuntoli's direction and the character development. Plot Opening quote: \\"You will face yourself again in a moment of terror...\\" Nick (David Giuntoli), Hank (Russell Hornsby), Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), Eve (Bitsie Tulloch), Wu (Reggie Lee) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) discuss their next move against Renard (Sasha Roiz), who is also demanding Hank's and Wu's resignations. The next day, Hank and Wu present their resignation letters to Renard, although Wu nearly loses control of his form. Nick decides to stop Renard from his inauguration as mayor by asking Eve to get him the witch's hat so he can transform into Renard. Renard is visited by Jeremiah (M. Ben Newman), who is angry after discovering that he had an affair with Rachel and is also a suspect in her murder and gives him 24 hours to give him money to not reveal the information. Renard then has a L√∂wen, Lt. Grossante (Chris McKenna), kill Jeremiah but the killing reminds him of him murdering Meisner (Damien Puckler). Renard then has Grossante promoted as captain. Adalind (Claire Coffee) retrieves hair from Renard's clothes and gives it to Monroe, who barely escapes the house when Renard arrives early. In the spice shop, Nick begins to inhale from the potion and after a painful progress, he becomes Renard. Adalind distracts Renard from attending his inauguration speech and Renard watches as Nick impersonating him, announces his resignation from the mayor office and states that Nick was part of an undercover investigation to bring \\"the real killer\\" to justice, planning to resume his career as police captain. After the speech, Nick (still as Renard) and Hank arrive at the precinct to retrieve items from him. Nick is confronted by Grossante, who is angry that he broke his deal and he will pay for it. The real Renard arrives and briefly confronts Nick before he leaves. Renard then arranges a meeting with Nick on his loft. The gang is confused as to why Nick is still Renard and find that due to his Grimm powers, he may be Renard forever. Adalind arrives with Diana (Hannah R. Lloyd) and Kelly and works on another potion to reverse the shift. Nick and Renard fight in the roof but as they have the same powers, none can beat the other. Nick proposes to frame Bonaparte for the attack in the North station and that his involvement was the cause of his resignation. Renard accepts and gives Nick, Hank and Wu their old jobs. He also adds that he will raise Diana and threatens that something will happen if he dies and if he finds another shiftier like him, the deal will end. Nick returns to the spice shop but finds that no potion has been discovered. Diana arrives and after seeing that he isn't her dad, she uses her powers to push him away, making him go back to his normal body. Renard returns to his house and discovers someone sitting on the couch, waiting for him. He stares in shock when he finds Meisner (Damien Puckler) there, telling him that \\"he chose the wrong side\\". Production =Development= On July 2016, it was announced that the third episode of the season would be called \\"Oh Captain, My Captain\\" and was to be written by Thomas Ian Griffith and directed by series regular David Giuntoli. The episode marks David Giuntoli's directional debut in the series. The episode was the first episode of the season to be filmed but it was the third to be released so as to give time for Giuntoli to prepare. As Giuntoli was directing the episode, he didn't appear in most of the episode but his character appeared throughout a personification. He commented that \\"Everybody was nervous about me directing because I'm a goofball on the set and don't have a long attention span. But I was ready. I did a ton of homework. I didn't want to let anybody down. It was the best time I've ever had professionally ‚Äî without doubt and without exception. If you had put me in an MRI machine, you would have seen my entire brain light up!\\" On the last day of shooting, the cast and crew threw a party for Giuntoli, giving him also a clapper board with his name written on it. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 4.29 million people, earning a 0.8/3 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking second on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind 20/20, a rerun of Shark Tank, Dr. Ken, Hawaii Five-0, Blue Bloods, and Last Man Standing. This was a massive slight increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.24 million viewers with a 0.8/3. This means that 0.8 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With DVR factoring in, the finale was watched by 6.21 million viewers and had a 1.4 ratings share in the 18-49 demographics. =Critical reviews= \\"Oh Captain, My Captain\\" received enormous praise. Les Chappell from The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"A\\" rating and wrote, \\"'Oh Captain, My Captain' is an episode that clears up the vast majority of those concerns, because all of that's present. It's easily the best episode of season six and a contender for one of the show's top ten, finding a way to both get our characters out of the hole they're in and break up the bleakness with some body-swap levity. It's an encouraging step for the show's final act, one that proves even after 112 episodes it still has a way to surprise us.\\" Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.4 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Oh, the sweet taste of revenge. Nick finally got some long-delayed payback, and Renard got no less than he deserved in Grimm Season 6 Episode 3. Dear me, but revenge is a dish best served cold. And boy was it satisfying to see Renard's schemes brought to nothing by one brief impersonation!\\" Lindi Smith from EW gave the episode an \\"A\\" rating and wrote, \\"Okay, I cannot emphasize enough how much pure enjoyment 'Oh Captain, My Captain' provides. Not only did it move the plot along ‚Äî Nick's no longer a fugitive, the action can refocus on police matters, Adalind's free of Renard's clutches ‚Äî but it offered some pitch-perfect light moments, too. Let's hope this momentum continues as the show returns to its monster-of-the-week roots.\\" TV.com, wrote, \\"Overall, 'My Captain' wasn't a romp or a huge comedy episode. But it seemed a tad more light-hearted than the last two weeks. Not as much as, say, 'The Grimm Who Stole Christmas.' And even with Jeremiah Rogers getting brutally murdered. So long, M. Ben Rogers! But there were some elements of farce going on. The bit with Monroe panicking and hiding in Renard's closet, and Adalind's over-the-top attempts to keep Renard there, seemed a bit like a French bedroom farce.\\" Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, \\"Who doesn't love a bit of body swap fun and games? Presumably that's what the writers were thinking when they penned Captain, My Captain, where they neatly find a way to get Nick out of the corner they have painted him into.\\" References External links Grimm (season 6) episodes 2017 American television episodes ","title":"Oh Captain, My Captain"},{"id":"53508803","text":"Nse Bassey Ekpenyong (born 1964 in Oron, Akwa Ibom) is a Nigerian politician and member of the Nigerian National Assembly.

The flight was operated by Air Cara√Øbes, a Caribbean regional airline, using a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter. On 24 March 2001, during an approach to Saint Barth√©lemy Airport, the DHC-6 Twin Otter banked steeply to the left and crashed onto a house, killing all 19 passengers and crew on board. One person on the ground was also killed in the explosions that followed. The crash was the third deadliest plane crash in Guadeloupe, behind Air France Flight 212 and Air France Flight 117, and was the 11th deadliest involving a Twin Otter. Investigation by the French Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile (or BEA) concluded that the cause of the crash was due to an error by the flight crew in managing the plane's thrust lever. During its final approach to Saint Barth√©lemy, the crew caused one of the aircraft's engines to reverse by moving the thrust lever back to the \\"beta\\" range, creating a thrust asymmetry which caused the aircraft to bank steeply to the left and crash. According to the BEA, this was the first fatal accident in the Twin Otter whereby an accidental thrust selection caused a propeller to enter the Beta range. The investigation was hampered by the lack of a flight recorder on the plane. After the crash, the BEA made a mandatory recommendation to equip every transport plane with at least one flight recorder. Flight =Take-off and approach= Flight 1501 took off from Princess Juliana International Airport at 4:00 pm local time, using a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan, and was expected to land in Saint Barth√©lemy at 4:15 pm. The distance between Saint Martin and Saint Barth√©lemy is approximately . The weather was reported as good, with calm winds and very good visibility. The flight entered its cruise altitude of and the crew reported passing the \\"Pain de Sucre\\" waypoint for a final approach to runway 10 of Gustaf III Airport in the last transmission from Flight 1501. =Crash= While flying above the western slope of La Tourmente Pass, the aircraft suddenly banked steeply to the left. Numerous eyewitnesses including an Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS) worker claimed that Flight 1501 then rapidly lost altitude and crashed onto a house, with a massive explosion following immediately after impact. Emergency services quickly arrived to the scene and cordoned off the area. All 19 people on board were killed instantly in the crash and an elderly man, identified as Augustin Questel, who lived in the house with his wife, died from the subsequent fire and explosion. His wife was alive but slightly injured and was taken to hospital. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter, popular among regional airlines operating short routes. Registered in France as F-OGES (MSN 254), the aircraft was equipped with two Pratt & Whitney Canada engines driving Hartzell propellers. It entered into service with Air Guadeloupe in 1970, was subsequently sold to Air Cara√Øbes and had accumulated more than 35,000 flying hours in 90,000 flight cycles. Passengers and crew According to Air Cara√Øbes CEO Philippe Chevallier and the company's local manager, most of the passengers were French tourists, 15 French residents of Paris, two local residents of Saint Barth√©lemy and one American. One of the crew members was a French national while other's nationality was not revealed. Multiple reports stated that one Dutch woman and two Belgians were also on board. The American was also reported to have dual nationality. The pilot flying obtained his commercial pilot license on 18 June 1987 and Instrument Rating on 3 November 1987. He obtained DHC-6 type rating on 28 November 1988 and was subsequently hired as a pilot by Air Guadeloupe and later transferred to Air Cara√Øbes. The Captain had acquired a total flying hours of 9,864 hours, of which 5,000 hours were on Twin Otters. He was later identified by an Air Cara√Øbes' official as Jean-Paul Jerpan. The co-pilot obtained his Twin Otter type rating on 21 December 2000, having had previous professional experience as a flight engineer in the French Air Force. According to the investigators, he was employed on a short-term contract, in which he was supposed to join another airline as a flight engineer. He had acquired a total flying hours of 670 hours of which 15 of them were on the DHC-6. Investigation As the crash occurred within the French territory, the BEA was responsible for the investigation. The BEA sent two field investigators to the crash site and later sent four investigators to Pointe-√†-Pitre on 25 March. As the aircraft was manufactured in Canada, the Canadian TSB joined the investigation with the assistance from Bombardier and Pratt and Whitney Canada. The American NTSB also joined the investigation and sent a representative. According to Chevallier the aircraft was not equipped with a black box, and thus investigators had to rely on observations of air traffic controller recordings, eyewitnesses, wreckage observation and their best guess on what might have happened on Flight 1501. Soon after the crash, airport officials claimed it was caused by mechanical failure. One witness stated that he heard an engine \\"sputtering\\" before the aircraft slammed onto the house. The Gustaf III Airport, which is surrounded by mountainous terrain, requires pilots to obtain a special certificate to land. The western approach to Saint Barth√©lemy Airport crosses the Col de la Tourmente just before the runway, requiring pilots to have special certification to land there. Aircraft approaching the runway must make a steep descent and fly low over houses before landing, with no night flights and all aircraft to be equipped with radio. During the first phase of the investigation, investigators inspected the wreckage of the plane. Initial examination revealed that there were no signs of abnormalities with the plane's controls. Inspection of the plane's propellers also revealed that both propellers were delivering significant power during the crash. Due to the severity of the impact, investigators could not take a fuel sample from the wreckage. During their inspection they found two video cameras at the crash site. Closer observation of the plane's propellers revealed that the left propeller had a pitch setting of at least 20.4¬∞, that is to say a pitch above flight idle. The right propeller had a different pitch setting for each of the blades, settings likely due to less-violent secondary impacts to the powerplant at the moment of impact. Consequently, the values noted were unusable. =Use of video footage in the investigation= The recovery of video from the crash site had the potential to significantly assist the investigation. One of the two video cameras was too badly damaged by the impact to provide a recoverable recording. However, the second was less damaged and its footage was recovered except for some portions including that adjacent to the recording head. This video had been taken by a passenger on Flight 1501 filming through a left-side window in the few minutes before the accident. Investigators reviewed the three main sequences of the flight: initial climb, cruise and approach. Later, investigators analysed the video more thoroughly to examine the operation of both propeller visually and through the sound recorded on the tape. During Flight 1501's initial climb and cruise there were no abnormalities in the sound of the propeller. However, investigators detected an abnormality during the approach phase, with audible fluctuations indicating that both propellers were \\"not synchronized\\". =Flights observation and footage comparison= Investigators then recorded new video footage, using the same model of video camera as the one recovered, during a recreation of the flight to evaluate the track, engine parameters and the pilot's hand positions. The thrust lever of the DHC-6 was located on the cockpit ceiling and investigators wanted to determine if the pilot's hand position may have contributed to the crash. It was revealed that, when the pilot flying was seated on the left, his right forearm is located in the extended vertical axis of the levers, a position which is favorable to symmetric handling. However, when the pilot flying is seated in the right seat, his left forearm is not vertical; he stretches slightly to the left and is thus not aligned with the axis of the levers, this \\"angle\\" being compensated by wrist movement. In addition, if the pilot flying was seated on the right, he would move the thrust lever with a different timing, used short successive and separate movements on the engine No. 1 lever and then on the engine No. 2 lever, with the hand always remaining in contact with both levers. A comparison was made by investigators to confirm the position of Flight 1501. An analysis of the engine parameters also showed that both engines were functioning normally from take-off until the last image of the video, recorded just minutes before the accident. Towards the end of the film, the spectral analysis showed an increase in the propeller speed. This variation seems to correspond to the beginning of the descent towards the airport, at the moment when the crew selected the propellers' full low pitch position. =Thrust lever beta= In the DHC-6, there is a mode called as \\"beta\\" in which the crew can control the propeller pitch directly. There are two beta ranges. The first is from + 17¬∞ to + 11¬∞, called \\"approach beta\\" and permitted in flight. In this range the propellers are tractive. The second range runs from + 11¬∞ to ‚àí 15¬∞, called \\"reverse beta\\" and prohibited in flight. In this range, the propellers act as brakes, two different sub-ranges being identifiable: ground idle and traction reversal. If the reverse beta is engaged in mid-air, according to the manufacturer, this would greatly increase aerodynamic drag and cause rapid deceleration. As a consequence, the plane would lose lift. The manufacturer had known about this risk since 1979 and had started to implement several preventive measures. They had warned pilots about the risk in all flight manuals. They had installed a mechanical stop to try to prevent a pilot accidentally causing a plane to enter the beta range. An alarm had also been installed by the manufacturer. =Investigators' hypotheses= Investigators made several hypotheses about Flight 1501. Mechanical failure, terrorism, bird strike and weather-related factors were quickly ruled out. They then focused their attention on two strong hypotheses. The first hypothesis was that the pilot flying was the captain and that he had accidentally selected the reverse beta range for the propellers with the intention of losing energy to correct the airspeed, regain the descent path or shorten the landing as much as possible, as the reverse beta mode acted as a powerful brake. During that time, a thrust asymmetry occurred, which could have caused an undesirable behavior or caused the plane to reach its desired speed. In either case, it would be necessary at that moment to deselect the reverse beta range. Then the pilot would have pushed the levers energetically back to their normal use range by increasing thrust, which would explain the change in engine noise. Asymmetry in the power levers' movement, or in the operation of the propeller mechanism, or even in the position of the propeller levers, would then have led to asymmetry between the engines to an extent that would have caused a violent yaw movement, inducing a sharp roll to the left, possibly associated with a stall of the left wing and then a dive. The pilot would not have been able to regain control of the aircraft, which would have been both too slow and too near the ground at that moment. This hypothesis was supported by testimonies from numerous eyewitnesses and routine in-flight procedure violations in the airport. The second one was that the pilot flying was the co-pilot. One day before the crash the co-pilot had performed a take- off from Saint Barth√©lemy. The captain, who was more experienced than the co- pilot, ordered the co-pilot to conduct the approach, without himself taking over radio communications with the tower. The co-pilot was seated on the right, where it was not easy to control the thrust lever. According to the investigators neither hypothesis could be excluded as there were no flight recorders to provide confirmation. Investigators did state they believed that the first hypothesis was far more probable, based on testimonies of eyewitnesses, and concluded that the most probable cause of the crash was due to the selection of the reverse beta range. =Conclusion= Investigators then made the conclusion of the cause of the crash: =The absence of flight recorder= The investigation was hampered due to the absence of a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder. BEA made a statement: After the crash, the BEA made mandatory recommendations to the Directorate General for Civil Aviation and the Joint Aviation Authorities to equip every public transport plane authorized to carry more than nine passengers and whose maximum certified take-off weight is less than or equal to 5,700 kg, with at least one flight recorder. The BEA stated that the recommendation should be implemented as soon as possible and should also apply to cargo planes and helicopters. Aftermath =Immediate response= The prefect of Guadeloupe immediately went to the scene to organize relief, including gendarmerie reinforcements, firemen and teams of psychologists. French President Jacques Chirac sent a message of condolences to the families of the victims. On 25 March, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and Foreign Secretary Christian Paul also expressed their \\"emotion\\" and \\"deep sadness\\" to the families of the victims. A prayer service was held in Gustavia, the island's most important town, on 25 March. Public opinion in Saint Barth√©lemy supported Mayor Bruno Magras's declaration of Monday 26 March as a day of official mourning for the crash victims. Schools, public services and most businesses were closed. Air Cara√Øbes General Manager Philippe Chevallier announced that the airline would fly relatives of the victims to the crash site. =Lawsuit= A hearing on the crash was opened at the Correctional Court of Basse-Terre in Guadeloupe on 29 June 2006 and lasted two days. The case stated that there were alleged criminal offences. Richard Degryse, responsible for Air Cara√Øbes' training at the time of the events, was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Jean-Paul Dubreuil, Air Cara√Øbes' president, was also charged with manslaughter. Twenty- one members of the Association of Families of Victims, ADFV, chaired by Karine Paris, arrived in Guadeloupe along with three lawyers engaged by the National Federation of Victims of Collective Accidents. Other civil parties also attended the trial, including members of the Questel family. On 15 September 2006, Richard Degryse was convicted of involuntary homicide and sentenced to a two-year prohibition from any work involving directing flight operations. The sentence was much lower than the prosecutor's demand for a two-year suspended prison sentence with a five-year ban. Subsequently, the airline, Air Cara√Øbes, was also found guilty and fined 250,000 euros. The court determined that the operations manager and the company knew of the risks they had created by failing to comply with the training flight requirement for a pilot taking control of an aircraft after a break of more than 90 days. The court also received representations from more than 70 parties whose interests were examined during a civil lawsuit, held on 22 December at the tribunal of Basse- Terre.

Louisa Eva Gould (1891‚Äì1945) was a British shopkeeper and a member of the British resistance movement in the Channel Islands during World War II. From 1942 until her arrest in 1944, Gould sheltered an escaped Soviet slave worker known as Feodor Polycarpovitch Burriy on the island of Jersey. Following a trial, she was sent to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp where she was gassed to death in 1945. In 2010 she was posthumously named a British Hero of the Holocaust. Life Gould was born Louisa Eva Gould in St Ouen, Jersey, on 7 October 1891. For most of her life she ran a grocery store at La Fontaine, Millais in St Ouen. Gould had two sons, Ralph and Edward, both of whom enlisted in the British armed forces during World War II. Edward, an officer in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, was killed in action in 1941. Resistance During the World War II occupation of the Channel Islands, the Nazis used captured Russian soldiers as slave workers. Beginning in late 1942, Gould hid Fyodr Polycarpovitch Burriy, an escaped Soviet slave and former pilot who had been captured after his aircraft had been shot down. Aware of the severe penalties for harbouring enemies of the Germans, Gould said simply \\"I have to do something for another mother's son.\\" Gould hid Burriy inside her St. Ouen home for 18 months. Arrest, trial and death A neighbour later reported that Gould was harbouring Burriy, who she called \\"Bill\\". In June 1944, the German forces searched her house. While they did not find Burriy, they found a scrap of paper that had been used as a Christmas gift tag, addressed to Burriy, and a Russian-English dictionary that he had used for practising his English. Burriy managed to avoid capture during the search and until the end of the war. Gould was arrested by the Nazis and charged. At trial she was sentenced to two years in prison for harbouring Burriy, and for the possession of a radio which she had kept despite regulations requiring her to hand it in. Arrested with her were her brother Harold Le Druillenec, and her sister Ivy Forster. Following her trial, Gould was sent to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Her brother Harold Le Druillenec was sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, and would be one of only two British survivors. Louisa Gould was gassed to death in February 1945 at Ravensbr√ºck. A plaque in Saint Ouen, Jersey, Jersey commemorates Louisa Gould's death. Recognition In 1995 a memorial plaque was unveiled in St Ouen, Jersey; Burriy, the former Russian slave, attended its unveiling. In 2010 she was posthumously named a British Hero of the Holocaust.https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/gordon-brown-honours-british- holocaust-heroes-1.14398 Gould's story is depicted in the 2017 film Another Mother's Son by Jenny Seagrove.

She has published extensively on Asian cultural practices and has written plays incorporating elements of traditional Japanese drama. Currently Professor Emeritus at UCLA, Sorgenfrei continues her creative work as a playwright.  Education  Her interest in Asian theatre, particularly in relation to Japan, was inspired by a contemporary French theatre class she attended under Leonard Pronko in Pomona College. She later explained, the professor \\"spent a lot of time explicating the ways that French theatre had been influenced by Asian performance... What I liked was theatrical theatre‚Äîso Japanese theatre was the natural thing.\\" She extended her studies in Japanese theatre by moving to the International Christian University in Mitaka, Japan where she received language training and exposure to Japanese theatre. As a result of the \\"Zenky≈çt≈ç\\" student uprisings in 1968, which closed universities nationwide, she spent five months exploring theatre throughout Asia. She returned to Pomona College and received her BA in 1970. She received her MA in playwriting four years later from the University of California, Santa Barbara where she also received her doctorate in 1978.  Career  Sorgenfrei was a professor at UCLA from 1980 to 2011, where she served as both a scholar and creative artist. She wrote plays, which reflected her interest in relationships between contemporary Japanese and Western theatre. In 1975, she wrote Medea: A Noh Cycle Based on Greek Myth, which served as a hybrid envisioning of Euripides' Medea in the style of a Westernized, Japanese Noh. She incorporated kabuki and Greek theatre in Fireplay: The Legend of Prometheus, which her professor Leonard Pronko directed in 1987. Inspired by Moli√®re's Tartuffe, she wrote The Impostor in 1992, which integrated two different comedic styles: Japanese kyogen and commedia dell'arte. In 1997, she wrote Blood Wine, Blood Wedding, which functioned as tribute to Federico Garcia Lorca's Blood Wedding and Chikamatsu Monzaemon's Love Suicides at Sonezaki; integrating both theatrical styles of Spanish flamenco and Japanese kabuki into the play's performance. Sorgenfrei's plays draw inspiration from the western canon ‚Äî often serving as reinterpretations of classics with a combination of Japanese plays and performance styles. Her fusion of performance styles and contemporary theatre improves understanding of plays by offering an intercultural East/West mix. In retelling Medea through a Noh cycle, her work reaches out to other cultural audiences and challenges western social norms. As theatre historian Helene Foley has argued, Medea: A Noh Cycle Based on Greek Myth \\"turn[s] to a reimagined Japanese tradition to empower a more aggressive feminist assault on patriarchal culture.\\" Sorgenfrei's play achieves the desired effect by portraying the story of a powerful female protagonist through a performance style in which traditionally only Japanese men participated. Her reinterpretation subverts Athen's and Japan's patriarchal theatre while also offering an analytical amalgamation of cultures, which reflects the creative and academic possibilities of theatre. In 2015, she showcased her most recent play Ghost Light: The Haunting at the Barrow Group Theater in New York. The play was produced as an equity showcasing by La Luna Productions‚Äîa feminist theatre company she cofounded to promote empowering stories through kabuki performance. The company carries her signature splicing of Japanese theatre with American theatrical conventions. Ghost Light draws inspiration from Macbeth and the kabuki play Yatuya Ghost Stories, which both carry plots of treachery and vengeance. In a review describing the play's performance, Yatsunov comments that the play, \\"crafts a unique style with influences beyond kabuki and Shakespeare, finding well placed touches of TV-crime-drama and old- timey vaudeville.\\" In other words, Sorgenfrei's script allows for a playful interpretation, which blends traditional American performance with kabuki performance and defines its own genre.  Publications  Described as the \\"founding mother\\" of Asian theatre studies, Sorgenfrei remains an influential scholar in the field of Japanese theatrical studies. Published in 2005, Unspeakable Acts: the avant-garde theatre of Terayama Shuji and Postwar Japan remains one of her most accredited academic studies. It discusses the work of Sh≈´ji Terayama, who was a poet, playwright, stage director, photographer, filmmaker, novelist and critic that heavily influenced the avant-garde movement in 60's and 70's Japan. Through an in-depth analysis of his influences, style, and his major works, Sorgenfrei offers an introduction to Terayama and an understanding of contemporary Japanese theatre for the Western perspective. Within the second half of her publication, she also provides translations of three of his plays as well as a compilation of his writings on theatre. It exists as an authoritative academic source on Terayama with a selection of the few English translations of his works. Originally published in 2006, Theatre Histories: An Introduction is another renowned academic publication, which provides an insight into intercultural performance and theatre as it discusses the history of theatre throughout the world. She co- authored the publication with Bruce McConachie, Gary Jay Williams, and Phillip Zarilli. Jortner states that the text remains a unique presentation of world theatre as it \\"gives an equal amount of text to non-Western... performance and places it in an equal historical and cultural context\\" as the Western canon in a non-chronological order. The original publication received such a popular reception that it had been edited and published twice afterwards. Its most recent edition was released in 2016. It lays testament to Sorgenfrei's relevance within current intercultural theatre studies.

Murray was a drapers shop in Adelaide founded by brothers David Murray (28 December 1829 ‚Äì 6 January 1907) and William Mackintosh Murray (c. 1831 ‚Äì 25 November 1920), which became the wholesale draper D. & W. Murray Limited, with warehouses in three States, then Goode, Durrant & Murray second in importance only to G. & R. Wills. History The Murray brothers were born in Anstruther, Fife, Scotland, sons of William Murray. They had some experience in the retail and wholesale drapery trade, which included supplying retailers in the young colony of South Australia. In early 1853 the brothers arrived in Adelaide, and began operating a retail drapery store in what had been H. D. Hilton's printing shop, King William Street, \\"a few doors from Hindley Street\\". with access on Gilbert Place. By 1858 they had moved to larger premises at \\"Cohen's Corner\\" (later T & G Building), on the south corner of King William and Grenfell streets, previously \\"Prince's crockery shop\\". They needed a warehouse to support their burgeoning wholesale trade, so took over the adjoining King William Street building, which had been Monteith & Muirhead's wheat store until that company was found insolvent in 1860. It was not long before two storeys were added to the building, for which they ran foul of the Council, as the walls were not thick as their regulations stipulated. The company had two arms: wholesale and retail. Seeing their strengths and opportunities lay in the wholesale, they sold their retail business in February 1862 to James Whiting. In May 1866 William Murray left for England to take over their London office, whose premises were in Fenchurch Building, the Barbican, then from 1890 at 28 Finsbury Street. Apart from a few short visits he never returned to Australia. They had a store on Grenfell Street, near King William Street, which in 1872 became a suite of offices for Francis Clark and Sons and the basement a wine cellar for the related firm of Clark & Crompton. Royal Exchange, King William Street between Grenfell and Pirie Streets In April 1867 they took over the lease on Levi & Watt's newly built warehouse at 96 King William Street (previously the site of Coglin's woodyard, and now the Commonwealth Bank ). The property had been passed in at auction, and purchased by Philip Santo for an English investor. By September the move had been effected and their old building taken over by auctioneer Louis Barnard. In February 1868 a serious fire destroyed most of the stock, but prompt action by the hose units prevented it spreading to the Napoleon Bonaparte Hotel adjacent. :In 1884 they sold the hundred-year lease to the Commercial Bank of South Australia which however failed in February 1886, and the lease was purchased by John Robb of Melbourne, who had it renovated as the Royal Exchange, with rooms for Stock Exchange of Adelaide, the Stock Exchange of South Australia and the Commercial Stock Exchange of Adelaide. The architects were Wright, Reed & Beaver. :A problem arose with crowds of speculators blocking the entrance; removing the veranda failed to solve the problem, so Robb reopened the old Pirie Street exchange (which he also owned). By July 1891 there were no stock exchanges at the Royal Exchange building. ::See also: Green's Exchange for more information on Adelaide's stock exchanges They built a new five-storey warehouse in Gawler Place; opened February 1886 Behind this building they had a box store on the site of the present stock exchange building on McHenry Street. This was left to David Murray by landlord Dr. George Louis John McHenry (18 September 1834 ‚Äì 9 May 1890), by the terms of his Will, which left his properties acre lots 168 (west of Freeman Street/Gawler Place) and 169 (next west) to their respective tenants. The Adelaide Boot Factory was founded by Murray on Park Terrace (now Greenhill Road) North Unley around 1870 and was still producing footwear at the same location for Goode Durrant & Murray in 1954. In April 1897 the company became D. & W. Murray Limited, with a paid-up capital of ¬£500,000 (perhaps $1,000 million in today's money). By 1913 the company had warehouses in Adelaide, London, Melbourne, Brisbane (Creek and Elizabeth Streets), Townsville (Sturt Street), Perth (Murray and Barrack Streets), Hobart (Murray Street), Launceston (Patterson Street), and Sydney (Market and York Streets). In 1934 Goode, Durrant & Co.. Ltd., acquired the South Australian, West Australian, and Broken Hill businesses of D. & W. Murray Ltd., and the former company's name was changed to Goode, Durrant & Murray, Ltd. D. & W. Murray Ltd. continued to operate in London and other States. The Gawler Place warehouse was left vacant until occupied rent-free by the Red Cross Society from 1940 \\"for the duration of the War\\", when up to 200 volunteers were engaged on the Society's work, until 1946 when the building was sold to Savery's Pianos, and the Red Cross purchased Matthew Goode & Co.'s old warehouse at Stephens place for its new headquarters.

Early life  Edith Holt Whetham was born on 27 December 1911, the daughter of William Cecil Dampier Whetham, a Cambridge-educated scientist and agricultural academic, and his wife Catherine Durning Holt, a daughter of Liverpool merchant Robert Durning Holt who had also pursued an education at Cambridge. She had one brother and four sisters, including Margaret Anderson (indexer). Whetham's family owned a small manor house in Devon, and also inherited a small estate in Hilfield, Dorset where they spent family vacations. Whetham suffered from hearing loss after a fall when she was an infant. She was educated at home and later at Downe House School near Newbury. In 1930, she enrolled in Newnham College, where her mother had studied. She took classes in economics, attending the lectures of John Maynard Keynes. Although she passed her degree examinations, it was not until 1998 that she was conferred with her full degree because she had studied at a time when Cambridge did not permit women to participate in graduation ceremonies.  Career  Whetham began work as a resident scholar at the Ministry of Agriculture, where she was an agricultural economist. Three years later, she moved to the journal, The Economist. During World War II, she worked in the Ministry of Food and the Cabinet Office's civil history department. Following the war, Whetham returned to Cambridge.. She was a Fellow of Newnham College and held the Gilbey lecturership in History and Economics of Agriculture until 1963. In 1952, Whetham published the book, British Farming 1939‚Äì1949, a major study of the change in farming practices in England. She resigned from Cambridge in 1963 and took up a position at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Nigeria, as a visiting Professor of Economics, later becoming a full professor there. Her interests had moved to the agricultural needs and economies of the developing world. Whetham's later publications, sometimes co-authored, included London Milk Trade 1900‚Äì1930 (1960), A History of British Agriculture (1846‚Äì1914) (1964), Cooperation, Land Reform, and Land Settlement: Report on a Survey in Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Ghana, Nigeria and Iran (1968), The Economics of African Countries (1969), Agricultural Marketing in Africa (1972) and Beef, Cattle and Sheep 1910‚Äì1940 (1976). She single-handedly wrote the eighth volume of the Cambridge University Press series The Agrarian History of England and Wales (1978). In 1966, Whetham was appointed to the executive of the Agricultural Economics Society and in 1971 she was elected as its president. She also held various posts with the British Agricultural History Society and served as its president for a period until 1979. Whetham died on 28 January 2001 in Cambridge.

The practice was instituted by John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church. Individuals kneel at the mourners' bench to experience the New Birth and some of those who have already had the New Birth go there to receive entire sanctification, while others, especially backsliders, use the mourners' bench to confess their sins and receive forgiveness, in order to continue the process of sanctification. At the mourners' bench, individuals receive spiritual counsel from a minister. In keeping with the doctrine of the mortification of the flesh, penitents do not kneel on kneeler cushions but instead kneel on the floor. Today many, but not all, Methodist churches supplant the mourners' bench with chancel rails, where Methodists (as well as other evangelical Christians) receive Holy Communion, in addition to experiencing the New Birth, repenting of their sins, and praying.

The abbreviation for the project is WOK and used to market quiz game mobile apps in a social network called the Knowledge Network. In all WOK apps the connection to Wikipedia is used by in coexistence with the multiple choice questions and Wikipedia content of articles and images using Wikipedia live content. WOK develops mobile apps in an ecosystem that are connected with the same scoresystem and with Wikipedia articles using the open API from Wikimedia Commons. History The WOK project was started by the founder Erik Bolinder in 2009. During several years he planned to create a system for social network based on learning and knowledge. After extensive travel around the World a team was found in Cairo for developing the first WOK related product called Wokcraft.com, WOKquiz and WOKbattle in 2012-2013. All initial projects were cancelled and redeveloped in 2014 when the app Quiz King was launched. In 2015 the app WOKwiki was developed and launched on the 15th Anniversary of Wikipedia. In 2017 the app was renamed to WikiMaster. In late 2016 the app WikiFlip was launched as the third app in the WOK ecosystem of quiz apps. All apps have been developed for Android and iOS mobile smartphones. All apps in WOK are based on the database of multiple choice questions with four alternatives, one being factually correct and three alternatives being incorrect. No direct relation to Wikipedia articles on questions exists other than keywords that are the same as Wikipedia articles. In the WikiMaster app a full Wikipedia access is to be found in 11 languages. Quizzes exist in 4 languages, English being the largest with 300000 questions indexed. WOKcraft has also developed an API that could be used in Wikipedia making all WOK questions available in Wikipedia without the need for access to apps from WOKcraft. Critics among the Wikipedia community project point to the commercial interests the WOK project based on which is not in line with the Wikipedia Foundation principles being a nonprofit organization. Enhancers to the WOK project point to the fact that learning is in coexistence with control questions in text books at the end of chapters and this would be useful to Wikipedia users if accessed and that WOK has been free to use without any advertising or subscription model just as Wikipedia. WOK has developed an API for the Wikipedia community to implement free public access to the questions in WOK so Wikipedia users could use questions in Wikipedia articles. The crowd sourced system of content used by Wikipedia articles is similar in WOK. All questions in WOK can be traced to a log file of creators, date and content. Wokers correct questions that are incorrect in spelling or content and are not fact based with a reliable source. All users of the WOK community can create and send questions in the WikiMaster app. During 2017 WOK plans to enlarge the existing database of questions currently available in English, Arabic, Swedish and French to Hindu, Portuguese and Spanish. Apps =WikiMaster= thumb WikiMaster app was launched as WOKwiki on 15 January 2016 in Google Play and AppStore. In early 2017 the app changed name to WikiMaster. In WikiMaster you have access to Wikipedia in 11 languages. All Wikipedia articles can be found by a search function using the API provided by Wikipedia. On top of a Wikipedia article a function of quiz is added. If questions exist in WOK database and are indexed with same keyword or tag as the name of the Wikipedia article by any user the question is available in the Wikipedia article and a quiz exist to this Wikipedia article. If no questions are indexed, no quiz is available. Only the members of WOK add questions and tags. No bot or automatic procedure is used. On all Wikipedia articles questions can be created with a five step by step procedure. A question created can be tagged by any other woker enhance the questions in other related articles on a broad and granular level. A question about a football player can be adequately tagged to the Wikipedia article Sport, Associated Football, a club in which the football player play in, a championship related to the question as well as the article about the football player him/herself and so on. The usefulness of WOK is therefore similar to Wikipedia over time in sense the more questions on top of Wikipedia articles, the more useful for the community finding relevant content to be quizzed in for educational purpose like learning a subject in education. Questions can have images attached from Wikimedia Commons. No other images can be uploaded to questions, thus enhance the interconnection with Wikipedia. All quiz in WikiMaster can be played alone by the registered user or played with other workers in a challenge. Challenges are independent of time for each woker to play. All WOKer get points called WOkbits based on correct questions, created questions, challenge wins and alerts. And notifications of events as common in social media apps. All WOKbits counts in a universal score-system in all apps. A WikiMaster can be reached on allocated WOKbits on article level, in a city, country or the World. And on different time periods. =WikiFlip= thumb WikiFlip is an app developed by WOKcraft in the end of 2016 aiming to use the images uploaded to Wikipedia Commons and used as a part of questions in WOK added in WikiMaster. With over 80000 questions in database with images associated from Wikimedia Commons, WikiFlip user can search any Wikipedia article and find questions in WOK related and take them by a clic on the image. Using Wikimedia Commons images uploaded by users in Wikipedia community and questions created by the WOK community WikiFlip benefit the learning process by many students in need for learning in a new way. WOK claim to have \\"released the images captured by the Wikipedia text\\". Any answered flips can be reviewed and tags associated with the question can be flipped or the Wikipedia article opened in WikiMaster. WOKers can reach as many correct questions flipped as possible in a row. =Quiz King= thumb Quiz King is the first app developed by WOK that is still in AppStore and Google Play in 2014. The quiz game is based on questions from the WOK community. Players play 5 rounds with four questions from a main category, chosen out of 22 categories. Each player chose a category and answer same questions in the round. The quicker correct answer is given, the more WOKbits is given.

It was part of a pattern of colonist attacks against Native Americans in the area after the former began to encroach on native lands, and conflicts arose over use of the territory. Ultimately the Karankawa ceded their territory to the European Americans, and were dispersed to other areas, became day laborers, were forced into slavery, or killed. By 1860, no free Karankawa remained here. History =Background= Due to the formation of the First Mexican Republic in 1823 and the opening of Mexican Texas to colonists from the United States, the European-American population of Texas increased rapidly. They pushed Native Americans off their land. Struggling to survive, the native people raided the new settlers' cattle, and deep hostility and conflict arose between the two groups. In the Galveston Bay region populated chiefly by the Karankawa Indians, Native Americans in the 1820s still outnumbered White colonists. The most recent European-American settlers came from well-settled regions of the Southern United States and were not accustomed to living among large Indian populations in a non-dominant relationship. The Americanos took new settlements without offering gifts, sharing the land, or allowing raids on their livestock in the manner of the longer-settled Tejano. In 1823 Stephen F. Austin began to claim rich tracts of land near bays and river , which were occupied by the Coco and the Carancaguas, subgroups of the Karankawa. The Karankawa relied on these bays for the fish and shellfish that provided their winter protein sources, and they were fiercely protective of that territory. After scouting the land, Austin wrote that extermination of the Karankawa would be necessary, although his first encounter with the tribe was friendly. He spread rumors among the settlers, attributing cannibalism and extreme violence to the Karankawa, and sometimes more specifically to the Carancaguas. Research has suggested that these accusations of cannibalism were false, possibly caused by his confusion of the Karankawa with another tribe. The Karankawa had been horrified by cannibalism which they saw practiced by shipwrecked Spaniards. Austin's stories primed the colonists to believe that it would be impossible for them to live among the Karankawa. When the Karankawa began to poach the livestock being ranched on the land that had been taken from their territory, conflict erupted between the groups. Several massacres were committed by settlers against the natives, including the Skull Creek Massacre. The Whites encouraged neighboring Indian tribes to kill the Karankawa, and Austin rewarded them with bounties of lead and gunpowder if they did so. By 1824 the Karankawa were under enough stress that a local Carancaguase chief, Antonio, signed a treaty abandoning their homelands east of the Guadalupe River. The displaced Karankawa ran into difficulties west of the Guadalupe, as the Comanche, Lipan, and fellow groups of Karankawa were already using available land. Chief Antonio‚Äôs treaty was violated by Karankawa tribesmen who continued to go to the bay for fishing as well as poach cattle from the settlers east of the Guadalupe. At this point Austin ordered his men to \\"Pursue and kill all those Indians wherever they are found.\\" =Incident= After an Indian attack against the Cavanaugh and Flowers families, Aylett C. Buckner led a Texian Militia company against the Karankawa. Finding a band of Coco Indians trapped near the Colorado River about three miles north of the present-day town of Matagorda, the militia began to shoot the Coco men, women, and children by rifles as they swam through the water and climbed the opposite bank in a desperate attempt to flee. =Consequences= The colonists called this massacre site \\"Dressing Point\\" because there the Indians had received the \\"dressing they deserved\\". After the massacre, the Coco Indians abandoned the region and settled west of the Guadalupe with the other tribes. Other smaller groups remained, but were continually harassed by the settlers, who took on \\"Indian hunting\\" as a sport. They also regularly raped Indian women. On May 13, 1827, Chief Antonio signed a second peace treaty, permanently ceding the land to the colonists. That year Austin founded the town of Matagorda, three miles from Dressing Point, in order to \\"protect\\" settlers from the Indians. Having difficulty in finding uninhabited regions that would sustain life, the remaining bands of Karankawa dispersed: some became day laborers in towns and on plantations, others were taken as slaves by Austin's settlers, or were killed in later conflicts. By 1860, the free Karankawa had been eliminated in this area. See also * Texian Militia * List of conflicts involving the Texas Military *Karankawa people *Stephen F.

Before 1823, there were few settlers of European heritage from the United States in the state of Texas. With the formation of the First Mexican Republic in 1823 and the opening of Mexican Texas to colonists from the United States, white people began to settle in the state. The subsequent pushing of Native Americans off of their land, combined with Native American raids on the new settlers' cattle, led to deep hostility and conflict between the two groups. After two colonists were killed by Coco people (a subgroup of the Karankawa), a Texian Militia company of 26 men was formed by Robert Kuykendall. The company attacked a Karankawa village on Skull Creek, killing 19 people and razing homes after stealing their possessions. There was no punishment for the attack and hostilities continued until free Indians were eliminated from the land. History =Background= In the Galveston Bay area, white colonists were still a minority in the 1820s. The newest settlers came from well-settled regions of the American South and were not accustomed to living among large Indian populations in a non-dominant relationship. For instance, they took new settlements without offering substantial gifts, sharing the land, or allowing the customary depredation of their livestock that Tejanos who had previously lived in the region had grown accustomed to. In 1823, Stephen F. Austin began to claim rich tracts of land near bays and river mouths populated by the Karankawa. The Karankawa relied on these bays for the fish and shellfish that provided their winter protein sources and thus were fiercely protective of that land. Austin wrote upon scouting the land that extermination of the Karankawa would be necessary, despite the fact that his first encounter with the tribe was friendly. He spread rumors among the settlers of cannibalism and extreme violence of the Karankawa, sometimes more specifically the Carancaguases. Research has suggested that these accusations of cannibalism were false, possibly caused by confusion with another tribe, and that the Karankawa were horrified by cannibalism when they learned of it being practiced by shipwrecked Spaniards. Austin's stories primed the colonists to believe that the Karankawa would be impossible to live among. =Incident= In February 1823, Coco Indians killed two colonists. Although the circumstances are unclear, one theory is that this occurred while they were stealing corn. The colonists, led by Robert Kuykendall, gathered twenty-six Texian Militia who found a Karankawa village on Skull Creek. They killed at least 19 inhabitants of the village, then stole the villagers' possessions and burned their homes to the ground. Multiple participants in the slaughter cited the cannibalism and \\"warlike\\" or \\"repugnant\\" nature of the Karankawa as a justification for the massacre. =Aftermath= None of the attackers faced repercussions for their act. The colonists soon began working on an alliance with the Tonkawa Indians of the region, whom they saw as \\"great beggars\\" who did not threaten their desires to settle on the land. Through them, Austin began encouraging and exacerbating warfare between the competing Indian tribes and the elimination of the Karankawa, as well as continuing to attack the \\"hostile\\" Indians themselves. There were further battles and one-sided massacres, and by 1824 the local Carancaguase chief Antonio signed a treaty abandoning their homelands east of the Guadalupe River. Soon this treaty was violated on both sides, leading to Austin‚Äôs 1825 orders to pursue and kill all Karankawa on sight, the Dressing Point Massacre and the eventual permanent loss of the land by the local Indians by 1827. Having difficulty in finding uninhabited regions in which a living could be had, the remaining bands of Karankawa scattered out, became day laborers in cities and on plantations, were taken as slaves by Austin's settlers, or were killed in later conflicts. By 1860, free Karankawa had been eliminated.

It is Hamid's fourth novel. The main themes of the novel are emigration and refugee problems. The novel is about a young couple, Saeed and Nadia, who live in an unnamed city undergoing civil war and finally have to flee, using a system of magical doors, which lead to different locations around the globe. The book was named by The New York Times as one of the 10 Best Books of 2017. It was also shortlisted for 2019 International IMPAC Dublin Award. Plot Nadia and Saeed meet when they are working students in an unnamed city. Saeed is more conservative and still lives at home, as custom generally requires, but the more independent Nadia has chosen to live alone and has been disowned by her parents for doing so. As war breaks out and militants begin attacking the city, the two fall in love. After Saeed's mother is killed by a stray bullet while searching for a lost earring in her car, Nadia moves in with Saeed and his father, despite not wanting to marry Saeed as propriety requires. As the militants successfully wrest control of the city from the government and violence becomes an every day part of life, Nadia and Saeed begin chasing rumours that there are doors in the city that serve as portals to other locations. Although most of the doors are guarded by militants, they manage to bribe their way through a door, leaving behind Saeed's father who does not wish to be a burden to them and asks Nadia to promise him never to leave Saeed until they are settled. The door they go through takes them to Mykonos, where they are among many refugees and settle in a tent city. They eventually obtain the compassion of a local Greek girl who has a rapport with Nadia and helps the two go through a recently discovered door which leads to a luxury home in London. Nadia and Saeed and other migrants settle in the home, claiming it from its owners. As more migrants penetrate London, hostility between the migrants and the native-born increases, including attacks and mob rule. The migrants are eventually sectioned off in a ghetto with minimal food and electricity called \\"Dark London\\". After a raid to clear out migrants goes wrong, the natives decide to try to work together with the new migrants and put them to work clearing the land for Halo London, a city surrounding London- proper, with the promise that they will be given 40 meters and a pipe i.e. a small plot of land and access to utilities. Nadia and Saeed throw themselves into the work as they feel themselves growing apart from each other. Although the couple are on a list that puts them among the first to obtain a secure home, Nadia asks Saeed to leave through another portal and they eventually take their chance arriving in Marin County, California. They find they are generally welcome there and Nadia finds work at a food co-op while Saeed becomes more and more religious. Eventually, realizing that they no longer have any feelings for one another, Nadia leaves Saeed and moves into a room at the co-op, forming a relationship with a cook who works there. Saeed, meanwhile, marries the native-born daughter of a preacher. Fifty years later, Nadia returns to the country of her birth and meets up with Saeed, who offers to one day take her to see the stars in Chile. Responses Omar El Akkad in The Globe and Mail calls the novel \\"a masterpiece of humanity and restraint\\". Sarah Begley of Time magazine praised its relation to the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis and making a love story of refugees nevertheless feel universal. She also selected it as one of Time's top ten novels of 2017. The Guardian defined it as a \\"magical vision of the refugee crisis\\". The book was also selected for the 2017 Booker Prize longlist among twelve others, and on 13 September 2017 was announced as one of the six-strong shortlist. In December 2017, former U.S. President Barack Obama included Exit West in his list of best books he read in 2017.

The event was organised by General Max von Schenckendorff, commander of Army Group Centre Rear Area, in cooperation with the officials of the security and intelligence services of Nazi Germany‚ÄîSS and the Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service; SD)‚Äîoperating in the same area. Ostensibly an \\"anti-partisan\\" training conference, the event marked an escalation of violence against Jews and other civilians in the area of Schenckendorff's command. Background Wehrmacht propaganda photograph of Jewish women in Mogilev, July 1941. Six thousand Mogilev Jews were murdered by SS forces and units of Police Regiment Centre in October 1941. In June 1941, the Axis Powers launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union and by 26 July 1941, Mogilev, Belarus, had been occupied by the Wehrmacht. Army Group Centre Rear Area, commanded by General Max von Schenckendorff, established its headquarters there on 7 September, but members of Einsatzgruppe B had entered the city in August and already begun murdering Jews. A ghetto was later established in September; in October 1941, most of the inmates had been murdered as part of two operations. The Wehrmacht's aggressive security doctrine‚Äîand the use of the \\"security threat\\" to disguise genocidal policies‚Äîresulted in close cooperation between the army and the security apparatus behind the front lines. Einsatzgruppe B was the key killing unit that operated in the territory of Army Group Centre Rear Area, killing thousands of Jews, Communists and Soviet POWs handed over by the army for execution as well as other \\"undesirables\\", such as Roma (\\"Gypsies\\"), \\"Asiatics\\", and the mentally disabled. In July, Einsatzgruppe B commander Arthur Nebe reported that a \\"solution to the Jewish problem\\" was \\"impractical\\" in his region of operation due to \\"the overwhelming number of the Jews\\", that is there were too many Jews to be killed by too few men. By August 1941, Nebe came to realize that his Einsatzgruppes resources were insufficient to meet the expanded mandate of the killing operations, due to the inclusion of Jewish women and children since that month. The SS Cavalry Brigade, made up of the 1st and 2nd SS Cavalry Regiments, also participated in mass murder activities targeting Jews in Belarus. In July and August 1941, the unit carried out the Pripyat swamps punitive operation resulting in the murder of over 11,000 Jewish civilians. The operation has since been considered a turning point in the transition from \\"selective mass murder\\" to the wholesale extermination of the Jewish population in occupied areas. Units of Police Regiment Centre had, by that time, also conducted mass murder of Jews. In that environment, Schenckendorff, in cooperation with Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, the Higher SS and Police Leader for Army Group Centre, organised a three-day conference for security troops. Held in Mogilev, the meeting aimed to create an \\"exchange of experiences\\" for the Wehrmacht rear unit commanders. Police Colonel , commander of Police Regiment Centre, was in charge of planning and logistics. The conference The conference began on 24 September and focused on \\"combatting partisans\\" (Bek√§mpfung von Partisanen, later Bandenbek√§mpfung) and reflected Schenckendorff's views on the need for total eradication of the resistance to German forces as the only way to secure the occupied territories. The minutes of the conference, if they had been taken, did not survive. What is known of the conference is based on the agenda, the list of attendees, after-action reports, and the summary distributed by Schenckendorff after the event. =Attendees and speakers= Invited officers were selected on the basis of their previous participation in security operations, and included representatives of the Army High Command and Army Group Centre. The audience also included battalion commanders and higher-level officers from both SS-Police and the Wehrmacht, including its security divisions, the 221st, the 286th, and the 403rd. In total, 61 officers participated, with 82 percent of attendees coming from Wehrmacht units. Of the attendees, 38 percent were battalion and company-level commanders. Many had already participated in mass atrocities. For example, the attendees included the commander of the 3rd Battalion in the 354th Infantry Regiment, 286th Security Division. A week prior to the conference, the battalion assisted Einsatzkommando 8 and directly participated in the murder of 1,000 Jews in the town of Krupki. The speakers included: Arthur Nebe, commander of Einsatzgruppe B; Erich von dem Bach- Zelewski, as the representative of Heinrich Himmler; Max Montua, commander of Police Regiment Centre; Hermann Fegelein, commander of the SS Cavalry Brigade; and Gustav Lombard, commander of the 1st SS Cavalry Regiment. The commander of the 2nd SS Cavalry Regiment, , was not invited, perhaps because he was not viewed as extreme enough on the \\"Jewish question\\", as he only massacred Jewish males, and not women and children. =Lectures and sand-table sessions= Presentations covered the evaluation of Soviet \\"bandit\\" organisations and tactics, why it was necessary to kill political commissars immediately upon capture, and gaining intelligence from local collaborators. Bach-Zelewski's session was entitled \\"The Capture of Kommissars and Partisans in 'Scouring- Actions'\\", referring to the activities of the SS Cavalry Brigade in the \\"Pripyat swamps\\" punitive operation. Nebe's talk focused on the role of the SD in the fight against \\"partisans\\" and \\"plunderers\\". He also covered the \\"Jewish question\\", with particular consideration to the anti-partisan movement. Company-grade officers gave short classes or led sand-table exercises on a variety of tactical situations that could be encountered in the field, such as securing a village. =Field exercises= The conference included three field exercises. On the first day, the participants observed an operation by Police Regiment Centre that involved surrounding a village and distribution of leaflets. On the second day, participants travelled to the village of (German: Knjaschitschi) in the vicinity of Mogilev. There, men of the Police Battalion 322 of Police Regiment Centre conducted a demonstration of how to surround and screen a village. According to the after-action report, \\"suspicious strangers\\" (Ortsfremde) or \\"partisans\\" could not be found. The screening of the population revealed 51 Jewish civilians, 32 of whom were shot by the police and SD troops. At dawn on the last day of the conference, participants observed another operation conducted by police troops. The goal was to \\"practically experience\\" the combing of the town for suspects who were identified as \\"partisans, commissars, and communists\\". After the roundup, the participants observed the interrogations then rejoined their respective units. Conference summary and aftermath A 16-page executive summary of the conference, under Schenckendorff's signature, was distributed to Wehrmacht troops and police units in the rear area. The document focused on tactics of security warfare, while also prescribing harsh measures, such as \\"the streets should be kept clear of 'wanderers who should be handed over to the Secret Field Police or sent to filtration camps for further screening. (Many sent to these camps were killed by the SS and SD troops.) The summary warned that the enemy was employing women, children and the elderly as agents. The summary proclaimed that \\"the enemy must be completely annihilated\\", while specifying that the distinction between a \\"partisan\\" and a \\"suspicious person\\" was not always possible, thus giving a carte blanch to the troops for the most brutal approach possible. The document was sent to all company-level units in the army group's area of operations, including to units that did not send representatives to the conference. The conference marked a dramatic increase in atrocities by the Wehrmacht units against Jews and other civilians in the final three months of 1941. The summary had an impact beyond the territory under the control of Army Group Centre Rear Area. The commander of the German army, Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, issued \\"Guidelines for the Fighting of Partisans\\" in October 1941, one month after the conference. Underlining the importance of the event, the closing text of Schenckendorff's summary was reproduced verbatim: > The constant decision between life and death for partisans and suspicious > persons is difficult even for the hardest soldier. It must be done. He acts > correctly who fights ruthlessly and mercilessly with complete disregard for > any personal surge of emotion. Assessment In the opinion of historian Waitman Wade Beorn, the Mogilev Conference was a key event that, in the Army Group Center Rear Area, helped incorporate the Wehrmacht into the Nazi genocide as part of \\"the anti-partisan war and the Jew-Bolshevik-partisan construct\\". Since the conference, the Wehrmacht rear units were instructed to cooperate fully with the SD detachments beyond simply providing logistical support. The Wehrmacht units also assumed direct responsibility for the murder of Jews in the territory under Schenckendorff's command. Jewish civilians were added to an approved list of enemies that the army's rear units would then destroy on their own initiative and without the participation of the SS Police or SD. Although the conference summary did not mention Jews, the field exercises demonstrated that the Wehrmacht was to target Jews in its anti-partisan actions. Beorn concludes that verbal instructions to this effect were, most likely, communicated during the sessions, given the speaker lineup, which included experienced mass murderers such as Bach-Zalewski, Nebe, Lombard, and Fegelein. The anti-Jewish policy had changed radically the month before, with the addition of women and children to the list of targets. This strained the limited resources of the SD and SS organisations. In addition, the German forces had to make room for Jews newly deported from elsewhere in occupied Europe, which was achieved by killing Soviet Jews already concentrated in ghettos. The size of territories under German control increased as well, which limited the activities of these units even further to major population centres. The conference led to a further conflation of more legitimate anti-partisan warfare against irregular fighters with genocide by identifying civilians as enemy combatants. Euphemistic language helped couch the actions; Wehrmacht reports frequently referred to targets as \\"stranger to the village\\", \\"wanderer\\", \\"suspect civilian\\", \\"partisan helper\\", \\"civilian without identification\\", and \\"women soldiers\\". The exercises during the conference put the punitive operations into military context, by breaking down the actions into something that soldiers could relate to, such as surrounding a village, guarding and escorting the suspects, interrogations, etc. In explaining the Wehrmacht's willingness to participate in the genocide, Beorn opines that the Wehrmacht's long history of harsh treatment of civilians, paranoia about a not-yet- existent partisan threat, institutional and individual racism, and its own criminal actions against Red Army commissars all predisposed the army towards accepting mass murder. This was done under the guise of anti-partisan warfare where Jews were targeted as Bolsheviks and thus partisan supporters. Consequently, the division between the Holocaust and the anti-partisan war still prevalent in historiography is a false one. Beorn concludes that \\"the Mogilev conference shows that these two were never separate, but intentionally connected in an effort to include the combat power of the Wehrmacht more efficiently in Hitler's genocidal projects in the east\\".

This functional alteration in a protein in relation to its thermodynamic and kinetic properties enacts an extended chain response among neighboring proteins until an extensive and potentially harmful polymerized structure is formed. Due to this endogenous foreign formation, these diseases are often untreatable and very severe in clinical manifestation. Although DAPs are rare infections, the poor outcome in patients and the need for further understanding makes this class of diseases a pillar for future research.  Replication by recruitment  Diseases of abnormal polymerization are said the undergo ‚Äúreplication‚Äù, or rather that the number of proteins that are polymerized is shown to generally increase much like in a natural course of infection. Since the functional ‚Äúpathogens‚Äù of DAPs are protein units the diseases are almost entirely independent from the use of nucleic acids. Multiple models illustrating this recruitment function exist, including the PrP protein in prion disease. The PrP protein is the major agent in spongiform encephalopathies and undergoes a clear process of polymerization based upon the natural balancing of thermodynamic states and kinetic summation. Like most proteins PrP can exist in two forms, one major and one minor, an alpha helix structure and a beta-pleated sheet structure respectively, that are balanced during nearly all conditions, but with dominance granted to the stable helix form. In certain instances, it may be possible for two beta forms to contact each other at the same time, and in this case the pair can form bonds that successfully stabilize the beta forms thermodynamically and allowing these structures to remain. This is termed the ‚Äúseed‚Äù of polymerization as from this point the continued interaction, or recruitment, amongst the beta forms is increased perpetually, since there is a constant presence of stable beta forms, as well as the fact that beta forms, or beta-pleated sheets, have a greater number of reactive nucleation sites. This progression forms extended fibrils slowly over time that will then cause localized cytopathology, resulting in the characteristic sites of cell degradation or ‚Äúsponginess‚Äù. This general template of recruitment is also characteristic in the condition sickle cell anemia in which the red blood cells are misshapen because of the formation of extended polymer fibrils.  Scenarios for pathogenesis  = Spontaneous development = ADPs can be generated in a spontaneous nature by the existence of multiple thermodynamic states and the kinetic equilibrium between the alpha helix and beta-pleated sheets polymerizing into extended fibrils. = Genetic predisposition = In certain ADPs, such as Gerstmann-Straussler or fatal familial insomnia, individuals naturally encode a form of the PrP protein that shifts the equilibrium slightly to make the beta form more favorable, thus increasing the likelihood of additional nucleation and extended polymerization. = Infectious etiology = Many ADPs, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Kuru, have an infectious nature and can be transmitted to other hosts through various means. In the case of Kuru, familial and cultural rituals in indigenous peoples of Papua New Guinea promoted the consumption of a relative‚Äôs body upon death, and if contaminated, resulting in the transmission of the original ‚Äúseed‚Äù of polymerization.

Etymology The origin of the genus name (Caenolestes) drives from the Greek words kainos (\\"new\\") and lestes (\\"robber\\", \\"pirate\\"). The origin of the species name (sangay) derives from Sangay National Park, which is the largest Andean national park in Ecuador. The park itself is named after a volcano called Sangay, one of Ecuador's most active volcanoes that lies within the park. Sangay National Park was the site of the discovery of the eastern caenolestid in 2010. Taxonomy The eastern caenolestid is one of the five members of Caenolestes, and is placed in the family Caenolestidae (shrew opossums). In the latter part of 20th century, scientists believed that Caenolestes is closely related to Lestoros (the Incan caenolestid). Over the years, it became clear that Lestoros is morphologically different from Caenolestes. A 2013 morphological and mitochondrial DNA-based phylogenetic study showed that the Incan caenolestid and the long-nosed caenolestid (Rhyncholestes raphanurus) form a clade sister to Caenolestes. The cladogram below is based on this study. Caenolestid fossils date to as early as the early Eocene (nearly 55 mya).

He has been a Labor member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly since the 2017 state election, representing Bunbury. Punch studied psychology and social work at the University of Western Australia later completing an MBA at Edith Cowan University. He has worked throughout regional Western Australia as a social worker and later as a Senior Executive in the public sector. He became CEO of the South West Development Commission in 1998, serving until he resigned in 2016 upon his preselection as the Labor candidate for Bunbury. In his role as CEO Punch was responsible for many aspects of The South West's development including projects such as the renewal of the town centre of Manjimup with an emphasis on food based tourism, redevelopment of Busselton airport and renewal of the water front in Bunbury. His work is characterised by blending social and economic development and looking to new and emerging technologies and creative design as part of the emergence of a new definition of the south west. Punch has strong views about the role of Bunbury in the overall development of WA and has pushed hard for Bunbury to be recognised as Western Australia's second city. This was recognised in the WA Labor Plan for Bunbury. Punch is a strong advocate for Aboriginal involvement in decision making and ensured there was Aboriginal representation at the newly formed Bunbury Development Committee (BDC). Chaired by local advocate Robyn Fenech, the BDC is the only sub committee of the Western Australian Planning Commission of its kind in Western Australia. It is responsible for advising the WAPC and the Minister for Planning on the development of Bunbury as Western Australia's second city. Punch has major plans to see the Port of Bunbury as an integral part of the state strategic freight network collaborating with Fremantle Ports on the state freight task and is an advocate of a resurgent manufacturing sector in the industrial lands surrounding Bunbury. Punch was appointed to the WA Methamphetamine Task Force in 2017 and is a member of the Community Development and Justice Standing Committee.  Personal Details  Punch was born in 1956 in Pwllhelli, Wales. He migrated to Australia in 1971 from Manchester in the UK and attended high school in Manjimup and Collie. His early life in Manchester was turbulent following the separation of his mother and father. He migrated to Australia at the age of 14 and joined his brother Tony and his wife Ann and recommenced high school in Manjimup. He matriculated from Collie High School in 1973 and attributes this to a combination of inspiring teachers and the regional school experience. He studied Psychology at UWA and then spent 1978 working back in Manchester. In 1979 he returned to Australia to study Social Work at UWA. Here he met his first wife Beverley and together had two sons Alan and Daniel. He worked as a social worker in Moora later transferring to Collie. In 1986 Beverley died following complications from heart surgery and this had a devastating impact on him and formulated much of his later thinking about grief, loss and human relationships. Punch later became the regional Director for the Department for Family and Children's Services northern regions and married Helen Wychlo. Wychlo is the second daughter of Ludwina and Theodore (dec.) Wychlo, themselves migrants from Poland after the Second World War. Wychlo and Punch have a third son David Theodore. In 1998 Punch left Family and Children's Services to take on the role of CEO of the South West Development Commission. He completed his MBA in 2003. Punch is a keen sailor and holds commercial marine qualifications both as a master of commercial vessels and an instructor.

Barry Urban quits WA Labor amid doubts about past but says he will stay in Parliament. ABC News, 29 November 2017. Accessed 20 December 2017 In May 2018, the parliament's procedures and privileges committee recommended Urban be expelled from the assembly after it found he had misled the house on five occasions. Urban resigned immediately after the tabling of the committee's report, and his seat was subsequently lost to the Liberal Party. Urban was charged by WA Police with twelve counts of forgery, attempted fraud and false evidence in September 2018. Biography Urban was born in Ashington, Northumberland in England and joined the British Army after leaving school. He claims to have served in Northern Ireland, Cyprus and Namibia and, in 1989, joined the police. He claimed to have worked as a detective, and later as a war crimes investigator in Bosnia but none of this was able to be verified when requested, and was removed from his parliamentary biography following the medal scandal. He relocated to Western Australia around 2000 and worked in the construction industry until joining the Western Australia Police in 2005. He also served on Serpentine-Jarrahdale Shire Council. Political career Urban first contested Darling Range for Labor at the 2013 state election, but was heavily defeated by incumbent Tony Simpson, winning only 34.7 percent of the two-party vote. Urban was again pre-selected to contest the electorate at the 2017 state election, this time defeating Simpson, achieving an 18.9% two-party preferred swing amid the Liberals' meltdown in Perth. He was the first Labor member ever to win Darling Range; for most of its existence, the seat had been considered Liberal heartland. In November 2017, Urban was asked to explain why he wore an Australian Police Overseas Service Medal to commemoration services, despite not having served overseas for an Australian police force. Urban claimed that he was awarded a medal by British police for his work as a war crimes investigator in Bosnia- Herzegovina in the late 1990s, but that he had somehow been sent the wrong medal by authorities in the UK. A day later, he issued a statement saying that he had ordered a commemorative International Police Service Medal from a military supply store because he felt he was entitled to one, but had received a POSM in error. In addition, the University of Leeds stated that it had no record of Urban attending the institution, or completing a Bachelor of Arts in health and physical education there, as he had claimed. His claims to have completed a certificate of higher education in policing at the University of Portsmouth, and a diploma of local government in Western Australia, were also questioned, and later found to be false. In response to Urban's statement, the United Nations and Overseas Policing Association of Australia announced it would be lobbying Australian federal parliamentarians to make it a criminal offence \\"with considerable penalties\\" for people to wear medals to which they are not entitled.Travers, Mick.

It is also notable for being one of the few clarinet solo pieces that calls for clarinets in both B and A.

The tempo is marked at = 52, making it by far the slowest of the three pieces. It is made up of a long, plodding series of quarter and eighth notes, adorned by the occasional grace notes and often interrupted by a breath mark. The lower register of the clarinet is explored here, with many leaps going from the upper to the lower registers of the instrument. The last measure is marked \\"poco pi√π e poco pi√π mosso\\", or \\"A little more forte and a little more motion\\". This last measure is to be played much quicker and at a louder dynamic so as to create a contrast with the rest of the piece. A sustained concert C ends the first piece in a long fade-out. = II (Preferably Clarinet in A) = The second piece is written in a free- form style, akin to jazz improvisation, with no time signature or bar lines. The indicated tempo is eighth note = 168, with an eighth note being treated as three sixteenth notes. The piece can be segmented into three sections. The first is a flurry of sextuplets and thirty-second notes that are extremely technically challenging. The second section is quieter and calmer, with the clarinetist playing fast eighth notes in the lower register. The third section is a recapitulation of the first, bringing back the same sextuplet patterns from earlier. The second piece also ends softly, with a sudden change from a to dynamic. = III (Preferably Clarinet in B) = The third piece is inspired by the ragtime from the L'Histoire du Soldat Suite,Huscher, Phillip. \\"Program Notes: Three Pieces for Solo Clarinet.\\" Cso.org. Chicago Symphony Orchestra, n.d. Web. 16 Mar. 2017. and is the only one to call for clarinet in B instead of in A. With a metronome marking of , the piece is characterized by much rapid syncopation and frequently shifting time signatures, made more complicated by the accents placed on certain notes. It maintains a near- constant dynamic until the very end, where the player backs down to a softer dynamic and ending with one final grace note.

He has been a Labor member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly since the 2017 state election, representing Mount Lawley. Millman studied law at the University of Western Australia, and worked as an industrial relations lawyer at Slater and Gordon.  End of Life Choices  Millman was one of the members of the WA Parliament‚Äôs Joint Select Committee on End of Life Choices that recommended the introduction of assisted dying legislation in August 2018. Speaking on the tabling of the Committee‚Äôs report he said: > there was more than enough evidence presented to our committee for us to > reach the view that assistance is being provided to patients at the end of > their life, but that this assistance, although arguably illegal, does not > lead to any criminal prosecution. I call this ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell‚Äù. As a > lawyer with a faithful belief in the rule of law, this is an intolerable > situation. Bad laws should not be evaded and avoided; bad laws should be > changed. Access to rights should be available to everyone equally, based on > the premise that no-one is above or beyond the law. One of the Committee‚Äôs recommendations concerned establishing an Expert Panel to advise on ways to increase take-up of Advance Health Directives, the legally binding mechanism by which Western Australians are able to set out their wishes regarding future treatment options. Millman was appointed by Attorney General John Quigley as Chair of the Expert Panel. Writing in Western Australia‚Äôs daily newspaper, the West Australian, Millman reflected on the need for the Panel by referring to the Committee‚Äôs deliberations: > It was profoundly concerning to hear that some health providers are failing > to abide by the terms of legally binding AHDs. As a lawyer, I find it > astounding that a person can have these wishes simply disregarded by health > professionals. We must do more to protect the credibility of this mechanism > so we can all have confidence that, at our most vulnerable, our wishes will > be respected by our health providers. Legislation giving effect to the Committee‚Äôs recommendations was introduced in August 2019 and passed by the Parliament in December 2019. Speaking on the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2019, Millman said: > I have been fortified in my view that I should support this legislation by > some of the incredible contributions made by members in this chamber.

In 2019 Millman visited Israel as part of a Health and Medical Innovation Delegation led by Deputy Premier and Minister for Health Roger Cook, organised by the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce (WA). Speaking in the Legislative Assembly, Millman said of the trip: > 'Western Australia shares with Israel both an entrepreneurial spirit and a > tradition of outstanding medical innovation. The calibre of delegates on the > trip was a testament to both these attributes.'

On the report into the Committee‚Äôs third report, ‚ÄòPCH ‚Äì A Long Waiting Period: A critique of the state‚Äôs management and oversight of the Perth Children‚Äôs Hospital project‚Äô, Millman said: > During the course of this project, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and > Energy Union was criticised for the industrial action it took to improve > workers‚Äô conditions and health and safety on site.

The US military claimed the people targeted in the strike were militantsFor a discussion of this term, see belonging to the terrorist group al-Qaeda. However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), local residents and local officials have claimed that the building struck was a mosque filled with worshipers. At the time, US military claimed that the structure bombed was not a mosque itself but was next to a mosque, which was undamaged. However, on May 5, 2017, a US Central Command investigation determined that the building was indeed part of a mosque-complex. Rami Abdel Rahman, head of SOHR, claimed the structure was a mosque which held over 300 people at the time of the strike. In September 2017, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria concluded that \\"United States forces failed to take all feasible precautions to avoid or minimize incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects, in violation of international humanitarian law.\\" The UN commission's findings did not support the U.S. claim that an al-Qaeda meeting was taking place. Casualties Forty-two people were initially reported by the SOHR to have been killed, though the group said that by March 17 the death toll had increased to 49, while The Guardian reported that 46 people had died. The SOHR said that most of the casualties were civilians, and more than 100 people were injured. The Syrian Civil Defence said that \\"dozens\\" of people had been buried in rubble following the strike. According to a September 2017 report from the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, 38 people were killed, including one woman and five children, and 26 people were wounded.Masri, Lena (September 7, 2017) \\"US airstrikes on Syria mosque compound violated international law, UN says\\" ABC News. According to a spokesman for the Pentagon, \\"dozens\\" of al-Qaeda fighters, including \\"senior al Qaeda terrorists, some of these were likely high value individuals\\", were among those killed. Another spokesman stated that initial assessments indicated no civilian casualties. U.S. involvement A missile fragment was reportedly found at the attack scene which had Latin alphabet letters corresponding with script found on missiles used by US forces, according to British investigative group Bellingcat. The Syrian Institute for Justice released photographs showing fragments of American weapons at the site of the bombing, which British newspaper The Telegraph cited as evidence that the US was responsible for civilian casualties. A United States Central Command spokesman, Josh Jacques, confirmed that the United States had carried out an airstrike, but said that the area was \\"assessed to be a meeting place for al-Qaeda, and we took the strike,\\" and denied both that the mosque had been the target and that it had been the building that was destroyed. \\"We did not target a mosque, but the building that we did target ‚Äì which was where the meeting [of militants] took place ‚Äì is about from a mosque that is still standing,\\" spokesperson Colonel John Thomas said. Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis later clarified that the target had been identified as a \\"partially constructed community center.\\" The photo released by the Pentagon showed the mosque was \\"relatively unscathed,\\" Davis added. The Washington Post reported that two Reaper drones fired at least four Hellfire missiles and dropped a bomb in the attack. Within a week of the attack, US Central Command began two internal investigations, one into whether civilians had been killed and another to find additional information about the type of building hit and its occupants. On May 5, 2017, the investigation determined that the building was indeed part of a mosque- complex. According to Forensic Architecture, witness testimonies and photographs of the building taken before the strike suggested few of the rooms had doors separating them from one another. A large number of local residents visited regularly and the building was open to the public. Forensic Architecture concluded that \\"[a]ll of this makes it unlikely that a meeting of senior al-Qaeda operatives would have been taking place at the time of the strike.\\"\\"Airstrikes on the al-Jinah Mosque\\" Forensic Architecture. April 17, 2017. In a report released 18 April 2017, Human Right Watch stated that they had \\"not found evidence to support the allegation that members of al-Qaeda or any other armed group were meeting in the mosque.\\" Local residents in the area reported that there were no members of armed groups at the mosque or in the area at the time of the attack and that the victims were all civilians and local residents. First responders to the initial strike said the dead and injured wore civilian clothes and that they saw no weapons at the site. Human Rights Watch also noted that \\"U.S. authorities have so far released no information to support their claims.\\" In June 2017, a United States military investigation found the airstrike was legal and caused one civilian casualty.Gibbons-Neff, Thomas (June 7, 2017) \\"U.S. finds that March airstrike that struck building described as mosque was legal\\" The Washington Post. U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Paul Bontrager said the investigation into the attack did not involve any interviews with people on the ground and no U.S. personnel visited the site. In September 2017, a report from the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria said that three days before striking the mosque compound, the U.S. team knew about the target but did not do enough to verify it. The Commission therefore concluded that \\"United States forces failed to take all feasible precautions to avoid or minimize incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects, in violation of international humanitarian law.\\" The UN commission said its findings did not support the U.S. claim that an al-Qaeda meeting was taking place there and the U.S. had not released evidence that such a meeting took place. The report noted that the United States Central Command investigation included interviews with dozens of people, none of whom were in al-Jinah at the time of the attack. The investigators said the U.S. had sought to limit collateral damage using ten bombs that produced minimal blast and fragmentation to hit the building, before following up with two missiles fired by a drone at people fleeing.Cumming-Bruce, Nick (September 6, 2017) \\"U.N.

Local police officer, Abdur Rasheed said, \\"The bomb went off minutes after a provincial lawmaker, Khalifa Abdul Qayyum, had passed by the area. It is not clear whether Qayyum was the target, but our investigation teams have rushed to the site of the blast to collect evidence.\\"  Reactions  President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari condemned attack, calling it cowardly act of terrorism. Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani have asked for timely investigation of the blast and directed the hospital authorities to provide the best possible treatment to the victims. Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ameer Haider Khan Hoti and Emir of Jamat-e-Islami Siraj ul Haq have also condemned attack. Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Owais Ahmed Ghani said, \\"elements behind this inhuman and un-Islamic act would be brought to justice\\".

The field is broad and interdisciplinary and involves research requiring expertise from multiple disciplines that can include botany, ethology, biochemistry, entomology and a range of analytical techniques. A slightly narrower area of research within floral biology is sometimes termed as pollination biology or anthecology. Flowers are structures that are produced by angiosperms and their evolution is intricately associated with their pollinators, particularly insects. Flowers are costly structures that target pollinators by offering them rewards so as to enhance cross- pollination. The evolution of the size of flowers, their structure and the nature of rewards and the way these signals are transmitted and perceived by potential pollinators are typically examined in terms of the costs incurred and the benefits accrued. The timing of flowering, the duration of flowering and the mode by which they cease to function once their role is fulfilled are all areas of research within the field of floral biology. Studies in floral biology can have applications since pollination and fruit set are key factors that affect yield in all crop plants. History of the field Cover of Sprengel's 1793 book The beginnings of the field of floral biology is generally traced to Christian Konrad Sprengel's Entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur im Bau in der Befruchtung der Blumen (The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilization of Flowers Discovered) (1793). Sprengel may however have been influenced by the earlier work of Joseph Gottlieb K√∂lreuter in 1761. Sprengel began his studies in 1787 starting with the wood cranesbill Geranium sylvaticum. He noted that the lower portions of the petals had soft hairs. He believed in the wisdom of the \\"Creator\\" and that not even a single hard could be without purpose. He suggested that the hairs were present to protect the nectar from rain like eyebrows and eyelashes preventing sweat to flow into the eyes. It took him six years of observation in which time he examined 461 plants. He observed that orchids lacked nectar but had nectar guides. He called these as false nectar flowers and observed that the flowers of Aristolochia trapped insects. His book included twenty five illustrations. Sprengel's work was favourably viewed by Carl Ludwig Willdenow who incorporated some of the results in his Grundriss der Kr√§uterkunde zu Vorlesungen (1802). Sprengel noted, contrary to popular belief of his time, that flowers were aimed to prevent self-fertilization. Sprengel identified the patterns on the petals as nectar guides (\\"Saftmale\\") for pollinators. At that time flowers were considered as the place for the marriage of the stamens and pistils and nectar was thought to aid the growing seeds. Bees were thought of as thieves. Sprengel's work was criticized by Johann Wolfgang Goethe. Sprengel's work however got wider coverage in the English speaking world only after Charles Darwin credited him in his Fertilisation of Orchids (1862).  Aspects  Flowering plants, angiosperms, are relatively recent among the plants. The oldest flower structures date to about 140 million years ago. Flowering plants underwent a major diversification after this period. Darwin saw this as an \\"abominable mystery\\" in a letter to Joseph Hooker in 1879. The earliest flowers were principally actinomorphic or having radial symmetry with multiple axes of symmetry. From these evolved flowers with bilateral symmetry or zygomorphy. It is thought that the attraction of insect pollinators led by visual cues had an influence in the evolution of zygomorphy. The earliest groups of flowering plants among the Magnoliids and the families Choranthaceae, Ceratophyllaceae, Nymphaeaceae, Annonaceae, and Aristolochiaceae are bisexual with both male and female parts present and functional within the usually large floral structure. The main pollinators of these flowers were beetles, flies and thrips. They evolved mechanisms to reduce self-pollination by changing the timing of maturity of the male and female parts. This altered timing mechanism or dichogamy was principally expressed by protogyny or the early maturation of the female parts and only rarely by protandry or the early maturation of the male parts. The early flowers were principally flat and dish-like with the evolution of deeper corolla tubes being a later innovation and principally associated with long- tongued pollinators such as moths. There are a large number of other mechanisms that enhance cross-pollination and prevent self-pollination. The forces that lead to the evolution of such systems as bearing male and female flowers on separate kinds of plants is still unclear. The evolution from solitary flowers to the production of inflorescences is also thought to be influenced by pollinator behaviour. Clusters of flowers may increase the visitation rates of pollinators. It may also reduce the risk of damage to individual flowers. The production of volatile chemicals by flowers is targeted towards insects. Some evidence shows that there is significant overlap between the chemicals produced by plants and those used by insects for their communications, especially for mating. In the classic case of orchids in the genus Ophrys, the volatiles mimic the female sex pheromone of bees which attempt to copulate with the flower and thereby pollinate them. A study of the evolution of volatile chemicals in scarab beetles and flowers that attract them in the family Araceae showed that the insects had evolved the chemicals in the Jurassic Period while the plants evolved the attractants later in the Cretaceous Period. The colours of flowers are another area of enquiry. Some distinct patterns have been noted, for instance bird-pollinated flowers are predominantly red while night-flowering plants tend to be white. The colours of flowers are produced by a variety of pigmentary mechanisms and they are meant to signal messages to pollinators. Flowers that have been pollinated often quickly wither and the nutrients resorbed by the plant. In some case parts of the flower may undergo colour changes to indicate their being unfit for visitation by pollinators.

They play home games at Greenlight Stadium in Onduparaka, a suburb of Arua. The club's name means 'sorghum stem' in the Lugbara language while motto is: The struggle continues. History =Amateur era= Onduparaka FC was formed in late October 2011 by Joe Erema and Benjamin Nyakuni, who had graduated from Makerere University Business School. Originally, the club was intended to benefit students and young people and enable them to play in inter-village competitions. The team was strictly amateur and created so that the youth would be kept on the path of moral uprightness through a healthy passion for competitive games. After only one year of participation, the team renamed themselves Onduparaka Football Club and got promoted from the Ugandan Big League to the Azam Uganda Premier League (AUPL) at the end of the 2015/2016 season. =2015‚Äì16 season= Onduparaka appointed former South Sudan national team coach Leo Adraa as their first Uganda Premier League head coach to replace Allan Kabonge whose contract expired after promoting the club to the top flight league and reaching the Uganda Cup Final. He later became the Technical Director. In August 2016, Charles Livingstone Mbabazi was named Head Coach and Adraa became the Assistant Coach while Moses \\"Ugoboss\\" Oloya became Goalkeeping Coach. In 2016, Onduparaka FC lost in the 42nd Uganda Cup Final by 3‚Äì1 to Vipers SC, their first appearance in the final. =2016‚Äì17 season= During 2017, their first season in the top flight, Onduparaka FC was the only UPL team unbeaten at home. One of the club's targets in its maiden top-flight season was to avoid relegation. By the end of the first round of matches, Onduparaka had climbed to the top four. The last time an upcountry team won the league was in 1999 by Dairy Heroes from Mbale and fans hoped Onduparaka would be next or even pull off a promotion miracle like Leicester City FC had just done in England. They started the season with a goalless draw against Soana, then lost to Bright Stars before drawing again on 6 September 2016, this time with Express FC, the Oldest Team in the league. The fourth game was against defending champions KCCA who had won all their first three games. Ondu needed a quick second half brace by Muhammad Shaban to inflict the first season loss to the 11-time champions on 9 September 2016 at Greenlight Stadium. Despite a late onslaught, the visitors only managed a consolation goal; that was Onduparaka's first Uganda Premier League win. On 1 October 2016, SC Villa - the Most Successful Club in Ugandan Football scored first, then the Newcomers from Arua crawled back scoring three through Caesar Okhuti, Wahab Ajuman Gadafi and the leading Azam Uganda Premier League Top Scorer at that time Muhammad Shaban. The visitors fought back from 3‚Äì1 down until they equalised via a penalty netted by Tabu Vitalis (a former Onduparaka Captain) but Shaban had the last laugh with his second of the game. The match took place at Greenlight Stadium. Ondu couldn't be bullied by the Jogoos. A week before, Ondu had handcuffed Police FC 2‚Äì1 on the same ground (with goals by Shaban and Kabon). Three days prior to Ondu ending Villa's Unbeaten Run of the Season, FUFA cleared 26-year-old Caesar Okhuti to play for the Northwesterners who sat at 5th on the table; he was on a six-month loan from KCCA since mid September. On 10 December 2016, Ondu beat Sadolin FC 1‚Äì0 at Bugembe Stadium to climb to 3rd place around half season courtesy of a Gaddafi free-kick. Ondu's leading goalscorer Muhammad Shaban (aka [I]jagason) was voted the 2016 FUFA MVP (Most Valuable Player) in a year when Mamelodi Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango also performed well and actually won the CAF Best Player in Africa Award and Farouk Miya scored the goal against Comoros that took Uganda to the tournament. In 2017, the three travelled to Gabon for AFCON; Onyango only played in the two narrow 0‚Äì1 defeats to Ghana and Egypt. Shaban came on as a substitute in both games while Miya was substituted but scored Uganda's only goal in the third game; Uganda drew 1‚Äì1 with Mali in the third group game to register at least a point after a 39-year absence from the continental showpiece. Also on Onduparaka's squad is KCCA loanee Caesar Okhuti who is no stranger to being a hot newcomer especially after he took the nation by storm with another Arua club called Ediofe Hills FC in 2007 and was called up to the national team. Other players on the 2017 Onduparaka team included: Richard Anyama (goalkeeper formerly at Saints FC), Nisar Kasim (another Goalkeeper), Alex Gasper Adriko (aka The Rock), Norman Saddam, Rashid Toha, Gibson Adinho, Akram Kakembo, Ivan Mbowa, Ibrahim Faizul (aka Anini), Sabir Simba, Dickens Okwir, Mohammad Rashid, Ajobe Toto, Denis Andama, Rashid Agau, Living Kabon, Wahab Ajuman Gaddafi Gadinho and Fahd Muhammad Toko. On 17 February 2017, Azam TV broadcast a live game from Onduparaka's Greenlight Stadium for the first time. Kabon Living (also known as Messi), clad in a number 13 shirt, scored the only goal of the game from a Shaban assist in the 88th minute to give Ondu a win over Kirinya Jinja SS. Kabon took off his shirt, somersaulted in the goal celebration and got a yellow card for indecency but his goal leapfrogged Ondu to 3rd place next to SC Villa and KCCA. They dropped points with humiliating away defeats to KCCA (7‚Äì0 at the Phillip Omondi Stadium in Lugogo - Record Biggest Loss in Uganda Premier League - Caesar Okhuti, loaned to Ondu by KCCA missed the match) and SC Villa (4‚Äì1 at Masaka Recreation Ground) but bounced back. Starting the day in sixth place on 1 April 2017 with a chance to climb to 4th with a win at Kakindu Stadium in Jinja after Vipers SC had already lost to a different Jinja side, Gaddafi scored one of the Contenders for Goal of the Season against Jinja Municipal Council who salvaged a 1‚Äì1 draw. On 5 April 2017, Muhammad Shaban's first half goal was enough to beat nine-man Lweza at Greenlight Stadium and end a three match winless streak. In their first international friendly of the season, Onduparaka beat Gor Mahia 2‚Äì0 at Mandela National Stadium Nambole on 4 February 2017. Kizza Besigye, the four time Runner-up in the Ugandan Presidential Elections, watched the game clad in a green jersey and offered Onduparaka FC 2 million Uganda shillings. Then on 21 February 2017, Onduparaka dressed in all white came from a goal down to beat Mbarara FC and advance to the Uganda Cup Round of 16. Airtel - FUFA MVP Shaban missed a penalty but Okhuti scored the winner in a 2‚Äì1 triumph at Kakyeka Stadium in Mbarara. On 26 March 2017, goals from Okhuti again and a returning Rashid Agau helped Ondu knock out Big League team Water FC and qualify for the quarterfinals. On 9 April 2017, Sadolin Paints FC knocked Onduparaka out of the Uganda Cup by 2‚Äì1 in Jinja. Nevertheless, Onduparaka's Greenlight Stadium was chosen to host the 43rd Uganda Cup Final (KCCA defeated Paidha Black Angels 2‚Äì0 in June 2017). In a UPL fixture twelve days later, the Painters left Onduparaka with a point after a 0‚Äì0 draw. According to Coach Livingstone Mbabazi, his side created the most chances in the league during the 2017 season. He added that his \\"players don't fear big teams\\" because they know that they are big too though recovering from a 2‚Äì1 loss to Soana where substitute Shaban scored the consolation on 29 April 2017. Ondu was one of the only two teams in the AUPL still unbeaten at home going into the Game Week 27 Fixture against Express FC on 5 May 2017. Livingstone would miss Living Kabon suspended for three accumulated yellow cards and Akram Kakembo who had family issues. Sabir Simba meanwhile was recovering from malaria. Livingstone's first game as Onduparaka Coach was at Wankulukuku and ended 1‚Äì1. The return leg almost seemed to be heading in that direction with Express taking the lead through Didier Jean within the first halfhour after assistant captain Rashid Toha (towering defender nicknamed Per Mertesacker) slipped and Express capitalised. Ondu badly needed an equaliser after all their wasted chances; Muhammad Shaban hit the woodwork and missed other chances. Kickoff was in sunny weather but even the winds could not discourage the many high balls. Then just before halftime, Dickens Okwir was fouled in the penalty box by the Express captain. Toha stepped up to score the equaliser in the 41st minute and redeem himself after sending the keeper the wrong way. In the second half, Coach Livingstone was restless on the touchline and urged his defence not to concede again. Rashid Agau excited the fans when he was called from the bench to warm up as a replacement for Caesar Okhuti, the Oldest Caterpillar. Fahd Toko meanwhile replaced Okwir less than 20 minutes from full-time. Shaban played his heart out but it just was not his day to steal the show when he missed a good opportunity for the winner close to extratime. Four minutes were added and while the game seemed to be headed to a repeat of the first leg, Rashid Toha scored the winner in the 3rd additional minute to send the stadium into a glorious frenzy. As the celebrations waned, Agau - the substitute for Caesar Okhuti was substituted with Caesar Olega, a fairytale of two Caesars crossing the line before and after the winner. A few seconds later, the final whistle was blown. Coach Leo Adraa said that Ondu had more time to prepare unlike the Oldest Club in Ugandan football who were thumped four goals by Lweza in their previous game. Kampala musician Kalifah Aganaga who had a show in Arua that weekend was present donning a green Onduparaka jersey. Arua musician and producer King Weedah was also at the game. This win propelled the Caterpillars from 6th to 5th Position out of 16 above Express who remained with 40 points with three games left to the end of the season. Four points behind 3rd-placed Vipers, the Caterpillars needed a win to reduce the gap to within one point. Fatefully, they were beaten 4‚Äì1 at the St. Mary's Kitende Stadium in Kajjansi on 9 May 2017. The game was marred with violence. That same day, KCCA were crowned Champions for the second consecutive year. In the Last Home Game of the Season, Muhammad Shaban scored in the 16th minute but Saints FC equalised just before halftime. The army side needed only one point, that is a draw to be safe from relegation and leave the battle for survival to Lweza and Police; JMC Hippos had already been relegated. Caesar Okuti replaced Dickens Okwir in the second half while Denis Andama (aka Koko Makosa) later replaced Gasper. Saints goalie Alex Mugabi hit himself on the goalpost while trying to save a goal attempt and seriously needed medical attention; he was stretchered off and replaced by Harrison Sempajji who made a number of saves from rejuvenated Onduparaka attacks. Mohammad Rashid was replaced with Rashid Agau, the darling of Ondu fans and minutes later, Kabon Living was fouled in the penalty box. Captain Rashid Toha stepped up to convert the spotkick. Close to the end of normal time, Richard Anyama in the Ondu goal who had been transferred from Saints in January (along with Ivan Mbowa) conceded the second equaliser from a freekick. It seemed like the visitors were safe but after the four additional minutes were over, Kabon also known as Messi scored and relegated the Saints. Armymen cocked their guns while disgruntled visiting fans and officials pursued the referee plus his linesmen. After the chaos subsided minutes later, the game resumed until the 100th minute but Ondu still maintained their Unbeaten Record at home in their maiden top flight season. The last team to defeat them at Greenlight Stadium was Nebbi Central three years behind. In the final game of the season at Kakindu Stadium in Jinja, Dickens Okwir put Ondu ahead in the 28th minute while BUL FC had a goal disallowed immediately after. However, after some pressure, the hosts equalised in the 57th minute. This season finale in which Ibrahim Faizul was redcarded ended 1‚Äì1. Onduparaka ended their first Azam Uganda Premier League season in 5th place on 45 points. Despite a negative goal difference, Ondu managed 11 wins, 12 draws and 7 losses in 30 games. At the Uganda Premier League Awards on 27 July 2017, Muhammad Shaban was included in the Azam UPL Team of the Year. Each player in the list receives 250,000 UgX courtesy of Betway. Meanwhile, Ondu fans were voted the Best Fans in the same gala at Kampala's Imperial Royale. =2017‚Äì18 season= Shaban and Rashid Toha were sponsored for trials in South Africa but returned in the middle of July 2017. During pre-season with some new players, Onduparaka won 1‚Äì0 in their first friendly before beating Nyowa Young Elephants 4‚Äì1 with goals from Caesar Okhuti, Dickens Okwi and newcomer Karim Ndugwa who netted a brace. Then they visited Masindi (1‚Äì1, Ndugwa again) and Hoima. In the rain on Eid Adha Day (1 September 2017), Ondu beat JKS 3‚Äì0 with goals from Agau, Gadinho and Shaban who was returning from injury. Three days later, Betway announced a 600 Million Shilling sponsorship package for Onduparaka's transport and player welfare.Betway Renew Onduparaka Partnership With Shs 600 Million Deal 7 September, they would face Jinja Kirinya SS in a friendly. The 2018 UPL season started on 12 September 2017 and Ondu drew 0‚Äì0 with Proline FC at Greenlight Stadium despite 6 additional minutes in the second half. Four days later amidst a transfer request from Shaban who later joined KCCA, veteran Caesar Okhuti scored twice away to Maroons in Luzira to give Ondu their first win of the season. On 19 September 2017, KCCA whipped Ondu 4‚Äì1. On 27 September 2017, Ondu beat Police FC 1‚Äì0 in Arua. On 14 October 2017 in Arua, Ondu beat Soana FC 2‚Äì0 with early goals from Captain Rashid Toha (1st minute) and the debutant from Jinja Municipal Council - Viane Sekajugo (ninth minute). Ondu pushed to the same 10 points with the table leaders but in 3rd place while Soana remained second last with four points. Earlier that day, MTN Uganda had announced a one-year 390 Million UgX sponsorship deal for Onduparaka FC. During a press conference at Desert Breeze Hotel Arua, Val Oketcho, the MTN Uganda Corporate Communications Manager handed over a dummy cheque to Ondu Patron Honourable Bernard Atiku (who is also the Ayivu County MP).Onduparaka Unveil MTN as Sponsors in Multi Million Deal 21 October 2017, Ondu beat Express FC 2‚Äì1 at Wankulukuku to go top of the table (until the following Wednesday when an own goal by Kirinya Jinja SS at Nambole propelled Police FC to the summit on goal difference). Alfred Leku's 46th-minute goal and an acrobatic 92nd minute volley from veteran Caesar Okhuti (who has played for both teams) gave the visitors three points. Serunkuma got the goal for Express after a goalless first half. On 28 October 2017, Ondu and Vipers played out a goalless draw in Arua. Leku was ineligible to play because he was on loan from Vipers, Toha had a groin injury he picked from the Express game while Agau had a toe injury but Gasper was returning. The goalless draw nevertheless took Ondu back to the summit by a one-point difference until 31 October when Police beat hosts UPDF in Bombo by 1‚Äì0. On 3 November, Ondu drew 0‚Äì0 with BUL FC in Jinja. On 7 November 2017, a jubilant Mbarara held Ondu to a 0‚Äì0 draw in Arua, their second goalless draw in a week. On 18 November 2017, Ondu beat Kirinya Jinja SS 1‚Äì0 in Arua courtesy of a penalty converted by goalkeeper Sebwato placing them one point behind table leaders Police FC but in 4th tied with KCCA and Villa on 19 points. Beginning the day in 5th place, Karim Bida's comeback brace gave Ondu a 2‚Äì1 victory over UPDF in Arua on 28 November 2017 at a time when Caterpillar goalkeeper Nicholas Sebwato (nicknamed Mr. Safe Hands) had been summoned for national duty ahead of the CECAFA Challenge Cup. This game marked the middle of the season. Ondu's second half-end of the season began on 19 December 2017 with a 2‚Äì1 loss to Masavu FC.

It may also be used to refer to aspects of maintenance which are not specifically covered by the technical departments. The term is used in both naval and merchant shipping, but naval vessel husbandry may also be used for specific reference to naval vessels. Etymology Ships husbandry diving Underwater ships husbandry can be financially advantageous when it eliminates the need for dry-dock repairs or extends the interval between dry-dockings, and reduces the time a ship is required to stay in dry- dock. Underwater ship husbandry includes the following operations, usually done by commercial divers, though some can be done by ROVs or robotic machinery: * Underwater hull cleaning to remove fouling organisms which increase drag, and therefore reduce top speed and increase fuel consumption. Such cleaning may be of the entire hull or parts thereof, particularly propellers, shafts and thrusters. The underwater hull may be inspected prior to cleaning, and the amount of cleaning done may depend on the inspection results. Hull cleaning may be done by divers using hand held or self-propelled mechanical brushing equipment, water jets or scrapers. * Non-destructive testing and inspection including fouling surveys, inspection of known or suspected damage to structure, equipment or coatings, and inspection of repairs. Several methods may be used, including visual inspection, video recording and magnetic particle testing. * Underwater painting is done to repair paintwork after repairs, or where small areas of paint have been damaged or have worn out. Suitable paints are applied by the diver using brush or roller. * Fiberglass repair, can be hull repair or propeller shaft protective coating repair. Repair of fibreglass shaft coating is generally done in a dry habitat mounted over the shaft, allowing access through the open bottom for the divers. The shaft is first cleaned before wrapping with a new layer of sheathing. * Underwater welding is either done in a submerged dry habitat or wet. Better quality welds can be achieved in dry conditions as the cooling rate is reduced and there is less problem with hydrogen embrittlement. Weld surfaces are prepared by cleaning with scrapers, chipping hammers or hand-held brushes, and pneumatic or hydraulic grinding tools. * Minor repairs to the rubber coating of sonar domes can be done by divers. This entails removal of damaged rubber, preparation of the surface and application of a rubber patch using a suitable adhesive. =Environmental impact= Several of the operations classified as ship husbandry will release some quantity of harmful material into the water, particularly hull cleaning operations which will release antifouling toxins. Underwater ship husbandry can cause an adverse environmental effect as significant amounts of copper and zinc are released by underwater hull scrubbing. Alien biofouling organisms may also be released during this process. =Diving under the hull= The underside of the hull is an overhead environment with no direct vertical access to the surface. As such it constitutes an entrapment hazard, particularly under large vessels where it may be too dark due to low natural light or turbid water to see the way to the side of the hull. The bottom of the largest ships is mostly flat and featureless, exacerbating the problem. Only surface-supplied diving is authorised for this work in most jurisdictions, as this not only secures the diver's breathing gas supply, but also provides a guideline to the exit point. The use of mechanised bottom scrubbing devices which are steered along the hull surface by a diver and scrub it with rotary brushes has been linked with high release of environmental toxins. There is also a hazard of crushing if the clearance is small and the tide range is large.

He is considered as \\"one of the most popular and celebrated novelists of Odisa\\". Mohanty was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1958 for his novel, Kaa, published in 1956, and was one of the fellows of the Sahitya Akademi. Mohanty died on 6 April 1994 at the age of 87.  Personal life  Kanhu Charan Mohanty was born on 11 August 1906 in Nagabali village of Sonepur, India, to an Odia family. He is an elder brother of Gopinath Mohanty (1914‚Äì91) who was also a Jnanpith Award-winning (1974) Odia novelist. He completed his schooling at Cuttack and joined an engineering college which he was forced to leave due to financial difficulties. Later, he completed his graduation from Ravenshaw College (now Ravenshaw University) in 1929. Mohanty joined as a clerk in Government Service and retired as a Senior Administrative Officer in 1964. Mohanty died on 6 April 1994 at the age of 87.  Literary works  Mohanty wrote his first novel Utshabe Byasane during 1923‚Äì24. However, the novel was never published and its manuscript could not be traced later. His novels first published in 1930, Arana and Patalaka. His 1932 published novel Nishpatti is considered as the first Oriya novel to depict the events of a marriage between a child and a widow. He published two novels in 1944, Bhala Paibara Sesha Katha and Tunda Baida. Bhala Paibara Sesha Katha portrays the untouchability in the Indian society and Tunda Baida depicts the relation between a widow and her younger brother-in-law and rumors spread about them by villagers. While Haa Anna (1935) was set against the backdrop of Orissa famine of 1866, his 1946 published novel Shasti (Punishment) depicts famine's aftermath and pestilence during the years 1866 and 1870. Both the novels portrayed the romantic love stories with social and economical inequality. His Sahitya Akademi Award-winning novel Kaa (Impersonation, 1956) deals with the subject of female infertility and maternal death. In Kshana Kshanake Ana (The World Changes Every Moment, 1975) Mohanty narrates the story of step-mothers and domestic violence. He published fifty-six novels in a career spanning over six decades from 1930 to 1985 with Jaksha (1985) being his last published novel.  Legacy  Mohanty is considered as \\"one of the most popular and celebrated novelists of Odisha\\". He is known for depicting social realism and most of his work involved problems associated with plight of woman, caste and economic exploitation. It was noted that he, being an upper caste writer, portrayed lower caste characters in his writings. His novels are set around coastal Odisha. Scholar Sisir Kumar Das appreciated Mohanty's authentic illustration of regions compared to actual geographical location but noted that the author has tendency to create an Utopian world while representing the human life. Shasti (1946) is considered as \\"one of the best progressive writings in Oriya\\" and \\"one of the earliest novels to use psychoanalysis to reveal different moods and emotions of its characters\\". Mohanty's work, in terms of its theme and writing style, is noted to be on the similar lines of another Odia novelist Fakir Mohan Senapati (1843‚Äì1918) with more critical social and cultural evaluation but lacking sense of humour and satire of Senapati. He said to have been influenced by The Woodlanders (1887) by Thomas Hardy for Shasti and by Pavilion of Women (1946) by Pearl S. Buck for Kaa (Impersonation, 1956). In 2006, The Government of Odisha decided to republish three Odia novels, Kaa by Mohanty, Matira Manisha (1931) by Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, and Mamu (1913) by Fakir Mohan Senapati to increase the popularity of Odia language among the youth. In January 2007, the Sahitya Akademi and Sarala Sahitya Sansad organised a two-day national seminar, \\"Kanhu Charan and the Rise of Indian Novel\\", to commemorate Mohanty's birth centenary. Odia novelist and a pioneer member of Sarala Sahitya Sansad, Pravakar Swain, noted that \\"[Mohanty's] books had a social commitment and sympathy for the insulted and the injured\\".  Artistic depiction of novels  Some of Mohanty's novels were later made into films. 1965 Odia film Abhinetri (The Actress) is based on his 1947 published novel by the same name and marked first occurrence of Dual role, played by Jharna Das, in Odia cinema. Another novel Kaa (1956) was later made into a film Kaa (1965). The film was awarded the Certificate of Merit for the Best Feature Film in Odia at 14th National Film Awards. Tunda Baida (Gossip, 1944) was also made into a film in 1987 by the same name.  Awards  Mohanty won several awards for his literary work. He won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1958 for Kaa, the Jeevan Rang Prize in 1970, and the Neela Saila Award in 1992. On 4 February 1994, the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, selected him as its fellow, the highest honour conferred by the Akademi; however, Mohanty died on 6 April 1994 before the honour could formally be conferred upon him.

He won the Sahitya Akademi Award in Sindhi in 1985 for his collection of ghazals Mero Siji (1984) and was conferred with the Sahitya Akademi fellowship in 2013, the highest honour of the Sahitya Akademi.  Biography  Arjan Jethanand Tanwani was born in Karachi (now in Pakistan) on 7 January 1930 in a Sindhi family. He participated in the Quit India Movement and was a Secretary of Students's Union at Kandiaro High School. In 1947, he matriculated from Bombay University. After the Partition of India, after brief stay in Bombay (now Mumbai) and Jaipur, his family migrated to Ahmedabad, India where he joined the Post and Telegraph Department. In 1989, he retired from the service as the Postmaster General from Gondal. He worked as an All India Radio artist and was on the Sindhi Advisory Board of Central Sahitya Akademi for a decade. A book, Arjan Hasid: A Study, was published in 1996 based on his life and works. He was Chairman of the Gujarat Sahitya Akademi in 2002. In 2004, he participated in 1st Indo-Pak Writers' conference at New Delhi and visited Sindh, Pakistan as a member of Indo-Pak conference where he attended the \\"Shah-Sachal-Sami International Seminar\\" at Karachi and presented a scholarly paper on 18th-century Sindhi poet Sami. He died on 26 December 2019 at 2:15 am in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.  Literary works  Tanwani started writing poetry in 1956 and later wrote under the pen name Hasid. He was a member and secretary of Sindhi Sahit Sangat, Ahmedabad. Soon, his poems were published in leading magazines. In 1958, he participated in Akhil Bharat Sindhi Sahit Sammelan at Mumbai and All India 'Mushaira'. His first published work was Suwasan Jee Surhaan (Fragrance of Breath, 1966), a collection of poems and ghazals. His next work Pathar Pathar Ka'ndaa Ka'ndaa (Every Stone, Every Throne, 1974) was a collection of ghazals. In 1983, he wrote a musical opera, Umar Marueee, based on Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai's poetry and was composed by Chaman Tapodan. In 1985, his collection of ghazals Mero Siji (The Soiled Son, 1984) brought him the Sahitya Akademi Award. He edited a book based on life and works of poet Hari Daryani 'Dilgir', Hujan Hota Hayaat (1986). His next two publications were collections of ghazals, Mogo (The Dullard, 1994) and Unjna (The Thirst, 1999). Hasid also translated a Hindi book Jaishankar Prasad (1995) by Ramesh Chandra Shah. Hasid's next collection was published in 2006, Saahee Patje (Relax a While). In 2008, he compiled and edited an anthology Aazadia Khaanpoi Sindhi Ghazal (Anthology of Post Independence Sindhi Ghazals). His 2009 collection, Na le'n Na (No, Not So), is based on the subject of Post-Partition migration. He worked as a lyricist for 2012 Sindhi film Halyo Aa Putt Actor Thiyan. Many of his ghazals are set to tune by various composers.  Writing style and reception  Hasid's debut work Suwasan Jee Surhaan was appreciated for being \\"an eclectic fusion of progressive ideas and traditional romance\\" and noted for invoking \\"the sentiment of Srinagar\\". The Pathar Pathar Ka'ndaa Ka'ndaa is considered to have contributed to Naee'n Kavita (New Wave movement in poetry). His Mero Siji introduced Synesthesia to Sindhi poetry and Hasid was lauded for freeing \\"Sindhi poetry form its pedantry and lexical shackles by employing a refreshing new idiom which greatly exploited the suggestivity and expressivity of the language\\". Mogo further improvised synesthesia by experimenting with the language and the senses. In Unjna, he extensively used personification to create \\"unique sensual world\\". For his latest publication Na le'n Na, Hasid expressed modern sensitivity and concerns using traditional poetry forms like Doha, Batis, and Waais. His initial work was considered to be progressive poetry. Hasid started writing romantic poetry which had \\"a share of painful mixed metaphors\\". He changed his writing style with Mero Siji and avoided any romantic words which was considered as \\"a rebellion against oneself\\". Critic Param Abichandani noted that Hasid uses \\"poetry as an anodyne\\" which is \\"not a cure, but is certainly alleviating\\". He also mentioned that Hasid's new ghazals \\"talk about us and they talk about only this day, the painful, dark today, and not the yesterdays. His poems are pure psychic automation expressing our thoughts, our feelings\\". To him, writing is \\"devout austerity a severe penance. It soothes, gratifies, whimpers, speeches, clenches lists and sews lips\\"  Recognition  Hasid won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1985 for Mero Siji, the Gujarat Sindhi Akademi Gaurav Puraskar in 1998, the Lifetime Achievement Award by National Council for Promotion of Sindhi Language in 2006, the Tagore Literature Award in 2011 for Na le'n Na, and the Lifetime Achievement Award by Akhil Bharat Sindhi Boli Sabha in 2012. In 2013, the Sahitya Akademi fellowship, the highest honour conferred by the Sahitya Akademi, was bestowed upon him.  Personal life  Hasid married Parpati in 1947 at Kandiaro. She died in 2016. They had three sons, Luxman, Gangaram and Mohan; and a daughter, Parmeshwar.

Overview  Muntakhab-ut- Tawarikh is a general history of the Muslims in India from Sabuktigin to 1595, commenced in 1590 followed by biographies of shaykhs, scholars, physicians and poets. \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni began writing this history in the first half of 1590. The book was completed in October 1595. Its comprises on the 618 solar year's historic events. Muntakhab-ut-Tawarikh is based largely on Khawaja Nƒ´zƒÅm-ud-Din Ahmad Sirhindi's TabakƒÅt-i-Akbar ShƒÅhi (also known as TabakƒÅt-i- Akbari), with characteristic asides by \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni.

The third part contains the biographical accounts of the Saints, Poets and men of letters who were either known to him, or were attached to the court of Akbar. The accounts relate to 38 Shaykhs (religious leaders), 69 scholars, 15 philosophers, physicians and 67 poets. The work is noted for its hostile comments on Akbar's religious activities. Its existence was apparently kept secret until at least the tenth year of Jahangir's reign (1615). When MullƒÅ 'Abd al-BƒÅƒ∑ƒ´ Nahawandƒ´, author of Ma'ƒÅthir-i- Rahimƒ´, did not know of it when he completed his work in 1616. According to Shaykh Muhammad Baƒ∑ƒÅ SahƒÅranp≈´rƒ´, author of Mir'ƒÅt al-'ƒÄlam, composed in 1667, said \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni's children asserted to Jahangir that they did not know of the existence of the work.

Matrosov is best known for his work Happiness Is Not Far on a Perm riverbank. Life and work Boris Matrosov was born in 1965 in Moscow. From 1986 to 1988 he was a member of World Champions (with Konstantin Latyshev, Andrei Yakhnin, Giya Abramishvili, and Konstantin Zvezdochetov, who was part of the group in its early days). In 1988, he was the Chairman of the Moscow Avant-Garde Club (CLAVA). From 1988 to 1990 he worked in the studios in Furmanny Lane, and from 1990 to 1994 at Chistye Prudy. He has been a member of the Moscow Union of Artists since 1994 and is currently based in Moscow. World Champions were known for mocking the seriousness of the practices of the older generation of Moscow Conceptualists, such as Andrei Monastyrsky and Collective Actions. They received critical acclaim for absurdist actions like Strokes of Joy (where they worked collectively to create a drawing of random objects on a large sheet of paper attached to a wall) and The Gray Sea (in which Abramishvili brought a bottle of water from the White Sea and Zvezdochotov from the Black Sea, and the group mixed the water in a little pool, announcing the discovery of a new sea). After the group broke up, Matrosov continued to work solo. He created ‚Äúimages of images‚Äù of the everyday world: interiors and landscapes painted minimally using black lines and monochrome color. In 2005, he made a text object Happiness Is Not Far, for the Art-Pole Festival, curated by Aidan Salakhova. The object was later installed on a riverbank in Perm, becoming an unofficial symbol of the city. In 2016, Matrosov made an object No, She Couldn‚Äôt Have Known How It Would All‚Ä¶ (based on the text from his earlier work) on the rooftop of Garage Museum of Contemporary Art Matrosov's works are in the collections of the State Tretyakov Gallery, Pierre-Christian Brochet, Paquita Escofet Miro, Igor Markin and Sergey Borisov Solo exhibitions 2015 ‚Äî Only Paper.

In response the Syrian Army fired several S-200 missiles at Israeli jets above Golan Heights. Israel reported that one Syrian missile had been shot down by an Arrow 2 missile, while none of its aircraft had been damaged. Israel stated it was targeting weapon shipments headed toward anti-Israeli forces, specifically Hezbollah, in Lebanon, while the Syrian Army claimed that a military site near Palmyra had been struck. Syria claimed to have shot down one Israeli aircraft. Israel denied Syria's claim that one jet fighter was shot down and another damaged. Israel has not reported any pilots or aircraft missing in Syria, or anywhere else in the Middle East following the incident. Also, neither Syria nor Hezbollah have shown photos or video of downed Israeli aircraft or personnel. According to some sources, the incident was the first time Israeli officials clearly confirmed an Israeli strike against Hezbollah during the Syrian Civil War. Following a generic statement by the Israeli Defense Forces reading \\"Several anti-aircraft missiles were launched from Syria following the mission, and IDF aerial defense systems intercepted one of the missiles. At no point was the safety of Israeli civilians or the IAF aircraft compromised\\", several news reports started speculating about the use of the Arrow system to defend jet fighters from hostile surface to air missiles. However other Israeli news publications confirmed that the initial reading of the IDF statement was wrong; in fact, the IDF said that the jet fighters were never in danger and the missiles were far from the planes. But the IDF detected Syrian S-200 missiles on course to reach Israel, so the Arrow missile system was used to prevent them falling on settled areas. Indeed, a S-200, after losing its target, hence going ballistic, has approximately the size, the speed and the range of a battlefield artillery rocket such as the FROG-7, which is one of the very standard targets the Israeli missile defense is shaped around. The Jordanian Armed Forces reported that a part of the Arrow missile fell in its territory. There were no casualties in Jordan.  Aftermath  S-200 missile, similar to the ones fired at Israeli Air Force fighter jets, seen here in a Ukrainian museum On 19 March 2017, Israeli defense minister Avigdor Liberman said that if Syria uses its air defense system against Israeli aircraft again, Israel will respond by targeting Syrian air defense systems. On 19 March an Israeli Skylark drone crashed in Syria reportedly due to human error.The drone went down due to human error made by the troops who were flying it There were further reports on alleged Israeli airstrikes on 22 March 2017, with another round of bombings carried out on suspected Hezbollah targets near Damascus. On 25 March 2017, the Syrian government said that it will respond to future Israeli strikes on Syrian military targets with Scud missile attacks against IDF bases, and also it will retaliate against future strikes on Syrian civilian targets by firing Scud missiles at the Israeli city of Haifa.

His channel, known as The Amazing Atheist, rose to prominence through Kirk's criticism of religion. Kirk has since expanded his focus to other political and social issues. Kirk has more than 1 million subscribers on his main channel, and more than 445 million views in total. From 2014 until 2017, he was one of the hosts of The Drunken Peasants, a YouTube news podcast focused on current events and interviews. Early life Kirk was born in Pasadena, California, though he was primarily raised in Mandeville, Louisiana. His father was Thomas James Kirk Jr. (July 1, 1946 ‚Äì January 3, 2008), who operated several fraudulent higher education organizations and served three years in U.S. federal prison following a plea deal.Associated Press (September 25, 1996). Minister indicted on fraud charges involving church-run university. Dallas Morning News At the age of sixteen, Kirk dropped out of high school with aspirations of being an author. Kirk began posting videos on YouTube in November 2006.  History  In 2007, Kirk posted a video which included a warning about the mental instability of 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen, who would later perpetrate the Jokela school shooting. In 2012, Kirk was widely criticized for incendiary comments made on Reddit before he deleted his account. In their argument about trigger warnings, Kirk repeatedly stated that one of the participants, a self-described rape victim, should be raped again. Science blogger PZ Myers condemned these posts and went on to debate many of Kirk's past claims about feminism, writing that \\"this kind of thing has always been part of his YouTube schtick.\\" After the incident, Kirk apologized to the Reddit user in a private message and later made a public apology. Kirk addressed the issue further in a 2014 video entitled, \\"Rape, Feminism, and The Amazing Atheist,\\" in which he again apologized for the incident and explained the context in which it happened: his remarks were meant to be satirical commentary on trigger warnings. In 2013, Kirk was a guest on a CNN panel, where he discussed the rise of atheism in America with Christian theologian William Lane Craig. Kirk has made two appearances on The Joe Rogan Experience, one in January 2016 and another in March 2017. Kirk interviewed Milo Yiannopoulos for The Drunken Peasants podcast in 2016. In 2017 Breitbart, CPAC and Simon & Schuster severed their ties with Yiannopoulos based on comments from the episode where Yiannopoulos spoke positively of sexual relationships between boys and adult men. Kirk left The Drunken Peasants at the end of 2017 with co-hosts Scotty Kirk and Paul Parkey Jr. and together they started their own podcast in early 2018, known as DEEP FAT FRIED.  Politics  Although Kirk has become well known for his liberal politics, he espoused libertarian views earlier on The Amazing Atheist channel and later deleted these videos. In multiple videos, he espoused support for 2016/2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

His artistic career began with the Objects of Protection solo exhibition, which took place on the Start Platform in Winzavod (Moscow) in late 2008 ‚Äì early 2009. His debut show expressed Antufiev's key creative method and the primary topic in the focus of his practice: working with non-typical, ‚Äòorganic‚Äô materials such as bones, hair, teeth, and skin, the artist contemplates the immortality of form and the transformation of content while making visual references to shamanic practices common in Tuva region, as well as to other archaic cultures. In 2009 Antufiev took part in a number of group shows in Moscow and St. Petersburg: Needlework (PROUN Gallery, Moscow), The Space of Silence (The Red Flag Factory, St. Petersburg), and had his second solo exhibition Myths of My Childhood (Globe Gallery, ETAGI loft project, St. Petersburg).

By the 20th century the town of Aars which had grown up round it was much larger and it was necessary to expand it. In 1921 it was enlarged and extensively re-built on a cruciform plan; the re-build included the construction of a new nave. At the same time it was painted white.VisitNordjylland.com: Aars Church The baptismal font was made by Christian Andersen in 1937 from a re-cycled steam roller; it includes the symbols of the four evangelists. The church also contains a large 18th-century crucifix and an altarpiece by Rudolf Petersen dated 1923 representing the Lord's Supper. The top of the communion table is a tombstone of blue slate.

They sit like \\"Jewels\\" in a larger public park setting. This enriches the built environment. The design was inspired by Islamic architectural tradition. These are two dimensional patterns, which are transformed three dimensionally to create spaces below a complex geometric form. The buildings sit independently below the \\"jewel\\" which houses the functional requirements of the building. Dramatic public spaces are created between the two forms using the contrast of light and shadow. Local culture is reinterpreted within the buildings by using technology to deliver complexity with simplicity. The pattern is created to accommodate the cultural need for privacy, views and shading. The buildings are linked by a linear landscaped podium to the back of the buildings where the car parks and service areas are situated below ground. Visitors move from the car park via lifts and travelators to the courtyard access points at ground level. The four buildings consist of full span steel envelopes which cover a series of independent concrete buildings. This primary steel grid is wrapped in a rainscreen weathertight envelope, with glazed areas supported by secondary steel, deck and insulation. This ‚Äòinline‚Äô surface is then protected with a series of titanium composite panels. The buildings beneath are largely constructed of concrete and include a large excavated basement level connected with a series of services tunnels and MEP areas. The buildings are independently circulated with stairs and lifts and walkways, with public level access in most cases being ground level upwards.

BancoPosta does not have a banking license and cannot directly provide loans to third parties, but is involved in the promotion and placement of public loans granted by banks and financial intermediaries. The bank services are available at all post offices in Italy.  History  The Poste italiane always provided the postal savings deposits and offered POGIs. The BancoPosta was founded formally in 1999 after the restructuring by CEO Corrado Passera. It operates under the Financial Services Division company and offers collections and payments, the collection of savings and insurance products for the public. In 2000 was launched the BancoPosta account, the debit card Postamat and credit card BancoPosta Mastercard, going from 175,000 accounts in December 1999 to 1.68 million in December 2001. The success of the account and the consequent restoration was mainly due to computerization of the 14,000 post offices and creation of a new technology infrastructure (with a total budget of 670 billion lire) which allowed to improve quality and returns. Since 2001, the bank from a mere asset manager, also becomes a financial intermediary, as it is authorized by the Presidential Decree 144/01 to propose to the public the equities, bonds, shares of investment funds and loans and financing, although with above restrictions: until then the 14,000 post offices could only sell government bonds and those of the privatization.

On Theophilos' death in 842, she joined her mother as a co-empress (Augusta) and appeared as such on coins with her younger brother.

There are different accounts of Thekla's fate after her mother's fall in late 855 or early 856, but in 858 Thekla and her sisters Anna, Anastasia and Pulcheria (Maria had already died in 840) seem to have entered a nunnery in Constantinople. Thekla is said to have been living there at the time of her brother's murder by his successor Basil I in 867, with some sources stating Basil was Thekla's lover.

Twelve men were killed in the crash, including the commander of the 9th Bombardment Wing, Brigadier General and another seven were killed on the ground when the aircraft exploded. The base was later renamed  Accident  In July 1950, soon after the outbreak of the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff resolved to send ten Silverplate (nuclear-capable) Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers to Guam as a deterrent to a People's Republic of China (PRC) attack on Taiwan, (Republic of China), and for possible future use in Korea, each loaded with a Mark 4 nuclear bomb without the fissile pit. There were twenty passengers and crewmen on board B-29 44-87651 of the 99th Bombardment Squadron when it commenced takeoff from runway 21L at Fairfield- Suisun at 22:00 on Saturday, 5 August 1950, including the commander of the 9th Bombardment Wing, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis; ten men in the forward compartment and ten in the rear. The aircraft was piloted by Captain Eugene Q. Steffes, with First Lieutenant Carter W. Johnson as his co-pilot and Technical Sergeant Donald W. Moore as his flight engineer. As the aircraft reached a speed of about three-quarters of the way down the runway with the propellers rotating at 2,800 rpm, the number two (port inboard) propeller suddenly went up to 3,500 rpm. Steffes ordered the propeller feathered and the aircraft lifted off at an airspeed of , then number three (starboard inboard) propeller suddenly went to 3,500 rpm. Moore reduced its speed to 2,800 rpm by reducing the manifold pressure. Steffes attempted to retract the landing gear by moving the gear switch to the \\"up\\" position but the gear did not respond; with the undercarriage still extended, drag reduced the aircraft's airspeed to . Steffes checked the landing gear fuse; finding it satisfactory, he attempted to raise the gear again, but the gear motors did not operate. Unable to accelerate, the aircraft would not be able to clear terrain ahead, so Steffes initiated a 180-degree turn to head back for an emergency landing. The tower cleared him to land on 21L, and crash crews were alerted. The aircraft turned around but lost altitude, Steffes asked Johnson to help him with the controls, and Moore reported more trouble with number three engine. Steffes allowed the aircraft to drift to the left to avoid a nearby trailer park, and the aircraft struck the ground at . The aircraft broke apart in the crash, and burst into flames, the entire nose section breaking off. The escape hatches there were jammed and would not open, but passengers and crew were able to exit through a hole in the nose caused by the crash, and through a window from which the commander and co-pilot removed the plexiglas. Travis was thrown clear from the wreckage but died from his injuries on his way to hospital. One other man in the forward section, Staff Sergeant Joseph Prachniak, was also fatally injured. All ten people in the rear compartment died in the crash. Only one of the twenty aircraft occupants, First Lieutenant C.E. Boyce, escaped uninjured. Four men were on duty in the base bake shop near where the forward section came to rest. They immediately ran to assist. They heard cries for help from the nose section, and helped to remove eight men from the wreckage. Firefighters arrived on the scene, as did military police and spectators. When .50 caliber ammunition started to cook off, Sergeant Lewis Siqueira, who was in charge of the bake shop detail, ordered his men out of the area. Sergeant Paul P. Ramoneda started to do so, but then turned back to help men still trapped in the burning aircraft. Lieutenant Colonel Raymond E. Holsey, the highest-ranking officer on the scene, feared the of explosives in the Mark 4 would explode. He ordered the large crowd of rescuers and onlookers to get clear, and told the firefighters to let it burn. The firefighters and onlookers did not comply. About 20 minutes after the crash, the high explosives in the bomb detonated, spreading wreckage and burning fuel over a area. The explosion blew a crater in the ground across and deep. An additional seven people who were not part of the crew died on the ground in the explosion, including Ramoneda and five firefighters. All of the base's fire trucks were destroyed, along with dozens of private vehicles in the nearby trailer park, which was set on fire. Some 49 people were admitted to the hospital, while another 124 were treated for minor injuries. Two women had their right foot amputated.  Aftermath  The crash investigators found that the number two propeller was indeed feathered. The cause of the problem was improper adjustment during maintenance on 22 July 1950, when all four propellers were changed. A problem was detected with number two during a test flight, and the ground crew was instructed to install new contactors. There was no paperwork indicating that this was done, and the entire maintenance crew was killed in the crash. The number three engine and propeller were not found. The generators were found to be working, so there was sufficient electrical power to retract the landing gear. No crew members recalled hearing the landing gear motors. The switches could not be checked due to the degree of destruction of the aircraft, but the fuse was intact. It was noted that there were only six seat belts for the ten men in the forward compartment. Their report made four recommendations: # That procedures regarding propellers be reviewed and improved so as to identify malfunctions on the ground; # That more emphasis be placed on training pilots and flight engineers in procedures for handling propeller problems; # That there should be better follow-up of maintenance problems; and # That escape exits and tunnels should be kept clear of baggage. USAF B-29 operating procedures were changed as a result of the investigation; aircraft with the same type of propellers as 44-87651 were required to be test-flown after corrective maintenance, and the number of persons permitted aboard an operational flight was reduced to 16, as it was felt that overloading and an inadequate number of safety belts in the accident aircraft contributed to the high loss of life. The 19 bodies were taken to the McCune Garden Chapel in Vacaville. The Air Force announced that the aircraft was on a \\"training mission\\". Ramoneda was posthumously awarded the Soldier's Medal, the Purple Heart and the Cheney Award. Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base was officially renamed Travis Air Force Base in honor of the dead general on 20 October 1950. A formal renaming ceremony was held on 20 April 1951, presided over by the Governor of California, Earl Warren, which was attended by Travis's family. Only in 1994 was it revealed that an atomic bomb was involved, when an interview with Holsey was published posthumously. The Mark 4 nuclear bomb contained a depleted uranium tamper as well as radioactive material inside the electronics making up the arming and firing circuits. There was also some radium in the dials in the cockpit. A public health assessment found no detectable levels of uranium at the crash site.

In 2019, the festival dates will move to 1‚Äì7 September. Name The festival takes its name from a visit by the composer Felix Mendelssohn to Scotland in 1829. Although only twenty years old, Mendelssohn was already an established composer and conductor. The natural beauty of Scotland and its rich history of fact and fable delighted the young composer and inspired his Symphony No. 3, Scottish.See \\"The Journey North\\" in Mendelssohn in Scotland website, accessed 9 January 2015. Mendelssohn stayed in Tobermory on Mull en route to Staffa where he visited Fingal's Cave. The concert overture known both as The Hebrides and as Fingal's Cave was composed shortly after his visit, and was originally entitled 'The Lonely Island'. Mendelssohn sent a postcard to his family with the opening phrase of the overture written on it. In a note to his sister, Fanny Mendelssohn he said: \\"In order to make you understand how extraordinarily the Hebrides affected me, I send you the following, which came into my head there.\\" The festival that now bears his name was conceived as a musical pilgrimage in commemoration of Mendelssohn's visit. History The festival was founded in 1988 by the violinist Leonard Friedman, as a week of music- making, concentrating on string chamber music, where the participants were a blend of established professionals and students, at which audiences were welcome at no cost. Following Friedman's death in 1994, the festival has maintained this pattern with artistic direction being provided by Levon Chilingirian (2003‚Äì2016), and the Doric String Quartet (2018 to present). The festival is administered by a trust which organises the events and pays the expenses of the participants and professionals. Since 2016 the festival has been administered by Sound Waves SCIO.http://www.oscr.org.uk/search- oscr/charity-details?number=SC044935 References External links *Mendelssohn on Mull Festival web site Classical music festivals in Scotland Chamber music festivals Music festivals established in 1988 1988 establishments in Scotland Felix Mendelssohn ","title":"Mendelssohn on Mull Festival"},{"id":"53511872","text":"Murat Emir (born 31 March 1969) is a Turkish ophthalmologist, jurist and politician from the Republican People's Party (CHP) who has served as the Member of Parliament for Ankara (II) since June 2015.

It is based out of the city of Cusco, Peru where its main offices, museum and shop are located. The CTTC works in support of indigenous weavers from the Cusco region to recover traditional Cusque√±an textiles. The organization currently partners with ten communities from the Cusco region: Accha Alta, Acopia, Chahuaytire, Chinchero, Huacatinco, Mahuaypampa, Patabamba, Pitumarca, Santa Cruz de Sallac, and Santo Tomas (Chumbivilcas). Dye workshop in Pitumarca held by the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco.  Mission and vision  The CTTC's mission is to \\"promote the empowerment of weavers through the sustainable practice of Peruvian ancestral textile traditions in the Cusco region. This enables the weavers to maintain their identity and textile traditions while improving their quality of life through workshops, opportunities, and the promotion of their textile art.\\" The CTTC's aim is to revive Pre-Columbian textile traditions and provide support to weaving communities. Due to racism, colonialism, poverty, and more, textile traditions in the Cusco region were in danger of disappearing during the 20th century. In the Andes, textiles are an important part of everyday life and a key component of local culture. This ancient way of life, passed down for thousands of years from generation to generation, has been at risk since the days of the Conquest. Traditional textiles were such a strong symbol of indigenous identity and resistance to colonial rule, that the Spanish outlawed their creation and use. Despite this, the people of the Andes continued practicing their textile traditions until the 20th century. Under pressure from changes brought about by globalization, including the introduction of chemical dyes and fibers, traditional textiles experienced a dramatic decline in the 1900s. Since 1996, the CTTC has worked to empower weavers and achieve its vision \\"To place the weaver of ancestral textiles as a recognized global artist, forging a just recognition by society and assuring the continuity of the ancestral textile practice.\\"  History  Since the 1960s, an informal group of women weavers from the community of Chinchero gathered together to revive textile traditions and earn an independent income from male relatives through the sale of their textiles in the tourist market. When the husband and wife pair of ethnobotnists Christine and Ed Franquemont arrived in Chinchero in the 1970s to conduct research, they encouraged the weavers to continue their community organizing work. With the support of the Franquemonts and other international friends, the group of weavers founded a cultural center in Chinchero. When this cultural center failed, the weavers re-organized under the leadership of Nilda Calla√±aupa Alvarez to found the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco (CTTC). The CTTC was founded in 1996 as a non-profit organization registered with APCI in Peru by weavers from Chinchero and their international supporters. Key founders of the CTTC include: Nilda Calla√±aupa Alvarez, Elizabeth and David Van Buskirk, Maria Tocco, Christine and Ed Franquemont, Yolanda Jaime Calla√±aupa, Yenny Calla√±aupa, Flora Calla√±aupa de Hendrickson, Betty Doerr, and Tim Wells, amongst many others. The CTTC originally partner with a handful of communities in the Cusco region to revive textile traditions, including the communities of Accha Alta, Chahuaytire, Chinchero and Pitumarca. Nilda Calla√±aupa Alvarez has served as director of CTTC since 1996. The board of directors includes: Nilda Calla√±aupa Alvarez, Flora Calla√±aupa de Hendrickson, Yolanda Jaime Calla√±aupa, Hilda Roque Perez, Miriam Luna, and Betty Doerr. Until 2001 the CTTC was run out of the basement of the home of Nilda Calla√±aupa Alvarez. After an extensive capital campaign, the CTTC purchased and remodeled a building on Av. Sol 603, Cusco, Per√∫ to house its offices, museum, and store. In 2010 the CTTC held Tinkuy 2010: Gathering of Weavers, an international conference that gathered together indigenous weavers, textile artists, art historians, anthropologists and others to discuss and share textile traditions from around th world. In 2013, CTTC organized the second Tinkuy titled Tinkuy 2013: Gathering of Weavers.  The weaving associations  The CTTC has partnered with ten communities from the Cusco region: Accha Alta, Acopia, Chahuaytire, Chinchero, Huacatinco, Mahuaypampa, Patabamba, Pitumarca, Santa Cruz de Sallac, and Santo Tomas (Chumbivilcas). In each community the weavers have formed autonomous weaving associations, each registered with the Peruvian government. Each weaving association is self-governed through elected officials (President, Vice- President, Secretary, Treasurer), who are elected once a year. Each weaving association determines its own rules and regulates member participation. In each community the CTTC has built a weaving center for the associations where the weavers can gather to meet and work. The weaving centers are composed of a central grassy courtyard for weaving in good weather while the surrounding complex of buildings are used for weaving in poor weather conditions, meetings, and include space for storage and a kitchen. Each association gathers once a week in their weaving center to work and organize. = Accha Alta = Association: \\"Centro de Tejedores Munay Pallay Awaqkuna de Accha Alta\\" Community: Accha Alta District: Calca Province: Calca Region: Cusco Accha Alta is located approximately 2 hours northeast of the city of Cusco. Nestled on a steep mountain slope next to the ruins of Ankasmarka, an ancient Incan granary, this remote mountain community looks out over the valley below. Most people in Accha Alta only speak Quechua, the local indigenous language, and rely on their chakras (fields) to produce much of the food they need for their families. At 12,930 feet above sea level, very few crops grow in the thin mountain air except for potatoes and other tubers. Accha Alta is well known for its many potato varieties and people from as far away as Cusco come to buy Accha Alta potatoes. The community of Accha Alta began working with the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco in 1998. In the beginning almost all of the association members knew how to weave, but solely used synthetic fibers. Since 1998, the weavers have returned to using natural materials, which includes natural dyes in sheep, alpaca, and llama wool. Accha Alta weavers are very proud of their traditions, and place emphasis on the young weavers, ensuring that their traditions are carried on into the future. There are approximately 40 adult members in Accha Alta's weaving association and 35 children. Accha Alta textiles are recognized for their thin sections of plain weave and wide designs in the ley (supplementary warp) technique. Traditional textiles from Accha Alta are white and red. Common designs include patterns of lakes, which are represented as diamonds, for example, wasqa qocha, or long lakes. Accha Alta textile artists manage a number of techniques, including: backstrap weaving in the ley technique, backstrap weaving in the doble cara technique, knitting (including the Qhurpus knitting technique), sling braiding, rope braiding, the tubular border weaving chichilla, and the crotcheted stitch known as kumpay used on the edges of textiles. = Acopia = Association: \\"Centro de Tejedores Cuatro Lagunas de Acopia\\" Community: Acopia District: Acopia Province: Acomayo Region: Cusco Acopia is located about two hours south of the city of Cusco in an area known as the Four Lakes, or land of Valicha after a popular huayno (folk song). The four high mountain lakes provide sustenance to local people who rely on them for fishing and irrigation for their fields. Acopia is located on the banks of the third and smallest lake. The weaving tradition in Acopia nearly disappeared completely as the younger generation did not continue in the footsteps of their elders. The CTTC began working with Acopia in 2006, helping the elders pass on their knowledge to younger generations. There are approximately 30 adult members in Acopia‚Äôs weaving association and 20 children. Traditional Acopia blankets are woven with many thin designs in the doble cara (two sided warp-faced) technique. A distinguishing design from the community is organo q‚Äôenqo, a zig- zag pattern. = Chahuaytire = Association: \\"Centro de Tejedores Inka Pallay de Chahuaytire\\" Community: Chahuaytire District: Pisac Province: Calca Region: Cusco Chahuaytire is located in the mountains above the valley town of Pisaq approximately 25 miles north of the city of Cusco. There is an Incan trail that leads from the lowlands near P√≠sac to the highlands of Chahuaytire that has been in use since pre-Columbian times. Chahuaytire weavers care for flocks of alpaca, llama and sheep higher in the mountains around their community. The CTTC began working with Chahuaytire in 1999. There are approximately 35 adult members in Chahauytire's weaving association and 40 children. Chahuaytire weavers are well known locally for the high quality of their weavings. Their compact warp-faced weave, careful colour combinations, and detail to border finishes make Chahuaytire textiles some of the finest in the Cusco region. Chahuaytire weavers use both the doble cara (complementary warp) and ley (supplementary warp) techniques to create wide designs. Traditional textiles from Chahauytire are dark marooon and white. Designs are woven in dark marroon or purple on white backgrounds, while plain weave pampa sections are modulations of varying hues in dark purple. maroon and/or black. Chahuaytire weavers are experts in color combination, and modulate color tones in non- traditional textiles. A common design from Chahuaytire is tika qocha, lake with flowers, which often features on blankets and ponchos. Chahauytire blankets are characterized by their unique star, or rose, stich which unites the two sides of the blanket. = Chinchero = Association: \\"Asociaci√≥n de Tejedores Awayriqcharicheq de Chinchero\\" Community: Chinchero District: Chinchero Province: Urubamba Region: Cusco Chinchero is known as the ‚Äòbirthplace of the rainbow‚Äô and is located on a high plain 45 minutes outside the city of Cusco. The town of Chinchero is composed of smaller communities, including: Cuper Bajo, Cuper Alto, Huaypo, Yanacona, and others. Chinchero is located on the road between Cusco and Urubamba, which means that thousands of tourists pass through Chinchero en route from the airport in Cusco to the famed ruins of Machu Picchu beyond Urubamba. Many tourists stop in Chinchero to visit the ruins of the summer residence of Inca Tupac Yupanqui and to witness the town's weaving tradition. Since the CTTC began its work in the textile field, many other small textile centers have emerged in Chinchero and the town has become increasingly commercial. The Chinchero weaving association was the founding association of CTTC in 1996. There are approximately 40 adult members in the Chinchero weaving association and 40 children. Since the 1960s until today, the Association \\"Asociaci√≥n de Tejedores Awayriqcharicheq de Chinchero\\" (not to be confused with the many other textile centers in Chinchero that sprung up afterward), has succeeded in bringing weaving to the forefront of their community. The town of Chinchero is known internationally as a prominent Andean weaving community where efforts to revive traditions have also revitalized the town itself. As Chinchero is located on a major tourist byway, the weavers of the Chinchero weaving association offer demonstrations to visiting tourists and run a small store in their weaving center. = Huacatinco = Association \\"Asociaci√≥n de Tejedores Wi√±ay Awaqkuna de Huacatinco\\" Community: Huacatinco District: Ocongate Province: Quispicanchis Region: Cusco Huacatinco is the latest community to partner with CTTC; it joined the non-profit in 2011. The community is located in the Ocongate district, approximately three hours south of the city of Cusco. While Huacatinco is rich in local culture and looks out over the snow-capped peaks of the Ausungate mountain range, it is one of the most impoverished areas of Peru. Some parts of the district have been abandoned by government services and local families are forced to be self-sufficient. Most rely on their chakra (fields) and flocks of alpaca and llama for survival. Local people mostly speak Quechua, and continue to wear their traditional clothing on a daily basis. Before partnering with CTTC, weavers from the Huacatinco association found it difficult to sell their textiles. After traveling the three hours to the city of Cusco, they would search for buyers, often in vain. When a store or merchant was interested in their products, they offered extremely low prices for the detailed work. Rather than paying the weavers upfront, they would withhold payment for months, if they even paid the weavers at all. Some merchants would agree to buy the textiles, but would never follow through with their promise of future payment. Today approximately 25 adult weavers and 20 children are members of the Huacatinco weaving association. The weavers are working to finish construction on their weaving center and to investigate their textile traditions with elders. Through the fair-trade sale of their textiles with CTTC, they are assured of a steady income for their families. In Huacatinco both women and men knit elaborately patterned hats called chullo and weave fine textiles with the backstrap loom. Both men's and women's traditional clothing are elaborated with embroidery in white beads. = Mahuaypampa = Association: \\"Centro de Tejedores Virgen Inmaculada Concepci√≥n de Mahuaypampa\\" Community: Mahuaypampa District: Maras Province: Urubamba Region: Cusco Mahuaypampa is located approximately 50 km to the northwest of the city of Cusco in the Maras district, just off the highway between Cusco and Urubamba. Situated on a high altiplano, the community dedicates itself to agriculture as it is well situated on a wide rolling plain. The textile tradition in Mahuaypampa almost disappeared as few children were learning from their elders. The Mahuaypampa association partnered with the CTTC in 2000. Since then the community has worked to recover its weaving tradition. Today there are approximately 30 adult weavers and 12 children in the Mahuaypampa weaving association. Traditional designs in Mahuaypampa are small and narrow. Because of this, weavers will typically place many designs next to each other in order to build up a wider design composition. The design mayu qenqo, said to represent the Milky Way, is one of the principal designs of Mahuaypampa. Blankets in Mahuaypampa are characterized by the enagua seam, which represents petticoats and is used to unite the two halves of the textile. = Patabamba = Association: \\"Centro de Tejedores Away Paccarichiq Pallay Tika de Patabamba\\" Community: Patabamba District: Coya Province: Calca Region: Cusco Patabamba is located high in the mountains above the Sacred Valley overlooking the town of Pisac. There are many Incan ruins located around the community. A high mountain lake is located above Patabamba. Here locals pasture their flocks of sheep, alpaca and llama while also occasionally fishing for trout. Few traditional festivals are still celebrated in Patabamba. This decline in local culture is attributed to conflicts between the older Catholic tradition and new Evangelical tradition that prohibits the expression of older belief systems. As just a handful of elders knew how to weave in Patabamba, the weaving tradition nearly disappeared. The Patabamba association partnered with the CTTC in 2001 and today approximately 40 adult weavers and 15 children are members. They continue to work to revive their weaving tradition. Traditional lliklla (blankets) from Patabamba are woven with a wide sections of plain weave in red or green. Design sections are woven in the doble cara (complementary warp) technique. Often, weavers will sew a strip of blue or green fabric, often velvet, around the edge of their blankets. Over this border frame they will embroider figures in white thread, often images of fish, flowers, and birds. While this embellishment is decorative, it also serves to protect blanket edges from fraying with use. = Pitumarca = Association: \\"Asociaci√≥n de Tejedores Munay Ticlla del Distrito de Pitumarca\\" Community: Pitumarca District: Pitumarca Province: Canchis Region: Cusco Pitumarca is located approximately two hours south of the city of Cusco, off the main highway passing the town of Checacupe. Pitumarca is now a large town, and weavers from surrounding communities come down from the mountains to participate in the Pitumarca weaving association which partnered with CTTC in 1997. There are approximately 50 adult weavers and 25 children in the Pitumarca weaving association. The weavers of Pitumarca have maintained for thousands of years, from generation to generation, dozens of complex textile techniques that can be directly traced to specific pre-Columbian cultures. These include: ley (supplementary warp), doble cara, (complementary warp), amapolas (a weaving technique that allows for designs on both sides of the textiles in up to five colors), ticlla (discontinuous warp and weft), sling and rope braiding, knitting, and other techniques. Pitumarca textiles are some of the finest and most complex in the Cusco region, and the town's official slogan is the \\"Andean capital of textiles.\\" Weavers of the Pitumarca association are incredibly proud of their hard work to investigate and revive techniques like ticlla, and wear their traditional clothing with honor and pride. Pitumarca is known internationally for its revival of the ticlla (discontinuous warp and weft) technique. This complex technique allows a weaver to change the color of their warp thread by inserting sticks into their warp. The weaver warps one color between one set of warp sticks, and another color between the following set of warp sticks. The weaver then weaves the two sections together to create a unified whole. The ticlla technique can be traced as far back as the Chavin culture, and was especially important to the Paracas and Nazca who created stunning textiles solely with ticlla. The technique is unique to the pre-Columbian cultures of Peru, and cannot be found anywhere else in the world. For decades modern scholars believed that ticlla was but another unique Andean technique that had been lost to time. After beginning investigative work with the Pitumarca association, elders revealed that they still knew how to weave ticlla. Since then elders have taught younger generations, and Pitumarca is now the only community in Peru that continues to weave with ticlla. = Santa Cruz de Sallac = Association: \\"Centro de Tejedores Watay de Santa Cruz de Sallac\\" Community: Santa Cruz de Sallac District: Urcos Province: Quispicanchis Region: Cusco Santa Cruz de Sallac is located approximately two and a half hours to the south of the city of Cusco high in the mountains above the regional town of Urcos. Urcos is a market town where highways meet and merchants sell products from the Andes mountains as well as the Amazon jungle. Santa Cruz de Sallac is located on the opposite side of the valley from the highway that leads to Puerto Maldonado and the Amazon jungle. There is a sense of community in Santa Cruz de Sallac and weavers focus on community organization and assisting each other. The weaving association is very well-organized. There are approximately 45 adult weavers and 20 children in the Santa Cruz de Sallac weaving association. The association partnered with the CTTC in 2005. Weavers in the Santa Cruz de Sallac association are unique in the Cusco region for their use of embroidery to create their designs. While they also weave patterns in the ley (supplementary warp) technique, they predominately embroider geometric shapes over plain weave backgrounds. Santa Cruz de Sallac is also well known for its revival of the watay (ikat) technique. In this dyeing technique, the weaver will prepare a special warp, where he or she tightly wraps up certain sections. The weaver then dyes this warp. The unwrapped sections of warp thread are dyed, but dye cannot enter the tightly wrapped sections which remain undyed. After dyeing, the weaver unwraps the sections of wrapped warp. When the weaver mounts this warp on their loom and weaves it as plain weave, the dyed and undyed sections form a design. Besides the Ccatcca district, Santa Cruz de Sallac is one of the only communities in Peru that still maintains the watay technique which can be traced to dyeing techniques practiced by the Nazca and Huari cultures. = Santo Tomas (Chumbivilcas) = Association: \\"Asociaci√≥n de Mujeres Artesanas 'Surphuy' de Chumbivilcas\\" Community: Santo Tomas District: Santo Tomas Province: Chumbivilcas Region: Cusco Santo Tomas is the capital of the Chumbivilcas province and is located eight hours southwest from the city of Cusco. The Santo Tomas weaving center is located in the capital, but weavers from the surrounding province travel into the small city to participate. Santo Tomas is located on a high rolling plain and is known for its horseback riding tradition and cattle herds. As communities and homes are spread far apart over the rolling plains and hills, people traditionally rely on their horses for transportation. Many local festivals and traditions are based around horseback riding, and traditional clothing reflects this in the use of leather chaps, spurs, and other riding equipment. The Santo Tomas weaving association partnered with CTTC in 2007. Today approximately 20 adults and 15 children are members of the Santo Tomas weaving association. Before working with the CTTC, members of this association used acrylic yarn and chemical dyes in their textiles. After an arduous process, the weavers now use natural dyes and natural sheep wool. The textile tradition of Santo Tomas reflects their unique horseback riding tradition. Wide designs in the doble cara (complementary warp) technique often reflect horses or horses with riders. Women's traditional clothing is distinguished by bold reverse appliqu√© designs in black velvet over satin-like fabrics in bright reds, blues, and greens, making traditional dress from Santo Tomas highly distinct from other Cusco communities. Both women and men wear boots for horseback riding, while men wear elaborate leather leggings and spurs.  Education department  The mission of the CTTC's Education Department is to \\"provide an interactive space between weavers and the public through programs, investigations, and publications that promote the revaluation of ancestral textiles.\\" The vision of the Education Department is \\"To achieve a future where Peruvian textile culture is valued as a global patrimony.\\" The Education Department at the CTTC runs educational events for the weavers, the young weavers and the general public, as well as managing the museum Weaving Lives, the permanent collection of textiles, the library on textile sources, the design catalogue, investigations and publications, classes for visitors, visual materials and the volunteer program. = The Young Weaver Groups = Each of the ten weaving associations works with a youth group called the Young Weaver Group. These are children and adolescents between the ages of six and thirty who are learning the textile traditions of their community. The CTTC places emphasis on the young weavers as they will be responsible for carrying on traditions in the future. The Young Weaver Groups began in Chinchero in the 1990s. Since then, each community has organized a youth group. Elder weavers work with the children to teach them designs and techniques. The Education Department organizes various activities for the young weavers each year, including: gatherings of young weavers, weaving competitions, classes on ancient textiles of Peru, field trips to local museums, and more. = Museum \\"Weaving Lives\\" = Located on Av Sol 603, Cusco, Per√∫, the museum Weaving Lives details the backstrap weaving process, unique Peruvian textile techniques, traditional uses of textiles in the Andes, as well as traditions and practices associated with textiles. Opened to the public in 2001, the small museum presents five rooms that display textiles, photography, and text in Spanish and English. = The CTTC Permanent Collection of Textiles = Since its founding in 1996, the CTTC has developed a unique ethnographic collection of traditional textiles from the Andes that include: examples of the traditional clothing from each of the ten communities, examples of the rudimentary textiles made before the CTTC's investigative work, exemplary textiles created after the CTTC's investigative work, pieces from the annual competition \\"Weaver Awards,\\" amongst others. Pieces from the CTTC Permanent Collection of Textiles have been displayed in local and international exhibits. = CTTC Library = The CTTC maintains a small library of textile sources, used for investigative work with the weavers and visiting scholars. Much of the replication work completed by the weavers of the CTTC is conducted through reference to textual sources. = The CTTC Design Catalogue = Each community maintains a unique repertoire of designs that represent their history and culture. Since 1996, the CTTC has worked to create a reference catalogue for each community that documents every design as well as each design variation. = Investigations and Publications = Through extensive investigative work with the elders of each community, the CTTC works to recover ancient designs, techniques, and styles that were on the brink of being lost to time. The Center has published a number of articles, books and DVDs based on its efforts, including: * Weaving Lives: Traditional Textiles of Cusco, Preserving the Textile Tradition, published in 2005 by the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco * Weaving in the Peruvian Highlands: Dreaming Patterns, Weaving Memories, published in 2007 by Nilda Calla√±aupa Alvarez * Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage, published in 2012 by Nilda Calla√±aupa Alvarez * Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes, published in 2013 by Nilda Calla√±aupa Alvarez and Christine Franquemont = The Weaver Awards = Since 2006 CTTC has partnered with Culture Explorers to offer the 'Weaver Awards,' an annual weaving competition, to the ten weaving associations that partner with CTTC. The Weaver Awards inspire the weavers to unite their efforts to create exceptional pieces that are inducted into the CTTC's Permanent Collection of textiles or that are acquired by international collectors and museums. The Weaver Awards help provide additional income to impoverished communities while encouraging excellence in the textile arts. = Textile Classes = The CTTC offers four courses on traditional Andean textiles: spinning, backstrap weaving, knitting, and sling braiding. Each course is one to three days in length, except for the knitting course which is only offered for a full three days. The classes are private and teach the basic skills of spinning with a drop spindle, weaving on a backstrap loom, knitting in the Chinchero style, and braiding ropes and slings from Pitumarca. The CTTC's policy concerning the teaching of traditional techniques is a balance between educating the public and respecting the intellectual property rights of indigenous peoples. The CTTC offers up to three days of instruction in traditional techniques, as this time frame is enough for students to gain respect for the complex, millennia old techniques. The CTTC does not offer more than three days of class time, as this would risk compromising the intellectual property rights of the indigenous weavers it works with. = The CTTC Volunteer Program = The CTTC offers two volunteer positions, Education Department Volunteers and Project Volunteers. In the Education Department volunteers assist with various projects and events run for the weavers and the public. Project Volunteers work on unique projects in support of the CTTC.  The sales and marketing department  The Sales & Marketing Department promotes the sale on a fair-trade basis of the weaver's textile art. The Sales & Marketing Department manages five physical store locations, as well as an online catalogue. The main CTTC store, which sells woven textiles, is located on Av Sol 603, Cusco, Peru. Directly next door to its main store, the CTTC runs a small knitwear store. Besides the main two stores on Av Sol, the Sales and Marketing Department runs a small museum shop in Museo Inka and another museum shop in Museo de Arte Precolombino, both located in the historic center of Cusco. The fifth CTTC store is located at the weaving complex in the community of Chinchero. The CTTC also exports to stores and companies located in the USA and Canada. The sale on a fair-trade basis of the weaver's work has been the main contributing factor in improving the quality of life of member weavers. With improved income, families are able to send their children to school, access better health care, and make improvements to their homes. Women have been provided with independent incomes from their male relatives, which has improved their standing in community life. = Products = The CTTC offers traditional textiles as well as modern products created in various techniques including: backstrap weaving, knitting, and rope braiding. Each piece is made with natural alpaca, sheep or llama fiber and dyed with natural plant and animal dyes. Each item is authored and includes a photo of the artist, their birthdate, and their community. Traditional textiles offered by the CTTC include: lliklla (blankets), ponchos, unkuna (a cloth to carry coca leaves), chumpi (belts), jakima (small ribbons), slings, and chullo (knitted hats), amongst others. Non-traditional products offered by the CTTC include: wall hangings and wall art, home decor, bags and purses, accessories, and modern clothing items, amongst others.  Special Projects  Besides the Education Department and the Sales & Marketing Department, the CTTC runs a number of special projects that seek to revive textile traditions in the Cusco region. = Natural dyes = Since 1999, the CTTC has been the leader in the Cusco region in the revival of natural dyes. Weavers from the community of Chinchero, led by Nilda Calla√±aupa Alvarez, held investigations with elders, attended international workshops and conferences, and conducted many experiments before reviving the natural dyeing process in the Cusco region. The CTTC is recognized internationally as the main force in reviving natural dyeing in the Cusco region where today many weavers once more use ancient dyes once practiced by their ancestors. Natural dyes revived by the CTTC include: * Anil (indigo) - Indig√≥fera suffruticosa, familia Fabaceae - produces all shades of blue from light to dark * Chaphi (Palo Palo) - Galium aparine, familia Rubiaceae - produces a light shade of pink or peach * Checchi - Berberis carinata, familia Berberidaceae - produces shades of yellow * Ch'illka - Baccharis caespitosa, familia Asteraceae - produces shades of green * Cochineal - Dactylopius coccus, familia Dactylopiidae - produces shades of red, pinks, purples and oranges depending on what mordant is used in the dye vat * Kiku - Bidens andicola, familia Asteraceae - produces shades of yellow * Q'olle - Budleja coriaceae, familia Loganiaceae - produces shades of yellow and orange when mixed with cochineal * Kinsa k'uchu - Baccharis genistelloides, familia Asteraceae - produces a light shade of turquoise. Note, it is a black fungus on the leaf Kinsa kuchu that produces the dye, not the leaf itself. * Molle - Sichinus molle, familia Anacardiaceae - produces shades of yellow * Mot'e - Vaccinium floribundum, familia Ericaceae -produces shades of burgundy * Nogal (walnut) - Juglans neotropica, familia juglandaceae - produces shades of brown * Q'aq'a sunkha - Usnea barbata, familia Usneaceae - produces shades of dark orange to brown * Tayanka - Baccharis buxifolia, familia Asteraceae - produces shades of yellow to lime green = The Indigo Project = The strain of indigo found in pre-Columbian textiles is native to South America. After investigations and a long revival process, the CTTC establish a small plantation in the community of Huayro where it farms approximately five acres of native Indig√≥fera suffruticosa plants. Indigo is the only plant in the world that produces blue dye. The process of extracting the dye from the leaves of the plant is long and laborious. After harvesting, leaves must be oxidized in large vats of water that are left to evaporate. The resultant mixture is then heated to remove remaining excess water and produce a hard cake of indigo dye. This dye is later mixed with human urine and left to ferment underground with the yarn for a month to produce the dyed yarn. The CTTC's Indigo Project seeks to maintain the unique strain of indigo native to South America, and serves to educate the public about the importance of natural dyes. = Replica Work = The CTTC is known internationally for its work in replicas of Pre-Columbian and Colonial textiles. The CTTC's replica projects include, amongst others: * The Juanita Mummy - working jointly with Dr Bill Conklin, Jose Antonio Chavez (director of the Museo Santuarios Andinos at the Catholic University of Santa Maria in Arequipa), and National Geographic, weavers from the CTTC traveled to Arequipa to analyze the textiles of the Juanita Mummy, discovered by Johan Reinhard in 1995 on the Ampato Mountain above Arequipa. CTTC weavers replicated the lliklla (blanket), axsu (dress), and chumpi (belt), of the mummy after a laborious investigative process to determine the techniques and designs of the textiles. Chinchero weaver Carolina Concha W. comments that \\"When we went to the museum we wanted to open the showcase where 'Juanita' was exhibited, to touch, see and examine the designs. It was hard to see, and it was frozen. To replicate the designs was very difficult. We tried again and again until we thought that it might not have been woven in our style of warp-faced weaving. With great effort, the designs started to show, and I felt so excited! We discussed all kinds of commentaries and jokes, like Juanita didn't want us to replicate her designs and her textiles, but we did. I know that for some of us, it is still impossible to replicate the designs, but we feel very proud of weaving the heritage of our Incan textile.\\" * The poncho of Jose de San Martin - Contacted by an associate of the Museo Hist√≥rico Regional de Buenos Aires ‚Äì Argentina, where the original piece is housed, weavers from the CTTC replicated the poncho of Jose de San Martin in complementary warp faced weave. * The poncho of Simon Bolivar - Contacted by the director of the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a, Antropolog√≠a e Historia del Per√∫, weavers from the CTTC realized a replica of the poncho of Simon Bolivar. = Tinkuy: Gathering of the Textile Arts = Tinkuy is an international textile conference organized by CTTC approximately every three years starting in 2010. Tinkuy gathers together indigenous weavers, textile artists, anthropologists, art historians and textile enthusiasts. The conference is composed of lectures, presentations, workshops, demonstrations and other events. The next Tinkuy is scheduled for November 2017. During Tinkuy indigenous textile artists from across the world meet to share and celebrate their textile traditions.

Lytvyn was born in a village of Ksaverivka, Vasylkiv Raion on 26 November 1934 in a family of rural teachers. His dad a veteran of the World War II, after the Nazi Germany's occupation of Ukraine, served in the Soviet partisan detachments of Sydir Kovpak and died from wounds in 1944. Later Lytvyn with his mother moved to village Barakhty, Vasylkiv Raion. After finishing a seven-year school, he enrolled in mining- industrial school in Shakhty (now in Rostov Oblast), but after getting sick he left the school and returned on his village. In 1953 Lytvyn was imprisoned at the construction of Zhiguli Hydroelectric Station (at that time Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station) after being accused of theft. Soon after being released in 1955 he was arrested again on 14 April 1956 being accused in created of underground nationalistic organization \\"Group for Liberation of Ukraine\\" and convicted to 10 years imprisonment. His punishment Lytvyn served in camps of Medyn (Kaluga Oblast) and Vikhorevka (part of Ozerlag) as well as the so- called \\"Mordva camps for politicals\\" (Dubravlag). While being imprisoned Lytvyn wrote poems in Ukrainian and Russian languages and in 1965 finished his collection \\"Tragic gallery\\" () (a story about crimes of totalitarian system against Ukrainian people). Shortly all poems were taken away from him during a search. After being released in June 1965 Lytvyn was forced to move to Krasnoyarsk due to prosecution. On 14 November 1974 he was arrested again and convicted by article 187-1 of the Criminal Code of the Ukrainian SSR (Slanderous fabrications that discredit the Soviet state and social system). In November 1977, Lytvyn, after just being freed from prison, became a member of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group to facilitate the implementation of Helsinki Accords and continued his struggle against the totalitarian regime in Ukraine. In April 1979 he finished his article \\"Human rights movement in Ukraine. Its principles and perspectives\\" (), in which he created the political program of Ukrainian human rights movement. On 5 July 1979 while being seriously ill, Lytvyn was arrested again and accused in conducting \\"anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda\\". He was convicted by a court in Vasylkiv to 10 years imprisonment and 5 years of exile. From May 1982 he was serving his sentence in camps of strict regime (Perm Oblast, villages Kuchino, Polovinka, Vsesviatskoe) where was the majority of participants of Ukrainian human rights movement. The later influential (in Ukrainian politics) Viktor Medvedchuk defended Stus during this trial. Lytvyn described the work of Medvedchuk as a lawyer on 17 December 1979: ‚ÄúThe passivity of my lawyer Medvedchuk in defense is not due to his professional profanity, but to the instructions he received from above and his subordination: he does not dare to reveal the mechanism implemented provocations against me.\\" According to official court papers Medvedchuk had referred to the incompleteness of the investigation in the case and had asked to cancel the court's verdict and send the case for a new trial. On 24 August 1984 Yuriy Lytvyn was found in his cell with his stomach cut open. On 21 August the camp docter refused to treat him. On 5 September 1984 he died in a hospital of the city of Chusovoy, Perm Oblast. Medvedchuk's role: Yuriy Lytvyn and Vasyl Stus had one lawyer and died in the same camp, Ukrayinska Pravda (9 July 2020) In November 1989 remnants of Yuriy Lytvyn, Vasyl Stus, and Oleksiy Tykhyi was transported to Kyiv and buried with honors at Baikove Cemetery (lot #33).

It was formed twice, first in August 1941, and after its destruction in 1942, re-formed in 1944. The division landed in eastern Crimea as part of the 51st Army during the Kerch‚ÄìFeodosiya landing operation, which occurred in late-December 1941 and set off the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula. The landing operation sought to relieve Soviet forces trapped in Sevastopol in southwestern Crimea, but a German counterattack in mid-January forced the Soviets, including the 390th division, to retreat eastward; they eventually were cornered in the Kerch Peninsula. As a result of language problems due to lack of Russian speakers in the division, the 390th was made into an Armenian national division in February and given an Armenian commander. The division was destroyed in the final German offensive, Operation Bustard Hunt, in May, and officially disbanded soon afterwards. The division was reformed in the Far East in November 1944 and fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria before being disbanded postwar in late 1945.  First formation  = Formation = The division began formation as part of the Transcaucasian Front on 19 August 1941, under the command of Colonel Ivan Vinogradov at Makharadze. Out of 10,252 soldiers in the division at its inception, 8,979 had never handled weapons. Most of its troops could not speak or understand Russian. The enlisted personnel of the 390th were mostly Armenian and Azerbaijani peasants, while junior and political officers were Russian and Georgian. On 23 November, it joined the 51st Army, and by early December the division command post was located at Taman on the coast of the Kerch Strait. = Kerch landing = In December 1941 and January 1942, the division and the rest of the 51st Army fought in the Kerch‚ÄìFeodosiya landing operation, which began the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, an attempt to relieve the trapped Soviet garrison at Sevastopol. After the 44th Army finished landing on 31 December, the 51st Army began crossing over the frozen Kerch Strait. Both the 44th and 51st Armies were slated to commence an offensive on 16 January, which was expected to relieve Sevastopol and recapture the whole of Crimea. However, weather conditions thawed the ice and hindered the buildup of supplies between 6 and 9 January, resulting in the cancellation of the offensive. German troops launched a counterattack at the junction of the 51st and 44th Armies on 15 January. Positioned on the 51st's left flank, the 390th saw the heaviest fighting, but held against the German attack. However, the attack forced the 44th Army to retreat and Feodosiya was recaptured by the German troops. On the morning of 16 January, the division began its own counterattack and threw the German troops back . The 51st Army slowly gave ground over the next two days and by 18 January was holding a line along the Isthmus of Ak-Monay in conjunction with the 44th Army. = Operations in February and March 1942 = In February, the 390th Rifle Division became an Armenian national division as part of an attempt to overcome the language barrier, as the majority of its troops still could not speak Russian fluently. As a result of mass desertions of the Caucasian troops during the previous fighting, the Armenian officer Colonel Simon Zakian replaced Vinogradov as commander of the division on 24 February. The 51st Army launched an attack on 16 March, with the 390th and 398th Rifle Divisions in reserve. On the night of 17‚Äì18 March, the 390th and 398th were moved up to their jumping-off positions in the area of Korpech village. The attacks of the two divisions began at 10:00 on 18 March, and the 390th, advancing in conjunction with the 55th Tank Brigade, overcame German resistance and captured two trench lines of the German main defensive line. By the end of the day, they had dug in on the new positions. On the morning of 19 March, Zakian committed his reserve, the 784th Rifle Regiment, into the battle. However, the rest of the attacks were unsuccessful. After army commander Vladimir Lvov received reports of a German buildup, the offensive was halted. 257x257px On 20 March, the Germans counterattacked with the 22nd Panzer Division, which had recently arrived in Crimea, and took the Soviet defenses by surprise in the early morning fog. They attempted to eliminate the penetration that the 390th and 398th Rifle Divisions had made into their lines and break through the hastily prepared forward defenses of the 51st Army. Parts of the 390th began to retreat towards Height 28.2, but the situation was restored by the personal intervention of the 143rd Rifle Brigade's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Georgy Kurashvili, who rallied the troops to defend Korpech. Major Mushegh Malkhasyan's 789th Rifle Regiment was the first hit by the German tank attack, but the regiment was able to separate the German tanks from their infantry and break up the counterattack. Major L.G. Akopov's 792nd Regiment also participated in heavy fighting against the German attack. German tanks, supported by a company of infantry, broke through the 390th's line and attacked the divisional command post, forcing Zakian and his chief of staff to lead rear units in a counterattack. The German assault was eventually repulsed, and Soviet sources claim 17 tanks were destroyed. A second attack against the 398th Division followed but also failed. The Germans then followed up with a more powerful assault at the junction of the 390th and the 83rd Marine Rifle Brigade on the division's right flank. This third German assault was repulsed by Soviet anti-tank fire. From 26 to 29 March, the division's 789th Regiment and the 143rd Rifle Brigade, with tank support, attacked the German strongpoint of Koy-Asan. The 789th advanced two kilometers, entered Koy-Asan, and opened fire on the railroad bridge. However, the Soviet troops were unable to completely take the strong point. On 31 March, Lvov ordered the army to transition to echeloned defense, and the 390th was placed in the rear echelon. Around this time, Zakian was mortally wounded by a shell fragment at his command post, and died on 2 April. Colonel Ivan Lyudnikov took command on 1 April, and seventeen days later was replaced by Colonel Hmayak Babayan. In late April the Chairman of the Presidium of the Armenian SSR Supreme Soviet, Matsak Papian, presented the division with a battle flag. Around this time, at the insistence of the Crimean Front commissar Lev Mekhlis, all troops were concentrated into one single defensive line with few reserves. = Operation Bustard Hunt = Soviet prisoners of war after Operation Bustard Hunt with three German tanks in the background On 8 May, after days of heavy aerial bombardment, the final German offensive in the Kerch Peninsula, Operation Bustard Hunt, began. The 44th Army quickly collapsed, and the 51st Army was forced to fight off frontal attacks while also defending its open left flank. The 390th, in reserve, was sent into battle at Arma-Eli, and its 789th Regiment delayed the German advance, gaining time for the rest of the division to set up a defensive line in preparation for a counterattack. However, Lvov and his command staff were killed in an airstrike on the army headquarters, and no counterattack took place. Furthermore, on 13 May, division commander Babayan was wounded and evacuated, further diminishing the army leadership. By 14 May the German advance reached the shores of Kerch Bay, cutting off the troops retreating towards Eltigen and Kamysh-Burun. At this point, the 789th Regiment, now commanded by its commissar, S. Sargsyan, launched a counterattack, throwing the German troops back on the slopes of Mount Mithridat. For three days the regiment, suffering heavy casualties, held its positions and delayed the German advance. However, German troops advanced into Kerch from the southwest and the situation became hopeless. Upon orders from the Crimean Front command, from 14 to 20 May, the 51st Army covered the evacuation of the troops. The remnants of the division were among those evacuated across the Kerch Strait, but the fighting left the division nearly destroyed. It was officially disbanded on 14 June 1942, along with other divisions destroyed in Crimea, and its survivors were used to provide the experienced core of new formations.  Second formation  The division began re-forming from a cadre of rifle brigades on 22 November 1944 as part of the Far Eastern Front, commanded by Colonel Ivan Teplyakov. The division fought in the Sungari Offensive, part of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, which began on 9 August following the Soviet declaration of war on Japan after the American Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The division advanced as part of the 5th Separate Rifle Corps (an independent unit reporting directly to the front command) on the left of the 15th Army, with the objective of taking the towns of Raohe, Baoqing, and Boli in eastern Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state in Manchuria in northeast China. Attacking alongside the 172nd Tank Brigade, the division crossed the Amur River and captured Raohe and its fortified area from troops of the Japanese 135th Infantry Division on 10 August. The division and its parent corps then advanced southwest towards Baoqing, which was taken by the 172nd Brigade on 14 August. On 19 August, the corps linked up with troops of the 35th Army at Boli. After reaching Boli the corps' role in the fighting was effectively over, as Japanese resistance in Manchuria collapsed. The division was disbanded in late 1945 along with its corps in the Far Eastern Military District.  Commanders  The division's first formation was commanded by the following commanders: * Colonel Ivan Vinogradov (19 August 1941 23 February 1942) * Colonel Simon Zakian (24 February c. 31 March 1942) * Colonel Ivan Lyudnikov (1 April 18 April 1942) * Colonel Hmayak Babayan (19 April 14 June 1942) The division's second formation was commanded by the following officer: * Colonel Ivan Teplyakov (22 November 1944 3 September 1945)  Composition  The division's first formation included the following units: * 784th Rifle Regiment * 789th Rifle Regiment * 792nd Rifle Regiment * 954th Artillery Regiment * 147th Separate Destroyer Anti-Tank Battalion * 182nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battery (formerly 678th Separate Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion) * 678th Mortar Battalion * 453rd Reconnaissance Company * 672nd Sapper Battalion * 842nd Separate Communications Battalion * 476th Medical-Sanitary Battalion * 469th Separate Chemical Defense Company * 506th Auto-Transport Company * 814th Field Bakery (formerly 241st Mobile Field Bakery) * 816th Divisional Veterinary Hospital * 1449th Field Post Office * 720th Field Cash Office of the State Bank The division's second formation included the following units: * 425th Rifle Regiment * 513th Rifle Regiment * 554th Rifle Regiment * 1042nd Artillery Regiment * 475th Separate Self-Propelled Artillery Battalion * 424th Separate Destroyer Anti-Tank Battalion * 106th Reconnaissance Company * 244th Sapper Battalion * 1025th Separate Communications Battalion * 354th Medical-Sanitary Battalion * 233rd Separate Chemical Defense Company * 716th Auto-Transport Company * 612th Field Bakery * 469th Divisional Veterinary Hospital * 3157th Field Post Office * 2001st Field Cash Office of the State Bank  References  = Citations = = Bibliography =     External links  * Recollections of the commander of the 476th Medical-Sanitary Battalion on the fighting in Crimea Infantry divisions of the Soviet Union in World War II ","title":"390th Rifle Division"},{"id":"53511907","text":"The following is a list of notable events and releases of the year 1981 in Norwegian music.

The process was invented by Josef Albert, a German photographer who owned and directed a studio and photo lab in Augsburg. The technique is similar to collotype, but substitutes the gel plate for the lithographic stone used in collotype. Heliotype, invented in 1871 by Edwards, is another similar process. Albert's innovation was to replace the copper or stone with glass, construct a mechanical press, and cover it with another gel layer, silicate mixed with gelatin, in order to produce about two thousand prints from each plate using etching presses and hand rollers.

PPC operates under the fiscal sponsorship of the umbrella organization Earth Island Institute.  Positions  PPC asserts that plastic recycling is unhelpful. Instead, they endorse taxes on plastic bags, propose the elimination of single-use plastics, and emphasize producer responsibility for the end-life of their products. PPC has advocated for the discontinuation of single-use plastic drinking straws, describing this as a \\"gateway issue to help people start thinking about the global plastic pollution problem\\". PPC prioritizes changing legal structures and producer responsibility against a perceived over-emphasis on individual responsibility for recycling.  History  PPC was founded by Manuel Maqueda, Daniella Russo, Lisa Boyle, and Dianna Cohen in October 2009. The organization is primarily involved in internet activism. In 2010, PPC was the host of TEDx event \\"Great Pacific Garbage Patch: The Global Plastic Pollution Crisis\\" discussing the Pacific trash vortex. From April 2011 until June 2014, PPC operated a news website called The Plastic Free Times. In 2017, an advocacy video for the Plastic Pollution Coalition was made featuring the top 11 finalists from the 10th season of American Idol. PPC alleges that American Idol producer 19 Entertainment contributed to the video and then demanded that it be removed from the internet under pressure from corporate sponsors. A couple of the organization‚Äôs markets have become home to Sustain L.A. Refill Station, a business aimed at supplying customers with some of the products that are hardest to obtain without also buying new plastic bottles ‚Äî shampoo, hair conditioner, liquid soap, laundry detergent and household cleaners. =Legal cases= In 2015, PPC and the environmental law firm Greenfire sued 3,000 plastic manufacturers in California for allegedly violating stormwater permitting requirements of the Clean Water Act. In April 2020, PPC and the Earth Island Institute filed a law suit against Clorox, Coca-Cola, Mars, Nestl√©, PepsiCo, Procter and Gamble in California superior courts alleging that these companies of polluting waterways, coasts, and oceans with millions of tons of plastic packaging. The suit claims they violations of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, public nuisance, breach of express warranty, defective product liability, negligence, and failure to warn of the harms caused by their plastic packaging. The American Beverage Association responded to the suit with a statement by saying some of their members' are actively addressing the problem of plastic pollution. The suit claims that the defendant companies collectively produce about 15% of all single-use plastic packaging.  Endorsements  PPC has used celebrity endorsements to attract support. One video produced by PPC featuring actor Jeff Bridges was viewed by hundreds of thousands of people. Celebrity supporters include Jeff Franklin, Jeff Bridges, Alexandra Paul, Amy Smart, and Ben Harper  Criticism  PPC has campaigned to pressure companies to discontinue plastic packaging. Albe Zakes, spokesman for TerraCycle, while expressing support for PPC's goals, has questioned whether switching to glass bottles instead of plastic is better for the environment.

Constantine (, between 821/22 and 829 ‚Äì c.830 or at the latest 835) was a prince of the Byzantine Empire and co-emperor. Life Constantine was the eldest son of Emperor Theophilos and Theodora. He had five sisters (Thekla, Anna, Anastasia, Pulcheria, Maria). As Theophilos succeeded his own father Michael II as basileus on 2 October 829, Constantine became heir to the throne. Soon afterwards he was crowned co-emperor and he appears as such on the coins of his father. He died in childhood and was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles at Constantinople. There is little clarity as to the dates of his birth, coronation and death, but according to the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit he was born in the (late) 820s and died before 831. In any case, only one emperor is mentioned in the De Ceremoniis for 831; Constantine is also missing on coins minted in 831/32 and 832/33, though this could mean he was only raised to co-emperor in 833. He must have died by 835, since that year Theophilos was recorded as being without a male heir (Constantine's younger brother Michael III would be born in 840), a situation Theophilos attempted to rectify by marrying his infant daughter Maria to general Alexios Mosele, who shortly before this (possibly as early as 831) had been promoted to Caesar.

He scored a combined eight La Liga goals during ten seasons, whilst appearing in 158 matches with Osasuna, Barcelona, Betis and Athletic Bilbao during that timeframe. Playing career =Osasuna= Born in Logro√±o, La Rioja, Jos√© Mari was trained in the youth system of CA Osasuna and began his senior career with the reserves in Segunda Divisi√≥n B, his first match taking place towards the end of 1988‚Äì89. He spent another two seasons at that level, but also made his La Liga debut for the first team under manager Pedro Mar√≠a Zabalza, coming on as a late substitute in a 3‚Äì0 home win against Real Betis just prior to his 20th birthday. Jos√© Mari began 1991‚Äì92 with the B-side, but by October he was part of the main squad. At the end of the campaign he had started four league games and appeared from the bench in another four, and also made his European bow on 22 October 1991 when he played the last eight minutes in place of Miguel Sola in a 0‚Äì0 home draw against VfB Stuttgart. Jos√© Mari was confirmed as a first- team member for 1992‚Äì93, featuring in 20 matches (although he only played 90 minutes seven times) and scoring his first goal in a 1‚Äì3 home loss to RCD Espa√±ol. He was even more prominent the next season, but broke his ankle in March 1994 and Osasuna were eventually relegated in last place. =Barcelona and Betis= Jos√© Mari initially remained in Pamplona and played in Segunda Divisi√≥n until January 1995, when he was signed by FC Barcelona for 150 million pesetas (equivalent to around GB¬£720,000 at the time) and returned to the top level on a three-year contract. He later stated that the move had been close to completion the previous year, but his serious injury led to its delay. Once at Camp Nou, Jos√© Mari was immediately involved in the matchday squads under Johan Cruijff, starting seven of the remaining league games. He also featured in both legs of a UEFA Champions League tie with Paris Saint- Germain F.C. which ended in elimination, where he missed a good chance to score a vital away goal in France, angering the Dutch coach; in the domestic league, the side could only rank fourth. In the 1995 summer transfer window, Jos√© Mari joined Betis ‚Äì who had just finished above Bar√ßa in the table ‚Äì for barely a third of his purchase price, 60m ptas (¬£317,000), agreeing to a six- year deal. He was one of three Barcelona players transferred in discounted deals along with √ìscar Arp√≥n and former Osasuna teammate Francisco S√°nchez Jara, in the wake of √Ångel Cu√©llar's move in the opposite direction via his buyout clause. During his only year at the Estadio Benito Villamar√≠n, Jos√© Mari appeared in 23 games overall as Lorenzo Serra Ferrer's side went on to finish eighth. Subsequently, he left Seville and moved to Athletic Bilbao for a transfer fee of around ¬£1.2 million, arranged by controversial club president Manuel Ruiz de Lopera without the knowledge of the manager. =Athletic= Jos√© Mari signed a four-year contract at Athletic, being eligible under their recruitment policy due to learning his skills at a club in the region. A teammate from his time with Osasuna youths, I√±igo Larrainzar, was already playing there. In his first season ‚Äì at the outset of the Luis Fern√°ndez managerial era ‚Äì Jos√© Mari was a regular fixture (33 games, 28 starts), scoring the winning goal on his debut against Rayo Vallecano and netting the equaliser in an eventual 2‚Äì1 home victory over his former side Barcelona on 23 November 1996. His status thereafter diminished to squad member, and he only appeared in a combined 35 matches in the next three years. Jos√© Mari did play the whole game in a crucial win over Zaragoza in May 1998 which ensured that Athletic finished runners-up, which he described as \\"the most intense game I played in\\". This success enabled him to appear once more in the Champions League, where he started a group phase clash against Rosenborg BK. Jos√© Mari departed from Bilbao on 30 June 2000 at the end of his contract, aged 29. He made 77 official appearances during his four-year tenure. =Later years= Afterwards, Jos√© Mari was a regular in the second tier with both CD Legan√©s and Burgos CF, being administratively relegated with the latter. He then dropped down one further level to play with CF Reus Deportiu, but a worsening back injury marred his short return to Catalonia, as his team was also relegated. Post-retirement / Coaching After retiring, Jos√© Mari returned to Seville. In 2006, he was one of a group of former Betis players including Rafael Gordillo and Roberto R√≠os which took over lowly √âcija Balompi√© in an ambitious project, being installed as sporting director‚Äì his time there coincided with the rise of future international Nolito; they also brought former Athletic player Igor Angulo to the Andalusian club, which won its third division section in 2007‚Äì08 but missed out in the play-offs, and in 2010 the ownership was acquired by an √âcija supporters' group amid economic problems. During the 2011‚Äì12 season, Jos√© Mari worked with Betis' reserves as the assistant manager to Risto Vidakoviƒá (as part of the backroom staff led by former teammate and friend Vlada Sto≈°iƒá).

I talked a lot with Yukiko during the trip, and we came up with the idea for this combination of instruments.

Although the individual members are based in Basel, Stuttgart and Freiburg, the trio rehearses solely in Freiburg, which it considers its home. In addition to concerts, Trio Accanto has coached chamber music at Time of Music Festival, Viitasaari, and IMPULS Academy, Graz. Repertoire The scoring of saxophone, piano and percussion is common in jazz but uncommon in classical music. Trio Accanto has steadily built a repertoire of about 100 works for this scoring (including a handful of concertos). Some composers who have written from Trio Accanto include Mark Andre, Georges Aperghis, Aldo Clementi, Michael Finnissy,, Stefano Gervasoni, Vinko Globokar, Erhard Grosskopf, Georg Friedrich Haas, Toshio Hosokawa, Evan Johnson, Thomas Kessler, Marina Khorkova, Jo Kondo, Helmut Lachenmann, Marco Momi, Brice Pauset, Stefan Prins, Rolf Riehm, Wolfgang Rihm, Johannes Sch√∂llhorn, Martin Sch√ºttler, Salvatore Sciarrino, Mauricio Sotelo, Helena Tulve and Christian Wolff. For details of the repertoire Trio Accanto has largely created, see List of compositions for saxophone, piano and percussion. Composers currently writing for Trio Accanto include Beat Furrer, Misato Mochizuki, Rebecca Saunders and Mikel Urquiza. Several of these commissions are supported by the Ernst von Siemens Musikstiftung. Trio Accanto plays exclusively works for the three instruments together. The group's members do not play solos or duos in trio concerts, nor does the trio play with additional guests artists. In the past there have been projects with voice, including works by Bernhard Lang and Dieter Schnebel. These are however no longer in the active repertoire of the Trio. Similarly, in the past members have played solo works during the concerts. For example, on 6 August 2008, at the NDR Rolf-Liebermann-Studio in Hamburg (during the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival), Marcus Weiss gave the world premiere of Stockhausen's EDENTIA for soprano saxophone and electronics (from KLANG). (In the same concert the trio gave the premiere of Lachenmann's Berliner Kirschbl√ºten.) Trio Accanto has been very active in education, promoting tours of several different children's programmes, including specially written works by Helmut Lachenmann, Martin Smolka, Thomas Kessler and others. These works are still in the trio's repertoire, in as much as they fit into the current programming concept. Recordings Trio Accanto has over the years made many studio recordings of new works, for radio. Several of these were collected onto two CDs, on Assai (2003, featuring works by Mauricio Sotelo, Stefano Gervasoni, Toshio Hosokawa and Brice Pauset) and on Zeitklang (2009, featuring works by J√∂rg Birkenk√∂tter, Erhard Gro√ükopf, Manuel Hidalgo, Jo Kondo and Bernfried Pr√∂ve). The trio has released many other individual performances on other CDs. Trio Accanto have in recent years begun recording the highlights of its repertoire for Wergo, in purpose-made studio recordings. The first of these, Funambules, was released in December 2016 and featured music by Georges Aperghis, Rolf Riehm, Johannes Sch√∂llhorn and Stefan Prins, all pieces commissioned by the trio in the first year of Hodges' membership. The second, Songs and Poems, was released in April 2018 and features music by Aldo Clementi, Andreas Dohmen, Wolfgang Rihm, Hans Thomalla and Walter Zimmermann, all of which (apart from Dohmen) are major works from the Trio's \\"old repertoire\\" which were not recorded by the Trio in earlier decades. The third CD, Other Stories was released in April 2020, and includes four previously unrecorded works by Helmut Lachenmann ‚Äì two versions of Sakura Variations for trio, plus the solo piano versions of Marche Fatale and Berliner Kirschbl√ºten ‚Äì along with trio works by Michael Finnissy (Opera of the Nobility), Yu Kuwabara, Martin Sch√ºttler and Martin Smolka. A fourth CD has been recorded, solely consisting of works by Christian Wolff, including Trio IX ‚Äì Accanto and recent Exercises. With Hodges, the Trio has also released a recording of a work by Marina Khorkova.

In its place Enholmen Fortress () was built in the mid-1800s. It was decommissioned in 1905 and was then used as a training ground for the coastal artillery. During the 1990s it was used as a naval mine control station before the island was demilitarized in 2011. Karlsv√§rd Fortress ruin is since 2015 managed by the National Property Board.  Karlsv√§rd Fortress  In 1650, a technical drawing of Enholmen was submitted by Quartermaster general Johan W√§rnschi√∂ldh which included a pentagonal bastion sconce with lower walls and counterscarp ditches, a drawing, which after some modifications by himself, was approved by the King in Council in 1656. In 1657, the construction of the two western bastions was started. Little was done in the following years and in 1663 King Charles XI decided that the fortress would be closed. In 1710, however, the Defense Commission (Defensionskommissionen) ordained that a sconce was to be built at Slite, and the County Governor Anders Sparrfelt now made a drawing in which he \\"corrected\\" the old planning and in 1711 started the work on the Karlsv√§rd Fortress which Enholmen's sconce was then called, and the two bastions of intermediate curtain walls were constructed. Quartermaster general Magnus Palmqvist suggested, however, that instead of the completion of the \\"fortress\\", a couple of batteries and a redoubt would be built, and already in 1712, the batteries and the s for the infantry and cavalry were finished. In 1719, Palmquist also considered that the construction of Karlsv√§rd ought not to be continued, but works constructed in 1711-12 would instead be retained, and this met with approval in the same year by Prince Frederick. In 1723, however, the resuming thought of accomplishing Karlsv√§rd came about, which at that time had the two south bastions in good condition, the northwestern and eastern bastions unfinished and the northern hardly begun. Now a lower sea defence across the entire stronghold was proposed. In 1739, a new drawing was made and again in 1741, then based on the 1723 plan. The construction of the actual stronghold was now continued, while a ravelin and a beach bastion was constructed and four shore batteries were built. The construction lasted until 1752, when one of Gabriel Cronstedt's prearranged draft of detached bastions in front of the curtain walls were met with approval. Later Johan Bernhard Virgin suggested the construction of the shoreline under the new plan, and three bomb-free vaulted bastioned towers, but in 1756 it was decided that Karlsv√§rd would be fulfilled according to the 1752 decision, and colonel F. K. Wrede was commanded to draw proposals for the sea defences, which, however, should not become big or expensive. The construction resumed in 1764 and then continued to 1770 when the Secret Committee (Sekreta utskottet) considered that \\"the so-called fortress\\" Karlsv√§rd, which construction begun during Charles X's reign, could be completed only this year, but not the shore batteries and as well as the bomb free barracks and storehouses, to which Virgin had prepared drawings, which had been upheld by 1766 Secret Committee and should now be carried out. In 1773, von Arbin was commanded to submit a \\"shortened\\" design for Karlsv√§rd's placing into capable defense operations for the least cost possible, and in 1779 he had prepared a design for the shore batteries with bastioned towers besides another more discursive proposal with a large dungeon, which was simultaneously submitted. Further constructions were not made, and on 22 April 1788, the King in Council considered Karlsv√§rd, which was still unfinished, had an inappropriate plan and could not protect the country, why the fortress now was condemned as being useless, pointless and costly. Major General Johan Christopher Toll was instructed to blow-up the fortifications and redirecting the defense funds to other locations. The military commander of Gotland, Michael Silvius von Hohenhausen, made a request in 1834 for an engineer officer to help in drawing the proposal for a masonry fortification on the site of Karlsv√§rd but this did not lead to any result.  Enholmen Fortress  Eastern battery of Enholmen Fortress. In 1831 cholera reached the Baltic coast and a quarantine station was established on the island. A cholera hospital was also built. Slite Harbour had since olden times been fortified, but the fortification, which in the 1650s was built on Enholmen and later was called Karlsv√§rd was long since decayed, when the 1839 Fortification Committee suggested that a new fortification was to be established to protect the harbour. Nothing was, however, done with this, but when the Crimean War broke out in 1853 and the Baltic Sea became a probable theater of war, it was quickly decided that Enholmen's once again would be fortified, and during 1854‚Äì58 two casemate fortification were built underneath the former Karlsv√§rd's dilapidated eastern and western fronts, exclusively for artillery defense of the two inlets to Slite. The batteries, which were armed with four seven-inch bomb cannons m/1840 and eight 24-pounder mortar guns each, were maintained afterwards, and some wooden buildings for the accommodation of officers and crew were erected on the island, but no permanent crew was ever placed there. The cholera hospital and the quarantine station was moved to the Asunden island when the island was re-fortified. When the town of Slite ceased to be a naval port, the King in Council prescribed on 15 December 1905, that the cannons of Enholmen would to be sold and batteries and other buildings to be leased.  Later use  During World War I and World War II, Enholmen was manned by military guards. A number of firing and observation bunkers was built during this time along the beach. After the wars, the coastal artillery in F√•r√∂sund used Enholmen as the location for emergency response exercises. From the 1950s to the 1990s a naval mine control station was situated in the old fortress. About fifteen meters underground were three large containers where dozens of people worked, slept and kept supplies before the station was closed in the 1990s. In 2008 it was decided that Enholmen would be sold by the Swedish Fortifications Agency. During 2010-11 Enholmen was demilitarized. In 2013 the Cultural Property Inquiry proposed that Enholmen would remain under state ownership. The National Property Board manages Karlsv√§rd Fortress ruin since 2015.

The Britons had invaded Ayrshire and established a substantial camp on or near the banks of the River Doon, south of the town of Ayr. Place-names such as \\"Cynning Park\\", \\"North Park\\", \\"Gear Holm\\", \\"Wrights Field\\", \\"Slap-house\\" Burn, and most telling, \\"Cambusdoon\\", provide clues to the extent of the encampment and the numbers of men involved. Fergus allowed the Britons to languish in their camp well into winter, so as to exhaust their supplies and whittle down their numbers through disease and desertion. Taking advantage of a drunken Yule-tide revelry in the camp, the Picts and Scots attacked at night during the first watch. The camp, which had no ramparts or palisade, was successfully overrun. The army of Coilus fled the Doon-side camp in complete panic. After a circuitous retreat south around the \\"Craigs of Kyle\\", over the flooded \\"Water of Coyle\\" at a place remembered as \\"the King's Steps\\" and back again northward, Fergus cornered the remnants west of the hamlet of Failford, and slaughtered Coilus and his men at the place now called Coilsfield. The few survivors rallied around the remnants of the baggage train, and after a brief truce the following day, Fergus wisely allowed them to depart.

It has been built up since the mid-18th century, but most of the current properties date from the late 19th and early 20th century. It has had a number of significant residents, including various members of the British aristocracy, the James Bond author Ian Fleming, and the Beatles. Location The road runs west to east from Park Lane to North Audley Street via Dunraven Street and Park Street, and is part of the Grosvenor Estate. It is presumed to be named after a local builder, John Green, who worked in the area until he was accidentally killed in 1737, when he fell down a well in nearby Upper Grosvenor Street. History Green Street garden in October 1916 Some building had begun on Green Street in the 1720s, but the entire road took some time to fully develop owing to a building slump in the late 1730s and throughout the 1740s, and was not completely built up until the 1760s. Unlike some local streets in Mayfair, it was not initially considered a fashionable or desirable address. Only one mid-18th-century property survives into the 21st century; Hampden House at Nos. 60‚Äì61, which was originally two houses. The architect Roger Morris lived at No. 61 from 1730 until his death in 1749. The name is derived from the Hampden family, who took ownership of the two properties in 1756 and extensively rebuilt and modified them to give the current single property. From 1882 to the early 1920s, the remainder of Green Street was demolished and rebuilt, predominantly in redbrick or terracotta backed houses. The Grosvenor Office allocated a communal garden on the south side of the street, which lies between Park Street and Dunraven Street. Nos. 2‚Äì11 were constructed between 1891‚Äì1895, all but one by Matthews, Rogers and Company and designed by Maurice Charles Hulbert. The exception was No. 10 which was built for St John Brodrick (the future Earl of Midleton) and designed by Balfour and Turner. Nos. 25‚Äì31, architect Robert William Edis, constructed between 1891‚Äì1894. The properties were built in four stages in conjunction with development on the adjoining Park Street; No. 25 did not begin redevelopment until 1893, two years after work started on No. 26. No. 32 was designed for Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale by Sidney R. J. Smith and constructed between 1897‚Äì99. It replaced a group of 18th-century buildings on Green Street and north along Dunraven Street. Smith was chosen as architect owing to his work on the Tate Gallery, which was then under construction. The house was built using Portland stone dressings and Westmorland slate, and included a white marble staircase with a wrought iron balustrade. In 1931, Queen Mary (consort of George V) suggested the house should be available as a royal residence for her daughter Mary, Princess Royal and son-in-law Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood. The Princess and Earl lived at the house until the outbreak of World War II, and the house was sold back to the Grosvenor Estate in 1946. It subsequently became the offices of the Brazilian Embassy. In 2011, the embassy was sold to private development for ¬£40 million. The south side of Green Street between Dunraven Street and Park Street was redeveloped in the 1910s, under the direction of Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster. Most of the properties were rebuilt between 1912‚Äì1916, with the exception of Nos. 36‚Äì37 and 47 at either end of this block, which were reconstructed in the 1920s. Nos. 36‚Äì37 were built for the merchant Sir Percy Newson. Residents Sir Thomas Sopwith The poet and author William Blake lived at No. 23 Green Street from 1782‚Äì1784. The wit, writer and Anglican cleric, Sydney Smith, lived at No. 56, and died there in 1845. By 1862, the obstetrician Gustavus Murray was living in Green Street, where he also had his consulting rooms. The politician, sportsman and future Secretary of State for the Colonies, Alfred Lyttelton lived at No. 4 Green Street from 1893‚Äì95. The Admiral Edward Southwell Sotheby lived at No. 26 between 1894 and his death in 1902. Henry Parnell, 4th Baron Congleton lived at No. 28 between 1902 and his death four years later. His son, the 5th Baron subsequently lived there until his death in 1914, and was succeeded by his brother, the 6th Baron who lived there until 1925. The James Bond author Ian Fleming was born at No. 27 on 28 May 1908, while the first class cricketer Anthony Lawrence grew up on Green Street in the 1910s. The tobacco manufacturer Sir Louis Baron lived at No. 57 Green Street from 1915 to 1930. The aircraft designer and manufacturer Sir Thomas Sopwith lived at No. 46 from 1934 to 1940. A blue plaque now commemorates his time there. Most of the houses on Green Street were divided into flats during the 20th century. When the Beatles first arrived in London in 1963, they stayed at the Hotel President in Bloomsbury before taking a lease on an apartment at No. 57, and this was the only London address where all four ever lived together. The fashion designer Alexander McQueen committed suicide by hanging himself at his flat in 7 Green Street in 2010.

He was born in Dublin, the elder son of John Coppinger and Mary Ann Crosbie, daughter of Maurice Crosbie, 1st Baron Brandon and Lady Elizabeth Fitzmaurice, and sister of William Crosbie, 1st Earl of Glandore. His father belonged the well-known Coppinger (or Copinger) family of County Cork. John's principal estate was at Glenville, a few miles from Cork city; he also owned property in County Kildare. John spent his later years in Dublin and died there in 1752. His death caused a lawsuit between Maurice, who was executor of the will, and his brother Robert.

He and his wife had one son, John James Coppinger (1780‚Äì1813). His Dublin house was in South William Street, and nearby Coppinger Row was named after him.

DcSTX is one of the many analogues of saxitoxin (STX). Figure 1: the structure of saxitoxin, with numbered carbons. Decarbamoylsaxitoxin is one of the derivatives of saxitoxin, which only has a CH2OH group on carbon 1. Also, a double bond between carbon 2 and 3 is added. Saxitoxin is a tricyclic alkaloid compound, which has multiple structural related neurotoxins. One of those related neurotoxins is neosaxitoxin (NSTX) in which the nitrogen at position 2 is not bound to a hydrogen, but to a hydroxyl group. Another toxic analogue of saxitoxin is gonyautoxin (GTX). The difference between GTX and STX is that on the carbon at position 11, a hydrogensulfate is bound. Between dcSTX, NSTX and GTX, dcSTX is the one which varies most from saxitoxin. In dcSTX there is a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, while there is a single bond in STX. This also results in that the double-bonded N to carbon number 3 in STX, is a single bound NH2 in dcSTX. Another difference between decarbamoylsaxitoxin and saxitoxin is that the amino-carbonyl-oxy-methyl group at position 1 in STX, is only a CH2OH group in dcSTX. Even though there are slight differences between all saxitoxin-related compounds, all those saxitoxins are neurotoxins which affect the sodium channels. When in contact with one of the saxitoxins it can cause a severe illness, which is known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP).  Source in nature  From eating shellfish, under which mussels, clams, whelks and scallops, multiple illnesses can result. One of them is sensory and motor paralysis, known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), which results from ingestion of saxitoxin and its derivatives, such as decarbamoylsaxitoxin. Shellfish can concentrate a dinoflagellate known as Gonyaulax tamarensis, which elaborates saxitoxin. Mussels are known to filter up to 20 litres of water a day, which is why they are very likely to carry the toxin when the surrounding water is contaminated.Alaska Division of Public Health: Prevention Promotion Protection. \\"Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning Fact Sheet.\\" Accessed on March 12, 2017 This dinoflagellate does not affect the shellfish, but when an organism eats the scallop shuckings, it risks getting poisoned. Some species, such as the littleneck clam, possess an enzyme that converts saxitoxin into decarbamoylsaxitoxin, which reportedly decreases the toxicity to humans of the saxitoxins present.  Structure and synthesis  = Structure and properties = Synonyms of decarbamoylsaxitoxin are; dcSTX-saxitoxin, decarbamoylsaxitoxin, decarbamylsaxitoxin = Synthesis = Decarbamoylsaxitocin is like saxitoxin a very hygroscopic solid. Since saxitoxins and their derivatives are mainly produced by the Gonyaulax tamarensis dinoflagellate, for a long time the exact synthesis pathway was unknown. Saxitoxin was the first paralytic shellfish toxin for which a total synthesis was described. This was done by Kishi and his research group in 1977. In 1991 they managed to describe the synthesis of decarbamoylsaxitoxin as well.  Metabolism  Decarbamoylsaxitoxin enters the body via the mouth. There it can be absorbed through the mucosa, and later on it can be absorbed through the small intestine. After absorption, the toxin is distributed through the body water. It gets removed by the kidneys and is excreted via urine. An exact biotransformation of decarbamoylsaxitoxin is not known yet. In 2004, a study on people who died from paralytic shellfish poisoning reported detected oxidation of saxitoxin into neosaxitoxin. In a more recent study on human liver samples, a metabolic pathway was proposed for saxitoxin which is shown in figure 2. They found that saxitoxin can be converted into neosaxitoxin in the human body, which harmonizes the earlier research. The neosaxitoxin will however be converted further into either a sugar-binding state or into GTX4/GTX1, a pair of gonyautotoxin epimers. These epimers can be converted to a sugar-binding state as well. Also, the sugar-bound state of saxitoxin can be formed. As this study shows, the phase II conjugation reaction is a very common glucoronidation reaction. Due to this, the substance gets more hydrophilic which makes it more easily excretable. Even though this study was done on saxitoxin exclusively, it is very likely that the metabolic pathway of decarbamoylsaxitoxin will be the same, since the major structural difference between them is the shown OONH2 substituent, indicated with a yellow circle in the figure, which is a hydroxyl substituent in decarbamoylsaxitoxin. This group is not affected in the proposed metabolism and will most likely not interrupt the shown mechanism.  Mechanisms of action  Decarbamoylsaxitoxin is a known neurotoxin, which mechanism is based on that of saxitoxin. Both namely bind to sodium channels, as shown in figure 3 Sodium channels contain negative residues at the top of their pore. These negatively charged residues are part of the filter for sodium. Decarbamoylsaxitoxin contains two guanidine substructures which can be protonated easily. Protonation of the guanidine substructures leads to a positive charge on the decarbamoylsaxitoxin and because of this positive charge the decarbamoylsaxitoxin can bind to the sodium channels. This binding to sodium channels prevents sodium passing through the channel. Because sodium passage is blocked, the channel cannot fulfil its function and it will be impossible to generate an action potential in the cell with the blocked sodium channels. There has been a study performed on which sodium channels are mainly targeted by the neurotoxin. This study showed that the neuromuscular transmission in the motor axon and the muscular membrane is targeted whereas the end-plate is left unaffected. It also showed that the atrioventicular node is the main target inside the heart. The consequences of decarbamoylsaxitoxin are paralysis and death. In vitro tests declared decarbamoylsaxitoxin more toxic than saxitoxin. It is not clear why this is the case; it can be speculated that it is caused by the alcohol group that is present on decarbamoylsaxitoxin instead of the amide group on saxitoxin. However, what can be concluded for sure is that decarbamoylsaxitoxin is converted into other compounds in the body or has trouble reaching the sodium channels. In vivo tests declared decarbamoylsaxitoxin half as toxic as saxitoxin.  Illness and poisoning  = Toxicology = In coastal waters, mostly in temperate and subtropical regions, dinoflagellate blooms can occur when the conditions for growth and aggregation are optimal. They cause so called ‚Äòred tides‚Äô or ‚Äòred waters‚Äô and the concentration of toxic can be of great risk for both marine life and humans. However, also when the water is clear shellfish can contain toxins, which are not destroyed by heating or freezing. In case of a red tide, a mussel can contain as much as 180 g of toxin. To human, a dose of only 1 mg saxitoxin can be fatal. Worldwide the limits for toxins in shellfish which cause paralytic shellfish poisoning is set at 80 Œºg per 100 g of meat. = Illness in humans = Usually, within minutes of ingestion of the poisoned shellfish, paranesthesia of the oral region and fingertips are noticed. This gradually proceeds to the neck, arms, legs and toes, together with general muscular incoordination. Patients can start feeling numb, due to which it is hard to make voluntary movements. Also symptoms as dizziness, weakness and incoherence can occur. In the final stage of the poisoning, respiratory distress and full muscular paralysis occur, usually between 2 and 12 hours after ingestion. The symptoms are sometimes difficult to interpret, since they are also associated with drunkenness. Alcohol can increase the severity of symptoms. = Treatment = There is no antidote to paralytic shellfish poisoning. However, with proper medical care, most patients will survive. The most important in treatment is assistance of the patient with ventilation. Also alkaline and sodium-containing fluids can be used to block the effect of paralytic shellfish toxins on nerve conduction.  DEREK prediction  Figure 4: The structure of decarbamoylsaxitoxin as inserted in Derek Nexus. Highlighted is the reactive group to which the Derek alert responds. This group is specified in the figure next to the structure. A way to predict toxicity from structure, is with the help of a software programme like Derek Nexus v3.0.1.Derek Nexus (version v.3.0.1) [software that gives toxicity predictions]. Leeds: Lhasa Unlimited It comes up with alerts that match your structure. In the case of decarbamoylsaxitoxin, for mammals the alert ‚ÄúRapid prototype060: Methylene glycol or derivate‚Äù comes up, with a sureness ‚Äúequivocal‚Äù, see figure 4. This rapid prototype alert describes the nephrotoxicity of methylene glycol and its derivatives. For this alert 731 chemicals were classified on basis of the causation of histopathologic lesions in the kidney in oral rat repeat dose studies, mostly with a duration of 28 days. It turns out that four compounds were really nephrotoxic. Because decarbamoylsaxitoxin is a geminal diol, it may be toxic for the kidneys.

Returning to Chicago, Arnold met William Frederick, a silversmith teacher at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Arnold and Frederick became partners, and would remain together until Arnold's death more than fifty years later. Frederick encouraged Arnold to experiment with various artistic mediums in classes at the Art Institute. Arnold subsequently completed an undergraduate degree in 1955 at Roosevelt University; in 1976 he earned an M.F.A. from the Art Institute of Chicago. Career Arnold developed an artistic practice that utilized collage and assemblage to address and explore American popular culture. In 1966, Arnold began his involvement with the South Side Community Art Center, exhibiting individual works and serving as a juror for group exhibitions, followed by a solo retrospective his work in 1973. In the late 1960s Arnold was an Artist in Residence at Art & Soul, a collaborative art space in North Lawndale initiated by the Museum of Contemporary Art and CVL, Inc. ‚Äì the latter being a new configuration of the Vice Lords, a West Side street gang. In 1969, Arnold began a position as an assistant professor of painting at Rockford University, followed by work at Barat College in Lake Forest, Illinois. In 1972 Arnold joined the Fine Arts Department at Loyola University Chicago. He was an influential facility member at Loyola, named chairman of the art department, and remained at the University through 2000. During his time at Loyola, Arnold was a member of the Illinois Arts Council, on the Advisory Board of the Illinois Arts Alliance, and served as an adjunct lecturer at the Art Institute of Chicago.

This was the fourth synagogue in Canada.https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/artsci/jewish- studies/docs/working-papers/Workingpapers3IraRobinson.pdf The synagogue Ba√Øs Isra√´l was formed when the small synagogue located at 14 rue Henderson (a street which was closed in 1986) became too cramped in size. Jewish community members Mayer Vineberg and Louis Klineberg obtained the legal authorization to establish Ba√Øs Isra√´l on November 9, 1897. It was located at 164 rue Grant (this street was renamed rue Monseigneur-Gauvreau, in 1937). Ba√Øs Isra√´l remained on rue Grant until 1908. The previous year, in 1907, the community obtained land at 25 rue Sainte-Marguerite (this street was renamed rue Saint- Laurent, in 1915), for a new synagogue, as well as a school, l'Hebrew Hall. In 1909, the corporation of la congr√©ation Ba√Øs Isra√´l was formed.http://100objects.qahn.org/content/key-first-jewish-cemetery-quebec- city-c-1850s◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊ê◊ï◊î◊ë ◊©◊ú◊ï◊ù: Beth Isra√´l Ohev Sholom, p.

After Ba√Øs Isra√´l completed a building renovation between 1927‚Äì1928, it merged with Ohev Sholom, becoming Ba√Øs Isra√´l Ohev Sholom Congregation. The combined congregation utilized the rue Sainte-Marguerite synagogue until 1944. In early 1943, the congregation acquired land for a synagogue and school, located at 2 rue Cr√©mazie Est, at the intersection of avenue de Salaberry.

It became his best-known novel, sold more than 200,000 copies and was turned into a movie twice, in 1943 and 1983. Creation Stijn Streuvels was married in 1905 and had moved to Het Lijsternest, his house in Ingooigem where he would live for the remainder of his life. Between November 1906 and January 1907, he wrote De vlaschaard. Publication De vlaschaard was pre-published in five parts (one part for each of the first three chapters, and two parts for the much longer final chapter) in the Dutch magazine De Beweging (The movement) between January and June 1907. In December of the same year, the first impression of the book was published in Amsterdam by L.J. Veen. It had 332 pages. The same year a luxury edition of 250 copies with cover illustration by Emmanuel Vi√©rin was printed. Further Veen editions appeared in 1910, 1912, 1914, 1917, 1920 (as part of the Collected Works of Streuvels), and 1926. The 9th impression, in 1932, was the first to be published by Flemish publisher Lannoo, with a cover illustration by Jozef Cantr√©. The 10th impression, in 1941, was again with Veen (in a reedition of the Collected Works), but in the same year Lannoo published a cheap edition (\\"Volksuitgave\\" or \\"People's edition\\") of 100,000 copies. The 12th impression was still in 1941, in the \\"Lijsternestreeks\\", a new series of the collected works of Streuvels published by Lannoo and Standaard Uitgeverij, with illustrations by Renaat Demoen. This brought the total number of copies of the book to 160,000. The 13th edition, in 1942, was a special edition for South Africa and was printed in Pretoria by J.L. Van Schaik. Standaard published in 1943 a special film edition to coincide with the release of the German movie version. The same year, Lannoo published another film edition. Standaard and Lannoo again collaborated in 1944 for a special signed luxury edition of 1,000 copies to celebrate the milestone of 200,000 copies. This version was illustrated by Albert Saverys. After the Second World War, multiple publishers created new editions in 1948, 1953, 1955 and 1962. In 1965 Descl√©e de Brouwer created another luxury edition, this time illustrated by Frans Masereel. Further editions appeared in 1966, 1967, 1968, 1970 (4), 1972 (as part of the Complete Works, and as a reprint of the Masereel luxury edition), 1974, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1983 (a film edition to coincide with the second movie), 1985, 1989, 1993 and finally the 39th edition in 2003 (newspaper edition for Het Laatste Nieuws). Plot The novel has four parts: \\"De zaaidhede\\" (\\"the sowing\\"), \\"De wiedsters\\" (\\"the weed removers\\"), \\"Bloei\\" (\\"flowering\\"), and \\"De slijting\\" (the manual pulling of the flax without removal of the roots). It is situated on a prosperous farm of flax growers. The main focus is the conflict between the old farmer Vermeulen and his son and successor Louis, culminating in a row where the farmer badly beats his son, eventually resulting in his death. Films De vlaschaard was turned into a movie twice. The first version was maid in Germany in 1943 and was called Wenn die Sonne wieder scheint. Paul Wegener and Paul Wegener played the main roles, and it was directed by Boleslaw Barlog. In 1983 a Flemish version called De vlaschaard was made by Jan Gruyaert, with the main roles played by Vic Moeremans and Ren√© van Sambeek.

Being a layered substance, PtSe2 can be split into thin layers down to three atoms thick called monolayers. PtSe2 is a semimetal or semiconductor depending on thickness. Formation Minozzi was the first to report synthesising platinum diselenide from the elements in 1909. Platinum diselenide can be formed by heating thin foils of platinum in selenium vapour at 400 ¬∞C. A platinum 111 surface exposed to selenium vapour at 270 ¬∞C forms a monolayer of PtSe2. In addition to these selenization methods, PtSe2 can be made by precipitation in water solution of Pt(IV) treated with hydrogen selenide, or by heating platinum tetrachloride with elemental selenium. Natural occurrence Platinum diselenide occurs naturally as the mineral Sudovikovite. It was named after Russian petrologist, N.G. Sudovikov who lived from 1903 to 1966. The mineral's hardness is 2 to 2. Sudovikovite was found in the Srednyaya Padma mine, Velikaya Guba uranium-vanadium deposit, Zaonezhie peninsula, Karelia Republic, Russia. Properties Platinum diselenide forms crystals in the cadmium iodide structure. This means that the substance forms layers. Each of the monolayers has a central bed of platinum atoms, with a sheet of selenium atoms above and below. This structure is also called \\"1T\\" and has an trigonal structure. The layers are only weakly bonded together, and it is possible to exfoliate layers to bilayers or monolayers. In bulk the material is semi- metallic, but when reduced to few layers it becomes a semiconductor. The conductivity of the bulk material is 620,000 S/m. The XPS spectrum shows a peak at 72.3 eV from Pt 4f core, and also has peaks from Pt 5p3/2 and Se 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 at 55.19and 54.39 eV. Phonon vibrations are designated by the infrared active A2u (Se vibrating out of plane opposite to Pt), Eu (in layer vibration, Se opposite to Pt), and Raman active A1g (Se top and bottom atoms moving out of plane in opposite directions 205 cm‚àí1), and Eg (In plane, top and botom Se atoms moving opposite 175 cm‚àí1). In the Raman spectrum, the A1g is lessened when stimulated emissions polarised perpendicular to the incoming rays are measured. The Eg mode is red-shifted when more layers are stacked. (166 cm‚àí1 for bilayer and 155 cm‚àí1 for bulk material) The A1g emission only has a slight change when thickness varies. The band gap is calculated as 1.2 eV for monolayers, and 0.21 eV for bilayers. For a trylayer or thicker the substance loses a bandgap and becomes semimetallic. PtSe2 can change its conductance in the presence of particular gases, such as nitrogen dioxide. Within a few seconds, NO2 absorbs on the surface of the PtSe2 material and lowers the resistance. When the gas is absent, high resistance returns again in about a minute. The Seebeck coefficient of PtSe2 is 40 ŒºV/K. Although pristine platinum diselenide is nonmagnetic, the presence of platinum vacancies and strain were predicted to induce magnetism. Later magneto- transport studies have indeed shown that defective PtSe2 exhibits magnetic properties. Due to RKKY interaction between magnetic Pt-vacancies, this results in layer-dependent ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic behavior. Monolayers of platinum diselenide show helical spin texture, which is not expected for centrosymmetric materials such as this. This property could be due to a local dipole induced Rashba effect. It means that PtSe2 is a potential spintronics material. Reactions Water can physisorb to the surface of platinum diselenide with an energy of ‚àí0.19 eV, and similarly for oxygen with energy ‚àí0.13 eV. Water and oxygen do not react at toom temperature, because significant energy would be required to break apart the molecules. Comparison Palladium diselenide has a different modified pyrite structure. Palladium ditelluride has a similar structure to platinum diselenide. Platinum disulfide is a semiconductor, and platinum ditelluride is metallic in nature. More complex substances with platinum and selenium also exist, including the quaternary chalcogenides Rb2Pt3USe6 and Cs2Pt3USe6 Jacutingaite is a ternary platinum selenide HgPtSe3. Use Platinum diselenide is proposed for use as a mid-infra red detector superior to black phosphorus in durability in air. Also it can work as a catalyst, and can be built into field effect transistors. Combined with graphene it can be a photocatalyst, converting water and oxygen to reactive hydroxyl radical and superoxide. This reaction works when photons produce holes and electrons. The holes can neutralise hydroxide to make hydroxyl, and the electrons attach to oxygen to make superoxide. These reactive species can mineralise organic matter.

The ethnonym Koko Yao is said literally to mean 'talk, speech' (koko/kuku) 'this way' (yao), though this has been questioned. Language Pakadji is one of the Umpila group of dialects within the North Cape York Paman languages. They had a highly developed sign language, but used generally only one hand, with rapid movements, and little secondary reinforcement by physical or facial tics or gestures. Country Pakadji territory embraced roughly an area of 1,300 sq. miles around Weymouth Bay, the Pascoe River, and Temple Bay. It reached northwards as far as Cape Grenville; and ran to the southeast at Cape Weymouth. Inland it extended to the Dividing Range. Lifestyle and economy The Pakadji were one of the Kawadji, or sandbeach people. These coastal tribes basically exploited the rich food resources on and off the sea-line facing the Coral Sea. The year was divided into two seasons, the kawali or dry season that began with the onset of the south-east trade winds, from April through to November, and wullo wantjan/wullo waiyin ('when thunder cries') the season ushered in with the arrival of the northwest monsoon, beginning in late November/early December. In the kawali period they were often venture inland to harvest vegetables (mai'yi), yams (dampu) and bush honey, and construction materials like spear wood and weaving grasses. Ceremonies Donald Thomson gained the confidence of the Pakadji while spending 4 months with them during the season in which their initiation ceremonies (Okainta) were held, and was permitted to be present during the rites.

It was published by The Adventure Company, and is the sequel to the 1999 title The Crystal Key. Gameplay and plot Crystal Key 2s plot builds upon that of the original, and casts the player as Call, who seeks to stop the minions of Ozgar and save the world of Evany. Development Crystal Key 2 was revealed by DreamCatcher Interactive's Adventure Company label in April 2003, at first under the name Crystal Key II: The Far Realm. It was among a slew of announcements in preparation for the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), and Marek Bronstring of Adventure Gamers called it one of the publisher's \\"top titles premiering at the show\\", alongside Traitors Gate II: Cypher. Earthlight Productions developed Crystal Key 2 with Virtools and V-Ray. It was designed to feature spherical 360¬∞ panoramas, unlike its predecessor's more limited viewing areas. According to John Matheson, Earthlight sought to overcome the problems that had affected The Crystal Keys production pipeline and give its art team more room \\"to be as creative as possible\\". Initially developed by Earthlight and set for a late-2003 release, Crystal Key 2 underwent \\"many years\\" of production and took longer than The Adventure Company had wanted, Beno√Æt Hozjan of Kheops Studio later remarked. As a result, Kheops was hired to co-develop the game late in production, which Hozjan said included \\"the programming and the integration, hand in hand with John Matheson.\\" In July 2003, Matheson estimated Crystal Key 2 as 75% complete and on track for December, but it ultimately launched in March 2004. Reception According to the review aggregation website Metacritic, Crystal Key 2s critical reception was \\"mixed or average\\".

The galaxy lies 50 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 2681 is approximately 55,000 light years across. NGC 2681 has an active galactic nucleus and it is a type 3 Seyfert galaxy. Its nucleus is also a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region. NGC 2681 has possibly three bars, with a relatively large bar at the outer side. Because the galaxy is seen nearly face-on, the bar like structures cannot be projection effects. From earth based observations, in B-I images the galaxy showed neither grand design spirals nor a ring, but only two symmetrical spiral arms starting from the end of the primary bar. Ia HŒ± images some HII regions were observed in the spiral arms. A dust spiral is seen in Hubble space telescope images extending to the centre. The lack of stellar gradient in the central regions and the data from Faint Object Camera, Faint Object Spectrograph and International Ultraviolet Explorer indicate that the galaxy had a starburst event approximately one billion years ago, possibly after the tidal interaction with another galaxy, which involved all the galaxy. Dynamical modeling of the velocity dispersions suggests that NGC 2681 hosts a supermassive black hole whose upper mass limit was set at 6√ó107 M‚äô. As observed from Chandra X-ray Observatory, NGC 2681 displayed three stellar sources within the central kiloparsec of the galaxy. The active galactic nucleus had luminosity 1.8 √ó 1038 erg/s, which accounts for approximately the 20% of the total luminosity of the central kiloparsec.

She is best known for opening an academy to teach drawing, water-colour, music and language in Montreal. as well as her work dealing with the affairs of taking charge of German colonists during her husband William Berczy's travels.  Early life  Allamand was born in Lausanne, Switzerland. She was the second of two daughters born of Jean-Emmanuel Allamand and Judith-Henriette-Fran√ßoise David. Her father worked as a draper and dyer, which allowed Allamand to receive a good education. In 1785, Jeanne met her husband Albert-Guillaume Berczy, who later called himself William. At this time, he was working as a painter of miniatures. The two were married near Lausanne on November 1, 1785. Shortly after, they had two sons, William Bent and Charles Albert.  Personal Life and Education  The couple lived in Florence until about 1790, though they travelled frequently. In that year, they moved to London and both exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy of Arts. William exhibited a miniature and Allamand two genre scenes called ‚ÄúTuscan kitchen interiors‚Äù. Allamand had received previous painting instruction through her previous education in Lausanne. She also received lessons later on from her husband in Florence. The following year in 1791, Allamand's husband accepted the task of recruiting German colonists and they led them to the Genesee Association in New York state. Allamand, her husband and their eldest son left with the first group of settlers in the spring of 1792. Shortly after, the agent of the American colonization group, Charles Williamson, did not meet the terms of their agreement and Berczy left the settlement to near present-day Canaseraga, New York late in 1793 to seek help. After her husband left, Allamand was left in charge of the immigrants for the winter of 1793-94, alongside the Lutheran minister who had accompanied the immigrants previously. Allamand taking charge of the colonists was a role which she was in frequently, upon her husband's departures and she did so capably. After the first association was not a success, Allamand's husband assisted in the formation of a new association without Williamson's knowledge. The new German Company aimed to develop land in Upper Canada. Allamand and the pastor were left in charge of preparing the settlers for departure to the new location. The couple successfully led the colonists to Upper Canada where they were given land in Markham Township. Following this, Allamand and Berczy settled themselves in York, now known as Toronto. Unfortunately, the Berczys and the new settlers struggled in the newly developing land and were running short of supplies much faster than anticipated. The Association backers were also reluctant to commit more money, which forced Berczy to again depart travelling extensively to secure food and tools, which he was often putting on credit. During her husband's extensive travelling, Allamand was once again left responsible for the affairs of the settlement. In the later years of her life, Allamand had many difficult times where she struggled immensely with the lacking presence and support of her husband. She opened a haberdashery and textile shop to try and provide some source of income for her and her sons. Despite this attempt, she still lived in near poverty with little to none of the money owed to her husband by the settlers being repaid. The majority of the rest of Allamand's husband's life was occupied by travels in attempt to settle agreements and make ends meet. At one point, Berczy was forced to sell their house and Allamand was nearly homeless if not for the sympathy of the new owner who allowed her to stay. Eventually, Berczy returned and moved his family to Montreal in 1798. He departed for England the following year and did not return again until 1802, once again leaving Allamand to fend for herself. She dealt with matters of the Markham settlements through agents, all while trying to support her family. For the rest of Allamand's life, her husband was only present briefly from time to time.  Teaching career  When left to support herself alone in Montreal, Allamand opened an academy school for girls in her small rented accommodations to teach drawing, water-colour, music, and languages. Her school of arts was quite successful, with some quite notable pupils studying with her. Likely her most noted pupil was Louise-Am√©lie Panet, daughter of Pierre-Louis Panet. Louis-Am√©lie learned many things from Allamand's academy of the arts and later became a painter and art teacher. She also married Allamand's son, William Bent in 1819. Allamand passed on her artistic teachings to her younger son, Charles Albert as well. Allamand's husband passed away in New York in 1813, however she still continued to teach until 1817.  Life after Husband's Death  At some point after 1817, she joined her son William Bent in his home in Sandwich (which is Windsor of today) in Upper Canada. Allamand lived the remainder of her years with her son as a quiet life, only occasionally painting as a hobby. Around 1832, Allamand's son and his wife moved to Sainte-M√©lanie, in the seigneury of Ailleboust which Louis-Am√©lie had inherited. Allamand went with her son for this last move. She died there in the presence of her family in 1839. After her death, there were many letters discovered that were exchanged between her and her husband throughout their lives and during his constant travels. The letters are filled with expressions of love and respect for each other. It seems that despite their distance, Allamand and her husband remained strong throughout the journeys of their lives. Allamand was always a dutiful and supportive wife through all of her husband's trials and tribulations. It was clearly a strength and a talent that she possessed to maintain their family's strength even through difficult times during hid absences. Without Allamand's efforts, her husband's colonization scheme would have been much more difficult to carry out and their family could have very well fallen into poverty.

Life Kennedy was born in the family home at 9 Campden Hill Villas, Kensington, London on 11 March 1846, the eldest son of the Rev William James Kennedy and his cousin, Sarah Caroline Kennedy, and grandson to the Rev Rann Kennedy. He was born into a family of distinguished classicists: three of his uncles had been senior classics at Cambridge; Benjamin Hall Kennedy, the former headmaster of Shrewsbury School and Professor of Greek at Cambridge, who headed the Tripos in 1827; Charles Rann Kennedy, a barrister and noted translator of Demosthenes, in 1831; and George John Kennedy, in 1832. All three were also Porson medallists at Cambridge (Kennedy's father was also claimed to be a Porson medallist, but his name is not listed). Kennedy was sent to study at Eton College rather than the traditional family school of Shrewsbury, largely as his uncle was headmaster there. He won a foundation scholarship at King's College, Cambridge. After winning the Craven and Bell scholarships and the Powis Medal, he came top in classics in 1868 - the fourth member of his family to do. Afterwards he was elected to a fellowship at Pembroke College, Cambridge. For a year he served as private secretary President of the Poor Law Board. Law Kennedy was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1871, and he took silk in 1885. His practice was mainly in Liverpool on circuit. In 1891 he published Law on Civil Salvage (a second edition would be published in 1907). Politics Kenedy stood for election three times for the Liberal Party, but lost on all three occasions. He stood for Birkenhead in 1885 and 1892 and lost to General Sir Edward Hamley both times. Later in 1892 he contested the seat of St Helens, where he narrowly lost to Sir Henry Seton-Karr by just 59 votes. Judicial office After his defeat in the St Helen's by-election in 1892, Kennedy was appointed as a High Court judge assigned to the Queen's Bench. On the bench Kennedy developed a reputation as a slow and ponderous judge; his cleverness tending towards indecision. In 1893 Vanity Fair published a highly critical article of him, stating that although he was \\"liked and respected\\" nonetheless \\"with all his virtues, he is a failure as a judge\\", and concluding that he was \\"a very weak Judge with excellent intentions.\\" In 1907 he was elevated to the Court of Appeal and appointed to the Privy Council. He would hold these offices until his death in 1915. Notable decisions which Kennedy was involved in included the first instance decision in Allen v Flood [1898] AC 1.

According to Norman Tindale, they are to be distinguished from the Kokangol, higher up on the Alice River watershed. Language Olkola belongs to the Kunjen branch of the Southwestern Paman languages, as is mutually intelligible with Uw Oykangand, one of the other dialects of that group. Country The Olkolo are the traditional owners of some extending from the Middle Coleman River, as far south as Crosbie River., and including the western margins of the Quinkan region. Lifestyle and ecology The Olkolo are one of the Kawadji, or sandbeach people, who harvested the maritime resources available to them as coastal dwellers opposite the Coral Sea. Traditionally, the rhythm of their foraging depended on the climatic changes over two seasons, the dry season that arrived with the south-east trade winds, blowing from April through to November, followed by the northwest monsoon season, beginning in late November/early December. During the dry season they would on occasion move inland to cull vegetables and timber, but otherwise spent the major part of the year camped on the shores. History By 1889 Olkolo people could be found in camps south of their traditional grounds, in the Coen area. One descendant, Willy Long of Laura recalled several decades later a massacre, from which his parents survived, which took place by 40 troopers under Sub- Inspector Urquhart from the Musgrave police station. The ambushed Olkolo fled and sought refuge in swamps, where they were gunned down, in one of 5 such massacres that took place in 1889.

It comprises an international community of scholars and students, writers and artists with an interest in the broad field of Beat culture and the writers and artists associated with the Beat Generation. It holds annual conferences and promotes research and collaboration in the field of Beat Studies and the arts. It is particularly transnational in focus, as Dr. Chad Weidner writes: 'The impetus of the European Beat Studies Network (EBSN) provides an additional forum for transnational angles into the Beats.' Board and membership The EBSN is run by a board of seven that includes Beat scholars Paul Aliferis, Frida Forsgren, Benjamin J. Heal, Raven See and Chad Weidner. Current membership stands at over two hundred, drawn from across Europe and around the world. President - Professor Oliver Harris Professor Harris, a William Burroughs scholar, has done much to promote and develop the EBSN. The Jewish Telegraph notes that Harris and colleagues 'set up the European Beat Studies Network because they had found previous academic conferences boring', with the 2016 Manchester Conference described as 'the largest conference of scholars, poets, filmmakers and musical performers interested in the Beat Generation.' In a 2014 interview with Frank Rynne published on the official William S. Burroughs website Harris describes the aim of the EBSN: The EBSN is frequently discussed and endorsed in both popular and scholarly works such as Professor Andrew Lees' memoir Mentored by a Madman: The William Burroughs Experiment (2016) and Kerouac on Record: A Literary Soundtrack (2018). Simon Warner, an editor of the latter, writes in his acknowledgments thanking 'those involved in Popular Music Studies and Beat Studies (with special reference to the European Beat Studies Network) - for their continued efforts to open up new and interesting areas of inquiry,' while Lees writes that 'Oliver Harris encouraged me to look at Burroughs' work from a scientific viewpoint and invited me to join a group of deadbeats (the European Beat Studies Network) whose imagination knows no limits.'  Conferences  The core function of the EBSN is to facilitate, promote and manage its annual conference, which has been held in the Netherlands, Denmark, Morocco, Belgium, England and France. The Tangier, Morocco conference received significant media attention in Huffington Post Morocco and El Mundo. A review of the Brussels, Belgium conference was published in the American Studies journal Transatlantica. Notable keynote speakers and performers appearing at previous conferences include Beat poet and Naropa Institute founder Anne Waldman, poet Robert Gibbons, musician, author and broadcaster CP Lee, noted neurologist Professor Andrew Lees, writer and academic Anouar Majid, noted English Beat poets Libby Houston and Pete Brown, and folk singer-songwriter Eric Andersen.  Publications  Essays derived from papers presented at the 2011 EBSN conference in Middelburg, the Netherlands, were published in a 2013 edition of the Journal of Comparative American Studies. Essays derived from papers presented at the 2014 EBSN conference in Tangier, Morocco, were published in a 2016 EBSN special issue of the Purdue University Press Q2 rated Journal CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture, edited by EBSN founders Oliver Harris and Polina Mackay. The EBSN website also contains original scholarship including one of the last interviews with Carolyn Cassady, and many reviews of works of Beat and related scholarship, such as Alexander Adams' review of Iain Sinclair's American Smoke, referenced on Sinclair's website.

Administrative controls are training, procedure, policy, or shift designs that lessen the threat of a hazard to an individual. Administrative controls typically change the behavior of people (e.g., factory workers) rather than removing the actual hazard or providing personal protective equipment (PPE). Administrative controls are fourth in larger hierarchy of hazard controls, which ranks the effectiveness and efficiency of hazard controls. Administrative controls are more effective than PPE because they involve some manner of prior planning and avoidance, whereas PPE only serves only as a final barrier between the hazard and worker. Administrative controls are second lowest because they require workers or employers to actively think or comply with regulations and do not offer permanent solutions to problems. Generally, administrative controls are cheaper to begin, but they may become more expensive over time as higher failure rates and the need for constant training or re-certification eclipse the initial investments of the three more desirable hazard controls in the hierarchy. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends administrative controls when hazards cannot be removed or changed, and engineering controls are not practical. Some common examples of administrative controls include work practice controls such as prohibiting mouth pipetting and recapping of needles, as well as rotating worker shifts in coal mines to prevent hearing loss. Other examples include hours of service regulations for commercial vehicle operators, Safety signage for hazards, and regular maintenance of equipment.

Origin in Austria  Hertha Natzler (also Herta Natzler) was born on in Vienna as the daughter of actor, opera singer and playwright Leopold Natzler (1860‚Äì1929) and Emilie Franziska Theresia Rachel ('Emilia' or 'Lili') Meissner (1873‚Äì1957). Her father and mother were both actors, who were well-known in Austria and Germany. Hertha was one of five sisters, two of whom died young. Her cousin was actor Reggie Nalder.  On stage and in film in Vienna, 1928‚Äì1936  Like her two surviving sisters, Grete Natzler (1906‚Äì1999) and Alice Maria ('Lizzi') Natzler (1909‚Äì1993), Hertha started acting and singing on stage at a young age.Sedlak, Karin (2009) \\"Heiterkeit auf Lebenszeit\\" ... ? Hugo Wiener und seine Wirkungsst√§tten: Ein Beitrag zur Kabarett- und Exilforschung. (PhD thesis, University of Vienna) 127. She made her debut in Franz Leh√°r's operetta Der Tsarewitsch at the Johann Strauss Theatre in Vienna in May 1928.Reichspost, 13 May 1928: 12; Wiener Zeitung, 15 May 1928: 61. That year she also played a minor role in the revue Jetzt oder Nie,Das interessante Blatt, 28 October 1928: 20. and in the play Weekend im Paradies, the 1928 rendition of the Wiener Kammerspiele Revue.Reichspost, 12 December 1928: 11. Hertha performed many such roles during 1928‚Äì1936 in play and operetta performances in different venues in Vienna, such as in several renditions of the Femina Revue.Sedlak 2009: 405-489. She also played minor roles in films produced in Vienna and Budapest: Peter (1934), Maskerade (1934), Nocturno (1934) and Leap into Bliss (1935). Nevertheless, Hertha was not as well-known as her sisters Grete and Lizzi, and did not follow them to Germany to in pursuit of an international career.  Leaving Austria for Hollywood and Cairo, 1937‚Äì1938  The Natzler family was of Jewish origin. Following Hitler seizing absolute power in Germany in March 1933 and the start of anti-Semitic legislation, Grete and Lizzi were offered increasingly fewer roles in films and stage performances in Germany. Grete had renounced her Jewish faith in 1930. She moved to the UK in 1934 and went to Hollywood on a one-year contract with Paramount in 1935. By 1937 she had achieved minor celebrity as a film star and singer, had taken the stage name Della Lind, and was better known to an American audience as 'MGM's exotic Viennese singing actress'.San Bernardino Sun, 14 May 1938: 7; Weniger, Kay (2011) \\"Es wird im Leben dir mehr genommen als gegeben ...\\" Lexikon der aus Deutschland und ≈åsterreich emigrierten Filmschaffenden 1933 bis 1945: Eine Gesamt√ºbersicht. (Hamburg: Abacus Verlag) 357-358. Lizzi left Berlin to return to Vienna in 1933, but Austria experienced a similar political radicalization as Germany. Particularly during 1936‚Äì1937, which in 1938 resulted in Austria's Anschluss with Germany. Jewish people were increasingly barred from the positions they held in Austria's society. Lizzi's last film role was in Heut' ist der sch√∂nste Tag in meinem Leben, which was shot in 1935 and released in May 1936. Hertha's last performance in Vienna was in the Femina Revue in March 1936.Der Morgen, Wiener Montagblatt, 23 March 1936: 7. She was unemployed when she renounced her Jewish faith in April 1937.Die Stimme: J√ºdische Zeitung, 9 April 1937: 9. Together with Lizzi and her mother Lilly, Hertha left Austria and traveled to Rotterdam, from where they took the Dutch SS Statendam to New York in August 1937. Their destination was Hollywood and its film industry, where Grete was acting in several films, such as the Laurel and Hardy film Swiss Miss (1938). They arrived in October 1937.Der Wiener Film, 5 October 1937: 2. It appears that Hertha and Lizzi did not land any film roles in Hollywood.  Marriage to Frank Leddy, 1938‚Äì1945  Early in 1938, Hertha travelled to Cairo (Egypt), where she married Franciscus Nicolaas 'Frank' Leddy (1903‚Äì1964) on 11 April 1938.Algemeen Handelsblad, 12 April 1938; De Telegraaf, 12 April 1938. Leddy was Managing Director of Philips Orient SA, the local subsidiary of the international Philips Electronics company.Overberg, Henk (2000) 'Leddy, Franciscus Nicolaas (1903‚Äì1964)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 2000, accessed online 13 January 2017. Most likely she had met Leddy in Vienna, where Leddy had been a manager at the Vienna subsidiary of Philips until the company posted him to Cairo in 1938. They lived in the upmarket Zamalek district in Cairo.Le Mondain Egyptien, 1941, vol.2: 182. Hertha and Leddy left Cairo early in 1942 to travel to Sydney (Australia), after the Philips Company had appointed Leddy Managing Director of its Australian subsidiary. They arrived in July 1942.National Archives of Australia, SP11/2 DUTCH/LEDDY. To Hertha, Sydney may have been a backwater, compared to Vienna, Los Angeles and Cairo. It is likely that Leddy's busy work life, as well as Hertha missing her sisters and mother who had settled in Los Angeles, led to their separation and divorce in 1945.National Archives of Australia, A12508 16/1286 and C123 20110.  Los Angeles, 1945‚Äì1985  Hertha left Australia in 1945 and seems to have settled with her sisters and mother in Los Angeles. Although Grete's film career was flagging, the career of her husband, Franz Steininger (1906‚Äì1974), took off. Steininger was the godson of Franz Leh√°r and worked in Hollywood as a film music composer and orchestra leader and conductor. Lizzi had married Manuel Tortosa, and became better known in Los Angeles as Litzie Maria Tortosa.Weniger 2011: 358. Although she did not resume her acting and singing career, Hertha remained in Los Angeles. She died on 5 August 1985, and lies buried at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City in Los Angeles.

The sisters were Mother Martin and Sister (Sr) Tarcisius Mongin of France, Sr Mary of the Holy Name of Ireland and Sr Frances Chambers of Newfoundland, Canada All three sisters are buried in the old Suva Cemetery.

In 1938 (which was the golden jubilee of the sisters' arrival in Fiji) the sisters opened a secondary department on the third floor of St Anne's Primary School ‚Äì it was called St Philomena's. There was also a small secondary branch attached to St Joseph's Primary School which was on the site where the Reserve Bank is now, next to the Sacred Heart Cathedral. It was in 1956 that both secondary departments of St Anne's (St Philomena's) and St Joseph's Primary (St Joseph's Secondary) were transferred to the present site. The staff was mainly sisters of the congregation. The driving force behind the growth of St Joseph's was a little Irish sister known as Sr Loius Woodnut whom she was small in stature but very large in her ability to supervise the growth of this special school for girls. Together with the other sisters, some of whom are present today, managed to establish a school of excellence in both academic and spiritual fields.

Born in New York to a prominent family descended from Huguenots, Gerard attended Groton School and Trinity College, Cambridge. After serving in the army, navy, and Marine Corps during World War II, he moved to Montana and became involved in business, including mining and ranching, and politics. During the 1950s and 1960s, he was a member of both the Montana House of Representatives and the Montana Senate, serving as Republican minority leader in both. In 1974, President Richard Nixon appointed him United States Ambassador to Jamaica, a position he held through the administration of President Gerald Ford, leaving in 1977. He then moved to Florida, serving as an adjunct professor of marine archaeology at the University of Miami and sponsoring and participating in underwater archaeology expeditions. He died in 2005 in Vero Beach, Florida, aged 88.  Early life and education  Gerard was born in Melville, New York, a hamlet in the Long Island town of Huntington. Born to Sumner Gerard and Helen Coster, he had two brothers. His paternal ancestors, the Gerards, were French Huguenots who emigrated to New York in 1776 after several generations in Scotland. One of his ancestors from the maternal side of the Gerard family was Increase Sumner, Governor of Massachusetts and associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. James W. Gerard, the United States Ambassador to Germany during World War I, was his uncle. The family became prominent in business, law, and politics. Gerard Avenue in The Bronx is named for them. The Gerard family were members of the Episcopal Church. Gerard graduated from the Groton School, a private boarding secondary school in Groton, Massachusetts. He attended Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1937 and a Master of Arts in 1939.  World War II service  During World War II, Gerard served in the United States Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps. He started out as a buck private in the Army Air Corps, spent time as a parachutist, and ended his service four years later as an infantry captain of intelligence in the Marines. His service spanned such locations as the Middle East and North Africa, Washington, D.C., China, Burma, and California. In 1942, he flew with Winston Churchill to Moscow, Soviet Union, to meet Joseph Stalin. Gerard received the Army Commendation Medal and the Order of the British Empire.  Career  = Montana = After the war 1940s, Gerard became involved in his family's real estate business, the Aeon Realty Company, with interests in Manhattan, Long Island, and New Jersey. However, Gerard wished to move to the western United States. He began studying ranching, and in 1947 toured several western states, deciding on Montana. In 1948, he purchased what is now known as the Bar 7 Ranch in Ennis, Montana, moving there with his family in 1949. Gerard operated the ranch as both a home and a livestock operation, raising cattle and horses. He also owned another ranch in the town of Dillon. However, the ranch was never profitable, and Gerard received assistance from his father through monies and stocks in order to help him reduce with his significant debt. Thanks to his father's financial assistance as well as that of a company owned by his family, Gerard was able to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, covering ranch expenses, educational expenses for his children, and costs of operating a private airplane. In addition to ranching, Gerard had business interests in Billings and Bozeman, and was a mining executive for Newmont Resources and a director of Cardinal Petroleum, both based in Billings. =Politics= Sometime after moving to Montana, Gerard became involved in state politics. In 1954, he was elected to the Montana Legislature as a Republican representing Madison County, with his term beginning in 1955. He was elected to three terms in the House, serving in his final term as minority leader from 1959 to 1961. On December 17, 1959, Gerard announced his campaign for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate, and said: > [I am] convinced that Montana must look and think ahead, or we will forfeit > our potential. I intend to file for nomination to the U.S. Senate with the > hope that Montana will send new blood with a fresh outlook to Washington to > best represent all Montanans.\\" However, Gerard lost the nomination in the Republican primary, finishing second in a six-way race, earning 27% of the vote, compared to 39% of votes for nominee Orvin B. Fjare. His father helped fund his campaign, which cost $20,000. One source writes that he may have lost in the primary \\"because Montanans did not believe him to be authentically Montanan.\\" In 1962, Gerard earned the Republican nomination for the Montana Senate from Madison County. He won the election, serving in the Senate from 1962 to 1966. He was elected minority leader, serving in that capacity from 1965 to 1966. = Diplomat = In 1969, Gerard left Montana to pursue a career as a diplomat, and relocated temporarily to New Jersey. In 1969, the Nixon administration sent him to Rome, Italy, as a delegate to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In 1970, he was named mission director for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Tunisia, a position he held until 1974. On March 22, 1974, President Richard Nixon appointed him United States Ambassador to Jamaica, and he presented credentials on June 4, 1974. He served as ambassador through the presidency of Gerald Ford and the beginning of the Carter administration, leaving the position in 1977. = Later career = After leaving his ambassadorship, Gerard relocated to Florida from New Jersey. He was an active benefactor of marine biology and a frequent sponsor of underwater archaeological expeditions and in 1977 became an adjunct professor of maritime archaeology at the University of Miami.  Personal life  Gerard was married twice: first to Louise Taft Grosvenor in 1944, before divorcing in 1966, and next to Teresa Dabrowska, a native of Warsaw, Poland, whom he married in the 1960s and divorced in 2004. He had five children with his first wife: Jenny, Molly, Helen, Anne, and Sumner. Death Gerard died of natural causes in a hospital in Vero Beach, Florida, on February 24, 2005.

He was born in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire and died at Borough Green in Kent.William Bury at ESPNcricinfo Educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, Bury played cricket as a right-handed middle-order batsman. He played for Cambridge University in matches in 1860, 1861 and 1862, appearing in the University Match against Oxford University in the last two seasons, though he made little impact. In both 1861 and 1862, Bury played for Nottinghamshire when the university cricket season was over, and in 1862 he played a final match for a \\"Gentlemen of the North\\" side against an equivalent team from the south of England, and in this, his last first-class match, he made a score of 121 in his second innings, almost doubling the number of runs he made in his career. Bury graduated from Cambridge University in 1862 and was ordained as a Church of England deacon in 1863 and as a priest the following year. After brief incumbencies in Yorkshire and Dorset, he settled in Northamptonshire in 1867 and was successively rector of Haselbech to 1882 and Harlestone until 1907. In both parishes, Bury was involved with the Brixworth Poor Law union and was chairman of the board of guardians. As such, he was a leading figure in the implementation of a harsh local policy of \\"retrenchment\\" by which the Brixworth union attempted to minimise outdoor relief ‚Äì payments made to poor people outside the central workhouse ‚Äì eventually developing a series of \\"co- operative\\" welfare-to-work ventures, including subsistence agricultural work and a co-operative public house in Harlestone. Recent historians have argued that the policy was instigated largely at the insistence of the zealous Albert Pell, Member of Parliament for South Leicestershire and a Haselbech resident, with the connivance of the dominant local landowner and church benefice owner, Earl Spencer; they argue that it forced the rural poor into greater poverty or into migration to nearby towns such as Northampton. Bury was also the author of books on poor law reform that advocated the minimisation of outdoor relief and the establishment of welfare-to-work schemes. In parallel with his Poor Law guardianship, Bury was also chairman of the Brixworth Rural District from its formation as a unit of local government in 1894, though by that stage the dominance of the retrenchment view on the local Poor Law union was being actively challenged through the rise of the agricultural workers' union. After 1907, Bury moved to be rector of Ickenham, Middlesex, retiring from that post in 1919. An older brother, Thomas, also played cricket for Cambridge University and another brother, Frederick, played in the first first-class cricket match in the West Indies.

It was built in the Gothic style in the 14th century. Despite its large size, it is a chapel by status, as it does not have a parish. Today it is administered by the united parishes of the W√ºrzburg Cathedral and the '. The chapel was heavily damaged by the Bombing of W√ºrzburg in World War II and its interior was destroyed by flames. It was rebuilt in the 1950s and re-consecrated in 1962. Its two best known works of art, the sculptures of Adam and Eve by Tilman Riemenschneider, are today located in the Mainfr√§nkisches Museum and have been replaced in-situ by copies. The chapel is also the place of burial of noted Baroque architect Balthasar Neumann. History Southern portal with copies of Adam and Eve by Tilman Riemenschneider View down the nave towards the high altar On 21 April 1349 the synagogue located at this site was destroyed in the course of a pogrom. There are conflicting reports about any (wooden) structures that were erected immediately after that and whether a pilgrimage was established at the site. It is also not known whether building a chapel dedicated to Mary there was intended as atonement for the murder of the local Jews or as atonement for having earlier tolerated the presence of Christ-killers. Construction of the current church started under Bishop in 1377. It is not certain at what point in time the chapel was finished. The choir was reportedly consecrated in 1392. Burials at the site took place as early as 1411/2. By 1441 it must have been largely completed, as Bishop , driven from the cathedral, used it as his church. That same year construction started on the tower, overseen by . The tower roof was added in 1479. The Marienkapelle was no parish church, but records of its early history are sketchy. In 1393 the ', a knightly society or order, claimed the chapel. In 1412, the order made a Benefice donation for the chapel and as late as the 17th century the chapel was referred to as a Ritter- Capelle (knights' chapel), e.g. in a drawing of the town by Matth√§us Merian from 1648. However, there is also evidence that the Marienkapelle was a municipal chapel, under the control of the town council (or Rat). In 1415, the caretakers swore to be accountable to the council as well as to the bishop. Friedeberger was hired in 1441 by the town council and after 1446 this institution also appointed the caretakers. After 1478 the caretakers received a council wage. In 1452, the council decided that a Mass would be held here for each council member who died. At least from the mid-16th century, the council used the Marienkapelle as its chapel for formal occasions, foregoing use of the chapel inside the town hall, SS. Felix und Adauctus. In 1559 the F√ºrsp√§nger tried in vain to stop the custom that council members were buried inside the chapel. Burial at this place seemed to have remained an honor bestowed by the W√ºrzburg council on favored people, such as celebrated architect Balthasar Neumann, who was buried there following his death in 1753 (in an unmarked grave). In the 1490s, the council asked Tilman Riemenschneider and his workshop to add sculptures of the Apostles to the interior columns. These were removed to a museum and to the cathedral in the mid-19th century. 19th-century copies replaced them. The original Riemenschneider statues St. Dorothea and St. Magaretha flanking the choir, however, were destroyed in 1945. Later construction included 1556-8 work on the tower. The interior west gallery likely dates from 1616. In the early 18th century the roofs were renovated and the tower was topped by a Madonna, following the destruction of the original tower roof by lightning in 1711. A Baroque tower top was added by Josef Greising in 1719. Jakob van der Auwera designed the Madonna sculpture for the roof-top (1713) that was then made by goldsmith Martin N√∂tzel from copper and covered in gold (made from 400 gold ducats). In 1843-53 a major restoration was conducted by . This work included changes to the western fa√ßade and added the lower gallery and the rose window. In 1856-7, the Gothic Revival spire was added. At that time the gold cover on the Madonna was also restored. Marienkapelle (on the right) and the destroyed centre of W√ºrzburg in 1945 The chapel was heavily damaged by Allied bombing in March 1945. Following earlier air raids, the church had been used to store furniture which now fueled the fire. The interior and the rafters were completely destroyed by fire. Later fighting added damage from artillery and aircraft fire. The Marienkapelle was rebuilt in 1948-61 and re-consecrated in 1962. A major renovation took place in 1996-2003. Description Tomb of Konrad von Schaumburg, by Tilman Riemenschneider Original Adam by Riemenschneider, today in the museum at Marienberg Fortress. Original Eve by Riemenschneider The chapel is a mixture between a basilica and a hall church that was popular in the late-Gothic period. It has three aisles and five bays. The middle aisle is only slightly higher than the side aisles. The roof rests on octagonal pillars. The eastern choir extends three bays. The proportions are somewhat skewed towards the vertical: on a plan of 26.5 meters by 18 meters the nave rises 21.5 meters in the center, 20 meters in the side aisles. The church features three notable Gothic portals. The southern portal (Brautpforte) from 1430, is flanked by the sculptures of Adam and Eve. The tympanum shows the Coronation of the Virgin, with the Saints Barbara and Katharina. The western portal (Goldene Pforte), made after 1430, has a tympanum with the Last Judgment. The central pillar formerly held a stone Madonna (Sch√∂ne Madonna, ca. 1441) that is today located inside the church (replaced by a copy in its original setting). Finally, the northern portal from the early 15th century shows the Annunciation. The Riemenschneider figures of Adam and Eve (delivered in 1493) were removed to the museum in 1894 (then the Luitpoldmuseum). Most of the movable interior decoration was replaced in the Gothic revival period in the 19th century and was destroyed in 1945. The current high altar (early 16th century) was brought here after the war from Neum√ºnster; its previous provenance is not completely clear. Although most of the sepulchral art was destroyed by the fire of 1945, the interior still features a number of tombs and epitaphs such as the epitaph for J√∂rg Schrimpf (d. 1556) by Peter Dell der J√ºngere and the epitaph for Anna K√ºlwein (d. 1563). Most notable is the grave of Konrad von Schaumburg (d. 1499) by Tilman Riemenschneider. This was ordered in 1500 and was originally colored, the armor was golden. This sculpture was also heavily damaged by fire in 1945 and restored after the war. There was no contemporary monument for Balthasar Neumann, a key contributor to the design of W√ºrzburg Residence, who was buried at the second column of the southern aisle. In the 1950s a bronze memorial plaque was added to commemorate him. The top of the gold-covered Madonna crowning the tower rises 72 meters above the market square. Although it had survived the bombing of 16 March 1945 unharmed, it was subsequently damaged by repeated strafing from Allied aircraft during the fighting in the city. Post-war it was painstakingly reconstructed. Together with the globe at its feet, the statue measures 5.75 meters in height and weighs around 1,200 kg.

A fork influences the validity of the rules. Forks are typically conducted in order to add new features to a blockchain, to reverse the effects of hacking or catastrophic bugs. Forks require consensus to be resolved or else a permanent split emerges. Forks of the client software The following are forks of the software client for the bitcoin network: ; Bitcoin XT: A fork initiated by Mike Hearn. The current reference implementation for bitcoin contains a computational bottleneck. The actual fork was preceded by Mike Hearn publishing a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP 64) on June 10, 2014, calling for the addition of \\"a small P2P protocol extension that performs UTXO lookups given a set of outpoints.\\" On December 27, 2014 Hearn released version 0.10 of the forked client XT, with the BIP 64 changes. It achieved significant attention within the bitcoin community in mid-2015 amid a contentious debate among core developers over increasing the block size cap. :On June 22, 2015, Gavin Andresen published BIP 101 calling for an increase in the maximum block size. The changes would activate a fork allowing eight MB blocks (doubling in size every two years) once 75% of a stretch of 1,000 mined blocks is achieved after the beginning of 2016. The new maximum transaction rate under XT would have been 24 transactions per second. :On August 6, 2015 Andresen's BIP101 proposal was merged into the XT codebase. Bip 101 was reverted and the 2-MB block size bump of Bitcoin Classic was applied instead. :The August 2015 release of XT received widespread media coverage. The Guardian wrote that \\"bitcoin is facing civil war\\". :Wired wrote that \\"Bitcoin XT exposes the extremely social ‚Äî extremely democratic ‚Äî underpinnings of the open source idea, an approach that makes open source so much more powerful than technology controlled by any one person or organization.\\" Developer Adam Back was critical of the 75% activation threshold being too low and that some of the changes were insecure. :On August 25, 2017, Bitcoin XT published Release G, which was a Bitcoin Cash client by default. Subsequently, Release H was published, which supported the November 2017 Bitcoin Cash protocol upgrade, followed by Release I, which supported the May 2018 Bitcoin Cash protocol upgrade. ; Bitcoin Classic: In its first 8 months, Bitcoin Classic promoted a single increase of the maximum block size from one megabyte to two megabytes. In November 2016 this changed and the project moved to a solution that moved the limit out of the software rules into the hands of the miners and nodes. ; Bitcoin Unlimited All three software clients attempt to increase transaction capacity of the network. None achieved a majority of the hash power. Intended hard forks splitting the cryptocurrency Hard forks splitting bitcoin (aka \\"split coins\\") are created via changes of the blockchain rules and sharing a transaction history with bitcoin up to a certain time and date. The first hard fork splitting bitcoin happened on 1 August 2017, resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash. The following is a list of notable hard forks splitting bitcoin by date and/or block: * Bitcoin Cash: Forked at block 478558, , for each bitcoin (BTC), an owner got 1 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ** Bitcoin SV: Forked at block 556766, , for each Bitcoin Cash (BCH), an owner got 1 Bitcoin SV (BSV). * Bitcoin Gold: Forked at block 491407, , for each bitcoin (BTC), an owner got 1 Bitcoin Gold (BTG) Intended soft forks splitting from not-most-work block * The fork fixing the value overflow incident was controversial because it was announced after the exploit was mined. It was assigned CVE-2010-5139.

He is best known for developing ice-sheet models and leading model intercomparisons.  Early life and education  Frank Pattyn was born in Etterbeek on 4 March 1966. He completed his Bachelor and Master degrees in geography at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 1986 and 1988, respectively. He then obtained his PhD in ice sheet modelling from the same institution in 1998. His doctoral thesis is entitled ‚Äú Ice-sheet dynamics in eastern Dronning Maud Land, Antarcticahttp://biblio.vub.ac.be/opac/3/330336‚Äù.  Career and impact  After completing his PhD, Pattyn then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institute of Polar Research, Tokyo, Japan (1999-2000) before coming back to Belgium as a research associate at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. In 2000, he started to teach geomorphology and climatology at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles where he became a professor in 2011. Since 2006, he has also become co-director of the Laboratoire de Glaciologie of the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles. He is currently Chairman of the Belgian National Committee on Antarctic Research, the Belgian branch of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research and the vice-president of the International Glaciological Society and Associate Chief Editor of Journal of Glaciology. Pattyn has authored over 70 peer-review papers (including 6 from high-profile journals) covering various aspect of glaciology, which are cited over 1700 times. His research includes ice-sheet modelling with in situ and remote sensing observations, to evaluate the present-day and future mass changes of the Antarctic ice sheet. He has developed several ice-sheet models, such as a three-dimensional thermomechanical ice-sheet model including higher-order stress gradients (Blatter-Pattyn model), and more recently the fast Elementary Thermomechanical Ice Sheet model (f.ETISh). Such models are capable of simulating the behaviour of fast-flowing ice streams and ice flow across subglacial lakes, and over long time scales. He is also actively involved in a series of Ice-Sheet Model Intercomparison Projects (ISMIP), such as ISMIP-HOM, ISMIP-HEINO, MISMIP, MISMIP3D, and MISMIP+. He took part in 19 expeditions to Antarctica and Arctic glaciers in order to study the interaction of glaciers and ice sheets with subglacial water and the ocean, using ground-penetrating radar and differential GPS. Since taking office as a professor, he has also paid attention to the outreach of glaciology. In particular, he developed the Grantism model, which allows to simulate the evolution of the Greenland and the Antarctic according to parameters understandable to all (temperature, sea level). He recently set up the Tweeting ice shelf, a project which consists of two GPS placed on the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf, East Antarctica that communicate their position and movement via Twitter.  Awards and honours  Pattyn has received the 2018 Louis Agassiz Medal, an award from the European Geosciences Union that recognises his outstanding scientific contribution to the study of the cryosphere.

Its name and decoration commemorate the fortitude city dwellers demonstrated during the nearly 900-day-long 1941‚Äì44 Nazi Germany Siege of Leningrad as the square opens the way to the biggest burial place of the siege victims Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery. The underground station of the same name opened next to the square on 31 December 1975. The square joins five streets, two of which form northeastern roughly latitudinal part of the city's Central Arc Thoroughfare that as a whole connects much of the city's uptown residential areas with southwestern and northwestern suburban motorways. Mostly nearly longitudinal Polytechnical Street and its northern coaxials mark the boundary between Vyborg District and Kalinin District of the city. Overview =Site and name= The square and the station were designed on the route to Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery where hundreds of thousands people, mostly civilian victims, are buried from the 1941‚Äì44 siege of the city during World War II. =Road connections= The roundabout joins five streets. One of them, Politekhnicheskaya ulitsa (Polytechnical Street), passes through it tangentially to the central island. The street was named after the city's Polytechnical Institute and links the square with the institute northwards, and, to the southwest, with the Kushelevka railway station, Forest Institute neighbourhood, and streets leading to downtown St Petersburg. In the second half of the 20th century, the street got two metro stations and was continued in the newer northern built up residential areas by Tikhoretskiy Prospekt (Tikhoretsk Avenue) and Prospekt Kultury (Culture Avenue), the three streets making a single thoroughfare that reaches the northern city boundary and the Saint Petersburg Ring Road, over a junction with which a motorway goes north into suburban Vsevolozhsk District of Leningrad Oblast. Four other streets start or end at the Muzhestva roundabout. Prospekt Nepokoryonnykh (Avenue of the Unconquered) goes roughly eastwards, and takes visitors to Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery on the left-hand side of the street. In the 21st century the avenue was seamlessly reconnected as part of Central Arc Thoroughfare with Shafirov Avenue by an interchange over Piskaryovskiy Prospekt, thus making two other connections with the Ring Road and new residential and industrial areas of the urban and suburban northeast. Prospekt Morisa Toreza (Maurice Thorez Avenue, named so in the Soviet times) goes northwest, to the densely populated Ozerki neighbourhood and meets Severniy Prospekt (Northern Avenue) and Prospekt Engelsa (Friedrich Engels Avenue) at the highest point of the city's north - Poklonnaya gora (Russian for Bowing Mountain), a 30-meter-tall hill. To the west of the square goes Vtoroy Murinskiy Prospekt (Rus. for 2nd Murino Avenue, Murino being a now redeveloping village at the northeast boundary of the city, with several lanes and streets named after it in the vicinity on the way to the settlement). The avenue also reaches at its western end Prospekt Engelsa, at Svetlana Square, from which another major road goes westwards into the residential areas of the former Commandant's Airfield (Komendantskiy aerodrom) and of the Long Lake (Ozero Dolgoye). =Design and architecture= See also * List of squares in Saint Petersburg Further reading *–®—Ä–µ—Ç–µ—Ä –õ. –õ. –ü–ª–æ—â–∞–¥—å –ú—É–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞, –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç –ù–µ–ø–æ–∫–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö // –°—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞ (–°–∏–ê–õ). 1971. ‚Ññ 6. –°. 2-7; *–ö—É—á–µ—Ä—è–≤–µ–Ω–∫–æ –ê. –ú. –î–æ–º–∞ –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∏ –ú—É–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ // –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–∞–Ω–æ—Ä–∞–º–∞. 1982. ‚Ññ 8. –°. 19-21; *–õ–∏—Å–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –í. –ì. –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥: –†–∞–π–æ–Ω—ã –Ω–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–∫. –õ., 1983.

Her quilts have been shown in China, France, Washington, D.C., New Orleans, and in other locations in the United States. A solo show of 75 of her quilts were shown at the Le Mus√©e de Free People of Color in New Orleans (2013‚Äì2014). Career Pedescleaux's interest in textile arts began as a child when she began to crochet and knit. In the late 1960s, she began creating quilts based upon traditional designs. As she read design and other books about American slaves, her designs became Afro-centric. She has created quilts based upon African art, like the bright, beaded quilt with the Ashanti Adinkra symbol Gye Nyame, meaning \\"accept God\\", from Ghana that was shown at the Inspiration Exhibition curated by Don Marshall and Sara Hollis at the Contemporary Arts Center. The book, Hidden in Plain View, by Jacqueline Tobin and Raymond G. Dobard, Jr., a Howard University professor, tells of how quilts were used to document secret messages and routes used by slaves to navigate the Underground Railroad. This book served as an inspiration to Pedescleaux, who researched African-American quilters and quilt designs related to the Underground Railroad and reproduced many of the designs. She has been inspired by the work of Mary McLeod Bethune and the books of David C. Driscoll, Carolyn L. Mazloomi, Faith Ringgold, Cuesta Benberry, Roland Freeman, Gladys-Marie Fry, and Maude Wahlham. Pedescleaux has also been inspired by the multicultural city of New Orleans with people of African, Caribbean, Hispanic, European, and Native American heritage. She says that her quilts are \\"made up of 75 percent research, 15 percent cloth, and 10 percent heart\\". She has created traditional and art quilts, using thread painting, beading, trapunto, patchwork, wax batik, photo transfer, cloth collage, three-dimensional cloth flowers and figures, and traditional African American quilting techniques such as strip quilting. About her work, she said, She lectured, demonstrated, and taught quilting throughout the United States and established a quilting group at Beecher Memorial United Church of Christ in New Orleans that made more than 100 quilts for Child Welfare agencies in 2013. A quilt that she made of the revolt on La Amistad is held at the Amistad Research Center. Nine of her quilts were shown in \\"A Patchwork of Cultures: Traveling Exhibit from Louisiana to France,\\" an exhibition sponsored by the French Patchwork Association at the U.S. Embassy in Paris in 2008 to 2009. The DAR Museum in Washington, D.C. exhibited the quilts in 2010 at the \\"Honoring Lafayette Contemporary Quilts from France and America\\" exhibition. Her work was included in \\"The Sum of Many Parts: 25 Quilt makers in 21st Century America\\" held in Beijing at the U.S. Embassy (2012‚Äì2013) and later at the State Historical Museum of Iowa (2013‚Äì2014). A one-person show, \\"Why I Believe: An African- American Perspective of Quilting\\" of 75 of her quilts were shown at the Le Mus√©e de Free People of Color (2013‚Äì2014). Jewels of Faith, representing \\"the complexity and simplicity of the people of the world, and their faith\\", was shown at \\"Imago Mundi‚ÄîReparation: Contemporary Artists from New Orleans\\" exhibition (2014‚Äì2015) at the New Orleans Museum of Art. Drawings made by children at the Reliance Center in Houston, Texas were used in Katrina Kids Quilt, which was displayed at The New York Arts Club in New York City. Her work has been shown at galleries and museums, including Ogden Museum of Southern Art, New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA), New Orleans African American Museum, Ashe Cultural Arts Center, Jazz & Heritage Foundation Gallery, Contemporary Arts Center, and Stella Jones Gallery. Her work has also been shown at Southern University, Tulane University, Southeastern University, and Xavier University.

The head house formally known as the Recreation Pier or Rec Pier stood vacant for more than 15 years. The brick Beaux Arts building originally stored port cargo. History Sagamore Pendry Baltimore is located within the 1700 Block of Thames Street, it opened on August 20, 1914; built by the city at a cost of over $1 million($24 million USD today) as a commercial pier by Theodore Wells Pietsch I. The Recreation Pier as it was known served as a landing point for thousands of new immigrants processed across the Patapsco river at the Locust Point immigration station. The ferry continued to serve as an important social and economic link between the Fells Point and Locust Point communities until it finally closed down in 1937. Over the years the premises served a number of roles such as a meeting place for early 20th century Baltimore immigrants with a rooftop playground space for children, to a maritime radio station headquartered within the pier. It was even used as a parking garage. In fiction From 1993-1999, the pier had been occupied as the police headquarters for the television series, Homicide: Life on the Street. More recently it was the set of the fictional Maryland School for the arts in the films Step Up and Step Up 2: the Streets. Restoration/Reuse Over the years, many developers have tried to transform the 100-year-old pier. Previous developers struggled to find financing for the project because the pier needed so much work. A major piece of the pier's restoration involved replacing the pilings that are driven underwater and into the Baltimore harbor bed, an expensive undertaking. The restoration of the pier clocked in 200,000 worker-hours, $250,000 worth of asbestos and $300,000 worth of lead paint removal alone. Developers also had to comply with preservation rules, and address potential flood risks. Night view of the historic building.

Established in 1908, it is one of the largest cemeteries in Cuyahoga County. A mausoleum was completed in 1926, and an expansion finished in 1959. The cemetery's mausoleum, the largest in the state, boasts a number of windows by Tiffany & Co. Creating the cemetery Knollwood Cemetery was incorporated on September 9, 1908, by C.F. Heinig, Francis P. Newcome, and H.L. Ebbert. A five-member board of directors was established, and Benjamin Ottman elected its first president. A few weeks after its incorporation, the cemetery purchased of land from the Pennington-Quilling Co. for $40,000 ($ in dollars). The land had previously been the farm of Robert Lowe. In June 1909, the cemetery purchased another of land for $100 ($ in dollars) from James Watters, and of land from J.W. Thorman for $100. Another were acquired from other sources. Ground was broken on the new cemetery on June 26, 1909. Paul Heinze, an architect from Detroit, Michigan, who had designed several cemeteries in the Midwestern United States, laid out Knollwood as a \\"park\\" cemetery. Twenty work crews began preparing burial vaults, grading roads, and landscaping of the site in preparation for a July 15 dedication. Work included the creation of a man-made lake. The cemetery's roads were paved with macadam, while the county began work on grading and laying asphalt on Mayfield Road to upgrade it in time for the burial ground's opening. Other work at the site included the emplacement of stormwater sewers about belowground, and the construction of a front entrance consisting of wrought iron gates supported by several granite pillars. A.T. Russell sold of land to Knollwood in September 1909. The first interments at Knollwood were about 300 bodies removed from the old Erie Street Cemetery in downtown Cleveland. Hiram Brott became the first contemporary person to be interred at Knollwood when he was buried there on April 27, 1910. Interments were relatively few in number until 1912. Demand for burial space was strong enough that by 1916 of the cemetery had been cleared, landscaped, and plots laid out. Fully of this acreage was near the entrance of the cemetery, and consisted of a park-like garden cemetery. The remaining were more like a lawn cemetery. Another of the property had been cleared of underbrush and sodded, while remained heavily forested. The cemetery association also sold about of land, and spent $25,000 ($ in dollars) constructing a caretaker's residence (which included a small chapel) and maintenance buildings. By the mid 1920s, Knollwood Cemetery was effectively a large land-holding company. In 1925, Knollwood sought to become a nonprofit organization. Under Ohio law, this meant the cemetery had to divest itself of most of its investments, which meant selling off land. This included the sale of of land to the new Acacia Park Cemetery, adjacent to Knollwood.; By the end of 1927, Knollwood Cemetery held more than 2,300 remains. =Mausoleum= Knollwood Cemetery mausoleum. In 1923, Knollwood Cemetery announced it had hired noted funerary architect Sidney Lovell to design a large, above-ground mausoleum for the cemetery. Plans called for the structure to be a mixture of Gothic Revival and Egyptian Revival, and for it to include two chapels and about 50 \\"private rooms\\" off the main corridor. It was completed about 1926. To decorate the mausoleum, the cemetery commissioned a number of large stained glass windows from Tiffany & Co., most of which were vaguely secular in nature. Other Tiffany windows were commissioned by individuals who owned crypts in the mausoleum. All of the windows were finished in the late 1920s and early 1930s, toward the end of Louis Comfort Tiffany life, making it unclear how much work Tiffany himself put into their design. As of 2006, there were 17 windows in the mausoleum attributed to Tiffany. In 1928, Knollwood Cemetery officials determined the mausoleum should be expanded. Hubbell & Benes, a Cleveland architectural firm, designed the addition, which was constructed by the Craig-Curtiss Co. The $175,000 ($ in dollars) addition was finished in December 1928. Seven more additions were made between 1930 and 1959. A addition was added in 1997. Operational history Section 27 at Knollwood Cemetery In 1930, the Memorial Construction Company of Lansing, Michigan, purchased Knollwood Cemetery. Knollwood Cemetery was sold to Gibraltar Mausoleum Corp. in 1994, and in June 1995 Gibraltar was purchased by Service Corporation International. Knollwood was sued over the mishandling of remains in 1983. In 1929, Katherine G. Mallison was buried in a family plot at Knollwood. Her granddaughter, Dorothy Mallison Carney, died in 1982. While digging the Carney grave, cemetery workers discovered that it was already occupied by a wooden burial vault containing Mallison's coffin. Cemetery workers used a backhoe to remove Mallison's burial vault and remains, which they dumped at a refuse site on the cemetery grounds. Carney's burial occurred a few hours later. In March 1983, a Cleveland television station broadcast news about the mishandling of remains at the cemetery. After an investigation revealed the remains were Mallinson's, Carney's children sued the cemetery and were awarded $56,000. Knollwood Cemetery appealed, but the Ohio Eighth District Courts of Appeals upheld the verdict in 1986. In 1988, Knollwood Cemetery workers buried Ruth Pistillo in the wrong grave. The family discovered the error only when no headstone was placed on the grave Pistillo had purchased. Even after the error was discovered, Knollwood remained unsure as to who was buried in the wrong grave. Pistillo had to be disinterred and one of her family members had to identify the body. Her heirs received $101,000 in damages. In 2002, Knollwood Cemetery sought permission from the city of Mayfield Heights to permit the drilling and operation of a natural gas well on its property by Bass Energy. Knollwood said the proposed wells would be in an area about from any graves, an area which would not be used for burials for at least 25 to 30 years. Knollwood said the wells would provide it with free natural gas for heating of its mausoleum and other buildings, and would give the cemetery much-needed revenue of about $50,000 a year for 10 years to help meet its $350,000-a-year operating costs. The city denied the permit. The conflict led to the introduction of legislation in the Ohio Legislature to strip localities and counties of their authority to regulate oil and gas wells. This law passed in September 2004. Subsequently, three natural gas wells were drilled and began operation on the Knollwood property. The new law was challenged in court. As the lawsuit progressed, a Court of Common Pleas allowed production to continue at existing wells at the Knollwood Cemetery. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the new state law in February 2015. In 2008, the Vitale family sued Knollwood cemetery for placing a natural gas well too close to their mausoleum on the cemetery's grounds. The family also accused Knollwood (which had erected the mausoleum) of constructing such a poorly-built structure that family members had to be disinterred and the mausoleum rebuilt. The case was dismissed with prejudice in May 2010. Knollwood Cemetery had about 47,000 burials in 2007, and between and in 2008. Its mausoleum remained the largest in the state as of 2012.

It is bound on the southern and western sides by the Damara Belt in Northern Namibia and by the Cubango River to the East. The northern boundary is scientifically disputed, but is currently mapped by most stratigraphers to include southern Angola with the boundary set at the Kunene River. The Owambo Basin is host to two famous regions: Tsumeb, a major Namibian city and site of a formerly active copper mine with exceptional mineralogical variability producing museum quality rare specimens, and Etosha National Park, the largest protected wildlife sanctuary in Namibia centered around Etosha Pan.

Since its original formation, the Congo Craton has undergone a series of collisional and rifting events including: * 2.1 Ga - Collision into minor supercontinent Atlantica * 1.8 Ga - Collision into supercontinent Columbia * 1.3 Ga - Rifting apart and formation of an independent continent with the Sao Francisco Craton * 1.1 Ga - Collision and incorporation into supercontinent RodiniaDe Waele, B., S. P. Johnson, and S. A. Pisarevsky. \\"Palaeoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic growth and evolution of the eastern Congo Craton: its role in the Rodinia puzzle.\\" Precambrian Research 160.1 (2008): 127-141. = Creation of the Owambo Basin = The breakup of Rodinia (Late Precambrian) is the origin of the original depositional series of the Owambo Basin. The rifting apart of the Congo Craton from the Rodinean shallow sea created a classic pull-apart basin. Pull-apart basins are characterized by faults that create an area of crustal extension, causing uplift at the edges and a sinking of the center, which is infilled by sediment or, in this case, a shallow sea (See Image 3). The deposition of the Nosib Formation (900-750 Ma) is the original deposition from the mass wasting of the newly uplifted edges of the Congo Craton, followed by the Otavi Formation (750-650 Ma), composed of dolomite and limestone from the formation of the shallow sea. = Formation of Gondwana = The pull-apart basin was then compressed when the Congo Craton was forced back together in the formation of the Gondwana supercontinent. This caused extensive uplift of the Owambo Basin edges and deepening of the basin's center(see Image 4), resulting in a massive erosional event that formed the Mulden Group (600-560 Ma). These three groups (Nosib, Otavi, and Mulden) compose the sedimentary package known as the Damara Supergroup. = Glaciation = The Damara Supergroup has a relatively abrupt end when Gondwana shifts under the South Pole. The entirety of the Congo Craton is overlain by large glaciers from 420 Ma until around 280 Ma, when the continent shifted far enough away from the South Pole to allow deglaciation. As the glaciers melted, deep valleys are carved into the sedimentary Mulden group depositing glacial till along their path. This glacial till is included in the sedimentary package known as the Karoo Group (280-130 Ma). The valleys are filled with water from the melted glaciers and the Owambo Basin is again a shallow marine system with heavy carbonate and organic deposition. = Breakup of Gondwana = Idealized image showing the breakup of Gondwana as South America rifted away from Africa The breakup of Gondwana began in the early Cretaceous (about 184-132 Ma). South America began to drift westward from Africa as the South Atlantic Ocean opened, resulting in complete open marine conditions by 110 Ma. During this, the Owambo Basin was reactivated as a pull-apart rift basin pulling apart from the east to the west, but received compression from the opening of the Damara Belt to its south. This created rotational seismic wrench systems across the basin profile. These wrench systems allowed for intrusions of continental igneous deposits: sills and dikes, along with pegmatites from metasomatized country rock. This intrusion of igneous material and hydrothermal activity led to heavy mineral depositions like the copper ore from the Tsumeb mine. = Desertification = In the mid-Cretaceous, Africa shifted to closer to the equator with the Owambo Basin landing at near 30¬∞ South latitude (very close to its current location), causing rapid desertification. This is represented in the stratigraphic sequence by a large depositional sequence that continues through the Quaternary. Beginning in the mid-Cretaceous, deposition of sandstones occur. These are labeled as the Kalahari Sequence, so named after the sand origin, the Kalahari Desert.  Stratigraphy  = Neoproterozoic = The earliest formation in the known stratigraphic history of the Owambo Basin comprises what is geologically termed the basement and is compositionally zoned with mostly granite and gneiss. There is a metamorphic overprint on the majority of the granite from the tectonic history of rifting and compression, causing mass devolitilization of the basement rock. This section is overlain by a layer of volcanics, a likely accompaniment to the compression involved in the formation of Rodinia. = Damara Supergroup =  Nosib Group  The Nosib Group is charactererized by interbedded marine and continental sediment capped by volcanics. In the USGS stratigraphic column this is associated with the uplift of the Katangan orogeny 880 Ma, created during the series of rifting and compression of the Congo and Kalahari Cratons during the formation of the Gondwana supercontinent. The Owambo Basin is thought to originate at this time as a pull-apart basin filled with sediment from the surrounding uplifted areas, and eventually as a shallow marine system.  Otavi Group  The Otavi Group is composed entirely of shallow marine deposits. During this time period, the Owambo Basin was part of a shallow marine system that resulted in deposition of carbonates and organics, resulting in a layer of limestone and dolomite with interdispersed oolitic shoals.  Mulden Group  The Mulden Group was deposited after a major unconformity created by the uplift from the Kaoko Belt and Damara Belt collisions (580-530 Ma). During this time, the Owambo Basin was drained and exposed at the surface, causing massive erosion with minimal deposition. After 530 Ma, the rebound from the uplift of the Damara orogeny had caused the Owambo Basin to sink and it again filled with water to create a shallow marine system with deposition from both continental and marine organic sources. The stages between when the Owambo Basin was a transgressive vs regressive deposition system are bounded by a black shale marker that runs through the \\"middle\\" of the Mulden Group.  Mining  Tsumeb mining operation Though the center of the Owambo Basin is a wildlife preservation area, the surrounding uplifted areas are rich in mineral and ore deposits. In terms of revenue mining is the largest contributor to Namibia's economy, accounting for over 25% of the country's income. The majority of this revenue is centered around diamond mining, however, Namibia is also a large producer of copper, lead, zinc, cement, and uranium. Due to the highly volatile nature of Angola's political system, its resources have been vastly untapped by the boom of the twenty-first century. In 2007, Angola was the third largest producer of diamonds in Africa with only 40% of the potential territory explored. It is also known as a major exporter of iron ore, with potential to market several other mineral resources including manganese, copper, gold, phosphates, marble, uranium, tin, fluorite, feldspar, gypsum, and talc.

The hospital buildings occupied sites within the boundary of Ouseley Road, Sarsfield Road and St James's Drive (previously named St James's Road) Balham London SW12.  Early history as a workhouse  Rapid London population growth in the early 1890s had resulted in increased demand for poor relief, so the Wandsworth Union purchased the site of the St James's Road Industrial School for ¬£21,000 from the Westminster Union. The School had been built around 1851 to house juvenile offenders. The existing buildings were converted and became known as the St James's Road branch of the Garratt Lane workhouse.  St James‚Äô Infirmary  In 1909 the Wandsworth Board of Guardians built St James' Infirmary in Sarsfeld Road, on what had once been the workhouse gardens. It was officially opened in November 1910 by the Rt Hon John Burns (1858-1943), President of the Local Government Board, with the main ceremony taking place in an unfurnished ward. The buildings had cost ¬£66,550 and could accommodate 606 patients. The central 2-storey administration block had a long corridor either side, linking it to the 3-storey ward blocks to the south (for men) and the north (for women). The old workhouse buildings which fronted onto St James's Road were also taken over by the Infirmary.  First World War  During 1914-18 the Infirmary became an auxiliary military hospital to the First London (T.F.) General Hospital. Established in August 1914 at St Gabriel's College in Cormont Road, a large modern building built in 1900, overlooking Myatt's Fields, a municipal park. St James‚Äô allocated 68 of its beds to wounded or sick servicemen. There were four other auxiliary hospitals established at St Mark's College, Chelsea, Royal Victoria Patriotic School, Wandsworth, King's College Hospital, Denmark Hill and St Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth.  Re-named St James‚Äô Hospital  In 1922 its name was changed to St James' Hospital. By this time, it had 670 beds. In 1923 staff accommodation was improved with a new Nurses' Home that could accommodate 155 members of staff. In 1926 another block for the Nurses' Home was built at the southern part of the site. In 1930 the LCC London County Council took control and it became a general hospital with 746 beds. Between 1931 and 1936 the Hospital was greatly expanded; two new blocks containing six extra wards were added, giving a total of 898 beds. In 1935 new X-ray and Physiotherapy Departments were built and, in 1936, a further extension to the Nurses' Home provided lecture rooms for the Nurses Training School as well as accommodation for 44 nurses.  Second World War  During the Second World War the Hospital suffered superficial damage from incendiary bombs - on one occasion over 200 fell on the site. In 1944 a flying bomb damaged three wards, the boiler house and laundry. A second flying bomb not long afterwards fell outside the gates and damaged the opposite side of the Hospital.  Transferred to the NHS  In July 1948 the hospital became part of the National Health Service, within the administration of the South West Regional Hospital Board and Wandsworth Hospital Management Committee, with 610 beds, part of the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. By December 1948, the Hospital had increased to 628 beds. In 1949 land had been acquired at the junction of St James's Drive (previously named St James's Road) and Sarsfield Road, and a new entrance for the Hospital had been made on St James's Drive. By the end of the same year it had 637 beds and, by the end of 1950, 642 beds. In October 1951 it was decided to replace the workhouse buildings on St James's Drive with a new central complex containing an Out-Patients Department, Accident & Emergency and Admissions Departments on the west side (with kitchens and dining rooms above), X-ray and Physiotherapy Departments at the north, and a Nurses' Home at the south. The Hospital had not been originally designed for the treatment of out-patients, this department had been housed in a small obsolete building. In 1952, the foundation stone for the new main building was laid by Frank H. Elliott, the Chairman of the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. Building works began, but little steel was available in the post-war years and the building had to be redesigned to reduce the amount of steel used. While this work was carried out, it was necessary to transfer some patients to the Grove Hospital and St Benedict's Hospital. Following the rebuilding, the Hospital had 1082 beds. In 1974, following a major reorganisation of the NHS, it came under the control of the Wandsworth and East Merton District Health Authority, part of the South West Thames Regional Health Authority. In 1980, the hospital services were transferred to Saint George's Hospital, Tooting. It finally closed in 1988 when the new St James Wing opened at the Tooting site. The hospital buildings were demolished in 1992. The site has been redeveloped for housing.  Location for fictional St Angela's Hospital  Between 1975 and 1983 the outdoor scenes of the Angels television series were filmed in the hospital grounds. Angels is a British television seasonal drama series dealing with the subject of student nurses. The show's format switched to a twice-weekly soap opera format (although still seasonal) from 1979 to 1983. References  Further reading  * (Author unstated) 1908 Medical News.

The \\"lovers\\", the poet and his companion, were created by Peynet in 1942, in Valence, inspired by a music kiosk known since then as the Peynet kiosk. They would have inspired the song Les amoureux des bancs publics by Georges Brassens although this hypothesis is controversial. In the 1960s and 1970s, Murat jewels produced many medals, tiepins and cuff-links, and more rarely watches, in gold or silver, bearing the effigy of Peynet's lovers. These jewels are now collected.

It is part of the Amazon biome. The ecoregion extends southwest from the Amazon River between its large Madeira and Tapaj√≥s tributaries, and crosses the border into Bolivia. In the south it transitions into the cerrado biome of Mato Grosso. In the state of Rond√¥nia it contains some of the most degraded land of the Amazon basin. Location The Madeira-Tapaj√≥s moist forests cover an area of . They stretch in a southwest direction through Brazil from the Amazon into northeast Bolivia. The ecoregion covers parts of the states of Amazonas, Rond√¥nia and Mato Grosso in Brazil, and part of the Beni Department in Bolivia. The ecoregion covers the interfluvial region between the Madeira River to the west and the Tapaj√≥s rivers to the east, two large tributaries of the Amazon to the north. Above the sources of the Tapaj√≥s the ecoregion extends south to the Guapor√© River basin. The large rivers prevent the spread of flora and fauna. Thus the white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons) and hairy saki (Pithecia hirsuta) are found west of the Tapaj√≥s, while the white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus) is only found east of the river. In the south the bounds of the ecoregion are defined by distinct changes in vegetation, with the transition to Mato Grosso tropical dry forests in the southeast and to the Beni savanna and later the Chiquitano dry forests in the southeast. To the northwest the ecoregion is separated from the Purus- Madeira moist forests by the Madeira River, which has Monte Alegre v√°rzea along much of its length. The v√°rzea extends along the Amazon River on the north of the ecoregion. To the east it is separated by the Tapaj√≥s river from the Tapaj√≥s-Xingu moist forests ecoregion. Further south along its southeast boundary it adjoins the Mato Grosso seasonal forests, Cerrado and Chiquitano dry forests ecoregions. In the southwest it adjoins the Southwest Amazon moist forests and Beni savanna ecoregions. Physical Most of the ecoregion is below in elevation. At its northern boundary on the Amazon river the elevation is above sea level. The ecoregion south of the river covers part of the low, flat Amazon basin, and rises gradually to the south and east to uplifted parts of the old Brazilian Shield. The southern part of the ecoregion contains the mountainous Parecis plateau (Chapada dos Parecis). The land rises to at the tallest peak of the Parecis plateau. The terrain here consists of table mountains with rocky meadows and semi-deciduous open submontane forest and woodland savanna. The Madeira River is a sediment-rich whitewater river. The clearwater Tapaj√≥s, which rises in the ancient and well-weathered Brazilian Shield and follows a fixed course, does not carry sediment. Other large rivers in the region are the Mau√©s A√ßu, Aripuan√£ and Canum√£. The Parecis plateau's main rivers are the Ji-Paran√°, Juruena, Papagaio, do Sangue and Guapor√©. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Am\\" equatorial, monsoonal. Annual rainfall is in most of the region, with less than along the north and south boundaries. Along the middle Madeira rainfall increases to . In the center of the region temperatures are relatively constant year round. They range from and average . In the humid lowland areas temperatures average , while in the mountains they average . =Flora= House in the Juruena National Park Vegetation includes dense lowland rainforest, dense submontane rainforest, open submontane rainforest and woodland savanna. There is seasonally flooded v√°rzea forest in the Monte Alegre V√°rzea ecoregion along Madeira. There is white sand flooded igap√≥ forest along the clearwater Tapaj√≥s and Aripuan√£ rivers, with large trees such as Triplaris surinamensis, Piranhea trifoliata, Copaifera martii and Alchornea castaneifolia. The flooded forest is somewhat more open than the surrounding terra firme forest. On the upper Madeira and Tapaj√≥s there are large areas of campina, white sand grasslands. The canopy in the dense lowland rainforest is around high, with emergent trees reaching . Common trees include the legumes Eperua oleifera, Eperua campestris, Palovea brasiliensis, Elizabetha paraensis, Elizabetha bicolor, Elizabetha durissima and Coumarouna speciosa, as well as trees from other families such as Lophanthera lactescens, Polygala scleroxylon, Joannesia heveoides, Manilkara excelsa and Duckeodendron cestroides. At one time the endemic tree Polygonanthus amazonicus grew near Mau√©s, the western limit for the emergent Dinizia excelsa and the eastern limit for the Theobroma cacao. The Tapaj√≥s basin is the eastern limit of Theobroma microcarpum. The Physocalymma scaberrima has red hardwood used by furniture makers. The montane forests of the upper Marmelos and middle Tapaj√≥s hold Hevea camporum, Euterpe longibracteata, Huberodendron ingens and Brachynema ramiflorum. Further south in Mato Grosso there are forests in the transition between the Amazon and cerrado biomes. =Fauna= white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus) 183 species of mammals have been reported, including 90 bat species and many primates. The ecoregion is the eastern limit of the brown woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagotricha). The Santarem marmoset (Mico humeralifer) is endemic to the north of the ecoregion. Roosmalens' dwarf marmoset (Callibella humilis) lives along the east bank of the Madeira and the western bank of the lower Aripuana. The bare-eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus) and red-bellied titi (Callicebus moloch) are found only in the south- central Amazon. Other mammals include white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), cougar (Puma concolor), jaguar (Panthera onca), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris) and brocket deer (Mazama genus). Endangered mammals include the white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). 621 species of birds have been reported. These include several tinamous (Crypturellus and Tinamus genera), six macaws (Ara genus), many parakeets (Aratinga, Pyrrhura and Brotogeris genera), parrots (Amazona and Pionus genera) and hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin). Endangered birds include the green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus). The rivers are home to black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), yellow-spotted river turtle (Podocnemis unifilis), Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) and tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis). Snakes include fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), palm pit-vipers (Bothriechis genus), coral snakes (Micrurus genus), bushmasters (Lachesis muta) and boa constrictor (Boa constrictor). The neotropical rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus) is found in the dry uplands. Status The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as Vulnerable. The main threats come from deforestation and colonization along the main rivers and the highways. During the period from 2004 to 2011 the ecoregion experienced an annual rate of habitat loss of 0.61%. Part of the ecoregion in central Rond√¥nia is one of the most degraded areas of the central Amazon basin, with the forests cut down and the land degraded. This is worst along the BR-364 highway from Cuiab√° to Porto Velho and the BR-319 from there to Humait√° and also occurs along the BR-230 Trans-Amazonian Highway from Humait√° to the middle Tapaj√≥s. The banks of the Tapaj√≥s and Madeira have large areas that are scarred by large-scale illegal mining. Conservation units such as the Amaz√¥nia National Park and Paca√°s Novos National Park are underfunded and poorly protected.

This reaction can be conducted iteratively, shortening one carbon at a time to generate sugars with smaller chain lengths. Fig 2: Glucose chain shortening: Ruff degradation. Glucose chain lengthening Glucose can be the substrate in Kiliani‚ÄìFischer synthesis that adds a carbon to the aldehyde group and forms sugars with one more carbon than the substrate. The first step is nucleophilic addition of aqueous cyanide to aldehyde group in glucose to generate the cyanohydrin. Then cyanohydrin is hydrolyzed to form aldonic acid lactone upon heating. Finally, the aldonic acid lactone is reduced with sodium amalgam non-stereoselectively to produce heptose; two isomers with both stereoisomers at C2 are generated.

The eponymous character of the song \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and its parent album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), Ziggy Stardust was retained for Bowie's subsequent concert tour through the United Kingdom, Japan and North America, during which Bowie performed as the character backed by his band The Spiders from Mars. Bowie continued the character in his next album Aladdin Sane (1973), which he described as \\"Ziggy goes to America\\". Bowie retired the character on 3 July 1973 at a concert at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, which was filmed and released on the documentary Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. As conveyed in the titular song and album, Ziggy Stardust is an androgynous, bisexual alien rock star who is sent to Earth to deliver a message of hope before an impending apocalyptic disaster. After accumulating a large following of fans and being worshipped as a messiah, Ziggy eventually dies as a victim of his own fame and excess. The character was meant to symbolise an over-the-top, sexually liberated rock star as a comment of the society in which celebrities are worshipped. Influences for the character were English singer Vince Taylor, Texan musician the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, Japanese kabuki theatre, and Japanese fashion designer Kansai Yamamoto, who designed many of Bowie's costumes as Ziggy Stardust. Ziggy Stardust's exuberant fashion made the character and Bowie himself staples in the glam rock repertoire well into the 1970s, defining what the genre would become. The success of the character and its iconic look flung Bowie into international superstardom. Ziggy Stardust's look and message of youth liberation are now representative of one of Bowie‚Äôs most memorable eras. The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars became Bowie‚Äôs second most popular album in terms of record sales. Appearance thumbOne of the costumes designed by Kansai Yamamoto for Ziggy Stardust. =Hair= As Ziggy Stardust, Bowie had a bright red mullet. The hairstyle was inspired by that of a model for Japanese designer Kansai Yamamoto that Bowie had seen in Honey magazine, and modelled on three different images from Vogue ‚Äî a French issue inspired the front of the haircut, while the sides and back came from two different German copies. Bowie's mullet was cut and dyed, using peroxide and German hair dye to achieve the orange-red colour, by hairdresser Suzi Fussey, who accompanied the Ziggy Stardust tour until 1973. The haircut achieved widespread mainstream success in popular fashion, as Bowie himself stated in 1993, \\"[The Ziggy cut] became to hairdressing in the early seventies, what the Lady Di cut was for the early eighties. Only with double the appeal, because it worked for both sexes.\\" =Clothing= Long and slender, Ziggy was dressed in glamorous outfits often with flared legs and shoulders, and an open chest. On the cover of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, Bowie appeared a green suit of his own design, made by his tailor friend Freddie Burretti and local seamstress Sue Frost. Produced in a geometric- patterned fabric, the bomber jacket and matching cuffed trousers were worn with knee-high, lace-up boots designed by Stan Miller. Similar outfits were made for Bowie's backing band The Spiders From Mars; these costumes worn in early live performances were based on those sported by the Droogs in Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange. Bowie explained, \\"I wanted to take the hardness and violence of those Clockwork Orange outfits ‚Äî the trousers tucked into big boots and the codpiece things ‚Äî and soften them up by using the most ridiculous fabrics. It was a Dada thing ‚Äî this extreme ultraviolence in Liberty fabrics.\\" In addition to his green suit, Bowie's costumes for early concerts were white satin trousers with a flock-patterned jacket, and a multi- coloured jumpsuit that he also wore on Top of the Pops. By August 1972, Bowie was introducing Kansai Yamamoto's designs as stage wear for the Ziggy character. In total, seven costumes were designed for Ziggy Stardust by Yamamoto, some of which Yamamoto had originally designed for women, in the kabuki tradition. The collection Yamamoto provided Bowie in April 1973 included a white robe with \\"David Bowie\\" written in Japanese, a silver leotard hung with a floor-length fringe of glass beads, a striped spandex bodystocking, and a multi-coloured kimono that could be torn away to reveal a red loincloth. =Makeup= An example of traditional Japanese kabuki makeup. The character had pale skin, described by Bowie as a ‚Äúsnow-white tan‚Äù.Ziggy Stardust (1972), song lyrics. Retrieved from Following the instruction Yamamoto gave to his models, Bowie shaved off his eyebrows in late 1972, adding to Ziggy's alien visage. On Ziggy's forehead was a gold \\"astral sphere\\" suggested by make-up artist Pierre La Roche (who also applied the lightning flash to Bowie's face for the cover of Aladdin Sane). When the Ziggy Stardust tour came to Japan in April 1973, Bowie met the kabuki theatre star Bando Tamasaburo, who taught him about traditional Japanese makeup techniques. In a 1973 Mirabelle magazine article, La Roche explained that Bowie bought most of his make-up from a shop in Rome but acquired his \\"white rice powder\\" from \\"Tokyo's Woolworth's equivalent\\". Bowie used a \\"German gold base in cake form\\" for the sphere, and would occasionally \\"outline that gold circle with tiny gold rhinestones, stuck on with eyelash glue\\". By the end of the Ziggy Stardust period in 1973, Bowie would spend at least two hours before each concert to have his makeup done. According to La Roche, for his last few English concerts, Bowie painted tiny lightning streaks on his cheek and upper leg.Archived from Origins The character was inspired by English rock 'n' roll singer Vince Taylor, whom Bowie met after Taylor had a breakdown and believed himself to be a cross between a god and an alien, though Taylor was only part of the character's blueprint. In the 1960s Bowie had seen Taylor performing live wearing a leg-brace after a car accident, and observed: ‚ÄúIt meant that to crouch at the mike, as was his habit, [Taylor] had to shove his injured leg out behind him to, what I thought, great theatrical effect. This rock stance became position number one for the embryonic Ziggy.‚Äù Bowie's lyrical allusions to Taylor include identifying Ziggy as a \\"leper messiah\\". Bowie biographers also propose that Bowie developed the concept of Ziggy as a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed during a visit to the US in 1971. A girlfriend recalled his \\"scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy\\", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character \\"who looks like he's landed from Mars\\". Bowie later asserted that Ziggy Stardust was born out of a desire to move away from the denim and hippies of the 1960s. Along these lines, some critics assert that Bowie's artificial concoction of a rock star persona was a symbolic critique of the artificiality seen in the rock world of the time. Bowie had previously created artificial stage personas in 1970 with his backing band Hype. Over a small series of shows which, while poorly received at the time, are now credited as the origin of glam rock, the band performed in flamboyant costumes, each with an accompanying persona of a spoof superhero. Bowie, dressed in a blue cape, lurex tights, thigh boots and a leotard with colourful scarves sewn onto his shirt, was \\"Rainbowman\\". Describing his costume as \\"very spacey\\", he later explained that his idea for the outfits was to counter the popular image of rock acts at the time, which was \\"all jeans and long hair\\". The concept behind Rainbowman was recycled and reinvented as Ziggy Stardust. =Name= Bowie's friend and collaborator Iggy Pop in concert in 1973. Bowie told Rolling Stone that the name \\"Ziggy\\" was \\"one of the few Christian names [he] could find beginning with the letter 'Z'\\". He later explained in a 1990 interview for Q magazine that the Ziggy part came from a tailor's shop called Ziggy's that he passed on a train, and he liked it because it had \\"that Iggy [Pop] connotation but it was a tailor's shop, and I thought, Well, this whole thing is gonna be about clothes, so it was my own little joke calling him Ziggy. So Ziggy Stardust was a real compilation of things.\\" \\"Stardust\\" came from the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, the stage name of singer Norman Carl Odam, whose music intrigued Bowie. Fictional narrative Much of the Ziggy Stardust story was created by Bowie and told in the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, or appears in Bowie‚Äôs writings as plans for a never-realised theatrical performance of the narrative. The character of Ziggy Stardust is conceived to have been an androgynous, bisexual alien rock star from an unspecified planet, who was sent to earth to deliver the message that Earth had five years left, due to a lack of natural resources. Meanwhile, children around the world have become obsessed with rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll music, and came to look to the rock star Ziggy Stardust as a prophet.Archived from Ziggy gathered a large following, as adults are too preoccupied with the minutiae of their own lives to pay attention to their children. The children become obsessed with Ziggy‚Äôs hedonistic way of life. As the end nears, Stardust prophesises of the ‚ÄúStarman‚Äù waiting in the sky, who will come to save the earth. At the end of it all, Ziggy is torn apart on stage by black holes. This was reflective of Bowie‚Äôs paranoia that he would be killed on stage during a performance in real life, especially after his announcement that he was gay (a claim that he would later rescind). The character show‚Äôs Bowie‚Äôs paranoia, and the difficulties of living as a larger than life celebrity. The character was revisited by Bowie in his next album Aladdin Sane (1973), which topped the UK chart, and was his first number-one album. Described by Bowie as \\"Ziggy goes to America\\", it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the US during the earlier part of the Ziggy Stardust Tour. Cultural impact The character received success around the world. By the time Bowie returned to Britain for the final leg of the Ziggy Stardust tour in May 1973 following the release of Aladdin Sane, he had become the biggest English rock star since The Beatles almost a decade earlier, in terms of concert and record sales. Rolling Stone described Ziggy Stardust as the ultimate rock star: \\"He‚Äôs a wild, hedonistic figure ... but at his core communicates peace and love\\". The character influenced the glam rock genre and fashion wave. Bowie as Ziggy Stardust became one of the most iconic images of rock history. According to The Washington Post, \\"He was not only glam's principal architect, he was its most beautiful specimen.\\" Retirement By July 1973, Bowie had been touring as Ziggy for eighteen months. Due to the intense nature of his touring life, Bowie felt as though maintaining the Ziggy persona was affecting his own personality and sanity too much; acting the same role over an extended period, it became difficult for him to separate Ziggy Stardust from his own character offstage. Bowie was also beginning to reach a point of creative boredom and felt that he could no longer perform Ziggy with the same enthusiasm. There were also practical reasons behind his decision to retire the character: Bowie's record company RCA refused to finance a third large US tour due to Bowie's management overspending in excess of $300,000 during the 1972 and 1973 tours, as well as disappointing record sales in the US. Bowie retired Ziggy Stardust during a live concert on 3 July 1973, at London‚Äôs Hammersmith Odeon in front of 3,500 fans. The concert featured an 18-song set, with Jeff Beck joining the band for a medley of \\"The Jean Genie\\" and The Beatles' \\"Love Me Do\\". Just before the final song of the concert, \\"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\\", Bowie announced, ‚ÄúOf all the shows on this tour, this particular show will remain with us the longest, because not only is it the last show of the tour, but it's the last show that we'll ever do‚Äù. The fans and press took this to mean that Bowie was retiring entirely causing much media attention, however it only referred to the Ziggy Stardust persona, and the Spiders from Mars backing band. The final Ziggy concert was filmed by D. A. Pennebaker and released in 1979 as the documentary Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars and the audio on the live album Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture (released in 1983). Legacy The plaque on Heddon Street marking Bowie's album cover shoot. Ziggy Stardust is widely considered Bowie's greatest creation. In 2012, a plaque was unveiled by the Crown Estate at the site at which the iconic Ziggy Stardust album cover photograph was taken by Brian Ward on Heddon Street, London. The unveiling was attended by original Spiders from Mars band members Woody Woodmansey and Trevor Bolder, and was unveiled by Gary Kemp. The plaque was the first to be installed by the Crown Estate and is one of the few plaques in the country devoted to fictional characters. In 2015, the African butterfly species Bicyclus sigiussidorum was named after the character due to its \\"glammy\\" appearance. (Sigiussidorum is a Latin rendering of \\"Ziggy Stardust\\".)

The flag was adopted as the party's flag the following day. The flag is strongly influenced by the flag of the United States, along with a triangle evocative of Freemasonry, which had already been adopted during the unsuccessful 1789 separatist movement of Inconfid√™ncia Mineira.

It seems that the local government has started regulating the beginning of the Shah-e-era in relation to the traditional irrigation area, which has been constructed, operated and managed, based on its own source, skill and technology. State Government of India Beginning in 1922 (1979 B.S.), the construction started. Chandra Nahar Canal irrigation system completed in 1928 (1985 B.S.) is the first modern irrigation system built from the state. Apart from this, in 1950 (2007 B.S.), before the patronage of democracy, the Jamshed Canal (Manushmaara) in Saralahi district, Jagirdashpur dam in Kapilavastu and Pargi dam in Pokhara were started. Due to the lack of human power related to human rights, there should be a direct contribution to the state's limited contribution only due to the dependence on foreign manpower, and from the district structure rather than the different structure of the organization. The challenge to confirm the basis of justification, achievement and achievement of establishment of separate irrigation from the Ministry of Water is not going to cross the federal form, as it is preparing for conducting irrigation activities in the form of water sources. Last modified two years ago, in the 73 districts across the country, five regional irrigation directorates and irrigation management and underground water irrigation directorate besides the Department of Irrigation and irrigation.

He directs the NSF EPSCoR Attention Consortium.https://www.attentioninthebrain.com He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2014.  Early life and education  Tse, who has German and Chinese heritage, grew up in New York City. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1984, studying physics and mathematics. After graduating from Dartmouth, he worked for the Peace Corps as a school teacher in Nepal, studied philosophy of mind at the University of Konstanz, Germany, and worked for Kobe Steel Corporation in Japan. He began his studies at Harvard University in 1992, receiving his PhD in Cognitive Psychology under Patrick Cavanagh and Ken Nakayama in 1998. Tse served as a postdoctoral researcher with Nikos Logothetis at the Max Plank Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tuebingen, Germany. He joined Dartmouth's faculty in 2001.  Cognitive neuroscience  Peter Ulric Tse, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, Dartmouth College The focus of Tse's work in Cognitive Neuroscience is mid- and high-level human vision. In the domain of mid-level vision his group has worked on deciphering the rapid form-motion computations that go into the construction of subsequent conscious visual experience. His group focuses on visual illusions because they are mistakes made by the visual system that can inform us about the nature of processing that goes into the construction of conscious experience. In the field of high-level vision and attention, Tse's group has focused on two main directions: the influence of top-down volitional operations on visual experience, and the nature of volitional mental operations that go into the construction of internal virtual experience or imagination. In his work on the neural basis of the human imagination, he has emphasized the importance of volitional and non-volitional verb-like mental operations over noun-like representations, such as imagined visual objects. Using fMRI, his group has argued that representations and operations can be decoded by creating classifiers in one part of the brain, and applying them to different parts of the brain. This supports the idea that the brain might not be as modular as previously thought, and that certain types of brain processing may happen in a fundamentally distributed manner. In particular, the model of working memory operations that emerges suggests that traditional models of working memory, such as Baddely's, are too modular and hierarchical.  Philosophy of Neuroscience  In his 2013 book The Neural Basis of Free Will, Tse focused on the question of mental causation, in particular the proposition that mental events (and information in general, as in genetics) can be downwardly causal even though realized in, or supervenient upon, physical events. Exclusion Argument: He challenged the Exclusion Argument (EA) of Jaegwon Kim, according to which causal efficacy resides solely in the physical domain of the rootmost level of energy, by arguing that the EA does not hold if indeterminism is the case. This, he argues, provides an opening for information to be downwardly causal in the universe, whether high-level supervenient events such as conscious percepts or a concept, such as that of a ‚Äòhome-run‚Äô in a baseball game, or ‚Äòvoting‚Äô in a democracy. Information is downwardly causal, not as a force, he argues, but by filtering out possible paths that are open at the particle level which are not consistent with informational criteria. Under ‚Äòcriterial causation‚Äô (see below) only physically causal paths which are also informational causal paths are permitted to occur in the nervous system and other information processing systems, such as underlie genetic inheritance, protein formation, membrane channel formation, or social interactions such as speaking or institutional interactions. Possible physical particle-level paths which do not meet high-level informational criteria are effectively filtered out by a criterial assessment. Thus information is causal, not as a force, or via attributes such as impact or force, but is causal as a filter on what possibilities can become real. Criterial Causation: Tse gets around the impossibility of self-causation (i.e. of informational events altering their own physical basis) by positing what he has variously called ‚Äòparameter-,‚Äô ‚Äòpattern-,‚Äô ‚Äòphase-‚Äô or ‚Äòcriterial causation.‚Äô According to Tse, Science and Philosophy have overly focused on ‚Äòactive‚Äô modes of causation, such as Newtonian energy transfer among billiard balls. He points out that manipulationist and interventionist conceptions of causation, such as those of Woodward, have largely neglected the ‚Äòpassive‚Äô causal efficacy of manipulations of parameters for responses to subsequent inputs. For example, a neuron tuned to ‚Äòdog‚Äô at one moment can be reparameterized to respond optimally to ‚Äòcat‚Äô in subsequent input by altering the chains of synaptic weights that feed driving input into that neuron. The neural code: Tse argues that thinking of the neural code as one where neural spikes trigger neural spikes, much like billiard balls triggering motion in other billiard balls, is misleading and incomplete. He argues that the neural code is in fact as much a synaptic reweighting (i.e. informational reparameterization) code as it is a code based on neural spikes or action potentials. Tse argues that criterial causation offers a middle path between the extremes of determinism, where one's decisions and their consequences were ‚Äòset in stone‚Äô ages before one was even born, and informationally uncontrained indeterminism, where decisions happen randomly, for no reason at all. He argues that David Hume was wrong when he wrote ‚Äútis impossible to admit of any medium betwixt chance and an absolute necessity.‚Äù The middle path between the two is afforded by criterial causation. For example, if commanded to think of a woman politician, people will name whichever one comes to mind first. But if the universe could be rewound to the moment of the command, they might have generated a different name, say ‚ÄòMargaret Thatcher‚Äô this time instead of ‚ÄòAngela Merkel.‚Äô This was not utterly random, since it had to meet the criteria of being a woman and a politician, but it was also not determined, and might have turned out otherwise. Free will: Tse argues that discussants often argue past each other because they have different underlying definitions of the term ‚Äòfree will.‚Äô If one has (1) a ‚Äòlow-octane‚Äô definition according to which one's decisions and intentions can influence one's subsequent actions uncoerced by external forces or intentions, one can believe that free will is compatible with determinism, because nowhere in this definition is it required that events have the possibility of turning out otherwise. However, if one has a (2) ‚Äòmid-octane‚Äô definition, where this requirement must be met, then, by definition, one must hold that free will is incompatible with determinism, where there is only one possible unfolding of events. One must also be an incompatibilist under (3) a ‚Äòhigh-octane‚Äô definition of free will, which Tse also terms ‚Äòmetafree will,‚Äô according to which one must have the capacity not only to choose among possible courses of action as in (2), but to choose among possibilities that entail becoming a different kind of chooser in the future. Tse argues that the human brain realizes both types (3) and (2) free will, whereas other animals, such as a tiger, realize type (2) only. As such, Tse is an incompatibilist regarding definitions (2) and (3), and a compatibilist regarding definition (1). He believes indeterminism is the case, so falls in the camp of Free Will Libertarianism along with philosophers such as Robert Kane. For example, a tiger, seeing a tapir in the Sumatran jungle can internally weigh various possible paths toward capturing the tapir given criteria such as path and effort minimization and stealth maximization. But no tiger thinks to itself ‚Äònext year I want to become a different kind of tiger, one that eats fewer tapirs and more pangolins.‚Äô A human, in contrast, can envision future possible selves, weigh their merits, and then choose to become a desired self, and with effort realize such a self. For example, a person may desire to learn a foreign language, envision learning numerous possible foreign languages, deliberate among them, weighing various pros and cons, and then select, say, ‚ÄòSwahili.‚Äô After a year of hard work, a person can have transformed their nervous system into a new type of nervous system and mind, namely, one that can now process Swahili inputs and produce Swahili outputs. As such, Tse views the human imagination to be the central engine of free will, when combined with the physical and motivational wherewithal to realize imagined futures. In contrast, he has argued that the Libet experiments (where preceding brain activity can be used to decode picking this versus that option, such as turning left versus right, or the timing of an event, such as a finger motion, before a person becomes conscious of willing) are largely irrelevant to free will, because free will is rooted in imaginative deliberation and choosing, not picking among arbitrary and meaningless alternatives. Libet's picking paradigm also misses the fundamental importance of willpower in realizing envisioned future paths or future selves, where, for example, a person can envision numerous possible flying machines, but then must also have the determination and perseverance to build that machine, and thereby transform the world, as the Wright brothers did. Similarly, he has dismissed Wegner's claims that there is no free will with the statement ‚Äòjust as the existence of visual illusions does not prove that all vision is illusory, the existence of illusions of conscious agency does not prove that conscious operations cannot be causal of action in certain cases.‚Äù  References   External links  * http://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/peter-ulric-tse * https://www.attentioninthebrain.com 1962 births Living people American neuroscientists Cognitive neuroscientists Dartmouth College alumni Dartmouth College faculty Harvard University alumni ","title":"Peter Ulric Tse"},{"id":"53515285","text":"There Was a Young Lady is a 1953 British comedy film directed by Lawrence Huntington and starring Michael Denison, Dulcie Gray and Sydney Tafler.

It was the first of many treaties signed between the Navajo and the US Government. It was never ratified by the U.S. Senate. Background The traditional Navajo homeland spans from Arizona through western New Mexico, where the Navajo had houses and raised livestock. There was a long historical pattern in the Southwest of groups or bands raiding and trading with each other. This included Navajo, Spanish, Mexican, Apache, Comanche, Ute, and the \\"new men\\" (Anglo-Americans), as Chief Narbona called them in 1846. Events before 1863, included a cycle of treaties, raids and counter-raids by the US Army, the Navajo and a civilian militia, with civilian speculators often on the fringe. Most of the militia involved were longtime enemies of the Navajo, like Spanish descendants from northern New Mexico, where Spain had established several settlements beginning in the late 16th century during the New Mexico's Colonial period. Events just before the treaty, September‚ÄìOctober 1846 The Navajo continue to raid despite the arrival of the US Military in 1846. General Stephen W. Kearny ordered the Navajo to attend a council in Santa Fe in September 1846. The Navajo did not show up. On October 2, Kearny sent a note to Col. William Doniphan, his second-in-command in Santa Fe to take all prisoners held by the Navajo and property which may have been stole from the inhabitants\\" of New Mexico. On October 5 while on his way to California Kearny stopped in Socorro, New Mexico. He wrote a proclamation there that authorized \\"all the inhabitants (Mexican & Pueblos) ...to form war parties, march into the country of their enemies, the Navajoes, to recover their property, to make reprisals and obtain redress for the many insults received from them. The old, the women and the children of the Navajoes must not be injured.\\" In late October, Kearny ordered Doniphan to send a regiment of soldiers into Navajo country and secure a peace treaty with them. A detachment of 30 men made contact with the Navajo and spoke to the Navajo Chief Narbona in mid-October. Sundberg, L. Din√©tah: An Early History of the Navajo People, pp. 48-49. Treaty, November 21, 1846 A second meeting between Chief Narbona with five hundred Navajo and Col. Doniphan occurred on November 21 at Bear Spring, Ojo del Oso, near where Fort Wingate would later be built. Doniphan informed the Navajo that all their land now belonged to the United States, and the Navajo and New Mexicans were the \\"children of the United States\\". The Navajo signed a treaty, known as the Bear Spring Treaty, on November 21, 1846. Given that the Navajos could not read or write, it is unlikely that they completely understood the Treaty they had signed. The \\"Memorandum of a treaty entered into between Colonel A. W. Doniphan, commanding the United States' forces in the Navajo country, and the chiefs of the Navajo Nation of Indians\\", declared in Article I: \\"A firm and lasting peace and amity shall henceforth exist between the American people and the Navajo tribe of Indians\\"Locke, Raymond, The Book of the Navajo,.Mankind Publishing Company, 2001. . Article 2 noted the definition included New Mexicans and Pueblo peoples as being Americans, that Article 3 said free trade was guaranteed by both sides, with protection of any molestation and Articles 4 & 5 said the prisoners and property taken by both sides were to be restored.Hughes, J, Doniphan's Expedition. Aftermath After the treaty was signed, gifts were exchanged as an expression of good will, according to John Hughes from 1847. The treaty did little to end the conflict between the Navajo, the New Mexicans and recently arrived Anglos. The Navajo warriors continued to raid the New Mexicans and take their livestock.Cycles of Conquest: The Impact of Spain, Mexico, and the United States on Indians of the Southwest, 1533-1960,, Edward Spicer Likewise, New Mexican militia continued to raid the Navajo for livestock and slaves. Further treaties would be signed and military actions taken, resulting in the Long Walk of the Navajo in 1863, and their return in 1868. Notes References * Hughes, John, Doniphan's Expedition, U. P.

Because of this unknown status, a stranger may be perceived as a threat until their identity and character can be ascertained. Different classes of strangers have been identified for social science purposes, and the tendency for strangers and foreigners to overlap has been examined. The presence of a stranger can throw an established social order into question, \\"because the stranger is neither friend nor enemy; and because he may be both\\".Mike Featherstone, Global Culture: Nationalism, Globalization and Modernity (1990), p. 145. The distrust of strangers has led to the concept of stranger danger (and the expression \\"don't talk to strangers\\"), wherein excessive emphasis is given to teaching children to fear strangers despite the most common sources of abduction or abuse being people known to the child.Does 'stranger danger' go too far? - NBC News, Transcript, ET June 23, 2005 Definitions A stranger is commonly defined as someone who is unknown to another. Since individuals tend to have a comparatively small circle of family, friends, acquaintances, and other people known to them‚Äîa few hundred or a few thousand people out of the billions of people in the world‚Äîthe vast majority of people are strangers to one another. It may also more figuratively refer to a person for whom a concept is unknown, such as describing a contentious subject as \\"no stranger to controversy,\\" or an unsanitary person as a \\"stranger to hygiene\\". A stranger is typically represented as an outsider, and a source of ambivalence, as they may be a friend, an enemy, or both. The word stranger derives from the Middle French word estrangier, meaning a foreigner or alien. The boundaries of what people or groups are considered strangers varies according to circumstances and culture, and those in the fields of sociology and philosophy in a variety of broader contexts. According to sociologist and philosopher Zygmunt Bauman, every society produces its own strangers, and the natures of \\"strangeness\\" is \\"eminently pliable [and] man-made\\". Alternatively, Lisa Atwood Wilkinson has written that \\"[b]y definition, whoever is a stranger to me is someone who is not a philos: a stranger is a person who is not related to me by blood or marriage, not a member of my tribe or ethne, and not a fellow citizen.\\"Lisa Atwood Wilkinson, Socratic Charis: Philosophy Without the Agon (2013), p. 87. Another asserts that \\"[i]t has been argued by many a philosopher that we are all strangers on earth, alienated from others and ourselves even in our own country\\". =Types of strangers= The state of being a stranger may be examined as a matter of degrees. For example, someone may be a partial stranger in cases where they are unable to communicate, or another is unable to understand aspects of an individual, their perspective or experiences. Alternatively, one may be a moral stranger to another who acts \\"out of fundamentally divergent moral commitments\\", even though the person may be a close friend or family member. A stranger with whom a person has previously had no contact of any kind may be referred to as a \\"total stranger\\" or \\"perfect stranger\\".Graham Pointon, Stewart Clark, Words: A User's Guide (2014), p. 333: \\"The expressions perfect stranger and total stranger emphasize the fact that the person is completely unknown\\". Some people who are considered \\"strangers\\" due to the lack of a formally established relationship between themselves and others are nonetheless more familiar than a total stranger. A familiar stranger is an individual who is recognized by another from regularly sharing a common physical space such as a street or bus stop, but with whom one does not interact. First identified by Stanley Milgram in the 1972 paper The Familiar Stranger: An Aspect of Urban Anonymity,Milgram, Stanley. 1972. \\"The Familiar Stranger: An Aspect of Urban Anonymity\\". in The Division 8 Newsletter, Division of Personality and Social Psychology. Washington: American Psychological Association it has become an increasingly popular topic in research about social networks and technologically-mediated communication. Consequential strangers are personal connections other than family and close friends. Also known as \\"peripheral\\" or \\"weak\\" ties, they lie in the broad social territory between strangers and intimates. The term was coined by Karen L. Fingerman and further developed by Melinda Blau, who collaborated with the psychologist to explore and popularize the concept. =Strangers and foreigners= A stranger is not necessarily a foreigner, although a foreigner is highly likely to be a stranger: According to Chris Rumford, referencing the work of sociologist and philosopher Georg Simmel, \\"people who are physically close by can be remote and those who are far away may in fact be close in many ways\\". With the conglomeration of populations into large cities, people now have a historically high propensity to \\"live among strangers\\".Judith Donath, The Social Machine: Designs for Living Online (2014), p. 337. Adopting a statist view, strangers may be seen as a chaotic challenge to the order imposed and sought by the nation-state, which is then faced with the challenge of assimilating the stranger, expelling them, or destroying them. Although this view may overlook important issues of what authority defines the stranger, and how that determination is made. Interactions with strangers Interactions with strangers can vary widely depending on the circumstances and the personalities of the people involved. Some people have no difficulty striking up conversations with strangers, while others experience strong discomfort at the prospect of interacting with strangers.Warren H. Jones, Jonathan M. Cheek, Stephen R. Briggs, Shyness: Perspectives on Research and Treatment (2013), p. 228. At the opposite end of the spectrum, some people are excited by engaging in sex with strangers. Psychologist Dan P. McAdams writes: =Stranger anxiety= Video from the Centers for Disease Control showing the distressed reaction of a nine-month- old to encountering a stranger Infants will generally be receptive to strangers until after they achieve object permanence and begin forming attachments. Thereafter stranger anxiety typically emerges, and young children will normally exhibit signs of distress when presented with unfamiliar individuals, and will tend to prefer those with whom they are familiar rather than strangers. This reaction is generally referred to as stranger anxiety or stranger wariness. According to one review, the reaction to strangers may differ somewhat according to gender. While there were no gender differences observed at three months of age, girls appeared to exhibit stranger fear at an earlier average age than boys, at about eight to nines months old, although boys quickly caught up, and examinations of nine to 17 months old recorded no differences. Studies have shows that infants tend to show a preference for strangers if they are near their own age. However, this preference may reverse in situations which include fear-producing stimuli. The severity of stranger anxiety may be affected by individual temperament, capacity for self- regulation, and caregiver anxiety. Stranger anxiety may be mitigated through a number of techniques, including positive interaction between the stranger and companions, and arranging for familiar surroundings. =Stranger danger= For older children, instruction is often provided in schools and homes on so called \\"stranger danger\\". This often stems from public fears regarding stranger offenders, individuals who may approach children in public places with the intention of abduction or abuse, possibly due in part to their perception of children as vulnerable targets. Statistically, children who are abducted are much more likely to be taken by someone who is an acquaintance or family member. According to one estimate, \\"classic stranger abductions\\" accounted for only %0.014 of total missing children annually in the United States, or about 14 per 100,000. Furthermore, of all abductions by non-family members, the majority (59%) were of teenagers, rather than children. In similar statistics reported by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), only about 1% of abductions were from non-family members, while 91% of those abducted were classified as endangered runaways. This has led to calls to de-emphasize stranger danger, as Nancy McBride of NCMEC told NBC News, \\"let's take stranger-danger and put it in a museum. We need to teach our kids things are actually going to help them if they are in trouble.\\" This was echoed by sociologist, and director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center, David Finkelhor, writing in The Washington Post: > We‚Äôd do much better to teach them the signs of people (strangers or not) who > are behaving badly: touching them inappropriately, being overly personal, > trying to get them alone, acting drunk, provoking others or recklessly > wielding weapons. We need to help children practice refusal skills, > disengagement skills and how to summon help. =In adults= Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 thriller, Strangers on a Train, which revolves around the social dynamics of strangers meeting in passing with little expectation of future interaction, a scenario which research suggests predisposes people to be more open and willing to self-disclose information In their review of the sociological literature, Semin and Fiedler concluded that the perception of strangers tends to be based primarily on group membership, and their identity as a member of an out-group, because a stranger is, by definition, not known individually. This may magnify the perceived motives or intentions of the stranger, but may also vary greatly according to the circumstances and the environment. Among environmental factors, physical uncomfortably, such as presence in a room that is hot and crowded, have been shown to increase negative attitudes toward strangers. Laboratory evidence has indicated that individuals are likely to behave less modestly when meeting face-to-face with strangers, when no friends or acquaintances were present. As explained by Joinson and colleagues, \\"they tend to present more of their ideal self-qualities to strangers than they do to friends.\\" However, this appeared to be reversed when two strangers met one another online in the absence of friends, which elicited the most modest self-presentation, more so than online interactions with strangers conducted in the presence of friends. In willingness to disclose information, researchers have identified what has been dubbed the stranger-on-the-train phenomenon, wherein individuals are inclined to share a great deal of personal information with anonymous individuals. This may be influenced by the temporary nature of their relationship, and the knowledge that the stranger themselves have no access to an individuals wider social circle. As one author put it, the phenomenon is ironically best described by the words of travel writer Paul Theroux, saying: > The conversation, like many others I had with people on trains derived an > easy candour from the shared journey, the comfort of the dining care, and > the certain knowledge that neither of us would see each other again. This may be helpful in eliciting self-disclosure in the context of therapy or counseling, and can encourage openness and honesty. However, research also suggests that this phenomenon is mediated by the expectation of future interaction with the stranger. In religion Psalm 146:9 The New Testament Greek translation of \\"stranger\\" is xenos, which is the root word of the English xenophobia, meaning fear of strangers and foreigners alike.Ephraim Radner, Time and the Word (2016), p. 313. Strangers, and especially showing hospitality to strangers and strangers in need is a theme throughout the Old Testament, and is \\"expanded upon ‚Äî and even radicalized ‚Äî in the New Testament. In the King James Version of the Old Testament, Exodus 23:9 states: \\"Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt\\". Some other translations use \\"foreigner\\" instead of \\"stranger\\".

She died off the coast of San Diego, California on the night of April 14, 1994. Her body was recovered the next morning, naked, with her right leg missing from her mid-thigh, several broken bones, and other injuries. It appeared to investigators that she had been attacked by a great white shark. However, several experts have claimed that her injuries are inconsistent with those of a shark attack, with others suggesting murder or a fall from the nearby Sunset Cliffs was the cause of death. Last sighting Von Emster was last seen around 8 p.m. in San Diego on April 14. She was wearing a green trench coat and carried a purse, which would later be found along a busy stretch of beach the next day. This sighting helped establish a timeline for her last hours. Discovery of the body During the early morning of Friday, April 15, 1994, two local surfers walking near the Sunset Cliffs Natural Park and Beach in San Diego discovered a body floating face- down in kelp. The body was reported and moved to the San Diego Lifeguard Headquarters, where an official investigation was opened. Michelle von Emster was naked at the time of her discovery, wearing only jewelry. When medical examiner Robert Engle inspected the body, he described \\"large, tearing-type wounds with missing tissue\\". Michelle's right leg was missing from the thigh down. Engle believed von Emster had not been in the water a long time. Initially, the cause of death was marked Unknown, with the unproven assumption that it was simply a shark attack. Formal autopsy On April 16, 1994, an official autopsy was performed by San Diego Medical Examiner Brian Blackbourne. According to the official report, Michelle's right leg was missing from the thigh down. In addition, von Emster suffered a broken neck, broken ribs, a broken pelvis, and various scrapes and contusions on her face and torso. There were also large quantities of sand found in her mouth, lungs, throat, and stomach. The autopsy states that Michelle was alive when her injuries were inflicted, and would have had to have taken a large breath or gulp for all the sand to end up inside of her. Blackbourne ruled Michelle's death a shark attack. However, it's important to note that Blackbourne had never performed an autopsy on a shark attack victim before, and neither had anyone who viewed the body. Official cause of death Von Emster's death is considered, officially, the result of a great white shark attack. The coroner's examination concluded that she had gone swimming, or \\"entered the water\\", around midnight and was shortly thereafter attacked by a shark. It also appeared that her body had subsequently been scavenged by blue sharks postmortem. Inconsistencies and arguments against the official cause of death Unofficially the case remains a mystery for many who believe that her injuries are not consistent with a shark attack, and that something else must have caused her death before she entered the water. Proponents for an alternate theory regarding her death point to specific facts that appear to counter the evidence cited in the official autopsy report. For example, the water temperature was about 59 degrees which is likely too cold for anyone to consider a nude midnight swim; and her injuries are, according to shark attack experts, inconsistent with shark attacks. These include facial bruising, a broken neck, broken ribs, a broken pelvis, and sand in her stomach. In particular, shark expert Ralph Collier commented \\"...when a White Shark bites off part of a limb, the break is clean, almost like you put it on a table saw. What remained of Michelle's leg was anything but.\\" A pointed separation might indicate multiple cutting events on that particular bone which would literally whittle it into a point. An event like this could be consistent with the bone being repeatedly cut by a boat propeller, which is one possibility that Collier allegedly suggests to Decker during a phone call in which Collier is quoted as saying \\"Michelle von Emster was unequivocally not killed by a shark.\\" In addition, once Michelle's leg had been severed, she would have bled out quickly from a severed femoral artery. This would have made it extremely difficult to take a large breath, as she would have had to have done to get the sand into her stomach. This makes the theory that a shark forced her to the bottom of the ocean (where she took a breath and swallowed sand) extremely unlikely. Unofficial theories Initial suspicion, among theorists, fell upon one Edwin Decker, who had a short-lived romantic encounter with Michelle two nights before her body was found. Suspicion was drawn to Decker after he penned a mysterious, morbid poem about Michelle after her death, Another potential suspect was revealed when a co-worker at an office supply store where Michelle had previously worked saw a man making several copies of the original autopsy report shortly after the investigation was concluded. This co-worker claimed the man had a motorcycle. This last suspect theory ties in with a workplace stalker Michelle once complained about, who also owned a motorcycle. Further adding to speculations of a possible murder scenario is the fact that her clothes were never found and her purse, with money and other items intact, was found in an obvious location not far away. At the urging of Edwin Decker and journalist Neal Matthews, Michelle's autopsy report was reviewed in 2008 by new chief medical examiner Glen Wagner who, according to an article by Decker, concluded that there seemed to be some questionable evidence but not enough to justify amending her death certificate. Michelle's case was profiled on Buzzfeed Unsolved, a mystery series on YouTube reviewing the details of her case. Hosts Ryan Bergara and Shane Madej noted suspicious details in Michelle's autopsy, and developed three primary theories for Michelle's death: 1. That Michelle was indeed attacked by a shark, 2. that Michelle jumped and was later fed on by sharks, or 3. that Michelle was murdered, perhaps by a rebuffed love interest or by an unnamed stalker. While prevailing opinion has it that von Emster was the victim of a shark attack, authorities on scene had never investigated a death by shark attack before, and so may not have been qualified to pass on the cause of death. In addition, when experts were later shown the body, some claimed the injuries did not match the measurements of a great white shark. Officially the case is closed, but the case of Michelle von Emster's death remains a mystery to those who do not agree with the official cause of death: a great white shark attack.http://www.sharkattackfile.net/spreadsheets/pdf_directory/1994.04.16-Emster.pdfhttp://www.maritimeherald.com/2018/this- woman-was-killed-by-a-great-white-shark-but-all-clues-point-to-something-much- worse/https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanbergara/the-mysterious-death-of-michelle- vom-emsterhttps://scwc.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/open-and-shutrevisiting-the- mysterious-death-of-michelle-von-emster/ Currently, the Global Shark Attack File does not recognize von Emster's incident as a fatal shark attack.

A. thaliana was the first plant for which a high-quality reference genome sequence was determined (see below), and a worldwide research community has developed many other genetic resources and tools. The experimental advantages of A. thaliana have enabled many important discoveries. These advantages have been extensively reviewed, as has its role in fundamental discoveries about the plant immune system, natural variation, and other areas.  Early history  A. thaliana was first described by Johannes Thal, and later renamed in his honor. (See the Taxonomy section of the main article.) Friedrich Laibach outlined why A. thaliana might be a good experimental system in 1943 and collected a large number of natural accessions. George R√©dei pioneered the use of A. thaliana for fundamental studies, completing the first chemical mutagenesis screens and writing an influential review in 1975. Gerhard R√∂bbelen organized the first International Arabidopsis Symposium in 1965. R√∂bbelen also started the 'Arabidopsis Information Service', a newsletter for sharing information in the community. This newsletter was maintained by A.R. Kranz starting in 1974, and was published until 1990.  Adoption as the premiere model plant species for molecular genetics  As molecular biology methods progressed, many investigators sought to focus community effort on common model plant species. Researchers in the laboratory of Elliot Meyerowitz showed that A. thaliana genome is relatively small and nonrepetitive, which was an important advantage for early molecular methods. Meyerowitz and colleagues also made important contributions to development of the ABC model of flower development via genetic analysis of floral homeotic mutants. Notable researchers such Gerald Fink and Frederick M. Ausubel were persuaded to adopt A. thaliana as a model, including for the study of host-microbe interactions. Pioneering A. thaliana studies have used its natural filamentous pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, the model plant-pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, and many other microbes. Development of a genetic map based on visible and molecular genetic markers facilitated map-based cloning of mutant loci from classical \\"forward genetic\\" screens. Growing amounts of DNA sequence data facilitated development and application of such molecular markers. Descriptions of the first successful map-based cloning projects were published in 1992. A. thaliana can be genetically transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens; transgenic seed can be obtained by simply dipping flowers into a suitable bacterial suspension. The invention/discovery of this 'floral dip' method made A. thaliana arguably the most easily transformed multicellular organism, and has been essential to many subsequent investigations. Efficient transformation facilitated insertional mutagenesis as described further below.  Genome project  An international consortium began sequencing and assembly of a draft genome for A. thaliana in 1990. This work paralleled the Human Genome Project and related projects for other model organisms, and built on efforts to sequence expressed sequence tags from A. thaliana. Descriptions of the sequences of chromosomes 4 and 2 were published in 1999, and the project was completed in 2000. This represented the first reference genome for a flowering plant and facilitated comparative genomics.  2010 project  A series of meetings led to an ambitious long-term NSF- funded initiative to determine the function of every A. thaliana gene by the year 2010. The rationale for this project was to combine new high-throughput technologies with systematic gene-family-wide studies and community resources to accelerate progress beyond what was possible via piecemeal single- laboratory studies. DNA microarray technology was rapidly adopted for A. thaliana research and led to the development of \\"atlases\\" of gene expression in different tissues and under different conditions. The A. thaliana genome sequence, and low-cost Sanger sequencing, and ease of transformation facilated genome-wide mutagenesis, yielding collections of sequence-indexed transposon mutant and (especially) T-DNA mutant lines. The ease and speed of ordering mutant seed from stock centers dramatically accelerated \\"reverse genetic\\" study of many gene families; the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center and the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre were important in this regard, and information on stock availability was integrated into The Arabidopsis Information Resource database. A. thaliana quickly became an important model for the study of plant small RNAs. The argonaute1 mutant, named for its resemblance to an Argonauta octopuses, was the namesake for the Argonaute protein family central to silencing. Forward genetic screens focused on vegetative phase change uncovered many genes controlling small RNA biogenesis. A. thaliana became an important model for RNA-directed RNA methylation (transcriptional silencing), partly because many A. thaliana methylation mutants are viable, which is not the case for several model animals (in which such mutations cause lethality).  Post-2010 project developments  As the NSF 2010 project neared completion, there was a perceived decrease in funding agency interest in A. thaliana, evidenced by the cessation of USDA funding for A. thaliana research, the end of NSF funding for The Arabidopsis Information Resource database, and the rise of new genome-sequence-enabled model plant species (including crops). Nevertheless, A. thaliana remains a popular model, and continues to be the subject of intense study using new technologies such as high-throughput short-read sequencing. Mapping of mutations from forward screens is increasingly done with direct genome sequencing, combined in some cases with bulked segregant analysis or backcrossing. A. thaliana is a premier model for studies of natural genetic variation, including genome-wide association studies. Short RNA-guided DNA editing with CRISPR tools has been applied to A. thaliana since at least 2013.

The brand was reestablished in 2014 by co-founders Andy Rieger and Ryan Maybee and is the first legal distillery in Kansas City, Missouri since Prohibition. History Jacob Rieger immigrated to America from Goritz, Austria in 1877. That year Jacob founded the J. Rieger & Co. distillery in Kansas City's West Bottoms neighborhood, directly across from the Livestock Exchange Building. 21 years later, in 1898, the first official listing of J.

During Alexander‚Äôs time in charge, J. Rieger & Co. claimed to be the largest mail-order whiskey house in the U.S., with a customer base of 250,000+. The distillery offered over 100 unique products ranging from whiskeys, to gins, rums, and even stomach bitters. J. Rieger & Co. reached customers across the country through direct mail and advertisements. Recipients completed the order form and mailed it to J. Rieger & Co. with payment. Orders were then fulfilled and J. Rieger & Co. products were shipped all over the country. The company thrived on this business model until the Eighteenth Amendment was passed in 1919, making the production, sale and transport of intoxicating liquors illegal. Like most breweries and distilleries across the country, Alexander was forced to shut the doors of J. Rieger & Co. in December 1919. Shortly after, Alexander Rieger Mercantile Company and Alexander Rieger Investment Company were listed at the same address of the once thriving J.

Early life and career Robin Francis Cavendish was born 12 March 1930 in Middleton, Derbyshire, England. He attended Winchester College. He attended Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned into the 60th Rifles, of the King‚Äôs Royal Rifle Corps, spending seven years in the Army, eventually attaining the rank of Captain. He left the Army to join Thompson Smithett in starting up a tea-broking business in Kenya. In 1957, he married Diana Blacker and returned to Kenya. They had one son,Renton, Alice; Renton, Tim (10 August 1994). \\"Obituary: Robin Cavendish\\". The Independent. Jonathan Cavendish.Dex, Robert (17 May 2016). \\"Rings star Andy Serkis on filming another swashbuckling band of adventurers\\". London Evening Standard. Polio diagnosis and subsequent career In December 1958, while in Kenya, Cavendish became ill with polio. Because he was paralyzed from the neck down, a Nairobi doctor put him on a mechanical respirator that Cavendish needed to breathe, making him a \\"responaut\\". Cavendish flew back to England.Oaksey, John (17 August 2001). \\"Obituaries: Professor E T 'Teddy' Hall\\". The Daily Telegraph. He was initially given only three months, and then one year, to live. Against the advice of his doctors, he left the hospital after a year. For the remainder of his life, Cavendish and his wife worked not only to improve the quality of his life, but the lives of other paralysed people, travelling the world to inspire others as campaigners for disabled people. Cavendish would often serve as the expert who explained his condition to consultants and nurses. In the 1960s he tracked down and listed the circumstances of all the responauts in Britain, compiling the first record of how many people were confined to iron lungs. In 1962, Cavendish and his friend Teddy Hall, the Oxford University professor, developed a wheelchair with a built-in respirator that freed Cavendish from confinement to his bed, which became the model for future devices of its type, with Cavendish eventually using a total of 10 different chairs. Determined that mobility should be available to other polio survivors, Cavendish raised money from the Ernest Kleinwort Charitable Trust for the first dozen chairs, and eventually persuaded the then British Department of Health to fund a series of chairs, which were manufactured by Teddy Hall's company, Littlemore Scientific Engineering. After testing them on himself, Cavendish helped to market pieces of equipment that improve the quality of life of disabled people. Most notable among these was the Possum, which Cavendish developed with scientists at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, and which allowed users to use the telephone, turn on a television or adjust a home's central heating with only a left-or-right movement of their head. Others included a lightweight ventilator that ran on batteries, and a modified aircraft seat fitted with electronic aids. Littlemore received government funding to make another forty chair-and-ventilator sets. Moved by the plight of families who could never go on holiday together, Cavendish and others, in particular polio specialist Dr. G.T. Spencer, the consultant in charge of the Lane-Fox Unit at St Thomas's Hospital in London, co-founded the charity Refresh in 1970 to raise the money toward the construction of Netley Waterside House, a holiday complex overlooking Southampton Water on the South Coast whose facilities provided for the care of severely disabled responauts as they and their families enjoyed the attractive surroundings. The facility opened in 1977. Cavendish was made an MBE in 1974. Personal life Cavendish was an atheist. Among his pastimes was reading newspapers. Cavendish and Diana refused to accept Cavendish's condition as a major restriction, travelling widely until a short time before his death. They often drove from Oxford to London in their specially adapted van, returning home late at night. They also travelled abroad to visit places such as the battlefields of northern France, and they enjoyed receiving visiting friends in their home. According to Alice and Tim Renton of The Independent, \\"Young people found him an irresistible ear to pour confidences into and his stimulating and down-to-earth attitude to problems helped many. His contemporaries would drive across country to ask his advice and enjoy his company. It was as if his sedentary life gave him a broader viewpoint and a sharper vision than the rest of us, and his capacity for laughing at, as well as with, his friends was healthily deflating.\\" Cavendish was described by the Rentons as \\"naturally unsentimental\\" whose love for Diana, Jonathan and daughter-in-law, Leslie Ann Rogers was both \\"well-concealed and totally evident\\". According to the Rentons, Cavendish \\"questioned mercilessly and passed on gossip as happily as he received it, but somehow the malice disappeared as it went through him. He had a natural graciousness: his lack of evident resentment at his own condition made helping him a positive pleasure.\\" Death and legacy Blue plaque dedicated to Robin Cavendish, MBE (1930-1994), British advocate for disabled people, medical aid developer, and one of the longest-lived responauts Cavendish died on 8 August 1994 at Drayton St Leonard, Oxfordshire, England at the age of 64, becoming a medical phenomenon as one of the longest-living polio survivors in Great Britain. In their obituary of him, the Rentons stated, \\"To know Robin Cavendish was to know the personification of courage. Many people achieve moments of great courage, few are called on to show it continuously for 36 years.\\" On 27 November 1995, the Robin Cavendish Memorial Fund was created, with Diana, Jonathan and Leslie Cavendish among its trustees. Its purpose was to provide grants to individuals and organisations for the purpose of advancing the health and saving the lives of people with disabilities. In 2014, it was merged with the charity that Robin and Diana Cavendish had previously founded, Refresh, into the Cavendish Spencer Trust, which provides holiday and respite breaks for people with severe disability due to neurological or neuromuscular disorders. The Trust is named for Cavendish and his close friend Geoffrey Spencer, who aided Cavendish in his advocacy for disabled people.\\"The Robin Cavendish Memorial Fund\\". Open Charities.

The award was announced by Nobel Laureate Sir Richard J.

Upon his family's return to Canada, Elliott was introduced to street art while studying at the Etobicoke School of the Arts. His high school's guidance counsellor directed him to Sheridan College's program in Animation and affirmed for the young artist the possibilities of a career in the arts. Elliott studied animation at Sheridan College.  Career  Since graduating from Sheridan College's animation program, Elliott has amassed a collection of murals and public artworks that have come to help define Toronto's cityscape. Moving beyond notions of the streets being his only canvas, Elliott has exhibited works at The Art Gallery of Ontario, The Royal Ontario Museum, and LE Gallery. Elliott has also acted as an arts educator working with the Art Gallery of Ontario's \\"Free After Three\\" youth arts program, and the Toronto Jazz Festival, teaching youth aerosol paint techniques. Elliot's most notable works can be described as a highly improvised collage of soft characters and organic shapes, layered and blended through transparencies.

Its original title is Morbus Kitahara. A work of alternative history, it is set in Central Europe after World War II and the implementation of the Morgenthau Plan, which has deindustrialized the region and created a ruthless post- apocalyptic-esque society. The main character is the son of a blacksmith who becomes the bodyguard of the only man in the area who owns a car. An English translation by John E. Woods was published in 1997. The book received the 1996 Aristeion Prize. Reception Curt Fields wrote in the Chicago Tribune: \\"The themes are grand, but the writing is far from pompous. Ransmayr's story (and John E. Woods' translation from the original German) is elegant, incisive and never labored.\\" In The New York Times, Gabriele Annan wrote about the book's use of allegory: \\"Whatever it symbolizes, the narrative is wildly arbitrary; but there is something so powerful, committed and solemn about Ransmayr's tone that it seems like a command to interpret his message\\". The critic continued: \\"This can have the opposite effect, of course, and Ransmayr has affectations that can be irritating. All the same, he is a marvelous writer, though, unlike most novelists, he writes more about sensations than feelings.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote: \\"Ably translated by Woods, this novel paints a convincing postapocalyptic world sent back into a nearly pre-civilized state. But Ransmayr (The Terrors of Ice and Darkness), though clearly probing the question of how Germany is to view itself in the wake of the Holocaust and WWII, never pulls his story out of his dark, expressionist atmospherics into the clear light of an answer.\\" References External links * German publicity page 1995 science fiction novels 1995 novels 20th-century Austrian novels Austrian alternate history novels Dystopian novels German-language novels Novels by Christoph Ransmayr Post-apocalyptic novels ","title":"The Dog King"},{"id":"53516150","text":"Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Quito's 1971 season was the club's 41st year of existence, the 18th year in professional football and the 12th in the top level of professional football in Ecuador.

Beverley happens to be the tutelary goddess of Beverley Brook, a small river in South London, and can often be found swimming through its waters; when Peter comes to the bank and calls her name, she might jump naked out of the water, like a salmon, directly into his arms.

However, one of the teenagers involved was the daughter of a very magical creature ‚Äì Cecilia Tyburn Thames aka Lady Ty, who is the goddess of the River Tyburn and the older and far stricter sister of Peter's girlfriend. Peter owes Lady Ty a favour for having once saved his life, and she wants her daughter Olivia kept out of trouble with the law ‚Äì which is not easy for Peter to deliver. \\"Magic and Other Weird Bollocks: The Hanging Tree by Ben Aaronovitch\\" ‚Äì review by Liz Bourke. Peter's involvement soon grows deeper when an autopsy by pathologists who know about magic reveals that the dead girl, Christina Chorley, had died not only of a drug overdose but also of a wild and excessive use of magic ‚Äì which can cause a careless practitioner's brain to undergo hyperthaumaturgical degradation, with often fatal results. Peter plunges into the investigation, in partnership with the Muslim policewoman Sahra Guleed ‚Äì who has no training in magic but makes up for it in her courage and dedication. It is far from easy, since it is needed to interview various very rich and influential people, who resent the police digging into their affairs and who use their connections in the Metropolitan Police's command structure to obstruct the investigation. To further confuse the issue, there come up traces of a long-lost manuscript by Isaac Newton, who secretly founded modern magic. This lost Third Principia, stolen by the 18th Century master criminal Jonathan Wild, supposedly deals with alchemy, the Philosopher's Stone and possibly even with how to attain eternal life. Various magically-inclined individuals and groups are involved in the hunt for this treasure: * Viscountess Helena Linden-Limmer, heiress to a long line of witches and sorceresses who disdain male-dominated magic, and her daughter Caroline who aspires to learn how to fly magically without wings or mechanical aids * A bunch of American wizards known as the Virginia Gentlemen, with links to the US intelligence community ‚Äì who bungled badly when using magic at Falluja during the Iraq War, but are now intensively active in London * The various not-quite-human beings known collectively as The Demi-monde, identifying themselves as fae and strongly objecting to being called goblins. Their favourite gathering place is the sinister Chestnut Tree Pub, built around the still-existent Tyburn Tree, on which London criminals used to be hanged (the Hanging Tree of the title) * In particular, a specific denizen of this Demi-monde known as Reynard Fossman (Reynard the Fox), a highly enterprising and competent criminal rumoured to be in possession of the secret Newton manuscript * Sir William Tyburn ‚Äì an earlier deity of the River Tyburn. Considered to have been killed by the river's industrial pollution in the 19th Century, he suddenly re-appears ‚Äì using a 14th Century broadsword to kill a 21st Century underworld hired killer. On another occasion, he is seen at night running across the parks of modern London, painted blue with woad and stalking mysterious prey with spears All of these and more are constantly running into each other, ruining each other's plans but sometimes inadvertently saving each other's lives. Gradually, however, other issues become side-lined as Peter Grant and his mentor, the veteran wizard Nightingale, find themselves heading for an explosive showdown with their arch-enemy ‚Äì the very powerful and utterly ruthless wizard known as The Faceless Man. Also involved is the renegade policewoman Leslie May ‚Äì once Peter Grant's valued colleague with whom he was deeply in love, now The Faceless Man's cunning and highly resourceful accomplice. The titanic magical battle thoroughly wreaks the luxurious apartment building where everything began. \\"He almost got me, you know\\" Nightingale recounts afterwards. \\"He's prepared a number of booby traps and tried to lure me into the killing zone\\". However, though the Faceless Man is clever and ruthless, he lacks combat experience, while Nightingale is a veteran of deadly battles against Nazi German wizards in the Second World War ‚Äì enabling him to survive all traps and relentlessly pursue his foe. Meanwhile, Peter and Leslie engage in intensive magical duels of their own ‚Äì but remember enough of their past to still make an effort not to kill each other. In the event, no one is killed. The Faceless Man and Leslie make good their escape, to fight again another day. However, he is The Faceless Man no longer. His true name and antecedents had been revealed, and a wealth of information gained on his background and motivations: an upper-class English Nationalist, a racist who romanticizes the Dark Ages and admires Alfred the Great and dreams of the English once again ruling the world. In the aftermath, Newton's famed Third Principia had fallen into the hands of Lady Helena Linden-Limmer ‚Äì and Nightingale is content to leave her the task of deciphering its obscure Latin. Peter goes back to his idyllic relationship with the delightful Beverly, doing some needed work on improving her eponymous Beverley Brook. However, Lady Ty invites him to a stern talk, to warn of the dangers and dilemmas inherent in a mortal man loving an immortal goddess (and vice versa). Critical opinion Stephenie Sheung on The Speculative Herald wrote: \\"After two years of watching the release date hover in flux and getting pushed back time and time again, I must confess waiting for this book was its own special kind of agony. That was also when I realized I was irrevocably addicted to Peter Grant. (...) It fell short of being one of the best Peter Grant books because it had a lot less of the dry, sardonic humor which has always been one of the key hallmarks of this series. While still very enjoyable, this might be the first one that didn‚Äôt make me literally laugh out loud. There also wasn‚Äôt enough of Nightingale. What I wouldn‚Äôt give to see him kick some ass again in another epic wizarding duel, instead of just hearing everyone around him talk about it. In terms of criticisms though, that was probably the extent of it, which made me very happy since I had such high expectations for this book. It wasn‚Äôt always fast- paced, but as far as police procedurals go, it had just the right amount of mystery, suspense, and action. The story had so many moving parts that Aaronovitch was constantly juggling and keeping aloft, I can‚Äôt say there was really much time for anything else. Still, we got to see a little more of Peter‚Äôs relationship with Beverly, and I‚Äôm also enjoying the larger role of Sahra Guleed, another police officer who is shaping up to be the perfect partner for Peter while the two of them are on the beat.(...) This book is what I would call a real game-changer. While it did end rather abruptly, it‚Äôs clear that Peter and the gang will have to tread even more carefully going forward, and the next book should be very interesting indeed.

She continued to paint after the WPA project ended focusing on botanicals, landscapes and maritime themes. Early life Jessie Hull July 28, 1910 in New Haven, Connecticut to Anna (n√©e Goetz) and William H. Hull. Her family had several farms in New Haven County, Connecticut and as a child, she spent time at the farms in Branford and North Haven. After completing her education at Mrs. Day's School in 1927, Hull enrolled in the Yale School of Fine Arts to study with Eugene Savage. While attending Yale, she met Henrik Martin Mayer, who she would marry at the family farm, Shepherds Point in Branford on July 2, 1932, soon after her graduation with a bachelor's degree in fine arts. She and Henrik lived in New York City for a year after their marriage and then moved to Indianapolis, Indiana. Mural in Canton, MO post office Career While the couple was in New York, they worked together on a project to decorate the New York Cosmopolitan Club. Henrik was the lead designer on the project for the solarium murals and Mayer assisted him. In Indianapolis, Mayer began working as a curator at the Indianapolis Museum of Art and painted four murals for the WPA Federal Arts Project. She entered the competition for the post office in Lafayette, Indiana, but lost the commission to her husband. Instead, she was given the commission to paint the mural for the post office in Culver. Arrival of the Mail in Culver was completed in 1938 and featured students from the military academy and other residents looking at their mail. The post office and mural have been designated as part of the Culver Commercial Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1939, Mayer won a second commission to paint the mural for the post office in Jasper, Indiana. Indiana Farming Scene in Late Autumn depicts a harvest scene on a farmstead, with no indication of the town. The oil on canvas painting was featured in a 1975 film, Art for Main Street: The Indiana Post Office Murals, produced by the Indiana Historical Society. Her third successful Mural competition was for the post office in Canton, Missouri. Mayer's oil and tempera painting, Winter Landscape was installed in 1940 and had restoration work completed in both 1971 and 2005. In 1941, Mayer's mural Corn School was hung in the post office in LaGrange, Indiana. The mural depicts the LaGrange County Courthouse and the annual fall festival hosted by the town. After World War II, the couple relocated to Essex, Connecticut, where Mayer continued to paint, focusing on botanical, landscape and marine subjects. She participated in gallery showings as well as juried exhibits, until at least 1993. Death and legacy Mayer died on July 1, 2009 in Essex.

In addition to continuing his inventive work with other devices, he established the film production company Synchro-cin√©, producing documentaries using his machinery. Later, this company performed and distributed other kinds of films.  Early life  Pertaining to a family always related to the techniques and the plumbing to a large scale, dedicated to the supply of the army, Charles Delacommune was raised practically in the workshop of machinery (that was in his own house), and from childhood participated in the tests and trials on technical advances. Was also, among other things, doctor in agronomy at the age of 18, war hero, aviator, military writer, painter and art dealer. Career = Early inventor = Others devices of Charles Delacommune Relevant figure in the inventive aspect as were many the inventions that realized in a short space of time and with precarious means: among others, a first attempt of recording of sound in celluloide already in 1919 by means of gas flames; or the method and device for the synchronization of a cinematographic projection with a wireless telephony audition in order to synchronize live interpreters with other sounds emitted by radio from a transmitter, simultaneously in the various rooms connected to system; of 1923. There is also an aircraft-viewfinder (designed on the war front) that has been lost; and an apparatus for making various noises (cin√©-bruiteur), whose design is immersed in one of the complex modernizations of its system (with multiple individual patents on each application). = Synchro-Cin√© = The Synchro-Cin√© of Charles Delacommune, invented in 1921 Defined by him as a procedure and device for the realization of the so-called cinematic synchronism , his procedure and \\"desk of synchronization\\", widely used for conferences in schools (for what was originally designed), was also used with notable success to direct a symphonic orchestra (reading the conductor from the desk) or soloists in a synchronized way with the films. L'Inhumaine or Pacific 231 were some of those that were played, live, with his device. The Ballet m√©canique, which was attempted to synchronize with (it as it appears in the contracts), could not possibly be made, possibly due to the difficulty of Antheil's music, but the company Synchro-Cin√© remained as its official distributor for several years and even today most of its copies have their logo in the entrance and exit. Throughout the decade (1920‚Äì30) he was developing the various elements of his Delacommune procedure always perfecting them, realizing continuous patents of the various components, materials and methods to be used. In the case of greater expansion and potentiality of the system could control from nine to twelve different devices, but in a very unstable and simple way. With the advent of sound cinema, his live performance technique ended up making a great contribution to the later techniques of dubbing, since his procedure and device (especially the element called Kinematic band ) are an immediate precedent of the so-called rhythmographic paper-band, basic tool of those works until recently, and its subsequent substitution by digital systems. On the other hand, in a broad sense, its system could be considered a distant precedent of both: of audiovisual mixing tables (including a special table of audio-video mix for the composer's and director or fitter) work, as well as of the MIDI control systems , being able to fire various elements from a data sequence recorded on a sliding band of perforated paper, a medium term between the pianola's rolls of the previous decade, and the perforated paper-bands of the first computers that would arrive years later. =Later career= He was, on the other hand, very controversial and reprehensible in the political aspect at the end of his career. In 1935 his company is ruined and a national campaign is undertaken to save him from eviction. Soon after, he begins to approach the Vichy regime, with which ends up collaborating like executive of its new official cinematographics organizations . It seems that, at this time, he subscribe documentaries of racist tones, although we have not any concrete evidence. The end of the World War II brings the disappearance of its devices and the disappearance of the person, given by eliminated (\\"purified\\") with the arrival of the troops of liberation. And, perhaps justifiably, his fall into total oblivion. However, the reality is that he was saved, hid in Montmartre where he became a dealer and cultural animator ; and died, in the end, in the same Paris, always maintaining an almost absolute incognito.

Early life in Saudi Arabia Although he is routinely listed as a citizen of Niger Harun was born and raised in Saudi Arabia. It was in Saudi Arabia that he formed his support for jihadism, and from where he is reported to have left to undertake military training at a training camp in Afghanistan. He is reported to have arrived in Afghanistan shortly before al Qaeda's attack on 9-11. 2003 firefight Harun was said to have been part of a force that ambushed a group of American soldiers that included Jerod Dennis and THE Mr. Raymond Losano, and wounded three other men. Harun was said to have been wounded, during the attack, but was able to escape to Pakistan. Contact with al Qaeda leaders asserts Harun met with Abu Faraj al-Libi and Abdul Hadi al-Iraqi ‚Äì two senior al Qaeda leaders. They asserted it was at this point that he joined al Qaeda and swore an oath ‚Äì bayat ‚Äì to obey Osama bin Laden. They delegated him to travel to Nigeria to lead an attack on the United States Embassy in Abuja. The DoJ describes Harun fleeing Nigeria when one of his contacts was apprehended, and he believed the plot's secrecy was compromised. They assert he fled to Libya, from where he planned to travel to Europe. Libyan security officials however arrested Harun first, in 2005, and held him until June 2011, when the Muammar Gadafi regime was overthrown. Harun fled Libya immediately for Italy, where he was arrested on June 24, 2011. According to Tom Hays, reporting for the Associated Press, Harun then traveled to Africa, where he had some involvement in a plot to bomb a US embassy. He was, however, imprisoned in Libya, by Muammar Gadafi's government, from 2005 until 2011. Harun was first tied to the deaths of the American soldiers when a copy of the Koran a surviving GI found on the battlefield, and kept, as a souvenir, was found to contain Harun's fingerprints. Legal battle Tom Hays, of the Associated Press, reported that Harun confessed to playing a role in the 2003 firefight when he was in Italian custody. There was concern over Harun's sanity, but experts in mental health testified that he had the basic mental competency to stand trial. Nevertheless, he is reported to have insisted he was a \\"warrior\\", and tried to insist he should be tried in the Guantanamo military commission system. He is reported to have refused to appear in court or discuss his case with his lawyers, because he was not being tried in Guantanamo. His trial lasted two weeks, but it only took his jury two hours to reach their verdict. Law Professor Karen Greenberg, the author of several books on Guantanamo, described Harun's case as significant, as it showed how trials in civilian courts could be successful, in contrast to the long delays, and confusion, when suspects were tried, in Guantanamo military commissions.
