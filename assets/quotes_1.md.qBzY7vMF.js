It is native to many parts of the Americas, but it can be found on many continents and spreads easily to become naturalized. It is well known as a troublesome aquatic noxious weed that invades water ecosystems and can clog waterways. This is perennial herb which grows in moist to wet to flooded areas. The stem can creep over 2 meters long, sometimes branching. It spreads to form mats on the mud, or floats ascending in the water. The leaves are several centimeters long and are borne in alternately arranged clusters along the stem. The flower has 5 to 6 lance-shaped sepals beneath a corolla of 5 or 6 bright yellow petals up to 2.4 centimeters long. The fruit is a hard, cylindrical capsule. Distribution Ludwigia peploides are native almost all over the United States. It lives predominately along east and south west coast. States between Nevada, Washington, Michigan and all states north of New York do have a native species of L. peploides nor are they invasive. A country that is having a serious problem with the L. peploides are the French. It is considered the most invasive alien aquatic plants in France. They have spread all across the country at such alarming rates that it has been assigned to the German Black List of invasive species. Other counties are also wary of this incredibly invasive species so there has been a ban on the trade of L. peploides in France, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium and the UK. These species cause serious problems in area where they have been introduced and a ban on trade will hopefully prevent any further damage. Habitat, ecology and dispersal The genus Ludwigia is present worldwide. There are 23 sections consisting of 82 species in total. They can be both woody, herbaceous and aquatic. They have very high levels of reproduction and efficient dispersal capacity which is a large factor in its amazing ability to take over habitats all across the world. First their reproduction. It is divided into four steps that coincide with the changing seasons. During the spring, new shoots form buds. If in shallow water, it is formed in an erect position, but if in a drained environment, they will adopt a creeping form. The stems will eventually rise to the waters surface and will then form rosettes and small round leaves. The next step occurs over the summer where apical and branches begin to form whether the species formed in an erect or creeping form. After an overall lateral extension of 50 cm flowers can begin to emerge. Between late June to early October, yellow flowers are produced and reproduction can occur. Unfortunately, the sexual reproduction of these plants are relatively unknown due to lack of research and can vary from species to species. In autumn, from August to November fruiting occurs. For the rest of the year, the winter months, the species will break up, dry out and decay but it has been seen that there are cases where it can survive. The reason these plants are scattered all over the globe is because Ludwigia can be generated during all seasons just from fragments of stems or rhizomes. They can be broken as easily by wind, water flow or animals. Lugwigia Peploides have the ability to double their biomass from their broken particles between 15 and 90 days. This also allows this species to continue to thrive in habitat and regions where sexual reproduction cannot occur. The Ludwigia occur predominantly in wetlands and in the transition areas between aquatic and terrestrial environments. As a result of their high plasticity lugwigia can colonize pretty much anywhere in slow flowing waters, river banks and wet meadows. They do prefer slow flowing water over water with a higher velocity. Most Lugwigia species where present in stagnant water, from .06 to 1 metre deep. Great depths became a constraint on their development but shoots were still able to form flower buds. If they are in a low nutrient condition, Ludwigia double their biomass. The only true weakness of this species is intense levels of salinity in the water they inhabit. Morphology Ludwigia peploides is an herbaceous perennial wetland plant usually common along mud or a water surface. L. Peploides sprawl flat along the mud or waters surface. It is very similar to the Ludwigia Hexapetala and very difficult to tell apart. The leaves are arranged in clusters and vary in size. The average leaf is approximately 3.5 inches long and can be egg shaped to lance-shaped. They are hairless and each leaf's base tappers off to a stalk that ranges from 1 to 1.5 inches. The stem can grow as long as 9 feet and can be hairless or slightly hairy but are always have a fleshy texture. Flowers and fruits Ludwigia peploides flowers start from the stem which are floating or lying on the ground. Each flower has five yellow petals 1 to 1.5 cm in length. Each occur on long stalks that on each leaf axils. The fruits and seeds do not have extensive research done so the details are unclear but there are capsules that contain many seeds. Each seed is approximately 1 mm in size. Societal impacts The Ludwigia species cause dense mats which form a perfect protective habitat for mosquitoes. This cause higher rates of the West Nile Virus and other diseases that mosquitoes commonly spread. They are also a serious nuisance for human activity. Leisure activities such as hunting, fishing, and boating can be extremely difficult. Flood risk increases due to the decrease in channel carry capacity. The rapid and uncontrolled growth of water primrose dominates native population and are damaging irrigation and drainage networks of water bodies. Fish can have a hard time moving through these dense Ludwigia populations, which then in turn effect the habitat of surface animals such as birds. Food Luwigia peploides are not commonly ingested. They were traded originally for ornamental purposes. Medicinal Ludwigia peploides are both melliferous and polliniferous. Numerous compounds which have medicinal properties are produced by the Ludwigia species such as saponins, tannins, polyphenols, alkaloids, linoleic acids, flavonoids, starch grains and calcium oxalate crystals. There are also three medical compounds which contribute to antioxidant activities. Lastly, there is a potential for water waste management in agriculture. Because the plant can accumulate high concentrations of nitrogen in can decrease level of ammonia and nitrates in soil. Sadly, all of these are only potential uses of the plant since there has been close to no investigation of its use. Further research is required for their medicinal and agricultural benefits to be harnessed.

CrystaSulf is used in the energy industry as a mid-range process to handle sulfur amounts between 0.1 and 20 tons per day. Below 0.1 tons of sulfur per day is typically managed by H2S Scavengers and applications above 20 tons per day are typically treated with the Amine – Claus process. Process chemistry In the CrystaSulf process, a heavy hydrocarbon liquid is pumped through an absorber where the liquid contacts the gas stream that contains H2S. The H2S is absorbed from the gas stream and the clean gas stream then exits the absorber. The H2S in the liquid where it reacts with sulfur dioxide (SO2) to form elemental sulfur and water according to the following chemical equation. 2 H2S + SO2 → 3 S + 2 H2O The formed elemental sulfur remains dissolved in the hydrocarbon solution. Since the elemental sulfur remains dissolved, there are no solids, i.e., no slurry, in the absorber section of the process. This eliminates plugging problems that have been documented for aqueous redox processes when operated at high pressures. The SO2 that was present in the hydrocarbon solution was added prior to the solution being pumped into the absorber. The SO2 is chemically bound in the solution and readily available to react with H2S. The process is operated with an excess amount of SO2 in the solution so that there will always be sufficient amount for the liquid phase Claus reaction with H2S.  Elemental sulfur removal  After the dissolved elemental sulfur is formed in the hydrocarbon solution, the liquid is piped from the absorber, through a flash vessel if necessary to lower the operating pressure, and then through a crystallizer. The crystallizer reduces the temperature of the solution and solid sulfur is formed which is removed by a filter. After the solid sulfur is removed, the hydrocarbon solution is re-heated to approximately 150 °F and the liquid is then pumped back into the absorber to continue the process of absorbing more H2S and removing it from the gas stream.Energy Processing Canada The hydrocarbon solution has a low corrosion rate.

It is usually used in conjunction with a flow of an inert gas like helium or nitrogen, which prevents the panic, sense of suffocation and struggling before unconsciousness, known as the hypercapnic alarm response caused by the presence of high carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood. This method also makes the direct cause of death difficult to trace if the bag and gas canister are removed before the death is reported. Suicide bags were first used during the 1990s. The method was mainly developed in North America. History Self-administered and assisted suicides by asphyxiation using a plastic bag with helium were first recorded in the 1990s. Since the 2000s, guides have spread on the internet, in print and on video and the frequency of suicides by this method has increased. The suicide bag with inert gas method was originally developed by John Hofsess and the NuTech group, which consisted of Hofsess, Derek Humphry, engineers and physicians. In the book Final Exit by Derek Humphry, a suicide bag was described as a large plastic bag with an adjustable velcro strip around the neck. Its use with inert gases was mentioned in the Supplement to Final Exit in 2000. The pro-euthanasia group Exit Australia distributed a manufactured version of the bag in Australia in 2002, alarming government officials and pro-life groups. The Australian chapter of Right to Life expressed concern that they would be used by vulnerable people. In 2007, The Vancouver Sun cited Russel Ogden, Canadian criminologist and right-to-die advocate, who said that the combination of a suicide bag and helium was \\"a method of choice\\" within the right-to-die movement for people who are terminally ill and that its promotion does not appear to cause an increase in the number of suicides. However, he said that he has no way of knowing if the method was being used by people with terminal illness or by people who are mentally ill. In 2008, Ludwig Minelli, founder of Dignitas, filmed four people committing suicide by helium inhalation. Subsequent to this, the method \\"has been winning supporters both in the USA and in Europe as a reliable, rapid and painless way to die\\". In 2009, Philip Nitschke, founder of voluntary euthanasia organisation Exit International, wrote in a member newsletter that nitrogen has a lower risk of an adverse reaction by the body than helium and is also more available than helium in Australia and New Zealand. Nitschke's organisation sells suicide kits that contain nitrogen tanks and regulators. He promotes the use of nitrogen and suicide bags with lectures and films, such as Doing it with Betty – in which an elderly woman describes how to make a plastic 'exit' bag, and with published materials such as workshop handbooks. Nitschke calls the suicide bag death a \\"hypoxic death\\", and likens it to pneumonia, the \\"old person's friend\\", where hypoxia occurs because pneumonic inflammation stops the lungs extracting sufficient oxygen from the air, and \\"a peaceful death often results\\". In 2015 author and right-to-die advocate Derek Humphry reported that Worthington Industries, the world's largest manufacturer of disposable helium cylinders, had announced that their helium cylinders will guarantee only 80% helium, with up to 20% air, making them inappropriate for use with a suicide bag in Humphry's opinion. Dutch psychiatrist Boudewijn Chabot, in his 2015 book Dignified Dying, calls the suicide bag with inert gas method \\"rapid, painless and safe\\". Legal issues It is not illegal to own a suicide bag in any jurisdiction. Selling suicide bags is prohibited in some places. In 2011, the FBI raided a small mail-order business in California, which shut down afterwards.Federal agents raid California suicide kit seller Yahoo News. In July 2011, this raid caused Oregon to be the first US state to pass legislation prohibiting the sale of kits containing suicide bags or hoods. Canadian right-to-die advocates stopped shipping suicide bags to Australia in 2001, when the Australian government announced that it would review their importation. In 2002, the Queensland Police in Australia said that suicide bags did not violate any laws at that time, and the Australian federal government said it would look into banning them. Exit Australia gave them away to members upon request; they put warning labels on them, called them \\"exit bags\\", and included no instructions for use to circumvent Australian laws against assisting suicide. Mechanism Diagram of a suicide bag; details sourced from the books Final Exit and The Peaceful Pill Handbook A hypoxic, carbon dioxide free metabolically inert gas is provided for inhalation by confining the gas supply and the head in an impermeable bag which prevents contamination with oxygen from the surrounding air, minimising the amount of gas required. (The same effect could be reached by flooding any enclosed space with the gas, but much more gas would be needed, and this would be hazardous to a third party entering the space, an effect which is well known as a cause of industrial fatalities.) Inhalation of oxygen deficient or oxygen free gas not only fails to replenish oxygen used in normal metabolism, but causes the blood passing through the capillaries of the gas exchange regions of the lungs to lose residual oxygen in relation to the concentration difference between the oxygen in the alveolar air and in the blood in the alveolar capillaries. This causes a far quicker drop in blood oxygen level than holding the breath. The deoxygenated blood then passes through the systemic circulation to the vital organs, including the brain, and rapidly lowers oxygen concentrations below the level required to sustain consciousness, and when it is insufficient to keep the heart functioning, cardiac arrest will occur. For the majority of people, an alveolar oxygen tension of less than or 4% by volume at atmospheric pressure is not sufficient to support consciousness. The urge to breathe in normal humans is mainly controlled by blood carbon dioxide concentration and the acidity that it causes. A rise in carbon dioxide concentration caused by the inability to inhale fresh air will cause a strong reflex to breathe, accompanied by increasing distress as the level rises, culminating in panic and desperate struggle for air. However, if the supplied breathing gas is free of carbon dioxide, the blood carbon dioxide levels will remain low while breathing occurs, and there will be no distress or urge to increase breathing rate, as the sensitivity in normal people to blood oxygen level as a breathing stimulus is very low. The effect of contamination of the inert gas by air or other source of oxygen is to reduce the effects of oxygen loss and the person exposed may feel weak, tired and confused, but without a strong urge to breathe or the associated respiratory distress. The efficiency of the system for euthanasia requires minimising contamination by oxygen and carbon dioxide. Small amounts of oxygen will not affect the end result, but may extend the time taken. Short term effects  Helium and nitrogen are non-toxic and can be breathed with no ill effects over short or long term when oxygen levels are sufficient, and present no health risk to third parties except asphyxiation. The danger lies in that they are undetectable by human senses, and the first warning of their presence in asphyxiant concentrations may be loss of consciousness. Lower concentrations may cause confusion and weakness. Use of a suicide bag in a well ventilated room using either of these gases is unlikely to pose a hazard for other people, and there is no fire hazard. Propane, butane and natural gas are to varying degrees narcotic, and are a serious fire and explosion hazard, depending on concentration of the gas and of oxygen. They are usually supplied with strong-smelling additives to provide a warning. These additives may be toxic in large doses, but the concentrations which are needed to indicate the presence of the gas are not dangerous over short terms. The unpleasant smell may be a deterrent to more widespread use as a euthanasia agent, but the primary purpose is a warning of fire hazard. Propane has low toxicity since it is not readily absorbed and is not biologically active. It is heavier than air and may accumulate in low places, particularly if they are poorly ventilated. (2% by volume) Butane is similar to propane, and heavier, and has narcotic effects in large doses. Natural gas is lighter than air and disperses quickly in a well ventilated area. Research Suicides using bags or masks and gases are well documented in the literature. Suicide bags have been used with gases other than inert gases, with varying outcomes. Examples of other gases used are propane-butane, which has narcotic effects, and is commonly adulterated with strong smelling additives to warn of gas leaks, and natural gas. Suicides using a suicide bag and an inert gas produce no characteristic post-mortem macroscopic or microscopic findings. Forensic death investigations of cause and manner of death may be very difficult when people commit suicide in this manner, especially if the apparatus (such as the bag, tank, or tube) is removed by someone after the death. Petechiae, which are often considered a marker of asphyxia, are present in only a small minority of cases (3%). Frost reported that of the two cases he studied that featured death from inert gas asphyxiation using a suicide bag, one had \\"bilateral eyelid petechiae and large amounts of gastric content in the airways and that these findings challenge the assumption that death by this method is painless and without air hunger, as asserted in Final Exit.\\" A review study by Ely and Hirsch (2000) concludes that conjunctival and facial petechiae are the product of purely mechanical vascular phenomena, unrelated to asphyxia or hypoxia, and do not occur unless ligatures were also found around the neck. The authors wrote, There are also documented cases of suicide attempts using the suicide bag that failed. A case report study in 2015 discussed the risks associated with failed attempts using this method. The authors wrote, \\"If the process is interrupted by someone, there is no gas or the tube slips out of the bag, there is a high risk of severe hypoxia of the central nervous system\\" (in survivors). Brain cells are very sensitive to reduced oxygen levels. Once deprived of oxygen they will begin to die off within five minutes.Richmond, T. S. (May 1997). \\"Cerebral Resuscitation after Global Brain Ischemia\\", AACN Clinical Issues 8 (2). Retrieved on 2007-04-13. Free full text If hypoxia results in coma, the length of unconsciousness is often indicative of long-term damage. In some cases coma can give the brain an opportunity to heal and regenerate, but, in general, the longer a coma, the greater the likelihood that the person will remain in a vegetative state until death. Bioethics Russel Ogden (2002) said that the existence of \\"how-to\\" literature involving the suicide bag has been \\"shown to influence the choice of suicide method but not the overall suicide rate, and that an emerging counterculture of death providers, operating outside of the traditional medicolegal framework of health care, was placing assisted death outside the normative gaze of medicine\\". In 2010, Ogden and colleagues observed four cases of assisted suicide with helium delivered by face mask. The authors stated that a hood method might be able to play a role in \\"demedicalising assisted suicide\\". Ogden views a bag and inert gas as \\"the quickest way to go; used properly, you're unconscious after the second breath and dead in about 10 minutes\\". Clinical psychologist Phillip Kleespies said that Ogden's work calls attention to some of the risks associated with covert assisted suicide using unregulated methods like the suicide bag with inert gas. He does not dispute that the method is \\"swift, highly lethal and painless\\", as claimed by Ogden and other right-to-die proponents. However Kleespies feels it is an undignified, impersonal and \\"hurried\\" manner of death, which may be used by people who have not had the opportunity for appropriate counseling and that this is largely a result of more dignified methods being made illegal. He concludes by expressing the hope that with improved and more appropriate care during the dying phase of life, there will be less perceived need for these methods of self-deliverance. A study poses the dilemma for medical ethicists and the general public who \\"may also want to carefully weigh the unintended adverse consequences of widely disseminated suicide methods likely to appeal to some depressed persons (irrespective of their physical health status or age) against the putative benefits associated with making these methods more widely known and available\\". Characteristics of users Promoters of this suicide method recommend it to terminally ill patients. However, across the world, most people who use suicide bags are physically healthy. Instead of having incurable cancer or other life- threatening physical diseases, most of the users have psychiatric disorders or substance abuse problems that might possibly be addressed through medical and psychological treatment. The demographics of its users varies; in one survey, the method had been used mostly by middle-aged adults in failing health, who were attracted to the relative nonviolence of the method. This suicide method is also typically used by younger or middle-aged adults, rather than by older adults. In the US, it is more commonly chosen by non-Hispanic white males than by women or people of other races.

A number of these settlements were Dacian and Thracian, but some were Celtic, Greek, Roman, Paeonian, or Persian. A number of cities in Dacia and Thrace were built on or close to the sites of preexisting Dacian or Thracian settlements. Some settlements in this list may have a double entry, such as the Paeonian Astibo and Latin Astibus. It is believed that Thracians did not build true cities even if they were named as such; the largest Thracian settlements were large villages.The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC by John Boardman, I.

Strabo translated -bria as polis, but that may not be accurate.The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC by John Boardman, I. E. S. Edwards, E. Sollberger, and N. G. L. Hammond, , 1992, page 612: \\"According to Strabo (vii.6.1cf.st.Byz.446.15) the Thracian -bria word meant polis but it is an inaccurate translation.\\" Thracian -disza, -diza, and -dizos are derived from Proto-Indo-European *dheigh-, \\"to knead clay\\", hence to \\"make bricks\\", \\"build walls\\", \\"wall\\", \\"walls\\", and so on. These Thracian lexical items show a satemization of PIE *gh-. Cognates include Ancient Greek teichos (\\"wall, fort, fortified town\\", as in the town of Didymoteicho) and Avestan da?za (\\"wall\\"). It is suggested that the \\"dava\\" endings are from the Dacian language, while the rest from the Thracian language. However \\"dava\\" towns can be found as south as Sandanski and Plovdiv. Some \\"dava\\" toponyms contain the same linguistic features as \\"diza\\" toponyms, e.g. Pirodiza and Pirodava. The first written mention of the name \\"Dacians\\" is in Roman sources. Strabo specified that the Daci are the Getae, identified as a Thracian tribe. The Dacians, Getae and their kings were always considered as Thracians by the ancients (Dio Cassius, Trogus Pompeius, Appian, Strabo, Herodotus and Pliny the Elder) and were said to speak the same language. The Dacian language is considered a variety of the Thracian language.Peregrine, Peter N.; Ember, Melvin (2001). Encyclopedia of Prehistory. 4 : Europe. Springer. . Such lexical differentiation -dava vs. para, would be hardly enough evidence to separate Dacian from Thracian, thus they are classified as dialects.Polomé, Edgar Charles (1982). \\"20e\\".

Vol. 3, Part 1: The Prehistory of the Balkans; and the Middle East and the Aegean world, tenth to eighth centuries B.C. (2nd ed.). London: Cambridge University Press. . It is also possible that '-dava' and '-bria' mean two different things in the same language, rather than meaning the same thing in two different languages. Thus bria could have been used for urbanized settlements, similar in scale and design to those of the \\"civilised\\" peoples like Greeks and Romans, whereas '-dava' could mean a settlement which is rural, being situated in the steppe- like part of the Thracian lands. * Abydos * Acidava (Acidaua), a fortress town close to the Danube, located in today's Piatra-Olt, Olt County, Romania * Acmonia * Abdera * Acatapara * Aedava (Aedeva, Aedabe, Aedeba or Aedadeba), placed by Procopius on the Danubian road between Augustae and Variana, in Moesia (the present Northern Bulgaria) * Aedeva, modern Pernik * Agatapara * Ahypara * Aiadava (Aiadaba or Aeadaba, *Procopii Caesariensis opera omnia.

To suppress the rebelliousness that had taken hold of the troops, Cosingas built a number of long ladders, and fastened them one to another. He then put out a report, that he had decided to climb up to heaven, in order to inform Hera of the disobedience of the Thracians. The Thracians, who are notoriously stupid and ridiculous, were terrified by the idea of their general's intended journey, and the resulting wrath of heaven. They implored him not to carry out his plan, and they promised with an oath to obey all of his future commands. chieftain and priest of Hera to the tribes of Cebrenii and Sucaeboae *Getas, kingThe Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z.

Cosingas, according to the tradition of the country, was elected to be their priest and general; but the army took some objection to him, and refused to obey him. To suppress the rebelliousness that had taken hold of the troops, Cosingas built a number of long ladders, and fastened them one to another. He then put out a report, that he had decided to climb up to heaven, in order to inform Hera of the disobedience of the Thracians. The Thracians, who are notoriously stupid and ridiculous, were terrified by the idea of their general's intended journey, and the resulting wrath of heaven. They implored him not to carry out his plan, and they promised with an oath to obey all of his future commands. *CoelaletaeThe Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC by John Boardman, I.

First appearing in the 6th century bc, the Getae were subjected to Scythian influence and were known as expert mounted archers and devotees of the deity Zalmoxis. Although the daughter of their king became the wife of Philip II of Macedon in 342 BC, the Macedonians under Philip II’s son Alexander crossed the Danube and burned the Getic capital seven years later. Getic technology was influenced by that of the invading Celts in the 4th and 3rd centuries bc. Under Burebistas (fl. 1st century BC), the Getae and nearby Dacians formed a powerful but short-lived state. By the middle of the following century, when the Romans had gained control over the lower Danube region, thousands of Getae were displaced, and, not long thereafter, references to the Getae disappeared from history. Later writers wrongly gave the name Getae to the Goths. The Getae and Dacians were closely related; some historians even suggest that these were names applied to a single people by different observers or at different times.

The festival has been going for years and has always been organised by volunteers, under community ownership. The Blue Mountains is New South Wales' first City of the Arts and Katoomba is the heart of that city. On Winter Magic weekend artists, musicians, dancers, drummers, choirs and community take over one of Australia's most famous towns. During the event, the main street of Katoomba is closed to motor traffic and open to pedestrian traffic. This allows the main street to become a performance space. The streets are lined with market stalls, available spaces are converted to music and performance stages, and everybody who attends is encouraged to dress in costume. Katoomba Winter Magic has a strong local focus and very wide general appeal. In 2018 the festival went into hiatus after organisers concluded the festival could not continue in its current form.Jennie Curtin, 'No Winter Magic for this year', _Blue Mountains Gazette_ , 8 February 2018, https://www.bluemountainsgazette.com.au/story/5216113/winter-magic-update- cancelled-for-this-year/, accessed 2 May 2018..

The core specialisations of the Action Division are sabotage, destruction of materiel, assassination, detaining/kidnapping, interrogation with and without using torture, infiltration/exfiltration of persons into/from hostile territory and hostage rescue. The division also fulfils other security-related roles including testing the security of strategic sites, for example nuclear power plants and military facilities such as the submarine base of the Île Longue, Bretagne. Within the Action Division there are three separate groups, CPES for clandestine agents, CPIS for clandestine commandos, and CPEOM for clandestine combat divers. The division's headquarters are located at the fort of Noisy-le-Sec. It replaced the Service Action of the SDECE in 1971.  Organisation  The current action division originated from the SDECE's action service (Service Action or SA. Service Action is still commonly used). The action division has a \\"pool\\" of paramilitary operatives coming mainly from the French Army, often at least from the paras, and some from special forces. Since the early 1980s, the service action has been divided into three main parts: commandos, combat divers and air support. The commandos were originally chunked in the \\"11e Choc\\" (11e Bataillon Parachutiste de Choc, 11th Shock Parachutist Battalion, later 11th Shock Parachutist Demi-Brigade), created in 1946. The 11e Choc was disbanded in 1963 because its officers were suspected to be French Algeria supporters. Consequently, its missions were partly given to military special forces units, especially the 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment. After the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985, the \\"11e Choc\\" was re-raised in 1985 as the 11th Shock Parachutist Regiment. The unit was disbanded in 1993 among other various changes of French armed forces following the end of the cold war. DGSE operatives are since based in three \\"training centres\\" which compose the Centre d'Instruction des Réservistes Parachutistes (CIRP, \\"Paratrooper Reservist Instruction Centre\\"): * The Centre Parachutiste d'Entraînement Spécialisé (CPES, \\"Paratrooper Specialised Training Centre\\") in Cercottes for clandestine operations * The Centre Parachutiste d'Instruction Spécialisée (CPIS, \\"Paratrooper Specialised Instruction Centre\\") in Perpignan for special commandos. The CPIS is the successor of the Centre d'entraînement à la Guerre Spéciale (CEGS, \\"Training Centre for Special Warfare\\") * The Centre Parachutiste d'Entraînement aux Opérations Maritimes (CPEOM, \\"Paratrooper Training Centre for Maritime Operations\\") in Quelern, which instructs combat divers. The CPEOM is the successor of the Centre d'Instruction des Nageurs de Combat d'Aspretto. Commando Hubert originally included servicemen from both French Navy and Army. The unit soon split in two, the army soldiers being transferred to the Centre d'Instruction des Nageurs de Combat (CINC, Combat Divers Training Centre, nicknamed Ajax) assigned to \\"11e Choc\\". In the aftermath of the disastrous Rainbow Warrior affair, the CINC was officially disbanded, and the DGSE combat divers were transferred in the CPEOM. Commando Hubert remains as the combat diver component of the French naval special operation forces, the Commandos Marine. The air support of DGSE operations is provided by a French Air Force unit, the Groupe Aérien Mixte 00.056 (GAM 56) \\"Vaucluse\\", heir of a Free French Forces special duties flight.Le GAM 56 sur le site du ministère de la Défense This unit received the Croix de la Valeur Militaire with bronze palms on 1 June 2012, for having \\"particularly distinguished itself in a number of very sensitive recent engagements\\".

Dorling's father was a bookseller in Epsom, and Henry was apprenticed to a printer, returning to Epsom in 1834 to join his father's business, where he printed race cards for the course before becoming the first Clerk of the Course in 1840. In 1845 he leased the Grandstand for £1,000 per annum from the Epsom Grand Stand Association, which had been running it at a loss. He moved his printing operation into the basement of the stand, laid out a new racecourse in 1847, and extended the stand. Dorling married his first wife, Emily, before returning to Epsom in 1834, and after her death he married widow Elizabeth Mayson (née Jerram) in 1843. He had two sons and two daughters by his late wife Emily, and she had three daughters (the eldest being Isabella, the future Mrs Beeton) and a son by her late husband Benjamin Mayson. They went on to have a further thirteen children. At one stage this large family lived most of the year in the Grandstand at Epsom Racecourse, along with Elizabeth's mother, Dorling's mother-in-law, \\"Granny Jerram\\" to the children, the children being sent away to Brighton on race days. Elizabeth died in 1871 and was the first person to be buried in the new municipal cemetery in Epsom: while an ordinary grave space would have cost one pound eleven shillings and six pence, Dorling paid seven pounds, seven shillings and six pence for his wife's burial space. The National Portrait Gallery has a watercolour painting The children of Benjamin and Elizabeth Mayson, 1848, which is \\"attributed to Henry Dorling\\"; these children would have been his stepchildren, the future Mrs Beeton and her siblings. By 1851 Dorling's father William had retired and Dorling moved his household to Ormonde House in the High Street, Epsom, where he ran a bookshop and lending library. At the time of his death in 1873 Dorling's home was Stroud Green House in Croydon, the site of which is now Ashburton Park. In his will, Dorling left \\"20 fully paid- up £20 shares in the Epsom Grand Stand Association\\" to each of his sons, Henry Mayson Dorling and Edward Jonathan Dorling, and money to these sons, his other children, his daughters-in-law and his stepdaughter, and divided the rest of his property between all his children. The estate was noted as \\"below £80,000\\". Reporting on the proving of the will, The Times noted that The deceased was the well-known clerk of the course at the Epsom race meetings. In the BBC drama The Secret Life of Mrs Beeton, broadcast in 2006, Henry Dorling was played by Jim Carter. Dorling Drive, a street built in 1961 in Ewell, near Epsom, was named to commemorate Dorling.

It is also referred to as the Board of Transport and Transport Office. History It existed between 1690 and 1724, and again between 1794 and 1817 and was initially a subsidiary board of the Navy Board. In 1818 its functions were merged into the Board of Admiralty. It originated in the need to transport the British Army to Ireland in 1689 to meet the Jacobite invasion of Ireland. The responsibility for the transportation was given to a board, later named the Commission for Transportation. In time the commission assumed responsibility for transportation to all areas, not just Ireland. In 1724 the commission was disbanded and other Admiralty boards and several departments of the War Office assumed its functions. This arrangement did not work well. 1794 to 1817 The division of responsibilities and abuses that followed led to the creation of another Transport Board in 1794, which was one of three boards — Navy, Victualling, and Transportation — that then ran the Royal Navy until 1817. The Transportation Board centralized and unified the function of military transportation overseas. The Army, therefore, had to arrange all movement by sea through the Transport Board. The establishment in 1794 of the board reflected experience gained in the War of American Independence. A strong supporter was Sir Charles Middleton (later Lord Barham), the former Controller of the Navy. The Transport Board assumed responsibility for the care of prisoners of war on 22 December 1799 from the Sick and Hurt Commissioners, and in 1806 the Transport Board had taken over the business of the Sick and Hurt Board. In its Transport Service role, the board was responsible for “the hiring and appropriating of Ships and Vessels for the conveyance of Troops and Baggage, Victualling, Ordnance, Barrack, Commissariat, Naval and Military Stores of all kinds, Convicts and Stores to New South Wales and a variety of miscellaneous services such as the provision of Stores and a great variety of Articles for the Military Department in Canada and many Articles of Stores for the Cape of Good Hope and other Stations”.Parliamentary Papers, 1806 - Reports of the Commissioners Appointed by Parliament to Enquire into the Fees, Gratuities, and Emoluments, which are, or have been lately Received in the Several Public Offices therein Mentioned – Ninth Report. The board maintained resident agents at British ports and at those foreign ports that transports frequented. The board also employed agents who travelled with the transports. The transport agents represented the first quasi-professional specialization among commissioned officers. N. A. M. Rodger. (2005) The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain, 1649-1815. (W. W. Norton), p. 384. The transport agents were uniformed Navy officers under the employ of the Transport Board, but not being sea officers, were not subject to naval discipline. Their job was to control and organize merchant ships that the government had chartered. To assist them in their duties, agents had a staff consisting of a purser, boatswain, gunner, and carpenter, all appointed by warrant and on Navy pay. Hired vessels with a transport agent (always a Royal Navy Lieutenant but termed a Commander) aboard flew a blue ensign and a \\"plain blue common pendant\\" and could exercise authority over smaller transports that carried no Agent. In the case of a large convoys, one vessel would carry a \\"Principal Agent\\" (Commander or Captain RN) with a \\"Blue Broad Pendant\\" at the main-top- mast head. In the absence of a naval escort, the Principal Agent was in charge of the convoy. 1817 to 1862 In 1817, the Transport Board was abolished and its duties being divided between the Navy Board, which set up its own Transport Branch, and the Victualling Board, which took over the medical commissioner as well as setting up its own Transport Service. When the Navy and Victualling Boards were abolished in 1832 transport duties were assigned to the Victualling Department. Then in 1861 a select Committee of the House of Commons that contained both Navy and Army officers, recommended unanimously the formation of a separate and distinct Transport Office under the sole control of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty \\"To carry out transport of every kind required by our government to any part of our coast and to all our colonies and possessions, including India\\". In 1862 the responsibility for the provision of transportation was divided and a separate Director of Transports appointed who headed a new Transport Department.

He was the 14th Emir of Kano from the Fulani Sullubawa clan, ascending the throne on 8 June 2014, following the death of his grand uncle Ado Bayero. He was dethroned on 9 March 2020 by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. Prior to his accession, Sanusi was an economist and banker. He served as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria from 2009 to 2014, when he was suspended by President Goodluck Jonathan after raising the alarm on the US$20 billion NNPC scandal. Family Sanusi was born on 31 July 1961 in Kano to a ruling class Fulani family of the Sullubawa clan. His father, Aminu Sanusi, was a career diplomat who served as the Nigerian Ambassador to Belgium, China and Canada, and later served as the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was also the Chiroma of Kano and son of Muhammadu Sanusi I, who was the 11th Emir of Kano from 1953 to 1963, when he was deposed by his cousin Sir Ahmadu Bello. Education Sanusi received early Islamic education at home, where he learnt the Qur'an, Islamic jurisprudence and the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad. He then attended St. Annes Primary School, a Catholic boarding school in Kakuri, Kaduna. In 1973, Sanusi was admitted into King's College, Lagos, where he graduated in 1977. He then proceeded to Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics in 1981. After graduating, he spent a year undergoing his National Youth Service in Gongola State (now Adamawa and Taraba) as a teacher in a girls boarding school in Yola. He then returned to the university where he received a masters degree in economics in 1983, and lectured at the faculty for two years. Sanusi later received a degree in Sharia and Islamic studies from the International University of Africa in Khartoum in 1997. At the university, he studied in Arabic the works of prominent Western thinkers and Islamic authorities including Plato, Aristotle, Al-Ghazali, Ibn Rushd, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Khaldun, amongst others, and was also exposed to the four Sunni madhhabs of Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali. Early career In 1985, Sanusi began his banking career when he was hired by Icon Limited (a subsidiary of Barings Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust) – as a merchant banker before later becoming head of financial services and manager of the office in Kano. He left the bank in 1991, when he travelled to Sudan, to pursue studies in Arabic and Islamic law at the International University of Africa in Khartoum. In 1997, he returned to Nigeria and joined the United Bank for Africa working in the credit and risk management division – he rose through the ranks to the position of general manager. In 2005, Sanusi became a board member and executive director in charge of risk management at First Bank of Nigeria – Nigeria's oldest bank, and one of Africa's largest financial institutions. In January 2009, Sanusi became the chief executive officer, becoming the first northern Nigerian to head the bank. On 1 June 2009, Sanusi was nominated as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria by President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua; his appointment was confirmed by the Nigerian Senate on 3 June 2009, during the global financial crisis. Sanusi in Davos at the 2013 World Economic Forum In Nigeria, the effect of the crisis took a hit at the economy and the banking system, with the stock market collapsing by nearly 70%. It was amidst this crisis that Sanusi led the central bank in rescuing top tier banks with over ₦600 billion of public money, dismissing and imprisoning chief executives who had mismanaged customer deposits – and strictly dealing with banks found responsible for financial crimes. Sanusi attributed the crash in the capital markets to \\"financial illiteracy\\" on the part of Nigerian investors. He also introduced a consolidation process which reduced the number of Nigerian banks through merger and acquisitions, in a bid to make them stronger and more accountable to depositors. He also led efforts in increasing the level of investment in infrastructure and support for small and medium enterprises. Sanusi's tenure initiated several extensive banking reforms termed the \\"Sanusi Tsunami\\". The reforms were built around four pillars: enhancing the quality of banks, establishing financial stability, enabling healthy financial sector evolution and ensuring the financial sector contributes to the real economy. Sanusi developed the cashless policy – whereby financial transactions are not conducted with money in the form of physical banknotes or coins, but rather through the transfer of digital information (usually an electronic representation of money) between the transacting parties; he also introduced and supported the establishment of Islamic banking in Nigeria, a move which was criticized by the Christian Association of Nigeria. He also clashed with the National Assembly, over it's budgetary spending of 25% of all government revenue; and rejected the International Monetary Fund insistence for a currency devaluation. He also advised the government on the removal of the fuel subsidy, which he argued engendered a culture of high level corruption and economic inefficiency – the removal of the subsidy was unpopular and led to the Occupy Nigeria movement, which called for his resignation. His reforms received both criticism and appraisal from the industry. The Banker magazine recognised him as the 2010 Central Bank Governor of the Year, for his reforms and leading a radical anti-corruption campaign in the sector – the first of its kind during the financial crisis. Sanusi is widely recognized for pacifying the overtly corrupt banking industry and his contribution to a risk management culture in Nigerian banking. Sanusi has spoken at a number of international events including the 2013 World Economic Forum. Warwick Economics Summit 2012 Programme In December 2013, Sanusi in a leaked letter to President Goodluck Jonathan revealed that the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) failed to remit US$48.9 billion of government oil revenue to the central bank – the NNPC has a history of financial irregularities and oversees the corrupt petroleum industry in Nigeria. In February 2014, after a series of public investigations and raising the alarm on the US$20 billion NNPC scandal, Sanusi was suspended as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria by President Goodluck Jonathan. In April 2014, he won a court case against the federal government, after he was detained and his international passport confiscated by the State Security Service. Accession On 6 June 2014, Emir Ado Bayero who reigned as Emir of Kano for over five decades died, and a succession crisis loomed amongst the royal family. On 8 June 2014, Sanusi a grandson of former Emir Muhammadu Sanusi I; and holder of the traditional title of Dan Majen Kano (Son of Emir-Maje) emerged as the new Emir of Kano. His accession led to widespread protests from supporters of Sanusi Ado Bayero the Chiroman Kano (Crown Prince) and son of the late Emir Ado Bayero, with allegations that Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso interfered with the king-making process.  Emir of Kano  Emir Sanusi at the Durbar in 2017 On 8 June 2014, Sanusi was selected to succeed his granduncle, Ado Bayero, as the Emir of Kano. His enthronement was controversial, with some believing that it was a politically-motivated move to avoid corruption charges from his tenure at the central bank. Many expected Bayero's son to succeed him as The Emir, and protested Sanusi's appointment.\\"Sanusi' Coronation As Emir: Schools Shut In Kano\\", PM News, 9 June 2014.

Sanusi replied that he is \\"safe with Allah\\", and likened Shekau's extremist comments (describing Sufis as unbelievers) to those of the heretical Islamic preacher Maitatsine.Ibrahim Shuaibu (21 December 2014),\\"I’m Safe with Allah, Emir Sanusi Replies Boko Haram\\" , This Day Live. During Sanusi's six-year reign, The Emir reinvented himself as a charismatic figure at the crossroads of tradition and modernity. Major developments, such as the drafting of a new Muslim family law, construction of a 40,000 books library and vernacular modernization of the 15th century palace took place; and the Durbar festival was promoted internationally. Tourism to heritage sites such as the ancient Dala Hill and Gidan Makama increased and was encouraged by Sanusi. The Emir also played a role in revamping the ancient city's cultural objects including in clothing where he advocated for the revival of the moribund 14th century dye pits at Kofar Mata – and through his own style and drapery projected the craftsmanship of the city's leading guilds. Sanusi also spoke out on government policies, breaking with royal tradition. He criticised the government of misplaced priorities. In 2017, the emirate council was under investigation for financial irregularities. Many saw this as retribution over comments he made against the state government. The investigation was later called off by the state legislature following intervention by the ruling class. In 2019, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje signed into law the creation of four new emirates; Bichi, Rano, Gaya and Karaye. This unprecedented move saw the partitioning of Sanusi's traditional domain as Emir. According to the law, out of the 44 local government areas in the state, Sanusi as Emir of Kano will preside over just 10 local government areas; with the remainder carved up amongst the new emirates. In March 2020, the state legislature launched a new investigation against The Emir for violation of \\"traditional practices\\", this was coming after a high court ruling restraining the corruption investigation against Sanusi.  Dethronement  On 9 March 2020, Sanusi was dethroned by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. Sanusi was in his private residence in Gidan Rumfa when he learnt of his removal, while awaiting for state officials to formally serve him the deposition letter a contingent of police, military,and security operatives stormed the palace. Sanusi later accepted his dethronement as a divine act and urged his supporters to remain calm and avoid bloodshed. He also urged them to declare bay'ah to his successor Aminu Ado Bayero, and stated “It is a thing of pride that made us to rule and end in the same fashion as the Khalifa,” in reference to his grandfather Muhammadu Sanusi I, who was also deposed and exiled in 1963.  Exile  Sanusi was later informed of his exile from Kano to Nasarawa State. Initially wanting to serve his exile in Lagos with his family, his request was denied and was later escorted out of the palace under heavy guard to a military air base. His lawyers subsequently announced they are going to challenge his arbitrary exile in court. Sanusi was then flown to Abuja, en-route to Loko in Nassarawa. On 10 March, he was relocated from Loko via police helicopter to Awe a remote local government area in the state. On 13 March, a Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the release of Sanusi, he subsequently left Awe together with Governor Nasir El Rufai, after leading Friday prayers in full regalia to Lagos.  Engagements  Since his dethronement in March 2020, Sanusi has stated he has \\"moved on\\" and will not challenge the dethronement. One day after his dethronement, Sanusi received two appointments from his childhood friend Governor Nasir El- Rufai in Kaduna State; he was appointed Vice Chairman of the Board of Kaduna Investment Promotion Agency and Chancellor of the Kaduna State University. He has stated his intention of focusing on his private, humanitarian and intellectual engagements, which include: *Independent Non-Executive Director, MTN Group *United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Advocate * Chairman of Babban Gona, a private agricultural initiative helping rural farmers * Chairman of Black Rhino, a Sub-Saharan Africa infrastructure fund of The Blackstone Group * Chairman of the Advisory Board of 1 Million Teachers, a non-governmental education organization Sanusi is scheduled to proceed on a one-year academic fellowship at the University of Oxford's African Studies Centre from October 2020, where he plans to author a book about his as tenure as central bank governor during the global financial crisis. He has ruled out the possibility of entry into politics,and has expressed his plans to go back into academics and author two other books: on a collection of his articles from 1999 to 2005; and on Muslim law and cultural practices in Northern Nigeria. Views Sanusi has over the years debated and authored a member of papers articulating his views on: Islam, culture, political economy and governance. He has been criticised by conservatives in Northern Nigeria for making several comments on socio-political issues impacting the region. He has called for an end to child marriage, women empowerment, building more schools instead of mosques, and infrastructural development. Sanusi has called for population planning, and has said that polygamy is increasing poverty in the region. Sanusi has also advocated for family planning to solve the almajiri issue. Sharia He has contributed to the debate about Sharia in Nigeria. Sanusi's position has two underlying themes: Islam is concerned with delivering justice and should not be a tool for self-seeking political agendas, and the Wahhabist rhetoric of fundamentalists counters genuine Muslim interests. He explains that Sharia is not divine but religious, and is neither uniform nor unchanging. He has criticized the treatment of women in society in his paper, Shariah and the Woman Question. And has also described his views on non-Muslims in his paper, Non-Muslims in a Contemporary Islamic State – \\"It is no addition to the body of knowledge to assert that the Islamic State guarantees non-muslim citizens (Ahl-al-Dhimmah) civil rights in exchange for the protection tax (Jizya)\\". He has argued that although the collection of zakat is a state responsibility, it may be the responsibility of the Federal government rather than the Emirs of Northern Nigeria. Sanusi has adopted the mainstream position that zakat is an instrument for redistributing income, arguing in favour of giving the role of redistribution to the government. Culture Sanusi has called for a cultural revival in Northern Nigeria. In his works he has described his views regarding the alleged Fulani cultural hegemony, and is a supporter of Nigeria's unity in diversity. Sanusi has criticized the post colonial mentality of maintaining English as an official language stating \\"If you take Kano, for 600-700 years the official language was Arabic. We had British colonialism for 60 years, and today the official language in Nigeria is English. Arabic is not an official language\\". He has also spoken out for the need to revive the Trans-Saharan trade stating that \\"The Sahel was a major part of global commerce; it was the transit point of trade from Asia to the Atlantic and to Europe. The cities of the Sahel – Timbuktu, Gao, Kano, Agadez – were the richest cities in Africa before the steamship, before colonialism. Many of the countries in the Sahel are part of a great Arab Islamic civilisation – the official language of communication was Arabic.\\" Sanusi has also defended his views on Islam and modernity – and has opposed the external influence on Islam in Africa, \\"Wahhabism and Salafism have a certain intolerance in common with groups such as Boko Haram. Islam in Africa has its own schools of thought, its ancient empires and its own history. And we have no need for Saudi Arabia and Iran to explain Islam to us.\\"  Politics  Sanusi believes that fundamental constitutional amendments are required to address misgovernance in Nigeria. He has raised questions on Nigeria's extremely-high cost of governance and opposes having a full time bicameral legislature, 36 states with governors and deputies, and thousands of government aides. He has also called for an overhaul of the Nigerian Civil Service, describing it as inefficient and over bloated. Since 2013, Sanusi has ruled out participating in Nigerian politics and seeking elective office stating in a BBC HARDTalk interview \\"I cannot survive in Nigerian politics\\". He has said “our duty as Muslims is to learn from the ideals of Prophet Muhammad to save the society from eminent danger that is facing it\\" – with regards to the damaging effect of unprincipled politics on the society.  Economy  Sanusi favors deep economic structural reforms and a more \\"interventionist, directional economic policy\\" to be implemented in Nigeria. He has also called for the diversification of the economy away from oil, and has also criticized financialization for creating a \\"fake economy\\" and not having sufficient impact on the real economy. He has also supported the use of state-owned banks and development finance as a catalyst for industrialization. On bank ownerships he is of the view that \\"The owners and managers of banks, the rich borrowers and their clients in the political establishment are one and the same class of people protecting their interest, and trampling underneath their feet the interest of the poor with impunity\\". On his introduction of Islamic banking to Nigeria, he elaborated his view that Islamic finance is a resilient alternative; stating “Islamic banking, if well harnessed, would ensure large numbers of people are economically independent”, he also noted in the past proponents of interest-free banking included Aristotle, Adam Smith, and Alfred Marshall. Corruption As central bank governor, he led a radical anti-corruption campaign, dismissing Cecilia Ibru and other powerful bank heads who had mismanaged customer deposits, and (in the case of two senior bankers) imprisoned. According to Sanusi, there was no choice but to attack the powerful and interrelated vested interests who were exploiting the financial system. Sanusi has spoken out against the fuel subsidy – he cites the high level of corruption and the inefficiency of subsidizing consumption instead of production (leading to slower economic growth), and the fact that the government borrows money to finance the subsidy—taxing future generations so present Nigerians can consume more fuel. Sanusi revealed that Nigeria lost a billion dollars a month to diversion of funds under the Jonathan administration. The PBS segment quoted American and British officials that former petroleum minister Diezani Alison-Madueke might have organized a diversion of $6 billion (₦1.2 trillion) from the Nigerian treasury.Alison-Madueke said Sanusi made the allegations due to her refusal to get him appointed as President of the African Development Bank, which Sanusi rejected. In 2015, Alison-Madueke was arrested in London. Sanusi has criticised Buhari's anti-corruption war, arguing that his administration's foreign exchange policy is creating a nouveau riche class and promoting the rentier economy.

Issue  Sanusi has four wives and thirteen children, five sons and eight daughters.  Ancestors   Patrilineal descent  Sanusi's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations, which means that Sanusi is a member of the Dabo dynasty. ;Royal House of Kano Descent is traced back patrilineally to Ibrahim Dabo #Ibrahim Dabo dan Mahmudu (ruled 1819-1846) #Usman I Maje Ringim dan Dabo (ruled 1846-1855) #Abdullahi Maje Karofi dan Dabo (ruled 1855-1883) #Muhammadu Bello dan Dabo (ruled 1883-1893) #Muhammadu Tukur dan Bello (ruled 1893-1894) #Aliyu Babba dan Maje Karofi (ruled 1894-1903) #Muhammad Abbass Dan Maje Karofi (ruled 1903-1919) #Usman II dan Maje Karofi (ruled 1919-1926) #Abdullahi Bayero Dan Abbas (ruled 1926-1953) #Muhammadu Sanusi I Dan Bayero (ruled 1954-1963) #Muhammad Inuwa Dan Abbas (ruled 1963 - he served for 3 months only) #Ado Bayero Dan Abdu Bayero (ruled 1963-2014) #Muhammadu Sanusi II (ruled 2014-2020) #Ado Bayero II (2020 -present) References External links *2017 Ibrahim Forum *BBC HARDtalk - Sanusi Lamido Sanusi *Davos 2013 - Emerging Economies at a Crossroads *AfDB Debate: Improving domestic resource mobilisation to finance industrialisation *Keynote: Nigeria between the Past and the Future: Culture, Governance and Development, SOAS *Overcoming the fear of vested interest: Sanusi Lamido at TEDxYouth@Maitama\\", TEDxYouth, 17 August 2013. *Lamido Sanusi: Nigeria's Financial Challenges and Opportunities interview with Stanford Graduate School of Business Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Ahmadu Bello University alumni Category:Central bankers Category:Commanders of the Order of the Niger Category:Dethroned monarchs Category:Emirs of Kano Category:Governors of the Central Bank of Nigeria Category:International University of Africa alumni Category:King's College, Lagos alumni Category:Nigerian academics Category:Nigerian bankers Category:Nigerian Fula people Category:Nigerian Muslims Category:Nigerian Sufi religious leaders Category:Nigerian traditional rulers ","title":"Sanusi Lamido Sanusi"},{"id":"24130959","text":"Fyodor Viktorovich Dobronravov () is a Soviet and Russian stage and cinema actor,Добронравов получил приз имени Гайдая на фестивале «Амурская осень» Honored Artist of Russia (2002), People's Artist of Russia (2011).Почётное звание присвоено Указом Президента РФ от 21.03.2011№ 336 He is an actor, known for Kadetstvo (TV series 2006 - 2007), Playing the Victim (film) (2006) and The end of the Belle Époque (2015).

He was a contemporary of John Smart, George Engleheart, Richard Cosway and William Wood. Family and home Crosse was born on 24 April 1742 in Knowle, in the parish of Cullompton, Devon; to parents John and Mary Crosse. His father was a lawyer, and his family were members of the landed gentry. Crosse was, like one of his sisters, completely deaf and never able to speak. He had at least six siblings. Crosse fell in love with his cousin, Sarah Cobley, but she was already engaged to Benjamin Haydon - and it appears that he was deeply affected by his disappointment, leaving Crosse heartbroken. He is said to have felt the pain of this unrequited love for the rest of his life, and never married. Crosse lived and worked in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London from 1760. His brother kept house and acted as liaison between Crosse and his clients. Crosse retired to Wells in the late 1790s, and lived with Miss Cobley’s brother. Crosse met Sarah Cobley again in 1807, when she decided to visit her brother after she learned she was suffering from a fatal illness. She arrived unexpectedly, and her brother was not able to get Crosse out of the house beforehand. On seeing Sarah after so many years, Crosse rushed up to her and embraced her with strong emotion. She died the next day. Crosse died in May 1810, at his old family home in Knowle. Professional career Crosse began painting as a hobby, as was the fashion amongst the gentry. At the age of 16 he won a premium at the newly created 'Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce' (the Society of Arts) in London. He then moved to London and, like Richard Cosway and John Smart, he studied at the new drawing school of William Shipley, the founder of the Society of Arts. He also studied at the Duke of Richmond’s Gallery. Crosse exhibited his work at the new London societies: at the Society of Artists 1760–1796, the Free Society 1761–1766, and the Royal Academy 1770–1796. He lived and worked in Henrietta Street, in Covent Garden, London from 1760. His brother acted as intermediary between Crosse and his clients. Basil Long in his book \\"British Miniaturists\\" (1929) regarded Crosse as a very accurate draughtsman who painted without hesitation or retouching and who will one day receive recognition for his sound, if modest, work. Despite not being able to hear or speak, Crosse was very successful, and was highly regarded by his distinguished clientele. His clients included the Prince of Wales, and the Dukes of Cumberland and Gloucester. He painted his works mainly with watercolour on ivory; he also executed a few miniatures in enamel, a difficult and not always successful medium; as well as painting portraits in oil. Many of his portrait miniatures are small in size, being less than 2 inches in height. The miniaturists of the period 1760–1780 were still learning to paint on ivory, as it has a greasy surface which is difficult to paint with watercolour. Rather than attempt to paint on large surfaces, many portrait miniaturists from this period used ivories of only 1½ to 2 inches in height. Ivory was used for miniatures, as it gives a beautiful luminosity to the skin tones of the sitter's face. During the 1780s and 1790s Crosse did use some large sized ivories of 3.5 inches or more in height. His fees started at around 8 guineas for small works, and rose up to 30 guineas for his largest portraits. Crosse's work is refined, and in the best examples the sitters really look as if they could walk right out of the frame, they are so lifelike. Crosse’s miniatures often seem to be dominated by a shade of greenish-blue, maybe influenced by the early work of Joshua Reynolds. His works tend to have a greenish-blue hue to them, and his red pigments have faded a little over the years. He seldom signed his work. The fashion of the time was for women to increasingly wear their hair high on their head, and often it was powdered. It is interesting to see how Crosse manages to fit a head and shoulders portrait of a lady with stacked hair on to such a small piece of ivory. Men generally wore their hair ‘en queue’, pulled back into a ponytail tied with a black ribbon; often they wore powdered wigs over their hair, or powdered their hair directly. Crosse, as a member of the landed gentry, possessed a private income; he also earned quite a considerable sum from his portraiture. He invested his money wisely in property and stocks and shares, and received a good income from these investments in his later years. He retired from commercial painting in the late 1790s, and died in 1810.

Life  Charlotte Amalie of Denmark. Portrait by Johann Salomon Wahl. Charlotte Amalie never married. In 1725, she was placed on the list of 99 princesses regarded as suitable for marriage with Louis XV of France (which would require that she convert to Catholicism), but she was removed from the list because Denmark was an arch enemy toward Sweden, the traditional ally of France, and that such a marriage could potentially disturb the French-Swedish alliance.Edmond et Jules de Goncourt: La duchesse de Châteauroux et ses soeurs, Paris, 1906 In the early 1730s, her brother the king tried to arrange a marriage between her and Frederick, Prince of Wales, but the negotiations did not succeed and she remained unmarried. As was the custom for unmarried princesses, she lived with her mother until her mother's death, and then with her stepmother. In contrast to her brother and sister-in- law, she had a good relationship with her stepmother, Anna Sophie Reventlow. Charlotte Amalie tried to prevent the worst hostility toward her stepmother at court. She was separated from Anna Sophie when her brother succeeded to the throne in 1730. After this, she lived at the royal court in winters, and at Charlottenlund Palace in summer with her own court. Charlotte Amalie was described by her contemporaries as a lovable character with the ability to keep the peace with most: she had a good relationship with her father and stepmother, and still managed to have a good relationship also with her brother, who hated his own father and stepmother. She had no influence upon the affairs of state, and lived a peaceful life at court her entire life. On 8 April 1771, she was ordered to leave court. She spent the rest of her life with her nephew's widow, the queen dowager Juliana Maria. This meant that she continued to spend much of her time at court, when the queen dowager attended it: Juliana Maria became de facto regent in 1772. As she preferred black wigs, she had ordered her staff to wear them, and her court became known as \\"The court of the black wigs\\".Charlottas, Hedvig Elisabeth (1902) [1775–1782].

After twelve years with the department, he was made deputy head of the department in 2008 as it was merged into the broader spectrum of the department for International Relations. In 2010, with the downsizing of the American Studies department as part of a wider shakeup of the humanities at Swansea, Bilton has recently begun a move to the English department, in which he will teach literature and creative writing modules while still doing occasional American Studies modules in cinema and contemporary American fiction. However, with the future of the American Studies department still uncertain, there is every possibility that Bilton will continue to moonlight as a lecturer and marker for the department. Among the writers Bilton teaches in his Contemporary American Fiction class are Cormac McCarthy, Douglas Coupland, Paul Auster, Junot Diaz, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Jennifer Egan.  The Sleepwalker's Ball  Bilton's debut novel, The Sleepwalkers' Ball, was officially be launched on 29 April 2009 at the smallest cinema in Wales, La Charrette at the Gower Heritage Centre, Park Mill. Readings from the book were accompanied by two silent Buster Keaton films: The High Sign and Sherlock Junior. DM Thomas, author of The White Hotel, said of the novel: \\"Alan Bilton's artfully- interwoven narratives, part zany city guide, part silent film, creative an imaginative whole which is poetic, inventive, surprising and pulsating with life\\".https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0955527260/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-page The plot of the novel consists of \\"...four inter-connected stories, all set in the same strangely black and white Scottish town, and these stories graduallyhttp://www.ylolfa.com/alc-newpage-sleepwalkers-ball-twenty- questions.php link up to tell a tragic-comic tale of lost love and the perils of dreaming.\\" Bilton describes the novel thus: \\"turn [ing] my own experiences into a kind of painting or a silent film or a poem...for me the town [in the novel] is Stirling in central Scotland where I was a student for four years and where an awful lot happened to me – falling in love, discovering art, movies, books – discovering the world really. And all this autobiographical stuff provides the real emotional colouring of the book.\\"http://www.ylolfa.com/alc-newpage-sleepwalkers-ball-twenty-questions.php  The Known and Unknown Sea  Following the publication of The Sleepwalker's Ball, Bilton's attention turned to ideas for a follow up. However, work on the novel was delayed while he worked towards completing Constantly Moving Happiness Machines: Silent Film Comedy & American Culture, an academic non- fiction book on \\"silent film comedy with chapters on all the key figures – Chaplin, Keaton, Fatty Arbuckle, Harry Langdon, Mabel Normand – connecting slapstick comedy to American culture in the 1920s, especially consumerism, mass consumption and the idea of Hollywood as the dream factory.\\"http://www.ylolfa.com/alc-newpage-sleepwalkers-ball-twenty- questions.php However, by late August 2009, he was \\"20,000 words into the first draft\\" of his second novel. Limited details about the novel have emerged, including the title and some basic information about the plot, with its protagonist being a remarkably intelligent and precocious young child, and the novel being set in a mysterious coastal town opposite an island obscured in mist, from which no visitors have ever returned. There is currently no definite information regarding the novel's publication.  Influences  Bilton largely draws upon the influence of silent film (\\"When I was little I loved Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, and then later on I discovered Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd and I adored them all.\\"http://www.ylolfa.com/alc-newpage-sleepwalkers-ball-twenty- questions.php), Eastern European fiction and DM Thomas. However, when asked whether his academic work on American fiction feeds into his own fiction writing, and indeed whether he read much contemporary British fiction, he stated: > \\"I'm very, very fortunate these days to teach the things I like, so I guess > I'm drawn to books and films that touch upon the things which mean the most > to me. But I have written and studied all sorts of different things. My PhD > thesis, for example, was on Don DeLillo, a writer who I think I have nothing > in common with at all...The embarrassing truth is that I don't actually read > much British fiction. I love Kazuo Ishiguro for his voice...Oh, and the > much-maligned D.M. Thomas deserves some credit too, for The White Hotel and > Freud and the idea of writing books that only deal with poetic intensity > without all the mechanics of so-called believable realistic writing. But > really, American and European sources inform the book much more than British > ones. I unconsciously stole the idea of our hero unable to find his own home > in 'Our Grand Tour' from Paul Auster's New York Trilogy and all the laundry > and the spectral, ghostlike figures wandering the streets comes straight > from Gogol. But film was just as important to the book – and silent film in > particular.\\" http://www.ylolfa.com/alc-newpage-sleepwalkers-ball-twenty-questions.php  Bibliography  * An Introduction to Contemporary American Fiction (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press) US edition: (2003, New York: New York University Press). * The American 1920s: Literary sources and Documents, Vol One: The Cultural Condition, Vol Two: Voices of Modernity, Vol Three: An Age of Performance (2004,Co-editor with Philip Melling, Robertsbridge: Helm Information). * The Sleepwalkers’ Ball (2009, Aberystwyth: Alcemi) debut novel * Constantly Moving Happiness Machines: Silent Film Comedy & American Culture (Forthcoming; about silent film comedy in America) * The Known and Unknown Sea (Forthcoming second novel)  References  Category:Academics of Swansea University Category:People from York Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Stirling Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester Category:21st-century British novelists Category:British male novelists Category:21st-century British male writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Alan Bilton"},{"id":"24131066","text":"Arms Academy was a public school located in Shelburne, Massachusetts, United States.

Following her marriage to Ernest Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen, she became Duchess of Saxe- Hildburghausen.  Biography  Princess Louise as a child Miniature of the princess inspired by a portrait painted around the time of her marriage Louise was described by foreign diplomats as a lively person, not well suited to the rigid and religious court of her parents. The relations between her and her parents were not good because of their differing personalities. She disliked the strict customs at court; her father complained about her \\"rebellious nature\\" in a letter to his friend Count Christian Günther Stolberg. Louise's name is recorded to have played a major role in the delicate diplomatic game that was driven in Christian VI's final years. Scandal and marriage Initially attentions were drawn to get her married soon with George II of Great Britain's younger son, the Duke of Cumberland but this plan were abandoned following Christian VI's attempt to make her Queen of Sweden during the election of the heir to the vacant Swedish throne in 1742–43 through an engagement with the Prince of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld who acted as France's candidate or the prince of Mecklenburg who were also considered as a suitable option. However, none of these plans came to fruition, amidst the tension between the Danish-Norwegian state and Sweden, Holstein-Gottorp's candidate Adolf Frederick got elected King in 1743 by the Swedish Riksdag, it was a serious topic that a marriage between her and Adolf Frederick would be conducive to an alliance between the two kingdoms, but it was stranded on Christian VI's unwise unwillingness to see his daughter married to a Gottorpian prince. Under her brother Frederick V's reign in 1749, Louise had an affair—and possibly a child—with a valet de chambre from the noble Danish family Ahlefeldt, who was afterwards sentenced to imprisonment for his audacity in Munkholm Fortress. Later that year, she was hastily married to Ernest Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen, with a large dowry to hasten the wedding and calm down the scandal. They married in the Hirschholm Palace, north of Copenhagen, on 1 October 1749. Duchess of Saxe- Hildburghausen As duchess of Saxe-Hildburghausen, she hosted a court known for its formal etiquette, great costs and many parties; she was described as proud and with \\"royal expenses\\" in her way of living, amusing herself with ballets, masquerades, balls, hunting and gambling, driving through the streets with a carriage (or, in winters, with a sleigh) of gold and silver. In December 1755 she gave birth to a daughter, who died after a month: Princess Frederica Sophie Juliane Caroline (5 December 1755 – 10 January 1756). Louise died on 8 August 1756.

He was a right-handed opening batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler. He was part of the NatWest Trophy winning team of 1983. Career Born 6 September 1954 in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, Slocombe was educated at Millfield School, Slocombe was part of the Somerset Second XI team at the age of 14. He made his first-class debut against Sussex in May 1975, scoring 61 not out batting at number seven. In only his third County Championship match for Somerset, he made his maiden century while playing against Gloucestershire. A further century while opening the second innings against Nottinghamshire helped him become Somerset's first batsman to score 1,000 runs in his first full season. Slocombe's strong performances in his debut season saw him included in DH Robins' XI tour of South Africa in 1976 that included Fred Titmus and was captained by David Lloyd. He played twice, against Western Province and Eastern Province, but only scored 27 runs. He was also part of the Marylebone Cricket Club team that was devastated by the bowling of Paddy Clift during the 1976 season opener against County Champions Leicestershire. By the third game of the 1976 County Championship season, Slocombe was opening the batting with Brian Rose. He continued to open the batting for the majority of his career, forging a lasting partnership with Rose. He found it difficult to replicate his success of the 1975 season, only achieving 1,000 runs in a season once more in 1978.

Beginnings and World War II The company was founded by Samuel Elliott in 1870 as a joinery works, Elliott's Moulding and Joinery Company Ltd. It produced ammunition boxes during the First World War made by a workforce composed 90% of women. It changed to furniture production after the war. In the Second World War, once more a largely female workforce produced components for aircraft, including the Supermarine Spitfire, Tiger Moth, De Havilland Mosquito, Airspeed Oxford and Airspeed Horsa glider. Elliotts built about one third of the total Horsa production and it was also responsible for a powered version of the General Aircraft Hamilcar glider. The Olympia EoN Olympia glider being bungy-launched At the end of the war, the firm had hoped to resume furniture manufacture but in those times of austerity this was not allowed by the Board of Trade. The company therefore planned to continue with aircraft production. Its first product was the Elliotts Newbury Eon four-seat light aircraft. However the company had also been asked in 1945 by Chilton Aircraft Ltd to make one set of wings for the Chilton Olympia, a glider that was a copy of the DFS Olympia Meise. To maintain employment, Elliotts retained the right to the wing jigs they had made. On completion of the prototype's wings, Elliotts refused to sell the wing jigs to Chilton. One of Chilton's founders, Andrew Dalrymple, was killed in a crash of a Fi Storch on 25 December 1945 near Hungerford, and this event soon ended aircraft production. After the death of Dalrymple an agreement was reached to sell production rights, fuselage jigs and all the work in hand on the redesigned Olympia to Elliotts. The Chilton prototype was eventually declared un-airworthy in 1970 and destroyed. Production of the EoN Olympia commenced in 1946 as a batch of 100, and the first flight was made in January 1947. Elliot's went on to build 150 Olympias. Other aircraft projects The Olympia was followed in 1948 by the production of two further German-designed gliders, the Grunau Baby 2b known as the Baby EoN and the SG 38 Schulgleiter primary glider known as the Primary EoN. Elliotts and its design consultants Aviation & Engineering Products Ltd made improvements to each of the designs before starting production. The prototype of the Newbury Eon light aircraft made its first flight in August 1947. Aviation & Engineering Projects Ltd also worked with Elliotts on an abortive side-by-side trainer project, the Eon T.16/48, derived from the four seater but no further aircraft were produced. However the company acted as a sub-contractor making parts for other aircraft. The Primary flew in 1948 and 80 had been built when production ceased in 1958. Later Olympias After building three marks of the Olympia, another improved version, called the EoN Olympia 4. The only Olympia 401 ever made was built in 1959 (G-APSI, now BGA2372), and this was followed by the 402 in 1956, the 403 in 1957, and in 1958 by the Open Class EoN Type 6 Olympia 419 and the EoN Olympia 415 for the 15-metre FAI Standard Class. The 415 did not go into production, and only eight 419s were built. The EoN Olympia 460 was built in 1961 as a completely new Standard Class glider. The Olympia 460 was meant to be a world beating standard class glider. However the prototype was overweight against its design weight, and at low speeds suffered a marked buffet from the wing roots and aft of the canopy. Horace Buckingham decided on a lower aspect ratio, despite opposition from the designer, Harry Midwood, and the chief test pilot, David Ince. The less competitive Olympia 463 became the production model in 1963. It also had a wider fuselage at the front. Elliotts built 5 460s and 48 463s. A special version of the 460 series called the EoN Olympia 465, was developed for the 1965 World Gliding Championships. Closure In the summer of 1965 the managing director of Elliotts, Horace Buckingham, died. The company reviewed its business and decided that glider production was unprofitable. Slingsby Sailplanes Ltd agreed to take over the production of EoN sailplanes in 1966, but no Elliott designed glider was ever built by Slingsby, though spares were supplied and repairs were undertaken. Elliotts closed in 1974. The factory was demolished in the late 1970s to make way for Bayer's UK headquarters.

It is a cubic graph with diameter 8, radius 7, chromatic number 2 and chromatic index 3. Its girth is 10 and there are exactly 168 cycles of length 10 in it. There are also 168 cycles of length 12. Construction The Ljubljana graph is Hamiltonian and can be constructed from the LCF notation : [47, -23, -31, 39, 25, -21, -31, -41, 25, 15, 29, -41, -19, 15, -49, 33, 39, -35, -21, 17, -33, 49, 41, 31, -15, -29, 41, 31, -15, -25, 21, 31, -51, -25, 23, 9, -17, 51, 35, -29, 21, -51, -39, 33, -9, -51, 51, -47, -33, 19, 51, -21, 29, 21, -31, -39]2. The Ljubljana graph is the Levi graph of the Ljubljana configuration, a quadrangle-free configuration with 56 lines and 56 points. In this configuration, each line contains exactly 3 points, each point belongs to exactly 3 lines and any two lines intersect in at most one point. Algebraic properties The automorphism group of the Ljubljana graph is a group of order 168. It acts transitively on the edges the graph but not on its vertices : there are symmetries taking every edge to any other edge, but not taking every vertex to any other vertex. Therefore, the Ljubljana graph is a semi-symmetric graph, the third smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graph after the Gray graph on 54 vertices and the Iofinova-Ivanov graph on 110 vertices.Marston Conder, Aleksander Malnič, Dragan Marušič and Primž Potočnik. \\"A census of semisymmetric cubic graphs on up to 768 vertices.\\" Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics: An International Journal.

The Tainoceratina rearranges the precedented Tainocerataceae while excluding the ancestral Rutoceratidae. Three families, the Tainoceratidae, Tetragonoceratidae, and Rhiphaeoceratidae are in common with the Tainocerataeae, but with somewhat different meaning and content. Six additional families used in the Tainoceratina, the Actubonautilidae, Encoiloceratidae, Gzheloceratidae, Mosquoceratidae, Pleuronautilidae, and Temnocheilidae result from mixing genera from this family and that and redefining established families. None of these latter six are in common usage today. The Encoiloceratidae, Gzheloceratidae, Mosquoceratidae, and Pleuronautilidae are found in the Tainoceratidae; the Temnocheilidae in the Koninckioceratidae, and the Actubonautilidae in the Rhiphaeoceratidae. According to Kümmel (1964) the Pleuronautilidae might be considered a subfamily within the Tainoceratidae, which would include, Encoiloceras, the only genus in the Encoiloceratidae. The Tainoceratina differs conceptually from the Tainocerataceae in that the Tetragonoceratidae is the ancestral family, derived from the Rutocerida rather than being an offshoot from the Rutoceratidae and that the various families included within are combined in unique superfamilies.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Cobalt, Ontario. Background Flower- class corvettes like Cobalt serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Cobalt was ordered 1 February 1940 as part of the 1939–1940 Flower-class shipbuilding program from Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. in Port Arthur, Ontario. She was laid down on 1 April 1940 and launched 17 August later that year. Cobalt was commissioned at Port Arthur on 25 November 1940, however Cobalt was taken to Halifax in advance of completion to beat the St. Lawrence freeze-up, arriving 24 December. In mid-November Cobalt was sent to Liverpool, Nova Scotia for three months' refit. During the second of two other extensive refits at Liverpool from April to 20 July 1944 her fo'c'sle was lengthened. Wartime service Cobalt was completed early in January 1941. On 22 January 1941 she took part in the Canadian Navy's first secret trial of diffused lighting camouflage, a technology for concealing ships from submarines at night. She worked up and joined Halifax Force, but left on 23 May 1941 with the six other corvettes that were the nucleus of the new Newfoundland Escort Force (NEF). For the next six months she operated as an ocean escort between St. John's and Iceland. HMCS Cobalt leaving Iceland Following completion of her first refit, Cobalt made two round trips to Derry before being assigned in May 1942 to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF), with which she was to spend the balance of the war. During her time with WLEF she served with escort groups EG W-6 from June 1943; with W-5 from April 1944; and with W-7 from February 1945. She finished the war with group W-7. Post-war service Cobalt was paid off at Sorel, Quebec on 17 June 1945 and subsequently sold for conversion to a whale- catcher, entering service in 1953 as the Dutch Johanna W. Vinke. On 31 December 1961 she suffered a boiler explosion while whaling, and was declared a constructive total loss. She was broken up at Cape Town beginning on 6 June 1963 by South African Metal & Machinery Pty Ltd. References Bibliography * Macpherson, K.; Burgess, J.

It is an international initiative to draw attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity. Its objective is to highlight the growing cost of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation and to draw together expertise from the fields of science, economics and policy to enable practical actions. TEEB aims to assess, communicate and mainstream the urgency of actions through its five deliverables--D0: science and economic foundations, policy costs and costs of inaction, D1: policy opportunities for national and international policy-makers, D2: decision support for local administrators, D3: business risks, opportunities and metrics and D4: citizen and consumer ownership. One motive for the study was to establish an objective global standard basis for natural capital accounting. Estimates establish the cost of biodiversity and ecosystem damage expected to cost 18% of global economic output by 2050 and currently at over US$2T (for the largest 3000 companies according to Trucost), with some estimates as high as US$6T/year. The World Bank in particular has led recent efforts to include the cost of biodiversity and climate harm in national accounts. Its sponsors declared TEEB to be a \\"major international initiative to draw attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity, to highlight the growing costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, and to draw together expertise from the fields of science, economics and policy to enable practical actions moving forward.\\" In October 2010 it released its report \\"Mainstreaming the Economics of Nature: a synthesis of the approach, conclusions and recommendations of TEEB\\" and launched the Bank of Natural Capital to communicate its findings to the general public. History The TEEB study was launched by Germany and the European Commission in response to a proposal by the G8+5 Environment Ministers in Potsdam, Germany in 2007, to develop a global study on the economics of biodiversity loss. The second phase of the TEEB study is hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) with support from a number of organizations, including the European Commission, German Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety and the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Pavan Sukhdev, a senior banker from Deutsche Bank, and founder-director of the green accounting project GIST (Green Indian States Trust) in India. The TEEB Advisory Board includes experts from the fields of science and economics. The TEEB Interim Report was released in May 2008 under Phase I. The report provided evidence for significant global and local economic losses and human welfare impacts due to the ongoing losses of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems. It focused largely on forests and looked at the extent of losses of natural capital taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation. TEEB estimates that this is US$2–4.5 trillion per year, every year. Phase II of the study set out to expand on the work begun in Phase I. It was completed in 2010 and presented in Nagoya, Japan, at the 10th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in October 2010. The final volumes of TEEB are being published by Earthscan.Earthscan The first volume published in October 2010: The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity: Ecological and Economic Foundations.

(2001). \\"The current biodiversity extinction event: Scenarios for mitigation and recovery\\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (98):11, 5466–5470.Scholes, R.J. and Biggs, R. (2005). \\"A biodiversity intactness index\\". Nature 434, 45–49 TEEB indicates that pressure on commodity and food prices shows the consequences of this loss to society. TEEB recommends that urgent remedial action is essential because species loss and ecosystem degradation are inextricably linked to human well-being. Economic growth and the conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural production are forecasted to continue, but TEEB feels that it is essential to ensure that such development takes proper account of the real value of natural ecosystems. This is central to both economic and environmental management. The findings of TEEB (Interim Report) were largely in three areas--the economic size and welfare impact of losses of ecosystems and biodiversity, the strong links between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem health on the one hand and poverty elimination and the achievement of Millennium Development Goals on the other, and the ethical choices involved in selecting a social discount rate for discounting the benefits of ecosystems and biodiversity. Main findings * 11% of the natural areas remaining in 2000 could be lost, chiefly as a result of conversion for agriculture, the expansion of infrastructure, and climate change. * Almost 40% of the land currently under low-impact forms of agriculture could be converted to intensive agricultural use, with further biodiversity losses. * It is estimated that for an annual investment of US$45 billion into protected areas alone, the delivery of ecosystem services worth some US$5 trillion a year could be secured. TEEB finds that sound ecosystem and biodiversity management, and the inclusion of natural capital in governmental and business accounting can start to redress inaction and reduce the cost of future losses. Phase II TEEB Phase II, currently underway, takes an economic approach that is spatially specific and builds on knowledge of how ecosystems function and deliver services. It examines how ecosystems and their associated services are likely to respond to particular policy actions. A fundamental focus of TEEB is on developing an economic yardstick that is more effective than GDP for assessing the performance of an economy. TEEB recommends that national accounting systems need to be more inclusive in order to measure the significant human welfare benefits that ecosystems and biodiversity provide. Such systems can help policy makers adopt the right measures and design appropriate financing mechanisms for conservation. In Phase II TEEB aims to: * Integrate ecological and economic knowledge to structure the evaluation of ecosystem services under different scenarios. * Recommend appropriate valuation methodologies for different contexts. * Examine the economic costs of biodiversity decline and the costs and benefits of actions to reduce these losses. * Develop ‘toolkits’ for policy makers at international, regional and local levels to foster sustainable development and better conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity. * Enable easy access to leading information and tools for improved biodiversity practice for the business community--from the perspective of managing risks, addressing opportunities, and measuring impacts. * Raise public awareness of the individual’s impact on biodiversity and ecosystems, and areas where individual action can make a positive difference. Climate issues update TEEB's Climate Update stated that an agreement on funding for forests was a key priority for governments attending the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. An estimated 5 gigatonnes or 15% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed or 'sequestrated' by forests every year, making them the \\"mitigation engine\\" of the natural world. TEEB finds that investing in ecosystem-based measures such as financing Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) can thus assist in combating climate change and can also be a key anti- poverty and adaptation measure. The Update also underlines a 'Coral Reef Emergency' that is already here as a result of the current build-up of greenhouse gases. Scientists contributing to the TEEB process indicate that irreversible damage to coral reefs can occur at atmospheric CO2 concentrations of over 350 parts per million (ppm). This is linked with rising temperatures and ocean acidification. Concentrations are above this threshold and rising. It raises concerns that stabilizing CO2 levels at 450 ppm, or some 16% above the current levels, may condemn this critical, multibillion-dollar ecosystem to extinction and take with it the livelihoods of 500 million people within a matter of decades. Green economy initiative The UNEP's green economy initiative is a project designed to communicate that the greening of economies is not a burden on growth but rather a new engine for growth, employment, and the reduction of persistent global poverty. The green economy report, published in February 2011, used economic analysis and modelling approaches to provide an in-depth assessment of identified economic sectors where \\"greening\\" might lead to prosperity and job creation (i.e. traditional economic growth). This promotes sectors regarded as necessary for a green economy such as: agriculture, buildings, cities, fishery, forests, industry, renewable energy, transport, tourism, waste management, and water as well as the enabling conditions in finance, domestic and international policy architecture. Criticism The approach to valuing ecosystems encapsulated by the TEEB project has been criticized and is open to the same problems as affect all mainstream economic value theories. More specifically the argument is that prices need to be corrected for market failure and simple adjustments can be made to correct the price system so resources will be allocated efficiently. The basis for this recalculation is human preferences for nature, ecosystems, bugs and plants. One critique concerns the irrelevance of human preferences for determining what is ecologically essential for the maintenance of life support systems. Human preferences may be a good guide to choosing ice cream flavors but not the mix of species or gases in the atmosphere necessary to sustain life. Beyond criticism of the actual calculations being used in these TEEB studies and associated work there is the institutional implications. Pavan Sukdev argues for a financial and banking sector response which will 'capture values'. This basically means making profits for those prepared to develop and trade new financial instruments and fund financial initiatives which will trade biodiversity and ecosystem assets as new financial assets. This is seen by some as the hidden agenda of TEEB as it has been backed by financial interests including being headed by a former Deutsche Bank financier. Clive Spash refers to TEEB as \\"terrible economics, ecosystems and banking\\".

It is the ruins of a Romanesque castle with a belt of walls around a central keep with a cistern. History A perspective of the traitors' gate, or \\"Gate of the Frog\\" In the 9th century, Alfonso III of Asturias, donated the settlement of Castro Laboreiro and the castro to Count Hermenegildo, grandfather of Saint Rudesind, for his defeat of the Visigoth King of Hispania, Witiza. During the reign of the Galician count, the castro was adopted as a castle, but would eventually fall into the possession of the Moors. In 1144, Afonso Henriques reconquered the redoubt, and from 1145 his forces began the task of restoring and expanding the defenses: it was Sancho I of Portugal who finally completed the project in the 12th century. The efforts were for not, as the Leonese raised the castle in 1212, during their invasion. In 1290, Denis of Portugal began the reconstruction, with emphasis on defense from its neighbors. For many years Gomes de Abreu, of Merufe, was the alcalde of Laboreiro, and in 1375, King Fernando gave the alcaderia to Estevão Anes Marinho. Following the conquest of Melgaço in the 14th century, King John used Castro Laboreiro to restrain various Castilian incursions from Galicia. In 1441, the alcalde, Martim de Castro, was removed owing to protest from its residents. From the designs of Duarte Darmas, the castle had, around 1506, five rectangular towers surrounding their central keep, which was preceded by the cistern in the north. Another, unidentified, construction was erected to the south. In a surprise attack, Baltazar Pantoja took the castle after four hours of skirmishes in May 1666. He left Governor Pedro Esteves Ricarte in charge of the citadel, until it was retaken by the 3rd Count of Prado, Francisco de Sousa. The King, citing its historical importance, decided to conserve the castle, in a response to his partner Michel Lescole, rather than deactivate it. Following the restoration of peace, in 1715, the castle was decommissioned. From 1746 to 1779, the Governor of Castro Laboreiro was Manuel de Araújo Machado; the Count of Bobadela, then Governor-at-Arms for the Province, ordered the arrest of 400 men and women who had refused to present their children for military service in 1766-1778. In 1801, troops occupied and defended the castle using four military pieces. It has been listed as a National monument since 1944, but the first projects to maintain and restore the castle began in 1979, resulting in the re-pavement of the roadways, the removal of vegetation and landscaping, that continued into the following year. In 2005, the municipal council improved the access to the castle. Architecture The castle is located on an isolated hilltop above the Minho and Lima Rivers. It has an oval plan, oriented north-south, with the remains of the walls erected over cliffs and crags, sometimes zig-zagging, which corresponded to the ancient towers. The principal entrance is the Gate of the Sun () which opens to the east, while the \\"traitors' gate\\", the Gate of the Frog () as it was known, in the north. The east-west courtyard is closed and accessible from a footbridge that was used to gather cattle and property during invasions. It is around these walls that ruins of the ancient cistern remain.

The stage was the longest in the history of the race and it was disputed between the Chinese city of Qingdao and in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Background  In early 1985, master painter and yachtsman Kjell-Rune Magdahl bought an Optimist dinghy for his son Aksel, who had just turned six. The hope was that little Aksel would develop an interest in boats and sailing, just like his dad. But Aksel's interest in boats almost never set sail. He sailed his Optimist at home off Tönsberg on the Oslofjord’s west coast, but at the age of 11, other interests, such as computers and football, took the upper hand. When he was 19, he rekindled his interest in regatta sailing after he completed his military service, not in the navy but with an assault team in the Norwegian cavalry. Aksel studied economics at the BI Norwegian School of Management in Oslo, but his sailing career bloomed, and in 2004 two-time Volvo Ocean Race skipper Knut Frostad brought him on board his ORMA60 trimaran Nokia Academy, winning the Nokia Oops Cup total in their first season together. With Nokia Academy he combined his computer skills and sailing talent to become a full-blood professional racing navigator, and he also managed this project for two of his three years there. It was the same Knut Frostad who, in early 2007, told Aksel that he might be Anders Lewander's and Magnus “Mange” Olsson's first choice as navigator for Ericsson in the Volvo Ocean Race 2008–09. Aksel and Mange went on to lead the underdog team Ericsson 3, and the inexperienced team surprised the sailing world with three consecutive third places in the first three legs of the race after solid offshore sailing and some unusual navigation. He applied new decision-making- and analysis techniques and became established as one of the top offshore navigators in his first try. Outside sailing, Aksel won the regional road cycling championship in Vestfold, Norway in 2011, and is a keen private pilot.

Design and development Elliotts had been asked in 1945 by Chilton Aircraft Ltd to make one set of wings for the Chilton Olympia, a glider that had been developed in pre-war Germany as the DFS Olympia Meise. This had been designed by Hans Jacobs and selected as the glider for the 1940 Summer Olympics. The German drawings were not detailed and so new drawings were made by Chilton which retained the Meise Olympia's aerodynamic shape. The wing redesign resulted in a stronger and heavier (+30 kg) aircraft. To maintain employment at their factory, Elliotts refused to sell the wing jigs that they had made for the prototype. Consequently, Chilton gave up all aircraft work, agreeing to sell to Elliotts the production rights, fuselage jigs, and work in hand on all Olympia gliders. Production of the Olympia (originally called Type 5) started in 1946 as a batch of 100, and the first flight was made in January 1947. Elliotts and their design consultants Aviation & Engineering Products Ltd made improvements to the original design before starting production. Marks 1, 2 and 3 were produced, mainly distinguishable by the landing gear. The Mark 1 had only a skid whereas the Olympia 2 had a built-in main wheel. The Eon Olympia 3's wheel was jettisonable after takeoff. The first batch of 100 was completed in 1947 but the market could not absorb such a large number, despite the low price of £425. Even by 1953, 40 of the first 100 Olympias were still unsold. Nevertheless, a second batch of 50 was built. Gliders from the second batch were still being offered for sale for £800 as late as 1957 in order to clear the stock, despite being below cost price. After building three marks of the Olympia, another improved version, called the EoN Olympia 4 was produced in 1954. This is regarded as being sufficiently different from the original as being a new type. This type in turn led to a succession of variants. Operational history On 24 August 1950 an Eon Olympia flown by Bill Bedford broke the British distance record by flying 310 km in 3:50 hr. On 2 May 1951 Bedford broke his record with a flight of 413 km from Farnborough to Newcastle. Olympias also broke height records on occasions, culminating in a flight by Gordon Rondel on 18 June 1960 in a thunderstorm to 9,321 m (30,580 ft) with gain of height of 8,870 m (29,100 ft), absolute National height and gain of height records.

The name comes from the lute. It is played in most respects like the oud (plucked with a long plectrum). This instrument is known in Albania as \\"lauta\\" and in Romania as \\"lăuta\\".  Construction  Unlike the oud and other short-necked lutes, the laouto has a higher string tension due to its longer neck and hence is brighter in tone than the oud. It also has movable frets to permit the playing of the maqams. The laouto also tends to have only one sound hole (sometimes two) whereas the oud family tend to have three. Due to this, there are many similarities between the laouto and the oud. The soundboard is often made of spruce or cedar wood, while the body is usually made of a harder wood such as maple or walnut. This is a practice consonant with the construction of other (round-backed) lutes. The 11 frets of the neck are removable (and can be re-positioned for differing intervals) and made of nylon (resembling the gut/nylon frets of the lute). Up to 9 wooden frets, mounted on the soundboard, are fixed. The intervals of the frets may be more frequent than that of a guitar to permit the playing of maqams. The strings of the laouto were traditionally of gut, although modern laoutos have also steel (or steel wound nylon) strings similar to those of the bouzouki.  Tuning Except for the first (A4A4) strings, which are tuned in unison, the laouto's other strings are paired, tuned an octave apart. The interval from one pair to the next is tuned in fifths (C3C4-G3G4-D3D4-A4A4). The Laouto has a re-entrant tuning, G3G4 tuned a fourth lower than C3C4. The two primary contemporary variants of the laouto, one somewhat smaller than the other, are to be found on mainland Greece (steriano laouto) and on the island of Crete (Cretan laouto). The larger sized instrument (wider body) is played mainly on the island of Crete and tends to be tuned differently (G2G3 - D2D3 - A2A3 - E3E3), the re-entrant tuning is still a characteristic of the Cretan laouto (or lagouto ()), because D2D3 is a fourth lower than G2G3. In Cyprus, Cypriot laouto is tuned C - G - D - A. The role of the laouto in Greek traditional music is primarily that of accompaniment. The laouto is often played in a duo (the one laouto tuned more bass than the other) with the Cretan lyra or with the violin (in Cyprus).

His parents Kurt Schnellenkamp Nelaimischkies (14 March 1927 - 26 November 2017) and Elisabeth Witthahn Krüger (31 May 1936 - 23 July 2009) were co-founders of Colonia Dignidad. In 1961, they followed the leader Paul Schäfer to Chile in order to establish and grow the colony. Kurt Schnellenkamp is identified as a bodyguard of Adolf Hitler in the documentary Hunting Hitler. The parent’s vast power led to the paradoxical enrolment of the son in the paramilitary sect school Colonia Dignidad where he first received premilitary drill, presided over by the ‘AAG’ (an unofficial nongovernmental alliance of reciprocity, in German ‘Außerstaatliche Allianz auf Gegenseitigkeit’, dissolved in 2000). Schnellenkamp attended a private elite school within Colonia Dignidad, sponsored by the ChilAlRotary, where he studied natural and social sciences, in cooperation with the alliance known as AAG (a German-Chilean spin-off of the HIAG, a lobby group and a denialist veterans' organisation founded by former high-ranking Waffen-SS personnel in West Germany). This, in combination with his secretly written poems and ballads, led to repeated punishment and social isolation within the community.

Jørn Holme (born 16 August 1959) is a Norwegian judge and civil servant. He grew up at Nordberg, and originally wanted to become a priest. He was active in the Norwegian Christian Student Association while studying. He graduated with the cand.jur. degree from the University of Oslo in 1986. He left a job as research assistant there to do his compulsory military service, then work in the police. In 1988 he was hired as a police inspector for Senja, and from 1990 to 1991 he was an acting judge at Trondenes and Oslo District Courts. From 1991 to 2001 he was a public prosecutor in the Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (Økokrim). His work mainly concerned environmental crime. He edited and wrote books during this period, and launched the periodical Miljøkrim. He had short interruptions from this position to be acting presiding judge in Eidsivating in 1993, acting assisting director in the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage in 1997 and acting general prosecutor in the Norwegian Army in 2001. In 2001, when Bondevik's Second Cabinet assumed office, Holme was appointed State Secretary in the Ministry of Justice and the Police. He represented the Liberal Party of Norway. He was recruited by Odd Einar Dørum without any partisan political background. He left politics in 2004 to become the new head of the Norwegian Police Security Service. He succeeded the acting police security director Arnstein Øverkil, who had held office temporarily since Per Sefland resigned the previous year. Holme was the first active politician to be appointed as police security director.

The girls' school in Sweden from the mid 19th century onward was influenced by her methods. Biography Her father was Gustaf Fryxell and mother Catharina Maria Liljegren and her grandfather Jöns Olof Fryxell. She was a relative of the poet and educator Anders Fryxell. Cecilia Fryxell early supported herself as a governess to wealthy families: first to the landowner L M Uggla at Svaneholms manor in Dalsland and thereafter to landowner and courtier Olof Nordenfeldt at Björneborg in Värmland south of Kristinehamn In 1843, she decided to become a missionary after a sermon held by Peter Fjellstedt. Fjellstedt arranged for her to be educated for missionary service at a missionary institute at Basel in Switzerland. However, she was considered unsuitable as a missionary for health reasons. Instead, she studied the boarding schools for girls in Switzerland and Germany in 1843–1847, and was employed as a teacher at Waisenhaus in the Basel Institute. Principal In 1847, she returned to Sweden, and was employed at the Societetsskolan in Gothenburg. In 1848, she opened her first school for girls in Helsingborg with the help of Peter Wieselgren, vicar in Helsingborg. The school had room for 40 students. In 1852, she moved her girls' school to an estate of Count G. Lewenhaupt, Carlslund outside Västerås, where she could house 100 students. However, she wished to have her own building for her school, and in 1858, she was able to buy the manor Rostad outside Kalmar, where her school was housed from 1859 until 1877. Her school at Rostad was entirely her own. She accepted students from all over Sweden, from neighboring nations as well as further afield: she even had some students from North America. 30 of her students lived at the school. These places were in such demand that parents booked places for their daughters for years in advance. The students were divided into three classes as well as one teachers' class. A foreign language was practiced every week, and exercised with the teacher in the afternoon of that week. She herself was the teacher in the subjects History and Christianity. She is not considered to have been innovative in introducing new subjects, but she was recommended for her way of focusing on the personality of her students. She is described as strong and forceful and not tolerant in questions of religion and personal morals, but despite this, the life on her school was described as informal, familial and jolly. In 1877, she donated her school to the state and started an elementary school seminary on the estate. Legacy Cecilia Fryxell had a large influence upon the girls' schools and women's education in mid 19th- century Sweden, when a wave of girls' schools were established all over the country. Many of her students became teachers and founders of girls' schools themselves in other parts of the country, such as Elsa Borg in Gävle, Sophia Posse and Frederique Hammarstedt in Stockholm, Natalia Andersson in Västerås, Maria Henschen in Uppsala and Sigrid Rudebeck in Gothenborg.

Hardy is known for his contributions as a keyboardist for Chic, and his work with acts such as Run-DMC, Madonna and Crystal Waters.  Biography  Hardy was born on April 19, 1964 in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Cherry Hill Junior High School, and started out as a member of the school's marching band (P.S. #180) while growing up in the \\"Projects\\" of Cherry Hill. He joined the band in the seventh grade to keep out of trouble when his brother Gershwin brought home a trombone; he then decided to take music class. His music teacher Mr. Keenan suggested that he play the bass cello. Upon playing the Bass Cello, Nathaniel decided it was to troublesome to carry the cello home for practice and switched over to playing trombone alongside his brother. Nathaniel continued to play the trombone until the ninth grade under the direction on his new music teacher Miss Catherine Snyder. Once while watching neighborhood friends play instruments, he noticed his brother was acting like he was playing an organ his mother had bought, while the other band members were actually performing on his brother's friend Weldon Harris' porch, when they all stopped playing everyone knew that his brother was faking it. That is when Nathaniel decided to learn to how to play the keyboard. He worked numerous jobs saving up money to buy both music and stereo equipment. He taught himself by learning the keys and reading books. In 1980, Nathaniel was approached by a childhood friend Thomas Lee Brown, III, and later a junior high school friend Terrance Balfour (after hearing Nathaniel sing in the Gym shower) to front a local band that he started called \\"Savior Faire\\". The band was signed to RCA Records with Nathaniel fronting as lead vocalist. Nathaniel and Terrance would later write for artist such as Kurtis Blow, Run-D.M.C., and other rap acts from some contacts that Thomas knew in New York. After less than two years with RCA, the band was dropped by RCA for failing to reach 500,000 units in sales and contract disputes. Nathaniel was able to maintain all rights to his music since he was the only one that did not spend any money, when he was able to give back the advance that the record company had fronted him. In 1981, Nathaniel was introduced to Tony Thompson (who was at the time the drummer for the band Chic) at a party when he suggested he would introduce him to both Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. Nathaniel was then invited to join a number of Chic session recordings with Deborah Harry, Carly Simon, and on Madonna's Like a Virgin album, which was considered a re-united Chic, featuring band members Bernard Edwards, Nile Rodgers, Tony Thompson, and Robert Sabino; also while in the U.S. Navy he continued to write music with Bobby Brown, Teddy Riley, The Basement Boys, and Crystal Waters. In late 2008, Nathaniel started using the name The Nathaniel Hardy Project. Selected discography * \\"Sucker M.C.'s\\" – Run-DMC Nathaniel S.

The gameplay is similar to that of Bullshit (card game), but the goal of the game is different enough that the two games are vastly different.  Gameplay   Deck and Deal  Treasure is played with a 20-card deck consisting of the ranks 10 through Ace of a standard Anglo- American playing card deck. After shuffling, two cards, known as the treasure cards are removed from the game face-down, and the remaining 18 cards are dealt out equally between the two players.  Turn Play  Play alternates back and forth between the two players. On a player's turn, he is assigned the card rank one higher than the previous rank played (10s on the first turn and after Aces). He must then play face-down into the center any number of cards that he claims are of that rank, and while playing them states the suit of each. The other player may choose to begin his turn, or he may call \\"bluff\\". When this happens, the cards just played are turned face-up, and if they were the cards the player claimed they were, the player of the cards wins the bluff. Otherwise, the player who called bluff wins it. The loser of the bluff shuffles the cards in his hand, and then hold them face down so that nobody can see them. The winner then takes a penalty pull and selects one card from the hand to look at and then put back. The loser may not know which card was pulled. After this, the loser draws the entire pile into his hand.  Going Out and Winning  When a player believes he knows both of the treasure cards, he attempts to shed his hand. When a player has no cards remaining in his hand, he must guess what the two treasure cards are. After he has done so, the two cards are revealed. If they were the guessed cards, the guessing player wins the game. Otherwise, his opponent does.

Inspired by the Nordic Game Jam, and created by Susan Gold, Ian Schreiber, Gorm Lai and Foaad Khosmood, originally developed under the International Game Developers Association Education SIG to bring together the elements of creativity, collaboration and experimentation. At each site, participants gather to develop ideas, form small groups, create new, creative, innovative games, and present them to their peers and the global community, all in a limited time span. As of 2013, GGJ is managed by Global Game Jam Incorporated. Current and past board directors include the founders Elonka Dunin, Lindsay Grace and Zuraida Buter. In January 2019, GGJ generated teams in 860 sites in 113 countries, who over the course of one weekend created 9,010 games. The Global Game Jam carries a registered trademark.  Participants  Participants in the Global Game Jam are of all skill levels and in various fields. Everyone from professional game developers to educators to artists and designers is welcome to participate. Once the jam begins, participants come up with game ideas, before pitching those ideas to each other and forming teams to work together on a project.Basic Questions. http://www.globalgamejam.org/wiki/basic-questions#ggj Retrieved 2/14/2011.  Event organization  An image from the Global Game Jam in Los Angeles 2015 Groups wishing to host a jam site must fulfill certain requirements. Their location must have Internet access for everyone involved, access to development resources such as an IDE, possibly preinstalled at the location, an event coordinator, beverages and nearby food access, if possible, round- the-clock availability of the location, and security for belongings. At each site, the Global Game Jam runs continuously for 48 hours in each time zone, beginning at 5:00 PM on the start date, and ending at 5:00 PM two days later. The recommended schedule includes a short planning and team creation period, followed by development time until 3:00 PM on the final day. The last few hours are set aside for teams to present their creation to each other. However, sites are not required to follow this schedule. At the beginning of the event participants are given a theme, such as “Extinction” in the 2011 Jam. Participants are asked to create a game that in some way relates to this theme. Additionally, participants are given a list of “achievements”, also referred to as diversifiers. These are designed to drive creative development by adding a unique or limiting factor to their game’s design.  Past events  The first Global Game Jam was held from January 30 – February 1, 2009, at 53 locations across the globe.

Set in 1966, the film chronicles a young woman who is institutionalized after setting fire to a house, and who finds herself haunted by the ghost of a former inmate at the psychiatric ward. The film was shot on location at the Eastern State Hospital in Medical Lake, Washington. Plot In rural Oregon, at the North Bend Psychiatric Hospital in 1966, a young patient named Tammy is killed by an unseen force at night. Kristen (Amber Heard), a troubled young woman, sets fire to an abandoned farmhouse and is arrested. The local police take her to North Bend, where she meets the other patients in the ward: artistic Iris (Lyndsy Fonseca), seductive Sarah (Danielle Panabaker), wild Emily (Mamie Gummer), and child- like Zoey (Laura-Leigh). Kristen is taken to a room previously occupied by their friend, Tammy, and meets therapist, Dr. Stringer (Jared Harris). She reveals that she is unable to recall anything about her past. She is attacked by a horribly-deformed figure that had been staring at her earlier, but upon telling the nurse this, she is drugged and put through intense electroshock therapy. Dr. Stringer uses hypnotherapy to unlock Iris's hidden memories. After the session, Iris is killed by transorbital lobotomy by the deformed figure. Kristen finds Iris' sketch of her attacker with the name 'Alice Hudson', a former patient at the hospital. That night, Kristen and Emily attempt to find Iris and escape. However, Kristen is thwarted by Alice, and loses consciousness while Emily is caught. Sarah is killed by Alice. Kristen discovers that all of the girls had killed Alice together because Alice constantly hurt them. Now she is after the girls for revenge. Kristen tries to talk Emily down from attempting suicide but Alice kills her by slitting her throat with a scalpel. Kristen plans to escape again by holding Zoey as a pretend hostage but is drugged and placed in a straitjacket. She escapes it and she and Zoey try to get out. Zoey is killed by Alice off-screen. After a lengthy chase, Kristen seemingly manages to destroy Alice. She finds Alice's file in Dr. Stringer's office, which has each of the girls' names, including Kristen herself. Dr. Stringer, catching her in his office, reveals that Kristen is actually one of many personalities of the real Alice Hudson, who was kidnapped at age eleven, eight years earlier, and left chained for two months in the basement of the same farmhouse Kristen burned down. In order to survive the trauma, she developed multiple personality disorder, creating each one of the girls from the ward as a different personality. Over time, Alice's own personality became so overwhelmed by the others that she became lost. Dr. Stringer attempted experimental techniques to bring Alice's own personality back, resulting in the manifestation of Ghost Alice, who destroyed the individual personalities one by one. Her treatments were working until 'Kristen' appeared, yet another invention of Alice's mind to protect herself from reliving the trauma at the farmhouse. At the end of the movie, Alice packs a suitcase with her belonging as she prepares to leave the hospital. When she opens the medicine cabinet above her sink, Kristen lunges out at her. Cast *Amber Heard as Kristen, the main protagonist. A girl with no memories of her life but the strong belief that she is not crazy. She feels the constant need to escape the ward no matter the cost. She is the first in noticing the other girls are disappearing and that a vengeful ghost might be the one behind it. *Mamie Gummer as Emily. She is tough and free-spirited but also the one who mostly acts in wild, insane manner, annoys the other patients, and calls everyone crazy, which often starts conflict among girls especially between her and Sarah. Initially, she tries to intimidate and scare Kristen, but eventually, Kristen's strength makes her admire her. She hides a guilty feeling inside her though it seems unlikely she will open to it. *Danielle Panabaker as Sarah, a vain, beautiful redhead and the flirtatious one of the group. She flirts with a male nurse but is turned down because she is a mental patient. She often puts down the other girls through her snobbish and snooty disposition. *Laura-Leigh as Zoey, a girl who has suffered emotional trauma so severe that she keeps acting and dressing like a little girl. She carries around a stuffed rabbit everywhere she goes. She seems oppressed by the others due to her instant trust in Kristen. *Lyndsy Fonseca as Iris, artistically talented and prim and proper, she is the first of the girls in befriending Kristen. She is nice and kind to everyone. She also carries a sketchbook where she likes to draw. She seems to be the most aware of their situation in the ward since she explains to Kristen everything about their seclusion. *Mika Boorem as Alice, a girl who used to be a patient at the ward but is nowhere to be found anymore. Kristen tries to find out what happened to her during her time at the Ward. *Jared Harris as Dr. Stringer, the girls' psychiatrist. He seems hopeful in curing Kristen, though his real intentions seem mysterious the whole time. *Sydney Sweeney as Young Alice, a young girl who Kristen sees in flashbacks, both hands chained in a cellar. Nothing is really explained about her in the beginning. *Dan Anderson as Roy, the chief orderly at the ward. Serious and unpredictable, tries to maintain order inside the ward. He is the main target of Sarah's flirting. *Susanna Burney as Nurse Lundt, the chief nurse at the ward. Tends to consider Kristen a loose end, and constantly tries to act without the authority of Dr. Stringer. *Sali Sayler as Tammy, a girl who disappears from the ward unexpectedly. Her disappearance upsets the other girls. Her empty room is later occupied by Kristen.

Production The film marks a return for Carpenter after a ten-year hiatus of not making any films; his last was the 2001 film Ghosts of Mars. According to Carpenter, \\"I was burned out...I had fallen out of love with cinematic storytelling\\". Despite this, in the meantime he had done two episodes for the anthology TV show Masters of Horror. Carpenter said that the series reminded him of why he fell in love with the craft in the first place. Carpenter said that the script \\"came along at the right time for me\\", and he was particularly fascinated by how the film took place within a single location. The film was shot on location in Spokane, Washington, and at the Eastern State Hospital in Medical Lake, Washington. The film was shot at a real operating mental hospital, and the crew was caged in to prevent patients from intervening. Release The first footage revealed from the film was on French channel Canal+. The film premiered on September 13 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. The Ward was released in the UK on January 21, 2011. After its debut in a handful of film festivals in late 2010, The Ward was released in a few US theatres on July 8, 2011, where it grossed $7,760. The worldwide gross was $5.3 million. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the US on August 16, 2011, and in the UK on October 17, 2011. Reception The Ward received poor reviews. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 33% of 72 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.41/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Lacking the hallmarks of his best work, The Ward proves to be a disappointingly mundane swan song for director John Carpenter.\\" Metacritic rated it 38/100 based on 18 reviews. Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, \\"As usual Carpenter uses the widescreen frame with aplomb, but pic suffers from too little character detailing (even if a late twist explains that), rote scares, and emphasis on a hectic pace over atmosphere.\\" Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"an atmospheric supernatural thriller that has been stripped of the filmmaker's later excesses\\". Tim Grierson of Screen International wrote, \\"Tight as a drum and plenty of fun, John Carpenter's first film in nine years is hardly a groundbreaker, but when the execution is this expert, why complain?\\" Film Journal International wrote, \\"Genre veteran John Carpenter's sleekly professional ghost story is well-acted and directed but sadly derivative. Horror fans have seen it all before.\\" The Guardian's Phelim O'Neill also considered the film to be unoriginal, but nevertheless \\"a well- made film, with some finely crafted shocks\\" Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"continues the painful decline of a director who seems more nostalgic for past glories than excited about new ideas\\". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"feels like a foot- wetting exercise rather than a full-bodied romp in familiar waters\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated it B− and wrote, \\"While he does bring his trademark craftsmanship to this snake-pit mental-asylum thriller, the picture has too many old-movie bits rattling around in it.\\" Adam Nayman of Fangoria wrote, \\"The problem with The Ward is not so much its lack of style as the fact that the director doesn't seem to have much interest in the material\\". David Harley of Bloody Disgusting rated it 1/5 stars and wrote, \\"If someone other than Carpenter had been at the helm of The Ward, then no one would be talking about it.\\" Serena Whitney of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"John Carpenter's The Ward is a mediocre thriller that lacks any true original scares and blatantly rips off a twist ending from a far better film.\\" References Further reading Interviews:    * External links   Category:2010 films Category:2010 horror films Category:2010 independent films Category:2010 psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American independent films Category:Dissociative identity disorder in films Category:English- language films Category:Films shot in Washington (state) Category:Films set in 1966 Category:Films set in Oregon Category:Films set in psychiatric hospitals Category:Films directed by John Carpenter ","title":"The Ward (film)"},{"id":"24131866","text":"David and Jonathan are figures in the Books of Samuel in the Hebrew Bible.

Competing in two Summer Olympics, he earned his best finish of eighth in the C-2 1000 m event at Helsinki in 1952. Prior to the Olympics, Hodgson served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He started painting as a child. Hodgson began working in advertising from 1948 to 1967 but at the same time, experimented as an artist, making watercolours and joining art societies such as the Ontario Society of Artists and Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. By the early 1950s, he was experimenting with abstraction, and was invited to join Painters Eleven. His work is characterized by a large format, in bold colours and strokes of paint. One critic calls him the consummate gestural painter of the Eleven, gutsy and aggressive but finally, lyrical. He thought of abstraction as abstracting a feeling or memory of something rather than a record of nature. From 1968 to 1973, he taught at the Ontario College of Art. Afterwards, he taught at Art\`s Space in Toronto. A native of Toronto, he died in Peterborough of Alzheimer's disease.

The Aagamani songs describe the return of Parvati to her home in rural Bengal, not as Goddess but as daughter, and are followed by Vijaya songs which describe the sorrow of separation three days later as Parvati returns to her husband Shiva. The folklore that give origin to the songs are the mythological stories of Goddess Parvati- daughter of the mighty King of the Himalayas- who marries Lord Shiva. Shiva is described in Hindu mythology as the ageless hermit who is also pauper, and as such personifies the poor husband with little interest in the bonds of family life. One night in autumn, Parvati's mother Goddess Menaka dreamt of her daughter as did Parvati of her mother. Menaka urged her husband to bring Parvati home, even if just for the festival, and Parvati agrees at her father's request to return for the three days of the festival.

The season's finale, \\"Do You Take Dexter Morgan?\\" attracted 1.5 million viewers. Season three was watched by an average of 1.1 million viewers a week. It received largely positive reviews from critics, which ranged from being praised as \\"truly and incredibly exciting television\\" in the San Francisco Chronicle, to \\"lack[ing] the crackling tension the drama had supplied in previous years\\" by the Chicago Tribune; the aggregate site Metacritic scored the season at 78 out of 100 based on 13 reviews. Smits and Hall received Emmy nominations for their roles as Miguel Prado and Dexter Morgan respectively, while the show as a whole also received a Best Drama Emmy nomination. In this season, Dexter kills a man in self-defense and initiates a friendship with the man's brother, Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits). In the meantime, Rita discovers that she is pregnant, and Debra investigates the murders of a new serial killer, called \\"The Skinner\\", hoping to gain a promotion to detective. In addition to Smits, Dexter third season introduces two recurring characters: Desmond Harrington as Det. Joey Quinn, who becomes Debra's partner when he is transferred from the narcotics department to homicide, and Anne Ramsay as Ellen Wolf, a defense attorney whom Miguel detests.  Plot  Rita discovers she is pregnant, informing Dexter that she will keep the baby and raise him with or without his help. He ends up proposing marriage to Rita, which she eventually accepts. While stalking a murderous drug dealer, \\"Freebo\\", Dexter stumbles upon a fight between Freebo and another man, whom he is forced to kill in self-defense. This is the first time Dexter kills someone of whose guilt he wasn't completely sure. This victim turns out to be Oscar Prado, brother of Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), a prominent assistant district attorney and old flame of Lt. LaGuerta. Miguel comes to confide in and trust Dexter after he helps assist with the case. Dexter tracks down Freebo and kills him, but as he leaves he encounters Miguel, who has followed a lead to Freebo's location. Dexter tells Miguel he had discovered Freebo and killed him in self-defense, but instead of reprimanding him, Miguel thanks him and offers to help him cover up the crime. As Dexter and Miguel cooperate to conceal Freebo's true demise from everyone else, the duo end up becoming close friends, as do Rita and Miguel's wife, Sylvia. Miguel feeds Dexter information regarding a killer who continually gets away with it, in hopes Dexter will once again take matters into his own hands. When he discovers that Dexter indeed took such action, he realized what Dexter was doing and encourages him. Miguel hopes they could form a partnership and wants to be more hands-on in the future, with the guidance of Dexter. Trying to discourage Miguel, Dexter proposes a risky operation to free an infamous Aryan Brotherhood leader from prison in order to kill him. Miguel agrees with the idea and the plan succeeds. Dexter starts to recognize Miguel as his first and only true friend, to the point of inviting him to be his best man at his wedding. Debra starts working more seriously to earn her detective shield, and also starts working with a new partner, Joey Quinn. They investigate a serial killer, \\"The Skinner\\", who skins his victims alive. She also starts a relationship with Anton Briggs, one of Quinn's confidential informants. Miguel and Dexter's partnership takes a new step when Miguel offers to be the one to kill their next target. With some reluctance, Dexter agrees, only watching as Miguel kills without hesitation. The next day, Ellen Wolf, a ruthless defense attorney and old courtroom adversary of Miguel's, goes missing, and Dexter discovers that Miguel has killed her alone. Dexter also learns that Miguel has been manipulating him since the beginning. Dexter and Miguel both try to gain leverage over the other, with Dexter leaving Wolf's body to be discovered and investigated, while Miguel starts an investigation into Anton (the key witness to identifying the Skinner) and Deb's relationship. Dexter eventually realizes that Miguel cannot be allowed to run loose any longer, at which point Dexter decides to kill him and make it look like The Skinner did it. Meanwhile, Miguel uses his position to help The Skinner escape police custody in return for his agreeing to kill Dexter. Striving to discover the truth about Wolf's death, LaGuerta ends up obtaining evidence which links Miguel to the crime. Miguel discovers that LaGuerta was investigating him and decides to kill her, but Dexter discovers Miguel's plot and captures him. Before killing Miguel, Dexter confesses to him that he was the one who killed Oscar. After Miguel's body is discovered, he is immediately identified as a victim of The Skinner, just as Dexter planned. Miguel's other brother, Ramon, however, becomes suspicious of Dexter. After pointing a gun at Dexter during a dinner with Rita, he is taken into custody. During a visit to him in jail, Dexter helps Ramon put his demons to rest. On the night before his wedding, Dexter is captured by The Skinner, but breaks free by taking advantage of a moment when the Skinner is distracted, shattering his hand in the process. After a short but vicious fight, Dexter snaps The Skinner's neck and makes it look like suicide by dumping his body in front of a moving police car. Dexter gets his broken hand put in a cast and attends his wedding.  Cast   Main cast  * Michael C. Hall as Dexter Morgan * Julie Benz as Rita Bennett * Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan * C.S.

The show's writers convened during February and March 2009 to brainstorm ideas for the fourth season, and filming was scheduled to begin in June 2009. On May 27, 2009, Showtime announced that John Lithgow would guest star in all 12 episodes as Miami's latest and deadliest serial killer, and Keith Carradine would return as Lundy. The fourth season premiered on September 27, 2009, and focused on Dexter attempting to find his way to balance his family life, the birth of his son, and his \\"extra- curricular\\" activities. The season received critical acclaim before airing, including that from Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly, who saw the fourth season as being \\"bloody promising\\". The season opener was leaked to the Internet ahead of schedule in late August 2009. The fourth season premiered in the UK on the FX channel on August 20, 2010. Plot Dexter has married Rita and settled down to domestic life with her two children and their new baby Harrison. Dexter continues to act on the urge to kill, but the strain of his double life affects both his job at Miami Metro Police and his home life. Rita becomes upset that Dexter appears to be lying to her, including keeping his old waterfront condo where he has stashed his blood drop trophies, and their marriage goes through troubling times. As the police investigate a series of small-time crimes and killings in the so-called \\"Vacation Murders\\" with the help of investigative journalist Christine Hill, retired FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy returns to Miami; Debra initially worries he has come back to get closer to her, but he later reveals that he is following a case that the FBI refused to handle. The \\"Trinity Killer\\", believed to be an older Caucasian male, kills three people in the same city roughly once each year and in a specific sequence: one young woman killed in a bathtub, a mother killed by falling, and a father bludgeoned. The first two of this pattern have recently happened in Miami, and Lundy believes he knows when and where the last will be, but he is powerless to act on this. After rekindling their relationship, both Lundy and Debra are shot by an unknown assailant; Debra survives but Lundy's wounds are fatal, and the police initially assume that this was another random killing committed by the \\"Vacation Murderer\\". Dexter learns of Lundy's analysis, steals his records, and uses his own skills to sneak into the building and catch sight of the Trinity Killer in the act of dispatching his third victim. Dexter follows the killer to his home, and is very surprised to learn that he is Arthur Mitchell: husband and father, deacon at a local church, and leader of the \\"Four Walls One Heart\\" homebuilding charity organization. Dexter continues to watch him and comes to admire his ability to balance his killings along with his family and work lives. Using the alias \\"Kyle Butler\\", Dexter joins Arthur's church, befriends him, and learns from him how to improve his own relationship with Rita and his family, giving over his condo to Debra while transferring his killing implements into a shed behind their house. Meanwhile, the Miami police learn that the Trinity Killer places a small amount of cremation ashes at each murder scene, and identify that Trinity and the ash share similar genetics but otherwise cannot match Trinity to any criminal records. Arthur takes Dexter on a weekend trip to Tampa, taking him to the house in which he grew up. This is where he, at age ten, saw his older sister die after he inadvertently surprised her in the bathroom; she fell through the glass shower door and severed her femoral artery, killing her almost immediately. This drove his mother to suicide and his father to be abusive, eventually forcing Arthur to kill him. Arthur's trauma is analogous to the event that transformed Dexter and his brother into killers. Dexter later stops Arthur from trying to commit suicide. Dexter discovers that the Trinity series represents the deaths of Arthur's sister, mother and father, and that Arthur has likely been using the Four Walls One Heart program to cover his tracks. Dexter discovers that Arthur's home life is not as pleasant as it appeared, as Arthur abuses his son and locks his daughter in her bedroom, and when things get violent at Thanksgiving dinner, Dexter is forced to subdue Arthur to prevent him from hurting his family. Now assured of Arthur's guilt, Dexter begins to make plans to kill him. Debra recovers from her wound but Lieutenant LaGuerta removes her from the case because of Debra's personal involvement. Still obsessed with solving Lundy's murder, Debra notices that the angle of her wound indicates that the shooter cannot be as tall as Trinity is believed to be. Trace evidence determines that Christine is genetically similar to Trinity and is Arthur Mitchell's illegitimate child. She has been following her father around in an effort to try to clean up after his killings, and so took it on herself to shoot Lundy and Debra when they got too close to Trinity's next target. After Arthur rejects her, Christine kills herself after confessing to the crime in front of Debra. With information collected from Christine, the police start to narrow down the list of possible suspects for Trinity, and Dexter realizes he needs to move fast to get him before the police do. Dexter follows Arthur around but is surprised when he abducts a young boy from a family at an arcade. Dexter goes back to find that Lundy has missed this part of Arthur's pattern: each Trinity series was preceded, five days before, by the abduction of a ten-year- old child – and since the bodies were never found, they were not recorded as killings. With the help of Arthur's son Jonah, Dexter tracks down a bomb shelter at a vacant home where Arthur had stowed the child, and is able to stop Arthur from drowning the boy in cement at a nearby Four Walls One Heart construction site. But Arthur gets away. Dexter, as \\"Kyle\\", blackmails Arthur with the threat of exposing him as a pedophile, as a way to meet Arthur in secret. Instead, Arthur tries to find and kill \\"Kyle\\", in the process killing an innocent with the same name. Arthur then tricks Dexter to reveal himself, follows him back to the police station where they confront each other and he learns Dexter's true identity. Thus revealed, Dexter tails Arthur to a bank parking lot. He drugs him and prepares to take him elsewhere but, having sideswiped another car during the pursuit, he is confronted and taken to jail. Dexter is shortly released, but finds that Arthur has disappeared. Dexter arranges a getaway for Rita and his children to the Florida Keys as a means to protect them from Arthur, promising to meet them later in the day. Dexter eventually finds Arthur, chokes him until he faints, and takes him to the same bomb shelter to kill him. After disposing of the evidence, Dexter returns home, and finds a voice mail from Rita. He proceeds to call her back, but is surprised to hear her phone ringing in the house. Hearing baby Harrison's cries, he races to the bathroom to find Arthur's last victim, Rita, dead in the bathtub, and Harrison bawling in the pool of blood on the floor. Cast Main *Michael C.

Retrieved December 23, 2011. In the 2016 book titled TV (The Book), co-written by critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz, Sepinwall included the fourth season of Dexter in the section \\"A Certain Regard\\", which consisted of shows they loved but were not able to reach their list of the 100 greatest American television series. Sepinwall praised the season as the entire series' best, stating that \\"[s]tructurally, the Trinity season was a rehash of the first, but Lithgow was mesmerizing as a kindly old man who was cruel underneath. And the climax... was such a perfect ending not only to that season, but to Dexter as a whole, that continuing the series felt redundant.\\" References External links  * Dexter (TV series) episodes Category:2009 American television seasons ","title":"Dexter (season 4)"},{"id":"24132117","text":"Fright to the Finish is a 1954 animated American short film directed by Seymour Kneitel and Al Eugster starring Jack Mercer as Popeye.FilmAffinityCartoons Considered For An Academy Award – 1954-Cartoon ResearchMUBI The short was released by Paramount Pictures on August 27, 1954.

Two shows were played each night, with 8:00pm and 11:00pm scheduled start times on January 17, and 7:30pm and 10:00pm scheduled start times on January 18. The final show featured an extended encore with guests John Sebastian (harmonica and vocals) and Dallas Taylor (percussion) that concluded around 2:30am. Select tracks were previously released on the Doors' live album In Concert and as part of The Doors: Box Set. About a third of the material was previously unreleased. The concerts were held a few weeks before the band released their fifth studio album Morrison Hotel on February 9, 1970. The box set was released by Rhino Records from the Bright Midnight Archives collection which contains several previously unreleased live concerts by the Doors. Production The original 8-track and 2-track concert recordings had been used for the 1970 release of Absolutely Live. During this editing of the tapes, many cuts had been made which left the original running order severely compromised. To ensure the correct running order was used, the audience recorded bootlegs were used. However, this process has led to occasional dips in sound quality. Additionally, John Sebastian's blues harmonica was recorded through the PA system on the final three songs and not recorded onto tape. Long-time Doors' sound engineer/producer Bruce Botnick got John Sebastian to re-record his performance four decades after the original concerts.

In 1898 he was made a member of invitational touring side The Barbarians. Although never representing the England national team, Adamson was invited to tour with the British Isles team on the first official tour of Australia in 1899. Adamson was the stand-out player of the tour, being selected in all 20 matches and amassing 136 points in all games. He scored 17 points from the Test matches, two tries, four conversions and a penalty goal, making him the Tour's top scorer. In total he scored 8 tries, 35 conversions, 3 dropped goals and 10 penalty goals, 136 point by 1899 IRB rules; 149 by modern (2009) scoring rules. In the First Test, Adamson was placed at centre, alongside Gwyn Nicholls; but after the British team lost the game, team captain Matthew Mullineux dropped himself from the team to bring Adamson into his position at half-back. This move is seen as the turning point in the tour, and the British team won the final three Tests, with Adamson scoring in all three victories.

This is how we can see how the variant spellings of the name have occurred when the name became anglicised. Origins The first recorded spelling to be found of the surname Beglin in the history of Ireland is recorded in The Annals of the Four Masters in AD 1128 and is shown to be that of “Conaing Ua Beigléighinn, Abbot of Ceanannus, died in this year\\". Who was a Columbian monk from the Abbey in County Meath where the most beautiful of medieval manuscripts of Gospels, The Book of Kells was held in safe keeping before finally being moved to its new home in Trinity College, Dublin. Coarb Conaing Ua Beigléighinn seems to have been the 43rd for successorship of Saint Colm Cille between AD 1117–1128 . The title \\"Coarb\\" meaning \\"heir\\" or \\"successor of\\" was given to the head of the monastery following the rule of the Colm Cille. The title \\"Fer Léighinn\\" or \\"Vir lectionis\\" in Latin, was a title bestowed for teaching of penmanship and of the holy scriptures. The surname Ó Beigléighinn is documented secondly with \\"Maurice O'Beglin\\" in The Annals of Loch Cé in A.D 1528: \\"Muiris, son of Donnchadh O Beigléighinn, an adept in medicine, who died this year\\". His death was also recorded in The Annals of Connacht as \\"Muiris son of Donnchadh O'Beigléighinn, an eminent physician, died with unction and penance\\". \\"Measgrá Dantra\\" is a book which contains a 13th century poem about a Franciscan friars exile's thoughts on his native land, attributed to Tadgh Comchosach O Dálaigh. The last word of the opening line is Begléighinn - \\"Dá grádh do fhágbhas Eirinn im bráthair bhocht Beigléighinn\\". Rev. Patrick Beglin was one of the Seven Wonders of Fore. Legend states that in County Westmeath in Ireland, on a hillside above the old church of St. Fechin is a tiny chapel, the Anchorites church, an extension to a cell once occupied by hermits until the 17th century. Tradition states that the last hermit in Ireland was Patrick Beglin, who had stayed here living a life of a hermit for religious reasons and is commemorated on a stone tablet in the cell dated AD 1616. Bearers of the name * Conaing Ua Beigléighinn * Muiris Ó Begléighinn Later Beglins The prefixes Ó or Ua of surnames was widely dropped following the conquests of Ireland during the 16th-17th centuries, when english rule became effective and most Irish surnames had to become Anglicised under penal law. From the early 1800s, however, many began to revive the use of O' (rather than Ó) and Mac in their surnames, becoming especially popular in the time of the Gaelic League, and Irish independence as a free state. The Ó Begléighinns were located principally in Counties Meath, Westmeath and Longford, where it can be found today. The various spellings of the surname are Beigleign, Beigleinn, Beglin, Beglan, Begline, Beglen, Begnal, Biglen, Beglain, Begllin and Beglane. Some more notable Beglins in more recent times there is the former Irish international footballer and present day sports commentator for RTÉ Jim Beglin, the former field hockey player Beth Beglin of the United States of America who represented her country in the women's national team in the 1984 Summer Olympics and again 4 years later in Seoul.

Galway Castles and Owners in 1574 (Barons of Kingestowne Athenry) the owner being Villig Osebeg of Dunsandle. The castle was first held by the De Burgo (Burke) family, acceded to the Dalys and has recently been restored under the guidance of the architect David Newman Johnson. Dunsandle Castle is replete with unique architectural features including a great hall with tie beams unusual in Irish architecture of this period. Also unique to Dunsandle is its Groin Vault construction. This was first exploited by the Romans, but then fell into relative obscurity in Europe until the resurgence of quality stone building brought about by Carolingian and Romanesque architecture. Difficult to construct neatly because of the geometry of the cross groins (usually elliptical in cross section), the groin vault required great skill in cutting stone to form a neat arris. This difficulty, in addition to the formwork required to create such constructions, led to the rib vault superseding the groin vault as the preferred solution for enclosing space in Gothic architecture. Dunsandle also has an 18th-century ice house, remains of a later extension and Bawn with defence tower complete with gunloops. The castle is surrounded by native Irish woodland.

It was based on the 1956 novel Liane, das Mädchen aus dem Urwald by Anne Day-Helveg. The film attracted considerable attention due to Marion Michael appearing topless. Plot During a German expedition in the jungles somewhere in Africa, Thoren (Hardy Krüger) is attacked and captured by the local natives called the Botos. Before they can kill him, the Botos then notice the arrival of a long-haired, topless wild woman (Marion Michael) wearing only three necklaces and a loincloth made of beads, shells, and some feathers. The wild woman communicates with the Botos to spare him and let him go. When Thoren leaves, the wild woman heads into her treehouse. Later that night, Thoren tells the others of his experience with the wild woman and is told by one of them to take him to where he saw her. The Botos are shown doing entertainment as the wild woman plays with her pet lion cub Simba. The next day, the wild woman grabs onto a vine and swings over a lake before she lets go to drop into the lake and go swimming. When she is spotted by Thoren, she escapes into the jungle only to be later caught in a big game net by Kersten and Keller which is spotted by one of the tribesman who alerts the other Botos. Later that night, Thoren arrives and has part of the net removed from the woman's head and feeds her a banana. When the Botos attack in retaliation, Thoren hooks up a tape to a loudspeaker which frightens off the Botos, as Dr. Jacqueline Goddard (Irène Galter) undoes the net and lets her rest. After the Botos escape, the wild woman gets up and is attacked by an expedition member, only for him to be beaten up by Thoren, who warns him to keep his hands off of her. Thoren carries her body back to the tent to let her rest. Thoren and Jacqueline then notice that one of necklaces around her neck has a good luck charm with an L engraved into it. Thoren then decides to bring it to Professor Danner to figure it out. The next day, Jacqueline gives the wild woman a bath which she enjoys, cuts her unruly hair to shoulder length, and puts her in some new clothes. Thoren comes in and tells Jacqueline that the whole world is asking for information about the white girl that they found. Jacqueline says that her name is Kiyahi, but could not understand anything else that she said. Thoren and Jacqueline then teach her some of their language and states that she must have originally come from a good family before being taken in by the Botos. Meanwhile, in Germany, shipping tychoon Theo Amelongen (Rudolf Forster) and his nephew Viktor (Reggie Nalder) look at the article about the wild woman that was found and Theo suspects that it might be his long-lost granddaughter Liane, who went missing 18 years ago when the ship she and her parents were on went down, with a speculation that her Liane at 2 years old had somehow survived. Theo decides to have his agents look into this. Back in Africa, Thoren takes Liane with him and Jacqueline. When Liane's tribesman friend Tanga (Jean Pierre Faye) and Simba show up, he ends up sneaking on the ship. While Liane, Thoren, and Jacqueline are playing cards, Tanga catches up with them and they end up taking him and the lion cub with them. When the ship arrives in Germany, the press swarm over Liana until Thoren sends then off. When the group ends up at Theo's house, he is reintroduced to Liane as well as being introduced to Tanga and Simba. Viktor is told by his lawyer that Liane will be inheriting the fortune. This causes Viktor to take matters into his old hands without Theo finding out. He ends up locking her into a room and ends up getting attacked by Tanga. At his company later, Viktor hires a man named Jensen who was one of the survivors of the ship Imperia sinking and asks to testify that he had no survivors without mentioning that Viktor hired him for this. While talking with Thoren as a bikini-clad Liane plays with Simba, Theo tells Thoren that he will watch over Liane until he gets back. They then see Liane climb up a tree and dive into the lake that she swims in until breakfast is served. Theo then commented that she had inherited her mother's swimming abilities. Theo and Thoren then look at the last letter Liane's mother wrote, which says that she had given her milk to her fox terrier Terry and enjoys climbing. Later on, Blackie the dog finds a piece of paper of the letter that was crumpled up. When Thoren asks who would want to try to dispose of the letter, Theo asks his maid where Viktor is. Theo then arranges to meet with Viktor tonight. When the counselor arrives with Viktor, they find Theo dead in his study. Moments later, the police are called in where the counselor and the maid are questioned about Theo's death. They found the evidence of the pencil and string, which the inspector thinks that the culprit would end up getting into the study. It is then discovered that Viktor was responsible for his uncle's death as he makes his escape. Viktor then gets into his car as Thoren and the police pursue him. The car chase goes down the street until Viktor ends up driving off the bridge to his death. Back in Africa, Professor Danner gets the news that Liane has inherited the Amelongen fortune and gets a news article that Liane is heading back to Africa to visit the Danner expedition. Professor Danner considers this as a homecoming with Thoren and Tanga arriving with her. The Botos also rejoice with the news that Liane and Tanga are coming back. Liane, Tanga, and Thoren arrive with Professor Danner. While the Botos celebrate, Liane runs off into the jungle, gets naked, and goes swimming in a lake. She is then joined by Thoren.

The company began in the 1960s manufacturing metal chassis for slotcar racing; 1978 saw the introduction of the RX1200, a 1:12 scale on-road racer, which was the start of the RX series of 1/12-scale on-road chassis. The RX2000 followed and took the Japan Model Racing Car Association All-Japan Championship title in 1980, the first of three consecutive titles for the company. In 1984, Joel Johnson won the title on his first trip to Japan with Trinity. Conventional manufacturers mounted their differential gears between the right rear wheel and the motor compartment, but ayk placed theirs within the axle, which centered the weight more proportionately and kept the differential gears protected. By 1984, they resorted to an outboard gear diff much like the current Delta of the time. In 1982, the same year that AYK took its third consecutive 1:12 title (with the RX3000 EXL480), like other manufacturers, ayk broke into the 1:10 off-road buggy market with the 566 B Super Trail. The buggy included aluminum chassis, enclosed transmission with all-aluminum gears, and a waterproof radio case. This model was closely followed in the early eighties by a series of race-ready 1/10 off-road buggies which saw reasonable success on the semi-pro circuit. By the mid-1980s, Ayk abandoned the 1:10 two-wheel-drive off-road to concentrate on off-road four-wheel-drive models and on-road 1/12 scale. After winning the Japan Model Racing Car Association 1:12 on-road title with the Super Parsec, the company began its decline following the death of its president in 1989. The Japanese asset price bubble (バブル景気 baburu keiki) bursting in Japan was the other primary reason AYK closed down. These two events had more to do with AYK closing than the common overseas racing car market rumor. One of its staff members, Tatsuro Watanabe, left the company by 1986 to emigrate to the United States to start up Hobby Products International, a company specialising in radio-controlled cars. Later on, some other employees found themselves working either for his company (Hiroyuki Iida) or rival manufacturer Mugen Seiki (Takashi Aizawa and Koji Sanada). The Koiwa Ayk office still stands, although the service center is now an apartment complex. Current market Due to relatively small numbers, imported examples of AYK radio controlled cars are now extremely rare outside Japan and as such have inflated prices. Prices in Japan have also risen on and off-road cars dues to the ease that the Internet allows overseas buyers to use Japanese auctions. While 1/12 on-road still may be purchased at reasonable prices from the Japanese second hand market due to this class being less popular with overseas buyers. Early 1/10th AYK radio controlled cars from the 'golden era' (the early to mid 1980s command high prices) Many AYK slot cars seem to have been imported to Australia and were actually stamped and sold as AYK. Australia would be a better source for AYK cars if one is hunting. Slot cars AYK manufactured slot car chassis that included brass chassis, stamped steel chassis (similar to the Flexi from Parma), and a bolt together parallel dragster chassis to name a few. One item of note from AYK was the controller that AYK made for slot car racing. Unlike the current controllers that are all based on the Ruskit, AYK manufactured a controller that was held in the left hand and had a lever that controlled the speed using the right hand. This controller was the standard in Japan for a while. AYK also OEM various slot car parts and chassis to American companies. AYK also produced OEM parts for such companies such as Trinity during the 1980s for the 1/10-scale buggy market. Motor sports AYK sponsored the Nissan Fairlady ZC team in the WEC Championship. This car was copied in 1/12 scale by AYK and is one of the bodies available in the RG Impulse Kit. AYK also sponsored Toshio Suzuki's Formula 3 entry; the car was either Toyota or Alfa Romeo powered. The March 803 was red with blue three-color AYK logos, one on each side and one forward of the cockpit. These logos were hand-cut by AYK chief of media design. 1/12 on-road The chassis are listed followed by the bodies that were available with the kits in the Japanese market.

Even though AYK produced the NX series, they still competed against them with their own series of cars.

His nickname \\"Txiki\\" is Basque for \\"small\\". Early life Benegas' father was José María Benegas Echeverría, an exiled Basque Nationalist politician, who fled Spain in 1939 following the victory of Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War. His mother was Doris Haddad, a Lebanese Jew, who migrated from Lebanon to Venezuela. Born in Caracas, Benegas Haddad moved to Spain in 1955 and studied in the Jesuit College before qualifying as a lawyer at the University of Valladolid in 1971. He then briefly moved to London to study English and Economics. Entering politics On his return, he joined the PSOE and the affiliated Trade Union, the Unión General de Trabajadores. In 1974 he was elected Secretary of the PSOE's youth wing and also became Vice-Secretary of the International Socialist Youth movement. In 1977 he entered national politics when he was elected to the Spanish national parliament as a deputy for Biscay Province and was re-elected at the 1979 election. Basque regional politics However, in February 1980, he resigned from Congress in order to head the PSOE list for Guipuzcoa in the elections to the Basque parliament and was elected to that legislature. He returned to the Spanish Congress at the 1982 General Election representing Álava Province. However he resigned in February 1984 after being chosen to head the PSOE list in the Basque parliamentary elections. Despite the PSOE increasing their vote and more than doubling their number of seats from 9 to 19, he was unsuccessful in his bid to become Lehendakari or President of the autonomous government of the Basque Country. That office was retained by the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), which formed the government after those elections. However, after one year the PNV entered into an agreement with the PSOE for legislative support and in 1986 a split in the PNV led to the formation of Eusko Alkartasuna. As a result, the PNV lacked sufficient support to govern and was forced to call early elections in 1986 at which Benegas was again the candidate for Basque President. Although the PSOE managed to overtake the PNV as the largest party in the new legislature, the PNV candidate José Antonio Ardanza was re-elected President of the Basque autonomous community. In 1989 Benegas returned to national politics when he was elected to the Congress, representing Biscay. He was re- elected at every subsequent General Election until 2011 and was one of the few members of the Constituent Cortes (1977-1979) in the 2011 legislature. Personal life Benegas was married to Maite Urabayen and was the father of two children. His son is the Spanish musician and songwriter Pablo BenegasIMDB biography guitarist in the group La Oreja de Van Gogh. His sister, Doris Benegas, was the President of the Castilian Left party. On 25 August 2015, Benegas died in Madrid of cancer, which he had suffered from for several months.Muere Txiki Benegas, figura clave del socialismo vasco, El Mundo, 25 August 2015 References Category:1948 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Basque Jews Category:Deaths from cancer in Spain Category:Grand Cross of the Order of Civil Merit Category:Members of the 1st Basque Parliament Category:Members of the 2nd Basque Parliament Category:Members of the 3rd Basque Parliament Category:Members of the constituent Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 1st Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 2nd Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 4th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 5th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 6th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 7th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 8th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 9th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 10th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Politicians from Caracas Category:Spanish Jews Category:Spanish people of Basque descent Category:Spanish people of Lebanese-Jewish descent Category:Spanish Socialist Workers' Party politicians Category:University of Valladolid alumni Category:Venezuelan emigrants to Spain Category:Venezuelan Jews Category:Venezuelan people of Basque descent Category:Venezuelan people of Lebanese-Jewish descent ","title":"José María Benegas"},{"id":"24132526","text":"Michael Zachary \\"Mike\\" Petri (born August 16, 1984 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American rugby union scrum-half who plays for Rugby United New York (RUNY).

Biography Norman Magnus MacLeod of MacLeod was born on 27 July 1839. He was the eldest son of Norman MacLeod of MacLeod (1812-1898), 25th chief of Clan MacLeod and his wife Louisa Barbara St John (1818-1880), only daughter of the 14th Baron St John of Bletso. He was educated at Harrow and in 1858, at the age of 19, was commissioned into the 74th Highlanders, immediately joining the regiment in India. He served as aide de camp to General Sir Hope Grant, Commander in Chief in the Presidency of Madras from 1862 to 1865. He retired from the 74th Highlanders as a Captain in 1872. In 1878, MacLeod of MacLeod was appointed as Political Agent on the Transvaal border at the outbreak of the Zulu War. In 1879, he commanded a Swazi army of, reportedly, 8,000, plus an undetermined number of British officers and (presumably) NCOs, against the Pedis. The Swazi army decisively defeated the Pedis at the Battle of Wulu. MacLeod of MacLeod returned home in 1880 and, upon the death of his father in 1885, succeeded as the 26th Chief of MacLeod.

She also published in many of the top academic journals, including English Historical Review, Economic History Review, and History. In 1946, Ruddock moved to Birkbeck College, University of London, where she published Italian Merchants and Shipping in Southampton, 1270-1500 in 1951. She was appointed to the position of reader in history in 1952, and subsequently elected as a fellow both of the Society of Antiquaries of London and of the Royal Historical Society.  Later work  In the 1950s and early 1960s, Ruddock's concerns shifted from the activities of Italian merchants in Southampton to a broader investigation of Italian mercantile networks and businesses in medieval Europe. She intended to produce a \\"big\\" book to be titled Italian Merchants and Shipping. Around 1965, she claimed to have made a discovery in the archives of a Venetian banking family: documents relating to John Cabot's early activities, including a loan that the family advanced to him .Evan T. Jones, \\"Alwyn Ruddock: John Cabot and the Discovery of America\\", Historical Research, Vol. 81, (May 2008), pp. 235–236Evan T. Jones, \\"The Quinn papers: Transcripts of correspondence relating to the Bristol discovery voyages to North America in the fifteenth century\\", pp. 13–17. For at least 25 years, she was promising to produce her Cabot book \\"soon\\". In 1992, she undertook a formal book contract with the University of Exeter Press. She felt unable or unwilling to publish it; upon her death, she left instructions for her research papers to be destroyed.Emma Mason, \\"Obituary: Alwyn Ruddock\\", The Guardian, 17 February 2006.

Current investigations  After her death, the Bristol University historian Evan T. Jones began to investigate Ruddock's unpublished research claims about the voyages of John Cabot, producing an article about them in the journal Historical Research in April 2007 (print edition, 2008). He wrote a second article about two documents found by the historian, Margaret Condon, who had not published them in the 1980s, in part due to the understanding that Ruddock had a book in progress on the topic.Evan T. Jones, \\"Henry VII and the Bristol expeditions to North America: The Condon documents\\", Historical Research (Early View, August, 2009).\\"The lost voyage: First English-led expedition to North America\\", press release issued 27 August 2009, University of Bristol.\\"King's letter reveals epic voyage\\", BBC News, 27 August 2009. Jones subsequently set up the Cabot Project along with a number of other historians in Britain, Italy, Canada, and Australia to carry out further investigations into the early voyages, and to search for the evidence for Ruddock's claims.

Role- playing games industry Clark Peterson and his old friend Bill Webb formed Necromancer Games in the spring of 2000 to publish role-playing materials using the d20 license; on August 10, 2000, the same day Wizards of the Coast was to release the new Player's Handbook at GenCon 33, Peterson and Webb published a free PDF adventure called The Wizard's Amulet just a few minutes after midnight. On September 13, 2000, Necromancer Games announced a partnership with White Wolf in forming their \\"Sword & Sorcery\\" imprint. Peterson and Webb produced many of White Wolf's rulebooks, including Creature Collection (2000), Relics & Rituals (2000), The Divine and The Defeated (2001), and Creature Collection II (2001). Peterson ran \\"Return to the Caverns of Thracia\\" as a tournament at GenCon XXXV in 2002, after Necromancer Games formed a partnership with Judges Guild to release Judges Guild products. Peterson was initially a big supporter of the GSL for fourth edition D&D; when it was announced on April 2008, but by July, after seeing the new license applied, he declared it \\"a total unmitigated failure\\". In March 2010, Peterson declared that Necromancer Games was on indefinite hiatus. Peterson has since co-created Legendary Games, focusing on plug-in material for Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure paths and sourcebooks. Career in law Peterson attended Washington and Lee University for his undergraduate education and graduated from Loyola Law School. He was admitted to the California Bar in 1994 and the Idaho Bar in 2001. He was a deputy district attorney in Las Vegas. He was a defense attorney at Amendola Doty & Brumley PLLC in Coeur d'Alene. Peterson was selected to fill a vacant judge magistrate's seat in Idaho's First District Court in 2010. Peterson retained his position as magistrate with 81% of the vote in 2012; his first term expired in 2016. In December 2013, two litigants in cases over which Judge Peterson had presided made claims that Peterson's recent financial and marital problems and role- playing hobby distracted him from his duties. Administrative District Judge Lansing Haynes defended Peterson, describing him as \\"extraordinarily engaged in his work,\\" \\"a real agile thinker,\\" \\"a great resource to other judges\\", and \\"hard-working\\" with a \\"sharp focus\\". He saw no problem with Peterson posting on message boards during breaks from work. Peterson asserted that his hobby has never delayed a hearing or prevented him from doing work. In response to the concerns, Peterson announced plans to not post during business hours and to use caution in commenting about products. He also deleted his online avatar, Orcus, Lord of the Undead, to focus on his judicial activities. Peterson was the target of protesters prior to his 2016 reelection. Despite this, he won 73% of the vote to retain his position as a magistrate.

He was the first teacher of Russian literature of University of São Paulo, in 1960, despite being graduated in agronomy. He translated renowned Russian writers and poets, like Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky, Babel, Pasternak, Pushkin and Mayakovsky.

In 2003 he received the Prize of Translation by the Academia Brasileira de Letras.

He was the founder of Matson Navigation Company. Early life Wilhelm Matson said he was born on October 18, 1849 in an area noted for fishing and sailing, Lysekil in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. He was orphaned during his childhood. He attended public schools in Sweden, then took an intermission of a year to go to sea at the early age of ten. Career Matson came to New York City in 1863 as a cabin boy, at the age of fourteen. Working his way up in the maritime world, he arrived in San Francisco, California after a trip around Cape Horn in 1867. At the end of two years he was captain of a vessel, engaged chiefly in carrying coal to the Spreckels Sugar Company refinery. He was naturalized on Sept. 2, 1871, according to California Voting Registers, 1866-1898. Working aboard the Spreckels family yacht, Matson struck up a friendship with tycoon Claus Spreckels, who would finance many of Matson's new ships. In 1882, Matson bought his first ship called Emma Claudina, named for Spreckels' daughter. Matson had learned there was money to be made carrying sugar from the Hawaiian Islands. In 1882, the Emma Claudina ran to the Hawaiian Islands. The enterprise began in the carrying of merchandise, especially of plantation stores, to the islands and returning with cargoes of sugar. This led to gradually expanding interests at both ends of the line, which kept pace with the commercial development of the country. In 1887, Matson sold the Emma Claudina and acquired the brigantine Lurline, which more than doubled the former vessel's carrying capacity. Soon he had three vessels running.Capt. William Matson (by Bob Krauss. \\"The Honolulu Advertiser\\" July 2, 2006) Increased commerce brought a corresponding interest in Hawaii as a tourist attraction. The 146-passenger ship S.S. Wilhelmina followed in 1910. More steamships continued to join the fleet. When Matson died in 1917 at the age of sixty-seven, the Matson fleet comprised fourteen of the largest, fastest and most modern ships in the Pacific passenger-freight service.From Sail to Steam. History of the Matson Fleet (Matson Navigation Company ) In addition to serving as President of the Matson Navigation Co., Matson was President of Honolulu Consolidated Oil Co., Commercial Petroleum Co., Atlas Wonder Mining Co., and Wonder Waler Co.. Additionally, he served as a Director of the National Ice Co., Honolulu Plantation Co., Paauhau Sugar Plantation Co., and Hakalau Plantation Co.. One of the high honors conferred upon Matson was his appointment as Consul of Sweden, giving him jurisdiction over the Pacific Coast of the United States.Captain William Matson (\\"Journalism In California\\" by John P. Young. Chronicle Publishing Company San Francisco, California, 1915) While he was Swedish consul, he was instrumental in advocating for a Swedish Pavilion at the Panama Pacific International Exposition of 1915. Matson was also president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and was active in the civic life of the city and region. Personal life Matson married three times. The first time was in the mid-1870s to Margaret Neil in California. As later listed in the Dec. 7, 1917 San Francisco Chronicle, the couple parented five children: Walter (1877), Ida (1879), Emily (1881), Arthur (1882), and Theodore (1884). Walter Matson later became an executive in his father's extensive business. The Matsons divorced, and Captain Matson married Evadne Knowles in June, 1887, as recorded in the Pacific Commercial Advertiser. She died a few months later. Tradition in popular lore suggests that Captain Matson then met Lillie Low in 1888, when she was traveling on the Lurline to Hilo to teach in a missionary school. They married in May a year later in Hawaii. However, as the Pacific Commercial Advertiser of March 1, 1887 recounted, other passengers and Lillie Low signed a letter to Captain Matson regarding the shipwreck of the brig Selina in February, 1887. One daughter was born in September, 1890 to William Matson and Lillie Low. She was named Lurline Berenice Matson for the legendary Rhine river siren Loreley, in remembrance of the ship in which her parents were reputed in lore to have met.William Matson & Lillie Low Matson (Filoli Center. National Trust for Historic Preservation) Death And Aftermath He died on October 11, 1917. An exhibit that includes William Matson's Swedish Consul General's uniform as well as artifacts from the Matson-Roth families may be seen on the San Mateo County Historical Association Online Collections Database. In 1987, Matson was inducted into the National Maritime Hall of Fame at the American Merchant Marine Museum in New York City. (Note: Owing to burned out verifying documents in the Lysekil, Sweden area from the 1860s-1870s, Matson's birth record and other supporting documents of his early life have never been found, as of December, 2016. Likewise, documents in San Francisco that would help document his remarkable American Dream story (including his arrival and naturalization papers) were also destroyed in the conflagration of the 1906 earthquake, according to a letter he wrote dated June 13, 1906.)

The title may be translated as \\"Chronicle of Kings\\", although the Balinese babad genre does not quite accord to Western-style chronicles.Adrian Vickers, 'Balinese texts and historiography', History and Theory 29 1990, pp. 158-78. There are dated manuscripts from the early 19th century onwards, and the original version was very likely written in the course of the 18th century. The author was probably a Brahmin tied to the Klungkung Palace, the most prestigious of the nine pre- colonial royal seats of Bali.Margaret J. Wiener, Visible and Invisible Realms; Power, Magic, and Colonial Conquest in Bali. Chicago & London: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 97-102. The text is a blend of myth, legend and history, and traces the history of Balinese kingship back to the Javanese roots in the age of the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit empire (1293-c. 1527). The forces of Gajah Mada, the chief minister (patih) of Majapahit, invade Bali and subjugate the island (an event dated in 1343 in the Javanese poem NagarakrtagamaMpu Prapañca, Desawarnana (Nagarakrtagama), Leiden: KITLV Press, p. 59.). A Javanese nobleman called Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan, the grandson of a Brahmin, is installed as the vassal ruler of Bali, with his residence in Samprangan in the Gianyar regency. In the next generation the seat of the raja is moved to Gelgel in the Klungkung regency, where a strong kingdom takes shape. The collapse of Majapahit on Java later on leaves Gelgel as the heir of the classical Javanese civilization. The account follows the fortunes of the Gelgel kingdom until its fall, historically dated in 1686.I Wayan Warna et al. (tr.), Babad Dalem; Teks dan Terjemahan. Denpasar: Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Propinsi Daerah Tingkat I Bali. A continuation of the Babad Dalem, sometimes called Babad Ksatria, follows the history of Klungkung, the successor kingdom of Gelgel. It was authored in the second half of the 19th century, with a later version including a brief account of the fall of Klungkung in 1908.Helen Creese, 'Sri Surawirya, Dewa Agung of Klungkung (c. 1722-1736); The historical context for dating the kakawin Parthayana', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 147 1991, pp. 402-19. The great value of the Babad Dalem as a source of Balinese cultural values and perceptions of kingship is generally recognized by the scholars. Its value as a source of past events on Bali is controversial. The older versions contain few calendrical dates, and the babad genre seems more concerned with origins than with the exact chronology of events. Comparisons with external (in particular Dutch and Javanese) historical materials suggest that important aspects of the history of Gelgel have been left out or altered in the Babad Dalem.Helen Creese, 'Balinese babad as historical sources; A reinterpretation of the fall of Gelgel', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 147 1991, pp. 236-60; Hans Hägerdal, 'Bali in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries; Suggestions for a Chronology of the Gelgel Period', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 151 1995, pp. 101-24..

Driving a convoy of eighteen jeeps, each carrying 3 or 4 British or French commandos, the raiders destroyed or damaged around forty Luftwaffe aircraft. The attack damaged the Luftwaffe's capability during the German invasion of Egypt and also, by the destruction of many transport aircraft, severely diminished its ability to re-supply German land forces in the field. The airfield was later used by the United States Army Air Force Ninth Air Force during the Eastern Desert Campaign by the British Eighth Army, which the 57th Fighter Group, flew P-40 Warhawks from 8–12 November 1942. It was apparently abandoned after the western desert campaign moved into Libya and eventually was taken over by the desert. Aerial photos show some evidence of where it existed.

It is approximately 180 metres (600 feet) long and it is a section of a longer crossing constructed as an embankment. The viaduct carries around ninety trains, including commuter services and heavy freight, per day and it is the sole rail route between Dublin and Belfast. It has had a history of problems with its foundations being scoured out by strong currents. History The present structure is the third on this site. The first was built in timber for the Dublin and Drogheda Railway in 1844. Its stability was badly affected by erosion of the river bed around the piles and, after short- term remedial work, it was replaced in 1860 with a new structure of wrought iron spans on masonry piers. This sufficed until the early 1930s when new locomotives (4-4-0 Compounds) required strengthening of the piers and continued maintenance. Additional ballasting of the piers was also needed. The sea air caused deterioration of the wrought iron and these spans were replaced during 1966–1968 with the current prestressed concrete structure. At this time, the tracks were laid on ballast, reflecting modern practice. Collapse On Friday 21 August 2009, at 6:30pm, a 20-metre section of the viaduct collapsed. Some reports state that the collapse started while a passenger train was passing over it, others say shortly after. The driver of the Balbriggan to Dublin Pearse service was passing over the viaduct and noticed the section crumbling away. He coasted the train (not increasing the engine revs in case the vibrations made it collapse while the DMU was on it) across it. The train was not derailed and no one was hurt: the driver raised the alarm when he arrived at Malahide. The repairs took roughly three months, with curtailment of all services north of Malahide. The competence of Iarnród Éireann's maintenance regime has been questioned and there have been previous critical reports of the viaduct's structure. Iarnród Éireann stated that the structure had been inspected three days previously. Erosion had been reported by an Irish Sea Scout leader who later opined that a superficial inspection might have missed scour damage below water level. Official estimates of three months to repair the viaduct (by reinforcing the seabed and replacing the collapsed pier) and restore rail services were accurate and Iarnród Éireann announced that the bridge would reopen on 16 November after \\"round the clock\\" repair works that reportedly cost €4 million. The bridge reopened on the scheduled date.Packed carriages, late trains: normal service resumes over Malahide viaduct, Shane Hegarty, The Irish Times, 17 November 2009, retrieved 14 January 2010 Other piers have been strengthened and the riverbed weir restored. This is despite much more pessimistic unattributable comments by structural engineers shortly after the collapse. Such pessimism arose because the estuary is a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and a Special Protection Area (SPA) and it was suggested that a full environmental impact statement (EIS) would be necessary and, if a planning application were required, obtaining the necessary permissions alone could take more than three months. In addition, the stability of the remaining structure needs to be proven. A long term solution, perhaps a new longer span bridge, will be needed. Independent report An independent report found that spans 4 and 5 of the viaduct began to collapse as the 18.05 Balbriggan to Pearse train crossed the bridge at 18.23.Malahide Viaduct Accident Report The report said that staff had followed proper procedures. The design of the viaduct meant that the piers did not go down to the bedrock but instead joined with a man made causeway underneath, making the structure vulnerable to scour erosion. The causeway between piers 4 and 5 were particularly badly eroded and erosion had increased in part due to climatic, oceanographic and hydrographic factors. Visual checks and inspections had not led to questions about the structural integrity of the viaduct. Access to original construction drawings and historical documents was limited. The replacement pier 4 is founded on piles and the remaining piers were retrofitted with piles.

Although modern use of the word implies both that the parts are reasonably self-contained and that the structure was intended by the author, historically, neither was necessarily true: in fact, a pentalogia could be assembled by a later editor,In the 18th and 19th centuries, English students of Ancient Greek would often use John Burton's Pentalogia (1779), William Trollope's Pentalogia Græca, an edited collection of five plays by different authors, or Thomas Mitchell's Pentalogia Aristophanica. just as Plotinus's Enneads were arranged in nines by Porphyry in order to create an overarching structure of six which would express the idea of perfection. Overview In Western literature, the oldest quinary structure with great influence is the Torah or Pentateuch; in the Far East, it is the Five Classics. The most famous pentalogy in medieval literature is Nizami Ganjavi's Panj Ganj, or Khamsa (\\"Five Treasures\\"), a collection of five epics which was composed in the latter half of the 12th century. They were Makhzan al-Asrar, Khusraw o Shirin, Layli o Majnun, Eskandar-nameh, and Haft Paykar. The idea was widely imitated, the number five being seen as having mystical significance; for example, the 16th-century poet Faizi, the poet laureate of Akbar's court, attempted a work on the same scale, but completed only three of the intended five parts. Other famous examples include Amir Khusro: Khamsa-e-Nizami (13th century), a pentalogy of classical romances, and Ali-Shir Nava'i: Khamsa (16th century). The fivefold structure is usually first encountered by an English-speaking reader in the plays of William Shakespeare, which, like nearly all English, French and German plays of the period, are divided into five acts, even when the narrative of the play hardly seems to demand it; in his Essay on Comedy (1877), George Meredith wrote sardonically that \\"Five is dignity with a trailing robe; whereas one, or two, or three acts would be short skirts, and degrading.\\" The origin of this tradition was examined by Brander Matthews in A Book about the Theater. It could be traced to Horace: :{Neve minor, neu sit quinto productior actu Fabula, quae posci volt et spectanda reponi;Ars Poetica, l. 189–190. The first line appears misquoted in John Dryden's Of Dramatic Poesie (1668). |five acts the play must have, nor more nor less, To keep the stage and have a marked success.Translation by Sir Theodore Martin. Quoted by Brander Matthews. |} Brander explains that Horace came to this conclusion on the basis of the drama of Euripides: :And apparently Euripides was far more interested in his play, in his plot, and in his characters, than in these extraneous lyric passages, so he reduced them to the lowest possible number, generally to four [...] separating the pathetic play into five episodes in dialog. The Alexandrian tragedians [...] accepted his form as final. :Coming long after Horace, Seneca unhesitatingly accepted all the restrictions insisted upon by the Latin lyrist. [...] It is not to be wondered at that the Italian scholars of the Renascence followed the precept of Horace and the practise of Seneca. They were far more at home in Latin than they were in Greek; and they could hardly help reading into the literature of Athens what they were already familiar with in the authors of Rome. [...] So it is that Scaliger and Minturno prescribe five acts, and that Castelvetro [...] points out that poets seem to have found the five-act form most suitable. [... T]he French dramatic poems, composed a little later, were imitations of these Italians...Brander Matthews. A Book about the Stage. New York: Scribner's, 1916. Pages 57ff. quincunx Lawrence Durrell's pentalogy The Avignon Quintet (1974–85) is an example of the reappearance of numerological ideas in modern fiction. In an attempt to subvert the normal linear structure, Durrell explicitly specified it as a quincunx and related it to the Gnostical interpretations. The best-known discussion of this shape in English literature is Thomas Browne's essay The Garden of Cyrus, which relies on Pythagorean traditions, but Durrell goes much further afield, relating it to Angkor Wat and the Kundalini.Paul H. Lorenz. \\"Angkor Wat, the Kundalini, and the Quinx: The Human Architecture of Divine Renewal in the Quincunx.\\" In Lawrence Durrell: comprehending the whole. Edited by J. R. Raper, M. L. Enscore, P. M. Bynum. University of Missouri, 1995. The purpose of the work was to go beyond his previous tetralogy The Alexandria Quartet. In an interview, Durrell agreed with James P. Carley that \\"Christianity as we know it is a quaternity with a suppressed fourth\\" and a critic describes his ambition as being that of \\"achieving the 'quintessence', that is in its combination of Eastern spirituality and Western science leading to the global vision of 'Reality Prime'.\\"Stefan Herbrechter.

Perales was appointed by Cuomo on March 31, 2011 and unanimously confirmed by the New York State Senate on June 7. Early life The son of a Puerto Rican father and a Dominican mother, Perales grew up in New York City. He has said he first considered becoming a lawyer as a child, after his father's business went bankrupt. \\"It really cost us a lot. I'm talking about losing furniture in the house, having it repossessed and things of that nature. It was a very terrible period for our family. And my father once told me that if he had had good legal help this wouldn't have happened.\\" Perales went on to earn a bachelor's degree from City College in 1962 and graduated from Fordham Law School in 1965. Upon graduating from Fordham, Perales worked at the legal unit for a Ford Foundation-funded program on the Lower East Side of New York called Mobilization for Youth. In 1968, when the federal government began to open neighbourhood legal services programs as part of the War on Poverty, Perales was selected to establish the first Brooklyn Legal Services Office. His experiences working in New York's Puerto Rican neighborhoods allowed him to also assume the role of legal advocate for New York's Latino community. In April 1969, he represented the students who took over his alma mater, the City College of New York to demand the admission of more minority students. In January, 1970, he represented the Young Lords Organization when they took control of a church to provide community services to poor community in El Barrio. Perales negotiated the early morning non- violent arrest of over 100 members the Young Lords who refused to leave the church. \\"The Young Lords were seen as a radical young Puerto Rican group that, actually in that situation had taken over that church and were offering breakfast to the kids,\\" Perales said. \\"These young people had a right to have a lawyer. I was doing my job as a lawyer for a group that I thought was doing good things.\\" Government service Perales has spent more than four decades in public service, including serving as the Regional Director of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) in New York and later as Assistant Secretary of HEW during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Perales served as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services under Governor Mario Cuomo and as Deputy Mayor of New York City under Mayor David Dinkins. Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund; other service Perales is a co-founder of LatinoJustice PRLDEF and established the first Brooklyn Legal Services Office. In 1972, Perales, along with two other young Puerto Rican attorneys—Jorge Batista and Victor Marrero—raised enough seed money to open the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, a legal organization modeled on the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Perales served as the first Executive Director and Marrero was Chairman of the Board. In its early days, the fund, known by the acronym PRLDEF (pronounced pearl-deaf), brought many important civil rights lawsuits on behalf of Latinos living in New York City and across the U.S. In 1974, the consent decree issued in PRLDEF's suit Aspira v. New York City Board of Education became central to the United States’ establishment of bilingual education programs in schools across the country. And, in several lawsuits against the New York Civil Service Commission, New York Police Department and New York Sanitation Commission, PRLDEF was able to get the courts to strike down numerous civil service requirements that kept Latinos from public employment and eliminated barriers to government benefits for non-English speaking applicants. In the mid-1970s, a number of PRLDEF lawsuits, beginning with Lopez v. Dinkins on the local level and culminating with Ortiz v. New York State Board of Elections on the statewide level, forced election officials in New York to provide bilingual assistance. The litigation had national impact in 1975 when Congress amended the Voting Rights Act to include the right to bilingual voting procedures. In 1981, Perales returneded to PRLDEF after another stint in government. Within six months, PRLDEF was at the forefront of litigation to get the Justice Department to block the election of the New York City Council until district lines were redrawn in a nondiscriminatory manner. The subsequent court order halting the elections was perhaps the most dramatic application of the Voting Rights Act in the North. Perales left government in 1994 to assume the position of Senior Vice President at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. During his tenure at the hospital, he developed a Community Health Care system that received national recognition. In 2003, Perales returned to the organization he had founded. PRLDEF quickly gained new prominence as an advocate and defender of the rights of immigrants. The fund's attorneys won a major victory against the Town of Brookhaven, New York in 2005 when a judge ruled that the town had to halt its policy of selectively enforcing its housing code laws against Latino households and its practice of evicting tenants without prior notice. The group's case against Hazleton, Pennsylvania's anti-immigrant ordinance in 2007 was the first of its kind to go to a full trial, and ended with a federal judge issuing the precedent- setting ruling that immigration legislation is a matter reserved to the federal government. Under Perales's leadership, the group was also among the first to challenge violent early morning raids of private homes by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The organization has also filed a unique petition with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, arguing that the United States' aggressive immigration enforcement policies create a climate that fosters bias crimes. In 2008, PRLDEF's Board of Directors voted to change the name of the group to more accurately reflect changes in its mission, its client base, and the make-up of its Board. The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund changed its name to LatinoJustice PRLDEF. \\"Latinos are beginning to see themselves as a group, as a community,\\" said Perales. \\"There is a coming together of identification in a common struggle.\\" References External links *Official biography on the New York State Department of State website *LatinoJustice PRLDEF's website *CUNY's Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños Category:1940 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American politicians of Dominican Republic descent Category:Puerto Rican people in New York (state) politics Category:Andrew Cuomo Category:City College of New York alumni Category:Fordham University alumni Category:Living people Category:New York (state) Democrats Category:New York (state) lawyers Category:Politicians from New York City Category:Secretaries of State of New York (state) Category:Lawyers from New York City ","title":"Cesar A.

It is also part of the superfamily Trochoidea, presenting nacre as the inner shell layer, and its subordinated family Tegulidae. Woodring et al. (1924) recombined this species as Cittarium picum. Weisbord (1962) recombined it as Livona pica, and it was finally recombined as Cittarium pica by Philippi (1847), Rosenberg (2005) and Hendy et al. (2008). This is the only living species in the genus Cittarium. For a long time, only one species in the genus Cittarium was known, however in 2002 a fossil species Cittarium maestratii Lozouet, 2002 was discovered in the Oligocene deposits of southwestern France and named. Shell description The wide and deep umbilicus of Cittarium pica is very distinctive. This shell has been polished. Drawing of a shell of Cittarium pica The shell of this species can be up to 137 mm in maximum dimension. It is very thick and heavy, having an outline that is between trochiform and turbiniform in shape, with rounded shoulders and a somewhat low conical form. The spire is conoidal. It contains about six convex whorls. The large body whorl is depressed-globose. The outer lip is simple. The lip is edged inside by black, or black and white. The columella is arcuate, produced above in a heavy porcellanous callous deposit, half-surrounding the umbilicus and deeply notched in the middle. The shell of Cittarium pica presents a rather wide umbilicus, which is deep and devoid of sculpture, but spirally bicostate inside. The semicircular, oblique aperture is distinguishably nacreous inside as is the case in other Trochoidea, and is circular. The parietal callus is glossy and delicate, and has a node that projects towards the umbilicus. Juvenile individuals possess shells ornamented by spiral lines and strong cords, in contrast to the nearly smooth, homogeneous surface of mature specimens. The lusterless color pattern is rather distinct, overall white with black zigzag flammules on each whorl. Those spots have a tendency to become axial lines in older, larger individuals. The upper surface is often entirely black. The aperture is commonly white, with an inner iridescence because of the nacre. Young shells, or well-preserved adults, have the spire whorls sculptured by oblique folds, cut by a few spiral sulci. The periphery and the base in the half-grown shells are spirally lirate.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia ;Unusual erosion On some old, empty shells of large individuals, the black colored parts become slightly higher in relief, compared to the white areas surrounding it. This unusual morphology may be due to the action of blue-green algae, such as Plectonema terebrans, which continuously erode the surface of the white parts of the shell. Distribution This species occurs rarely in the Florida Keys, and in the Caribbean coast of Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela. It also occurs in the Bahamas, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the Lesser Antilles as far south as Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. The species has been reintroduced to Bermuda. Ecology An empty shell of Cittarium pica which has been polished to make it look more attractive Habitat This large snail is found on or under rocks, in exposed and moderately sheltered shores, both in intertidal and shallow subtidal zones. Cittarium pica generally does not live at great depths, though this has occasionally been reported. Most individuals are found at the water's edge, and have little tendency to disperse. Minimum recorded depth is 0 m. Maximum recorded depth is 7 m. Rocky shore on St. Croix US Virgin Islands, habitat of Cittarium pica A small shallow seawater pool found on St. Croix's north shore Life cycle Cittarium pica is dioecious, which means each individual organism belonging to this species is distinctly male or female. The fertilisation in this species occurs externally. During the reproductive season, which normally occurs from June to November in the field, male individuals release their sperm into the water, as females simultaneously release their green colored unfertilised eggs. The encounter of those gametes produce yolky fertilised eggs, which will further develop into lecitotrophic (yolk feeding) larvae. They emerge from the egg capsules as shell-cap-bearing trocophores. These trocophore larvae do not spend much time in the plankton, because settlement occurs relatively soon, after 3.5 to 4.5 days. Individuals usually reach sexual maturity at shell lengths of 32–34 mm. The life span of this species is still unknown, but estimates for other top shells reach 30 years. Feeding habits The west Indian top shell is known to be an herbivore, feeding on a large variety of algae, and sometimes also on detritus. They actively scrape the algal growths off rocks, and this tends to cause erosion over time. Feeding commonly occurs during the nocturnal period, when the snails are most active. Biological interactions The land hermit crab, Coenobita clypeatus, often uses a shell of Cittarium pica A small limpet, Lottia leucopleura, often lives on the underside of the shell of this large sea snail. The crab Pinnotheres barbatus is mentioned as a commensal. The sessile vermetid gastropod Dendropoma corrodens (also known as ringed wormsnail) and the tube dwelling polychaete Spirorbis may live attached to the shell of Cittarium pica, as is also the case for several species of algae. In the wild, the shell of this species is used extensively by the large land hermit crab species Coenobita clypeatus. Human use These large sea snails are boiled and eaten in a variety of different local recipes. Because of their popularity as a food item and the problem of overfishing, in the US Virgin Islands there are territorial regulations to protect these snails: no collecting is allowed during their reproductive season, and there is a minimum harvest size regulation. For a similar reason, Cittarium pica became locally extinct in Bermuda. This caused a serious impact on the Land hermit-crab populations, because these arthropods need empty Cittarium pica shells (or some other similarly large shell) to use as shelter. Nowadays, Cittarium pica is a legally protected species in Bermuda, where its collection is forbidden.

Created in 1866 following the 1866 Great Fire which burned down most of the buildings of Portland, it was named in honor of former President Abraham Lincoln. It is bounded by Congress, Pearl, Federal and Market streets. to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description Lincoln Park is located near the geographic center of peninsular Portland, at the southern corner of Congress and Franklin Streets. It is shaped roughly like a parallelogram, and is a relatively flat open grassy area, dotted with trees. A network of walking paths radiate away from a fountain located near the center of the park, and there are internal park walkways adjacent to Congress and Federal Streets. (The fountain was originally at the park's center, but its eastern boundary was reduced in order to widen Franklin Street, a major city artery.) The park is encircled by iron fencing. Entrances, each of which is flanked by dressed granite posts, are located at the four corners, and at the center of the Federal Street side. A gate providing access for maintenance vehicles is located at the Congress/Federal corner. History The park, the city's first public park, was acquired in the aftermath of Portland devastating 1866 fire, in which more than 1,800 building were destroyed, devastating the city's downtown and port areas. The land was purchased for just over $81,000 at 75 cents a square foot.City of Portland, Maine: The dedication of Lincoln Park being the public exercises held in the Payson Memorial Church and at Lincoln Park, February 12, 1909, in observance of the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln via GoogleBooks Its layout and design are credited to city engineer Charles Goodell, although a number of his design details were not implemented. In 1909, the lot immediately west of the park (across Pearl Street) was taken and landscaped as an extension to the park. It is now the location of Portland central fire station. Occupy Maine In 2011, the Occupy Maine encampment, part of the larger \\"Occupy\\" protests, began \\"occupying\\" in Lincoln Park as part of an arrangement with the city authorities. At 4am on October 25, a chemical bomb was thrown into the park at the encampment. On December 8, Portland City Council voted 8-1 in favor of denying Occupy Maine a permit to stay in the park.

History , as a child, was interested in building model warships and aircraft but became interested in radio-control models when he witnessed people playing with radio-controlled aircraft across the Arakawa River, thus he used monthly tuition money intended for cram school to buy himself an aircraft to participate in the hobby. As his father was an enthusiast of education, Yokobori Jr. regularly attended the home of a United States Army officer to practice his English conversation skills. After graduation from high school, he resisted his father's persuasion to enter college education in favor of starting his mail order scale model retail business, which thrived as model stores was solely available at metropolitan areas. His sister, who had good command of English, helped him with logistics of goods overseas when business grew. His parents, who ran a confectionery material business, later agreed to help out with the business. Yokobori branched out into his own store, , in 1974 at a Mitsuboshi store in Nihonbashi, the first radio-controlled specialty store incorporated in a department store. As a result, business increased twofold and then opened another in Ginza.Yokobori branched out into R/C car production in 1977 when the shop built a ready to run version of Cox's .49ci Dune Buggy, which was sold as a kit. The car became a success and helped to introduced radio controlled cars into Japan. In 1970, the company would become involved with another US RC car manufacturer, when they imported the RC-1, produced by Associated Electrics, into Japan. As a result, they became involved in the production side of the market, when they manufactured option parts for the car. This was the start of its partnership with Associated which continued to this day. The company, who became Yokomo, a portmanteau of Yokobori Mokei, soon began producing its own competition RC cars in 1977 with the Mini Racer RC-12. The Porsche 917/30 that was bodyshell of the kit later formed the basis of the company's Can-Am car styled logo. Its biggest break was in 1983, when it introduced the YZ-834B, the first of the long-running \\"Dog Fighter\\" series of 1:10 off-road buggies. The car was imported into West Germany by Graupner and was marketed as a Graupner Dog Fighter. Although criticized for having ground clearance that was considered to be too low for a typical off-road course, it wasn't until 1985, when Gil Losi, Jr. used the car to score his and the company's first IFMAR title for the inaugural 1:10 Off- Road World Championship 4WD title. The car was replaced by the YZ-870C, known as the \\"Super Dog Fighter\\", jointly developed by Masami Hirosaka, who was brought into the company following his victory at the following IFMAR 1:10 Off-Road 4WD event. His involvement was rewarded, when he successfully defended his crown in 1989. To this date, with the exception of his first title, won driving a Schumacher CAT, all other IFMAR titles he won have been either for Yokomo (six) and its partner for the Japanese market, Team Associated (eight) and still win national titles for the company. Masami's father, Masaaki was an employee for the company. Yokomo are also known for the infamous and very rare YR-F2 chassis line. Despite being a full-time front- wheel drive RC, the YR-F2 is banned from certain racetracks as it was too fast for other RC's. In 2003, Yokomo broke the R/C car mould further, when they introduced radio-controlled drifting with a series of cars that was built especially for drifting. Yokomo recently partnered with Tomy in 2008, releasing a series of miniature R/C cars based on its licensed D1GP and drifting cars similar to its R/C line. Following the decision of Yokobori to retire, Shigeki Suzuki was appointed to replace him as the CEO, effective from October 1, 2019.https://teamyokomo.com/topics/10437/ See also *YZ-834B *Mini Racer RC-12 References External links *Official Site of Yokomo Japan *Hobby Haven Sdn.Bhd.

Elliott wrote or co-wrote the band's 1965 U.S. top 20 hits \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" and \\"Just a Little\\". In addition to reuniting with the Beau Brummels on occasion over the years, Elliott released a solo album in 1970, and has played on and produced albums by a number of other artists. History During childhood, Elliott developed juvenile diabetes, which had near-catastrophic consequences when he was twelve years old. Growing up, Elliott wrote music influenced by composers George Gershwin and Jerome Kern, as well as country music artist Lefty Frizzell, In 1964, childhood friend Sal Valentino called to inform Elliott that he had a gig but had no band to back him up. Elliott agreed to help him put a band together, which included himself on lead guitar, Ron Meagher on bass, Declan Mulligan on rhythm guitar and John Petersen on drums. The group, known as the Beau Brummels, began playing in and around San Francisco, and was signed to Autumn Records by local deejay Tom Donahue. The band had two immediate hits in early 1965 with \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" and \\"Just a Little\\" both reaching the U.S. top 20. Elliott appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Elliott also appeared with the band as The Beau Brummelstones on The Flintstones television animated sitcom in the season six episode \\"Shinrock A Go-Go,\\" which originally aired on December 3, 1965. Touring became complicated on a couple of occasions when Elliott suffered seizures from his diabetic condition that left him unable to perform. In 1966, Warner Bros. Records acquired Autumn and promptly put out an all-covers album, Beau Brummels '66, which distressed Elliott as the band's main songwriter. He moved to Los Angeles to attempt to regain control over the musical direction, while the rest of the band remained in San Francisco. For a brief time, Don Irving became Elliott's stand-in on guitar when the group performed. Elliott, with Valentino co-writing, created two critically acclaimed albums, 1967's Triangle and 1968's Bradley's Barn. By this time the Beau Brummels were reduced to a duo consisting of Elliott and Valentino, and they soon split. Elliott arranged The Everly Brothers' 1968 album Roots, on which he also played. The Everly Brothers recorded two of his songs, \\"Turn Around\\", which had appeared on Bradley's Barn, and \\"Ventura Boulevard.\\" Elliott played guitar on Van Dyke Parks' debut album, 1967's Song Cycle, and released a solo album of his own, The Candlestickmaker, in 1970. He reunited with the Beau Brummels on occasion, most notably in the mid-1970s when the group released a 1975 self-titled album. Elliott went on to work with artists such as Randy Newman, Van Morrison, Little Feat and Dolly Parton.

It is situated on the corner of Turnbull Street and Greendyke Street, overlooking Glasgow Green, on the edge of the city's East End. History Construction on the church began in 1750, and ended in 1751 or 1752, according to different sources. It is the oldest Episcopalian Church building erected in Scotland since the Reformation, and one of the oldest church buildings in Glasgow. The nearby St Andrew's in the Square was started in 1739 and completed in 1757, making St Andrew's by the Green the fourth-oldest church building in Glasgow by date of starting construction, or third-oldest by date of completion, the earlier two being Glasgow Cathedral and the Trongate steeple. The design was produced by Andrew Hunter, himself a Presbyterian, and construction undertaken by masons Andrew Hunter and William Paul, and wright Thomas Thomson. Hunter was called before his Kirk Session and ex-communicated from the Church for producing the work. The entire cost of the building was £1,250 12s 9½d, comprising £90 5s 0d for purchase of the site, £420 6s 5d for stonework and £740 1s 4½d on the interior. Because of the church's situation by a low-lying part of Glasgow Green, it frequently fell victim to flooding before the parkland was eventually levelled to protect it from the river. There was an historic split between the Hanoverian-supporting Church of Scotland and the Jacobite-supporting Scottish Episcopal Church, who believed Bonnie Prince Charlie to be the true monarch of the Kingdom of Great Britain. Following the failed Jacobite rising of 1745, many Episcopalian congregations resigned themselves to a Hanoverian monarchy and agreed to use the English Prayer Book and pray for the Hanoverians, becoming Qualified Chapels; St Andrew's Episcopal Church was one of these. Following the death of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1798, almost all of the qualified chapels merged back into the old Episcopal Church; the St Andrew's congregation joined the Episcopal Church in 1805. However, one congregation in Glasgow, led by the Reverend Alexander Jamieson, continued independently until Jamieson's death in 1825. Jamieson is buried at St Andrew's-by-the-Green, his grave marked with a Celtic cross. His congregation subsequently built a chapel on Renfield Street, named St Mary's, in 1826. The building was inspired by St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, but was demolished in the late nineteenth century, when the congregation built St Mary's Cathedral on Great Western Road. The depopulation of the centre of Glasgow in mid-twentieth century reduced the congregation to the point that the church was no longer viable, the last service held in the building in April 1975. In 1978, the Church had become a target for vandals, and the pulpit and other valuable items were moved to safety within the People's Palace on Glasgow Green. Organ St Andrew's was the first church in Glasgow to install an organ for public worship, resulting in the nickname, \\"Whistlin' Kirk\\" or the \\"Kist o' Whistles\\". It was purchased from the Qualified Chapel in Edinburgh's Carruber's Close in 1744, when that congregation moved to another building. The organ had been built by John Snetzler in 1747, and was moved into St Andrew's-by-the-Green in 1775, although it is thought not to have been used for worship until 1777. It was enlarged by a pupil of Snetzler's, John Donaldson of York, in 1788, and replaced entirely in 1812. The old organ was sold to the Glasgow Unitarians' new chapel in Union Street in 1813, and moved with them to their new home on St Vincent Street in 1856. This church was subsequently demolished in 1982, and the organ, by now the oldest in the city, was gifted to the University of Glasgow, in whose Concert Hall it now stands. Renovation The church was acquired in 1985 by the Christian Action (Glasgow) Housing Trust as office accommodation for its parent organisation, West of Scotland Housing Association. A major fundraising effort, aided by the late John Crichton- Stuart, 6th Marquess of Bute, raised the £600,000 required to renovate the building. In June 2003, it became the headquarters of the Glasgow Association for Mental Health.

It was Bruce's first solo effort in over three years and was recorded and released in 1974, following the dissolution of the power trio West, Bruce and Laing.[ Album review at allmusic] Originally Bruce had wanted to title the album Into The Storm but, according to Bruce, \\"we couldn't find any stormy weather. We gave up and instead we found a little wood\\".Powell, Mark \\"Out of The Storm\\" liner notes, Esoteric Records, 2011 The album was largely recorded in Los Angeles and San Francisco at the suggestion of engineer Andy Johns, who felt, according to Bruce, that the problem with Bruce's previous work was that he \\"work(ed) with too many British guys and you need to work with some great American session players and you could make an album in ten days\\".Powell, Mark Out of The Storm liner notes, Esoteric Records, 2011 Bruce recorded the album while still addicted to heroin (which contributed to the dissolution of West, Bruce and Laing). According to Bruce's songwriting partner Pete Brown, the band ingested PCP during one session and \\"they were all holding onto each other walking across the floor--Bobby Keys, Jim Keltner, Andy Johns and Jack. Someone said, 'Don't let go of me or I'll float off into space'\\". The continued and heavy drug use periodically interfered with completion of the albumShaprio, Harry \\"Jack Bruce: Composing Himself\\", 2010 and engineer Dennis Weinreich was brought in to remix specific tracks so as to complete the album in a timely fashion and because the label wasn't pleased with Johns's mix of the album. The album peaked at No. 160 on the Billboard album chart in December 1974. Critically well received, including a glowing review by Melody Maker's Allan Jones, who stated that Bruce was \\"one of the most important individuals currently working in rock\\",Jones, Allan review, Melody Maker, 1974 the album sold poorly. Out of the Storm was the last Jack Bruce album distributed in the United States by Atlantic Records, as Bruce's company RSO Records, which was affiliated in the rest of the world with Polydor/Polygram, would shift U.S. distribution to Polydor beginning in 1976. Cover Bruce and a photographer traveled throughout the countryside looking for a storm to photograph for the original title Into The Storm. They were unable to find one so Bruce changed the title and elected to take a photo in the woods using whatever he found, which included an old, rusty bike. Bruce is visible in the background sitting partially in the dark with the landscape and the bike more prominent than Bruce himself is in the photo. Author Harry Shapiro in his book on Bruce suggested that the photo represented Bruce's state of mind at the time, wanting to disappear into the background and avoid all of the difficulties he was then facing. 2003 and 2011 reissues The reissue of the album in 2003 (put out again by Esoteric Records in 2011) included a handful of the original mixes prepared for the album. In contrast to the finished album, the early mixes sound muddy and lack the studio polish that was added to the final version of the album.Shaprio, Harry \\"Jack Bruce: Composing Himself\\", 2010 The reissue includes full liner notes on the recording and production of the album, but mistakenly credits \\"Pieces of Mind\\" as \\"Peaces of Mind\\".

Background The 20-year-old Muslim religious law student Ibn Battuta (1304–1368), Annotated edition (September 30, 2004). See google book search. set out from Tangier, a city in northern Morocco, in 1325, on a pilgrimage to Mecca, some 3,000 miles (over 4,800 km) to the East. The journey took him 18 months to complete and along the way he met with misfortune and adversity, including attack by bandits, rescue by Bedouins, fierce sand storms and dehydration. Ibn Battuta spent a total of 29 years travelling and covered 75,000 miles (117,000 kilometres) before he finally returned home. He travelled \\"further than any writer before him [...] covering most of the known world\\", through Africa, Spain, India, China and the Maldives. On Ibn Battuta's return the Sultan of Morocco requested that he relate his experiences, and this was to become what the Saudi Gazette referred to as \\"one of the world's most famous travel books\\", the Rihla (Voyage). Film synopsis With narration by Ben Kingsley, the film, which is \\"bookended\\" by scenes from the contemporary Muslim pilgrimage, chronicles the first 18-month-long leg of Ibn Battuta's journey, to Mecca. It was filmed in Morocco and Saudi Arabia in English and Arabic, with Berber in the background. On the way to Mecca, riding alone on horseback, Ibn Battuta was held up by bandits, robbed and nearly killed, but when the leader of the bandits realized that he was a pilgrim, feeling ashamed, he offered to escort Ibn Battuta to Egypt (for a fee). It was a difficult journey by camel across the desert and they were faced with fierce sandstorms, before taking to boats to navigate the Nile. Reaching Egypt, he handed a letter given to him by a friend to a Sheikh, and based on a Hadith (an oral tradition) of the Prophet Muhammed, he was advised \\"to seek knowledge to China\\", hence his further extensive travels. Ibn Battuta had intended to continue his journey to Mecca by sea, via the port of ‘Aydhab on the Red Sea, but war and the dangers that posed made him travel by land through Damascus instead, joining a 10,000-strong caravan of fellow pilgrims along the way, staying with them until they finally reach their destination, Mecca. Leading actor According to The Jakarta Post, \\"The lead, Chems Eddine Zinoun, was born in 1980 in Casablanca [Morocco] and studied classical ballet and the piano. He died in a car accident on 11 November 2008 in Casablanca, where he lived. His portrayal of Ibn Battuta shows a depth of feeling that will remain with audiences long after watching Journey [to Mecca].\\" Reception Genre Big Movie Zone described the film's genre as docudrama, whilst a review at that site, remarking that it was the most unusual giant screen film the reviewer had yet seen, called it \\"a biopic guised as a documentary\\". Reviews According to a review on the National Post in Canada, the IMAX format is best suited to the vast landscapes which Ibn Battuta crossed and less so for the close-ups and market places. As for the Hajj itself, this has been described as \\"stunning footage\\". The reviewer writes that \\"Journey to Mecca succeeds best in capturing the wonder, pageantry and beauty that are the hallmarks of any religion's central celebration. Though it is arguably impossible to catch an image of the Almighty on film, this doc comes as close as any.\\" Ann Coates, reviewing the film at Big Movie Zone, stated that with very little narration, unlike other giant screen productions, this helps the dramatic portrayal of Ibn Battuta and \\"his dangerous trek\\". Ross Anthony, also reviewing at BMZ, is of the opinion that the early special effects are nice and moody, though the desert is barren and unappealing. However, \\"once in Mecca, the images shine.\\" The reviewer finds the acting \\"very good for the format\\". Bruce Kirkland of Sun Media in Canada described Journey to Mecca as a \\"beautifully wrought film ... meticulously researched ... everyone, no matter their faith, should see it\\". Trade Arabia in the UAE wrote: \\"A powerful, larger than life cinematic experience that has the power to educate both young and old. Its message of tolerance and respect will resonate strongly with audiences.\\" The Detroit Free Press in the USA said: \\"...dramatic desert landscapes ... unprecedented access to the Great Mosque ... breathtaking aerial views ... a cosmic experience\\"; and Nick Meyer wrote in The Arab American News that the film was a \\"... Breathtaking ... Beautiful, inspiring (story) with many visual delights ... Highly recommended.\\" Martina Zainal of The Jakarta Post writes that \\"the photography is stunning and takes us to dizzying heights over grand scenes, and directors of photography Afshin Javadi, Ghasem Ebrahimian and Rafey Mahmood have helped show us a side of Islam that is rarely seen in today’s news. It is a film worth seeing by Muslims and non-Muslims alike.\\" The film has even received positive reviews in Jewish publications.

The isolation, danger and vulnerability that marked his journey surely also marked theirs.

Zamboni hypothesized that it might play a role in the cause or development of multiple sclerosis (MS). Zamboni also devised a surgical procedure which the media nicknamed a liberation procedure or liberation therapy, involving venoplasty or stenting of certain veins. Zamboni's ideas about CCSVI are very controversial, with significantly more detractors than supporters, and any treatments based on his ideas are considered experimental. There is no scientific evidence that CCSVI is related to MS, and there is no good evidence that the surgery helps MS patients. Zamboni's first published research was neither blinded nor did it have a comparison group. Zamboni also did not disclose his financial ties to Esaote, the manufacturer of the ultrasound specifically used in CCSVI diagnosis. The \\"liberation procedure\\" has been criticized for possibly resulting in serious complications and deaths, while its purported benefits have not been proven. In 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration states that it is not clear if CCSVI exists as a clinical entity and that these treatments may cause more harm. In 2017 they emphasized that this use of balloon angioplasty is not an approved use. In a 2017 study Zamboni et al. stated \\"Venous PTA cannot be recommended for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.\\" In 2018 a study in Neurology concluded \\"Our data do not support the continued use of venoplasty of extracranial jugular and/or azygous venous narrowing to improve patient-reported outcomes, chronic MS symptoms, or the disease course of MS.\\" Research on CCSVI was fast-tracked, but researchers have been unable to find a connection between CCSVI and MS. This has raised serious objections to the hypothesis of CCSVI originating multiple sclerosis. Additional research investigating the CCSVI hypothesis is underway. A 2013 study found that CCSVI is equally rare in people with and without MS, while narrowing of the cervical veins is equally common. Hypothesis Proposed consequences of CCSVI syndrome include intracranial hypoxia, delayed perfusion, reduced drainage of catabolites, increased transpulmonary pressure, and iron deposits around the cerebral veins. Multiple sclerosis has been proposed as a possible outcome of CCSVI. Pathophysiology Zamboni and colleagues claimed that in MS patients diagnosed with CCSVI, the azygos and IJV veins are stenotic (abnormally narrowed) in around 90% of cases. Zamboni theorized that malformed blood vessels cause increased deposition of iron in the brain, which in turn triggers autoimmunity and degeneration of the nerve's myelin sheath. While the initial article on CCSVI claimed that abnormal venous function parameters were not seen in healthy people, others have noted that this is not the case. In the report by Zamboni none of the healthy participants met criteria for a diagnosis of CCSVI while all patients did. Such outstanding results have raised suspicions of a possible spectrum bias, which originates on a diagnostic test not being used under clinically significant conditions. Further studies of the relationship between CCSVI and MS have had variable results, with many failing to reproduce the association between MS and CCSVI. Moreover, the greatest predictor of positive results is researchers' involvement in the administration of the \\"liberation procedure\\". This effect goes to the extent that, when only fully independent studies are considered, no association at all is found. The poor reproducibility across studies and diagnostic modalities has led some authors to conclude that CCVSI might be nothing more than a clinically irrelevant sonographic construct. Already by 2010, there were \\"a growing number of papers that raise serious questions about its (CCSVI) validity\\", although evidence had been \\"both for and against the controversial hypothesis\\". It was agreed that it was urgent to perform appropriate epidemiological studies to define the possible relationship between CCSVI and MS, although existing data did not support CCSVI as the cause of MS. Venous malformations Most of the venous problems in MS patients have been reported to be truncular venous malformations, including azygous stenosis, defective jugular valves and jugular vein aneurysms. Problems with the innominate vein and superior vena cava have also been reported to contribute to CCSVI. A vascular component in MS had been cited previously. Several characteristics of venous diseases make it difficult to include MS in this group. In its current form, CCSVI cannot explain some of the epidemiological findings in MS. These include risk factors such as Epstein-Barr infection, parental ancestry, date of birth and geographic location. MS is also more common in women, while venous diseases are more common in men. Venous pathology is commonly associated with hypertension, infarcts, edema and transient ischemia, and occurs more often with age, however these conditions are hardly ever seen in MS and the disease seldom appears after age 50. Finally, an organ-specific immune response is not seen in any other kind of venous disease. Iron deposits Iron deposition as a cause of MS received support when a relationship between venous pressure and iron depositions in MS patients was found in a neuroimaging study, and criticism as other researchers found normal ferritin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients.Primary studies during 2010 on neuroimaging, CCSVI, and MS:  Additionally iron deposition occurs in different neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease that are not associated with CCSVI. Evidence linking CCSVI and iron deposition is lacking, and dysregulation of iron metabolism in MS is more complex than simply iron accumulation in the brain tissue. Genetics A small genetic study looked at fifteen MS patients who also had CCSVI. It found 234 specific copy number variations in the human leukocyte antigen focus. Of these, GRB2, HSPA1L and HSPA1A were found to be specifically connected to both MS and angiogenesis, TAF11 was connected to both MS and artery passage, and HLA-DQA2 was suggestive of having an implication for angiogenesis as it interacts with CD4. (primary source) A study in 268 MS patients and 155 controls reported more a frequency of CCSVI in the MS group that was more than twice as high as in the controls group and was also higher in the progressive MS group than in the non-progressive MS group. This study found no relationship between CCSVI and HLA DRB1*1501, a genetic variation that has been consistently linked to MS. (primary source) Diagnosis Computer- enhanced transcranial doppler. CCSVI was first described using specialized extracranial and transcranial doppler sonography. Five ultrasound criteria of venous drainage have been proposed to be characteristic of the syndrome, although two are considered sufficient for diagnosis of CCSVI: *reflux in the internal jugular and vertebral veins, *reflux in the deep cerebral veins, *high-resolution B-mode ultrasound evidence of stenosis of the internal jugular vein, *absence of flow in the internal jugular or vertebral veins on Doppler ultrasound, and *reverted postural control of the main cerebral venous outflow pathways. It is still not clear whether magnetic resonance venography, venous angiography, or Doppler sonography should be considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of CCSVI. Use of magnetic resonance venography for the diagnosis of CCSVI in MS patients has been proposed by some to have limited value, and should be used only in combination with other techniques. Others have stated that magnetic resonance venography is a valid measure which has advantages over Doppler including the fact that results are more operator- independent. Diagnostic criteria have been criticized. Both the number of criteria and the need of being positive for two of them as enough for diagnosis are arbitrary ideas. Moreover, experienced groups in the use of ultrasound have not been able to show intracranial or extracranial reflux in MS patients or even healthy controls whereas the criterion of absence of flow and the criterion regarding stenosis are considered not valid since they are related to normal physiological processes and not pathology. These problems in the criteria have led some researchers to consider the criteria inadequate and more generally the concept of CCSVI flawed. Treatment  All proposed treatments are experimental  Treatment based on the idea of CCSVI is considered experimental.Balloon dilatation of stenosed jugular vein in a MS patient. Stenosis prevents the balloon from inflating (in the middle) while pressure is low. Further trials are required to determine if the benefits, if any, of the procedure outweigh its risks. Most experts, and medical and patients organizations, including the National Multiple Sclerosis Society of the USA or the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE), recommend not using the proposed treatment outside clinical trials until its effectiveness is confirmed by controlled studies. Moreover, the CIRSE has stated that treatment research should begin by a small, placebo- controlled, prospective randomised trial which should be monitored by an independent organization. An exception has been the Society of Interventional Radiology in the US and Canada, which considered research on the effectiveness of CCSVI intervention to be inconclusive as of 2010. In March 2013 a press release indicated that the first prospective, placebo-controlled study of balloon angioplasty for MS had not shown any benefit of the therapy. The study, a phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment, enrolled initially 10 patients that received the treatment and 20 more afterwards that were either allocated to receive angioplasty or a placebo intervention. Kuwait became the first country in the world where treatment of CCSVI, as of 2010, was explicitly allowed by the medical authorities and paid by the state health system. As of 2010, the procedure was performed privately in 40 countries, and, despite existing recommendations, as of 2013 it is believed that over 30,000 patients have undergone the procedure.  Procedures  Balloon angioplasty and stenting have been proposed as treatment options for CCSVI in MS. The proposed treatment has been termed \\"liberation therapy\\" though the name has been criticized for suggesting unrealistic results. Balloon angioplasty in a preliminary, uncontrolled, unblinded study by Zamboni improved symptoms in MS in a minority of treated people. Although the procedure pushes the vein open temporarily, the effect does not persist, supporters advise against using stents. Venous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has proven to be safe but due to its ineffectiveness is not recommended. Adverse effects While the procedure has been reported to be generally safe for MS patients, severe complications related to the angioplasty and stenting that have been reported include intracranial hemorrhage, stent migration into a renal vein, thrombosis and nerve compression syndrome of cranial nerves XI and XII. One death case appeared in the scientific literature, while 3 other deaths have been related to CCSVI treatment in the media. Some United States hospitals have banned the surgical procedure outside clinical trials due to safety concerns until more evidence to support its use is available. In May 2012 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety communication on CCSVI, stating that MS patients undergoing angioplasty and/or stenting to treat CCSVI risk serious injuries or death. Furthermore, it also noted that the benefits of these experimental procedures have not been proven and that studies exploring a link between MS and CCSVI are inconclusive. History Paolo Zamboni described CCSVI in 2008. Venous pathology has been associated with MS for more than a century. Pathologist Georg Eduard Rindfleisch noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around veins. Later, in 1935, Tracy Putnam was able to produce similar lesions in dogs blocking their veins The term \\"chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency\\" was coined in 2008 by Paolo Zamboni, who described it in patients with multiple sclerosis. According to Zamboni, CCSVI had a high sensitivity and specificity differentiating healthy individuals from those with multiple sclerosis. Zamboni's results were criticized because his study was not blinded and his results needed to be verified by further studies. Zamboni had become interested in CCSVI in 1999 when his wife was diagnosed with MS. Society and culture Conflict of interest Paolo Zamboni has patents related to the highly sensitive ultrasound diagnostic systems manufactured by Esaote which, he proposes, should be used to diagnose CCSVI. Moreover, Zamboni's research center has also received support in the form of equipment and technical assistance from this manufacturer. These are potential conflicts of interest that he has never disclosed when publishing scientific articles, which would be against ethical practices of some countries such as the United States. Media CCSVI has received a great deal of attention in all media, the scientific literature and on the Internet. Moreover, the CCSVI case has been considered a good example of how new communication technologies and social media are modifying the traditional relationship between science, politics, medicine, and the general public. In this sense they have played a key role in effectively promoting the theory. Media coverage has been perceived by some as \\"hype\\", with exaggerated claims that have led to excessive expectations. This has been partially attributed to some of the investigators of the theory. Mainstream media initial approximations to Zamboni's theory were enthusiastic and emphasized Zamboni's effort to find a cure for his wife, along with the improvement of some patients after its alleged treatment. Initial difficulty reproducing results connecting MS and CCSVI, combined with reports of secondary effects of the surgical procedure, led to a more cautious discourse proposing that more investigation in the relationship between CCSVI and MS was needed. The first fatality related to CCSVI treatment was a pivotal development in this trend towards a less optimistic media view of the theory. The Internet has been extensively used by patient groups to obtain and disseminate information on CCSVI. People with MS often read extensively about the CCSVI theory and its development on Internet sites, and a search for \\"liberation procedure\\" in Google as of August 2010 yielded more than 2.5 million hits. The Internet has also been used to advertise places where stenting for CCSVI is performed, and to more generally disseminate all the information on CCSVI. Social media have served patient groups in their attempt to pressure official bodies to make decisions favoring funding of clinical trials, or the public coverage of stenting and venoplasty as treatments of MS. Likewise, social media have been accused of creating a division between CCSVI supporters and those who say it does not work. Indeed, they have been repeatedly used by advocates of the CCSVI theory to attack those who were more critical or cautious, most commonly with accusations of being tainted due to commercial relationships with pharmaceutical companies. Many patients who have had the surgical procedure report their improvements on social media websites such as structured patient databases and YouTube. Such stories are only anecdotal evidence of efficacy, and do not constitute a scientific proof of the efficacy of the treatment since, for example, those who have had a positive result are more prone to post their cases than those who had little or no improvement, and the reported improvements in patients' condition can be attributed to the placebo effect. Patients' reasons for not publishing negative results may include embarrassment about the money spent in the procedure without effect and the negative reaction they expect from other people with MS. Caution has been recommended regarding patients' self-reports found on the web. Scientists and physicians transmitted their arguments regarding CCSVI inadequately, especially after the initial rising of the hypothesis. Their communication was characterized by an excessive hesitation and a lack of clear statements, as opposed to CCSVI proponents, who \\"won the communication battle, at least in the early rounds.\\" A positive effect of the important media coverage may be that it forces the world of medical research to be self-critical and give appropriate responses to the questions that globalization of the theory raises, especially among MS sufferers. Reception in Canada While reasons are not completely clear, the CCSVI theory was received differently in Canada than other places. The public interest and number of media appearances were much greater than elsewhere, including Italy, and debate has been heated regarding funding. As an example, by the end of 2009, a public petition to the country health authorities in support of the \\"liberation treatment\\" had received over 17,000 signatures. The debate regarding funding in Canada has been considered to be specially informative as an example of extreme involvement of politics, due to public pressure, in decisions usually governed by scientific evidence. In 2009, the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada committed to funding research on the connection between CCSVI and MS, although later in 2010 it came under criticism for opposing clinical trials of CCSVI therapy. The MS Society of Canada in September 2010 reserved one million dollars toward CCSVI research \\"when a therapeutic trial is warranted and approved.\\" At a political level there have been contradictory positions, with some provinces funding trials, others stating that since therapy is unproven they should wait, and others urging for a pan-Canadian trial. British Columbia, Alberta, and Newfoundland and Labrador funded observational studies in which patients who had already received the treatment were included. Over 2 million dollars were allocated to these studies. The province of Saskatchewan was more aggressive and provided 2.2 million dollars for some of its residents to be included in a clinical trial. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the federal agency responsible for funding health research, recommended in 2010 against funding a pan-Canadian trial of liberation therapy because there was a lack of evidence on the safety or efficacy of the procedure. It suggested a scientific expert working group made up of the principal investigators for the seven MS Society- sponsored studies. The health minister accepted the CIHR recommendation and said that Canada was not going to fund clinical trials. The expert panel was created by the end of 2010 together between the CIHR and the MS Society of Canada. It has been proposed that the creation of this expert panel was partly directed to cope with the high levels of social pressure the CCSVI theory had raised and at the same time try to maintain a scientific perspective in the funding and investigation of CCSVI. The main task of the panel was to monitor the results of the ongoing studies in the relationship between CCSVI and MS and recommend the funding of a clinical trial in case that there was evidence of a true relationship between the two. In 2011, the Canadian federal government announced that they would fund clinical trials of the procedure to widen the veins since CIHR considered that evidence of venous abnormalities in MS was enough for small treatment trials. It has been proposed that the recommendation to fund phase I and II trials instead of a big study was a compromise between the high levels of social and political pressure and the low level of evidence on the theory. Two qualitative studies have investigated the motives and experiences of Canadian patients traveling abroad to get the \\"liberation procedure\\". One of the studies identified three factors contributing to patients going abroad seeking treatment: a loss of faith in the Canadian health system when it did not provide access to CCSVI treatment in Canada, hope in the new treatment as a solution for their worsening health, and trust in the MS community and the organizations, clinics and doctors facilitating or providing the desired operation. Conversely, the other study concluded that sense of community and cooperation (from family, MS groups and the general population) was a key motivating factor. Other motivating factors included media reports, perception of approval from their health providers, the apparent low risk of the operation, or accessibility of the hospital that offered the procedure directly or through a medical tourism company. On the other hand, hesitating factors included the cost and effort required for the operation, the mistrust of foreign health systems, the underlying rationale for the operation, or advice against the procedure from trusted health providers. In 2013, a case-control study found evidence against the involvement of chronic cerebrospinal venous abnormalities in MS. Later in 2013 a study found that vein narrowing appears to be present equally in those with and without MS on ultrasound and catheter venography. The results of the study were described as a \\"death knell\\" for Zamboni's theory.Definitive imaging study finds no link between venous narrowing and multiple sclerosis, University of British Columbia, media release 8 October 2013. Another study released by the University of British Columbia in 2017 was described as a \\"definitive debunking\\" of liberation therapy. Organizations Several national and international organizations have been created to further the research and dissemination of the CCSVI theory, such as the International Society for Neurovascular Disease and the National CCSVI Society of Canada. They are working together with already existing organizations like the International Union of Phlebology (Union internationale de phlébologie-UIP- in French, its original working language) of which Zamboni is a member. The UIP for example proposed that developmental abnormalities were the primary cause of CCSVI. Research  There were further studies aimed at clarifying if there is a relationship between MS and CCSVI. In particular, the US and Canadian MS societies launched seven such studies. Recent reviewers have shown \\"no significant difference in prevalence of CCSVI in people with MS compared to people without MS\\". In 2014 imaging criteria for venous abnormalities were published to help with research on this topic.

The sloping lot is only at street level along Congress and part of Mountfort Street, the rest supported by a stone retaining wall. Its street-facing sides are ringed by iron fencing, with the main entrance on Congress Street, marked by pairs of granite posts. Chain-link fencing runs along the southwestern boundary with abutting properties. The cemetery, which has twelve sections (including special areas for Quakers, Catholics and blacks), is mostly grass, with occasional trees that are generally volunteer growth. It is the oldest historic site in Portland. Established as a public burial ground in 1668, 36 years after European settlers first arrived in the area, it now has more than 4,000 graves, with an estimated further 3,000 people in unmarked plots. The cemetery, which is about in size, was active until about 1860. There are 95 underground tombs, which were built to house about thirty coffins each. The Dead House, which was constructed in 1871, is located inside the front gate. It houses a tomb, built in 1849, to store bodies over the winter when the ground was too frozen to dig. Gallows, from which at least one hanging occurred, and stocks are no longer in place. The retaining walls along Mountfort and Federal Streets date from 1854 and 1868, respectively.

History Raghopur island creation and history is much older than thought as recently Harappan-type bricks from Raghopur Diara has been discovered by landlord during digging for piling work to build a house at the diara, around 10 km north of Patna, the landowner came across thousands of large bricks. He used some and kept the rest as samples out of curiosity. On 4 April 2017, the director of the state archaeological directorate, Atul Verma, visited the place and checked the samples. Vijay Kumar Choudhary archaeologist and executive director of Bihar Heritage Development Society, confirmed Harappan bricks were in the proportion of 1:2:4 in terms of thickness, width and length. He said the state archaeological directorate's move was a step in the right direction to establish that human settlements existed in the area. Raghopur Diara is situated between Chechar in the north and Didarganj in the south, places of archaeological importance. Chechar in Vaishali is a Neolithic site, while remains from the Mauryan period have been found during excavations at Didarganj in Patna. Geography Surrounded by the Ganges on all sides, Raghopur consists mainly of alluvial soil. Every year this area gets submerged by water due to flood by the Ganges. This has been helpful to Raghopur in way that flood also brings new layer of soil that makes this area fertile.

In past years, Karhu also manufactured skis. In 2008, the company was sold to a group of investors that constituted \\"Karhu Holding B.V.\\".

October 1922 The company was established in Helsinki, Finland, in 1916, as \\"AB Sportartiklar Oy\\". In 1920, the company renamed \\"Karhu\\", adopting a bear as its logo. In addition to the discuses and javelins that were Karhu's main products, the company also produced running shoes and track spikes. The Karhu brand featured prominently at the 1920 Antwerp Olympic Games, where Finnish athletes took all three medals in javelin using Karhu javelins, and the \\"Flying Finns\\" took five gold medals on the track wearing Karhu spikes. Four years later, at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Paavo Nurmi won five gold medals in track events \\"wearing a conspicuous pair of white Karhu running spikes\\". In the 1930s Karhu's production expanded to include cross-country and ski jumping skis. During the Winter War and Continuation War, from 1939–1945, Karhu produced snow-camouflage suits, tents and skis for the Finnish military. In 1952, Karhu sold the three stripes trademark it had been using to a then little known German brand called Adidas for the equivalent of 1,600 euros and two bottles of whiskey. In the 1960s Karhu began to use the M-logo, in replacement of the three stripes. The 'M' (that comes from \\"Mestari\\" which means \\"master\\" in Finnish) is still in use on Karhu shoes. During successive years, Karhu's innovations included the first use of nylon and air cushioning in running shoes. The 1960s also saw the development of Karhu's line of pesäpallo (Finnish baseball) equipment. In 1966, the Karhu company changed its name to \\"Oy Urheilu Karhu Sport Ab\\". By 1968, Karhu launched the Trampas, a shoe that came in two versions, one for trainers and the another for casual wear. The shoe was a great success, being used by the Finnish Olympic team, being praised by Arthur Lydiard, who called them \\"the best training shoe in the world\\". A new name change came in 1972 to \\"Karhu-Titan\\", reflecting its strong ice hockey equipment brands Titan (sticks), Koho (protective and goaltender equipment) and Jofa (helmets). By the 1980s the brand had started to struggle and sold off its outdoor shoe division to Merrell and its hockey division to The Hockey Company. However, a collaboration of research and design with the University of Jyväskylä led to the development of \\"Fulcrum technology\\". In 1982, Karhu launched the \\"Albatross\\" shoe model, one of the best-selling sneakers of that time. Two years later, the company launched the basketball shoe \\"Harlem Air\\" model. In 1997, Karhu-Titan's name changed to Karhu Sporting Goods. In 2008, Karhu Sporting Goods sold the Karhu brand to Karhu Holding B.V., a Dutch holding company led by Huub Valkenburg and Jay Duke.

Skis  Market share of Karhu skis were sold in Finland each year, but greatly reduced over past two decades by the fact the same factory also supplies Yoko and Järvinen branded skis and overall ski production in Kitee went down to about 1/10th due to national and global demand decline. The major export markets for Karhu skis were Sweden, Japan, Estonia and Germany.

By 1984 avant had produced thousands of acrylic on paper paintings and plastered them on walls, doors, bus-stops, galleries and museums citywide, concentrated mostly in lower Manhattan. As a group, they were capable of producing hundreds of individual paintings per week, and deployed them in the streets on a regular basis. They also mounted three-dimensional artworks to street sign poles and commandeered bus stop advertising light boxes, replacing the contents with their own original works of art, then relocking the cabinets. Over 40 exhibitions of AVANT's work were held in New York galleries and nightclubs between 1981 and 1984. Over a typical artist-gallery financial dispute, they actually managed to commandeer a gallery in Soho to open the 1982 September season with a self curated exhibition. Another fresh concept was to start an exhibition in the street that would continue into a gallery. They called this the “Drive-In Show,” which started with a dozen numbered oversized paintings pasted high up on a parking lot wall in Soho, and continued up the block in Gabrielle Bryers Gallery starting with painting number 13.

Description Lyside sulphur variation. The top row shows the upperside of the wings and the bottom row shows the underside of the wings. The lyside sulphur is variable. The upperside of the wings is pale yellow, usually with a black bar on the leading edge of the hindwing and a bright yellow patch near the base of the forewing. Some individuals also have black borders along the costa and apex of the forewing. The underside of the wings varies from a greenish color to bright yellow to almost white. Greener individuals have a whitish vein in the center of the hindwing and a bright yellow forewing basal patch. It has a wingspan of . Similar species Similar species in the lyside sulphur's range include Queen Alexandra's sulphur (Colias alexandra), the cloudless sulphur (Phoebis sennae), and the statira sulphur (Aphrissa statira). Queen Alexandra's sulphur has more yellow on the underside of the forewing and has a whitish spot in the center of the hindwing. The cloudless sulphur is larger and is much more yellow. The statira sulphur has a more yellowish upper side and the underside of the wings is pale greenish to white with females having light pinkish markings. Habitat The lyside sulphur may be found in open, subtropical scrub. Flight This butterfly is seen almost all year in southern Texas and is seen from early July to mid-November in Arizona. In Florida there have been scattered sightings from July to October. Life cycle The larva is highly variable. It ranges in color from grass green to blackish green. It may have markings or may be unmarked. Marked individuals usually have dorsal and spiracular silvery stripes.

Capitularies were used in the Frankish kingdom during the Carolingian dynasty by government and administration bodies and covered a variety of topics, sorted into chapters.Frassetto (2003), p. 88. ' is actually just one of many Charlemagne's capitularies that outlined his desire for a well-governed, disciplined Christian Frankish kingdom.McKitterick (2008), p. 237. The reforms issued in these capitularies by Charlemagne during the late 8th century reflect the cultural revival known as the Carolingian Renaissance.Jeep (2001), pp. 5–6.  Charlemagne and his desire for reform Charlemagne (742–814) ruled from 771 until his death, and the Frankish kingdom experienced a period of stability during his reign.Kreis (2009) This was arguably because of his strict and efficient moral and judicial reform and governance, enforced with capitularies like '.McKitterick (2008), p. 307. Indeed, ' was just one step in Charlemagne's goal of Christian institutions, political structures, and subjects within his Frankish kingdom, and it would be continually adapted and reinforced to meet his objectives.McKitterick (2008), p. 240. When Charlemagne came to power, he had two goals; territorial expansion and the conversion of all Franks to Christianity, including those recently added to the kingdom. Charlemagne's desire to extend his empire was inseparable from his desire to extend Christianity,Ganshof (1949), p. 527. so the conquering of other kingdoms was a method often used.Ganshof (1949), p. 521. This Frankish expansion into other realms and their contrast with those people and their religions, for example the arrival of Islam in Spain, has to be considered when considering legal and religious reforms such as ' and the fever in which they were carried out. Charlemagne was the champion of orthodoxy,McKitterick (2008), p. 311. and to address his perceived failings of the church and the moral and spiritual health of the Franks, he set out to reform the church and his subjects with the capitulary '.Ganshof (1949), p. 522.  Reforms  In the ', Charlemagne pronounced that he was a \\"new Josiah\\", and responsible for the moral health and salvation of his subjects,King (1987) highlighting Charlemagne's commitment to the Christianization of the Frankish kingdom. He sought to achieve this by reforming the church in pursuit of the moral reform and discipline of the clergy and other ecclesiastical members with the expectation they would lead their followers by example.Frassetto (2003), p. 1. He also pursued educational reform, requiring monasteries and cathedrals to establish schools to educate boys to read and write in order to make the Bible and other religious texts more accessible and in turn broadening and deepening the spread of Christianity. The schools would also teach religious music, singing and psalms to encourage the spread of the faith, as well as grammar so that religious texts could be revised and edited. To achieve these goals Charlemagne consulted with clerical advisorsMcKitterick (2008), p. 239. and rulings from earlier council decisions such as the Dionysio-Hadriana collection of canon law to draw up the 82 chapters of the . Chapters addressed the expected behavior, responsibilities, and compliance of all members of society. The clergy and monks were charged with the establishment of schools, guidelines were given regarding the basic knowledge expected of all Christians, and stipulations were made concerning weights and measures.McKitterick (2008), p. 240. Charlemagne also championed the use of Roman liturgy, and ordained the memorization and use of Roman chants in the '.McKitterick (2008), p. 341.  Distribution and reception Capitularies were sent to ', or officials supervising the administration of different parts of the Frankish kingdom, for their local enforcement.McKitterick (2008), p. 263. The ' were to represent and watch out for the king's royal interests, and report back to him. The ' would compile books from parts of different capitularies and other laws and religious texts indicating what was important to them and what they found useful in governing their districts.McKitterick (2008), pp. 264, 266. The wide distribution and acceptance of ' is traceable by the large number of surviving manuscripts from the books of the ' that include parts of ', found across the entire Frankish kingdom,McKitterick (2008), p. 243. showing up as early as the late 8th century. The reception and implementation of ' is also tangible by examining the effect it had on the Carolingian Renaissance, with Charlemagne's edicts of moral reform spurring on the resurgence of the education of the arts.  Role in the Carolingian Renaissance Charlemagne's early capitularies such as ' were the foundation for the Carolingian Renaissance, establishing his religious and educational aspirations for the kingdom. Charlemagne's most significant contribution to the Carolingian Renaissance was the revival of learning, especially among the clergy, most of whom were barely literate. Before the surge of education following the ' and subsequent Carolingian Renaissance, it was difficult for the Frankish people to connect with Christianity and the church. Peasant life was very hard; the people were illiterate and Latin, the language of the church, was not their native language, making Christianity and the Bible difficult to access. Nobles also were largely uneducated and uncultured, with few devoted Christians among them. Only the clergy were consistent in having some level of education, and thus they had the best understanding and exposure to the Bible and the full extent of Christianity. The schools, which the Admonitio ordered established by the monasteries and cathedrals, began a tradition of higher learning in Carolingian Europe, leading the revival known as the Carolingian Renaissance.Contreni (1995), p. 726. The fulfillment of ' meant that the study of language, rhetoric and grammar in these institutions,Contreni (1995), p. 739. as well as the standardizing of writing scripture and Latin, was undertaken in order to make religious texts and books accessible to the clergy, as well as their correction and standardization. However this strengthened all forms of Carolingian literature, and book production,Contreni (1995), p. 746. as well as developments in law, historical writing, and uses of poetry all flourished in these schools.Contreni (1995), p. 748. In fact, the capitularies themselves, and the level of language they use, are examples of the increasing importance of writing within the Frankish kingdom. As well as language, the ' ordered other arts such as numbers and arithmetic, ratios, taxes, measure, architecture, geometry, and astrology to be taught, leading to developments in each field and their application within society. Charlemagne pushed for an educated clergy who could help lead reform,Contreni (1995), p. 709. because it was his belief that the study of arts would aid them in understanding sacred texts, which they could then pass on to their followers.Contreni (1995), p. 747.

An operationally responsive business process or IT solution is one that reacts quickly and effectively to a wide range of business events as they occur, and is also one that is managed in such a way as to be rapidly and effectively evolved in response to changes in the business environment itself so as to drive both consistency and value of business outcomes. The key difference between operational responsiveness and related concepts like process optimization and agility is the implied continuous improvement of business results, as opposed to merely continuous improvement of process metrics or the cost of implementing changes. Improving operational responsiveness requires significant changes in either the elements linked together in a functional system, the linkages between subsystems, or both. This is true whether the system is organizational, technology-based, and so on. To meet these objectives, the business owner of the process or solution must regularly assess its activities and business performance and then execute well-informed decisions regarding adjustments to its operation. An operationally responsive process or solution must directly support these assessment activities by providing relevant information to feed the decision- making process. Operational responsiveness can also be applied to organizations. An operationally responsive organization is one that is consistently effective in making appropriate and timely decisions - about individual customer requests, about short term fluctuations in operating conditions, about changes in the overall business environment - and then executing on those decisions. This means not only reacting quickly, but routinely applying all of the relevant available information to make the best possible decisions., Steven C. Prenovitz's article on translating strategy into operational results.  Qualitative attributes of operationally responsive business solutions  * Operates reliably and security. Each request is protected against loss or delay. Unauthorized access and control is prevented. * Uses situation awareness. Information about each business action and the relevant business environment is used to help the system respond to complex business situations correctly. * Includes monitoring and support. Sufficient instrumentation and monitoring is included so problems can be identified and corrected quickly. * Provides information used to inform business decisions. Solutions must capture enough relevant information to provide the business with a complete picture for ongoing monitoring and analysis, and to support business decisions about individual activities and future evolution of the business process.  Related contexts  The term has been used in several other areas. Operational responsiveness has been used in a military context to describe both the ability of a military unit or operation to respond quickly and effectively to changes in the local situation as they occur, and the ability for the central leadership to quickly provide information, resources, or new capabilities to the field, typically in response to expressed needs of local commanders.Operationally Responsive Space Office, the US Air Force's Operationally Responsive Space Office.Joint multichannel trunking and switching system, an example of using operational responsiveness to talk about adapting to changing (and possibly degrading) conditions. The key concepts of operational responsiveness have emerged as critical to supply chain management as the practice has evolved. The operational dimension of supply chain management (the other dimensions are strategic and tactical) is focused on daily production and distribution planning, and being responsive to fluctuations in production and demand is a fundamental objective. The other aspects of operational responsiveness are apparent in the strategic and tactical activities as well, where longer-term plans are adjusted according to an evaluation of current and anticipated changes in the overall business environment.Supply Chain Management  Operational responsiveness articles  * \\"The Operational Responsiveness of Business\\" * \\"Operational Responsiveness: Ideas from Progress Software\\" * \\"Enterprise Architecture in a Down Economy\\" * \\"Independent Research Firm Names Progress Apama as Standout in CEP Report\\"  References  Category:Strategic management ","title":"Operational responsiveness"},{"id":"24133330","text":"The kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard occurred on June 10, 1991, in Meyers, California. Dugard was 11 years old when she was abducted from a street while walking to a school bus stop. Searches began immediately after Dugard's disappearance, but no reliable leads were generated, though her stepfather, Carl Probyn, witnessed her kidnapping and chased the kidnappers on his mountain bike. Dugard remained missing until 2009, when a convicted sex offender, Phillip Garrido, visited the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, accompanied by two girls, now known to be his daughters, on August 24 and 25 that year. The unusual behavior of the trio sparked an investigation that led Garrido's parole officer to order him to take the two girls to a parole office in Concord, California, on August 26. He was accompanied by a woman who was finally identified as Dugard herself. Phillip and Nancy Garrido were arrested by police after Dugard's reappearance. On April 28, 2011, they pleaded guilty to kidnapping and assaulting Dugard. Law enforcement officers believe Dugard was later kept in concealed tents, sheds, and lean-tos in an area behind the Garridos' house at 1554 Walnut Avenue in Antioch, California, for 18 years. During her confinement, Dugard gave birth to two daughters, who were 11 and 15 at the time of her reappearance. On June 2, 2011, Garrido was sentenced to 431 years to life imprisonment; his wife, Nancy, also received 36 years to life. Garrido is a person of interest in at least one other San Francisco Bay Area missing-person case. In 2010, the State of California awarded the Dugard family . In 2011, Dugard wrote an autobiography titled A Stolen Life. Her second book, Freedom: My Book of Firsts, was published in 2016. According to interviews, Dugard remains single, focusing on herself, her children, and her family. Her exact location has not been told to the public.  Background of kidnappers  The primary offender in the case, Phillip Greg Garrido, was born in Pittsburg, California, on April 5, 1951. He grew up in Brentwood, where he graduated from Liberty High School in 1969. In 1972, Garrido was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, but the case did not go to trial after the girl declined to testify. In 1973, Garrido married high school classmate Christine Murphy, who said he was abusive. Murphy alleged that Garrido kidnapped her when she tried to leave him. In 1976, Garrido kidnapped 25-year-old Katherine Callaway in South Lake Tahoe, California. He took her to a Reno, Nevada, warehouse, where he raped her for five and a half hours. When a police officer noticed a car parked outside the unit and then the broken lock on the warehouse door, he knocked on the door and was greeted by Garrido. Callaway then emerged and asked for help. Garrido was promptly arrested. He was charged and convicted of crimes in both federal and state courts. In a 1976 court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, Garrido was diagnosed as a \\"sexual deviant and chronic drug abuser\\". The psychiatrist recommended that a neurological examination be conducted because Garrido's chronic drug use could be \\"responsible in part\\" for his \\"mixed\\" or \\"multiple\\" sexual deviation. He was then evaluated by a neurologist. The diagnostic impression was: \\"normal neurological examination\\". In court, Garrido testified that he masturbated in his car by the side of elementary and high schools while watching girls. He was convicted on March 9, 1977 and began serving a 50-year federal sentence on June 30, 1977, at Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas. At Leavenworth, Garrido met Nancy Bocanegra, the secondary offender in Dugard's kidnapping, who was visiting another prisoner, her uncle, at the time. On October 5, 1981, he and Bocanegra were married at Leavenworth. On January 22, 1988, Garrido was released from Leavenworth to Nevada State Prison, where he served seven months of a five-years-to-life Nevada sentence. He was transferred to federal parole authorities in Contra Costa on August 26, 1988. In Antioch, the Garridos lived in the home of his elderly mother, who suffered from dementia. As a parolee, he was monitored, later wore a GPS-enabled ankle bracelet, and was visited many times by parole officers, local sheriff's deputies, and federal agents. In 2009, his father, Manuel Garrido, said his son was a \\"good boy\\" as a child, but changed radically after a serious motorcycle accident as a teenager. Garrido later turned to drug useprimarily crystal meth and LSD. Manuel Garrido died in 2011 at the age of 89.  Abduction  In September 1990, Dugard and her family moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because they thought it was a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade, and because of her shyness, was worrying about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna, who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a gray car approached her. She thought that the man driving the car would ask for directions. When the man, Phillip Greg Garrido, rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. Garrido's wife, Nancy, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted in and out of consciousness during the three-hour drive to the Garrido home in Antioch 120 miles away. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom. The district attorney in the Dugard case believed that Nancy had scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido. Carl Probyn witnessed the abduction of his stepdaughter from within sight of their home. He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, but was unable to overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Ken Slayton, Dugard's biological father, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion. By the time the Garridos arrived at their home in an unincorporated area in Contra Costa County, they had removed Dugard's clothing, leaving only a butterfly- shaped ring that she hid from them for the next 18 years. Taking her from their car onto their property, Garrido placed a blanket over Dugard's head and ushered her into an area of his backyard where sheds and storage units stood, placing her inside a tiny one that was soundproofed. After he finished raping her for the first time he left her naked in the structure, which he bolted shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her in the structure, bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.  Search effort  Within hours of Dugard's disappearance, local and national media converged on South Lake Tahoe to cover the story. Within days, dozens of local volunteers assisted in the search effort, which involved nearly every resource within the community. Within weeks, tens of thousands of fliers and posters were mailed to businesses throughout the United States. Since her favorite color was pink, the town was blanketed in pink ribbons as a constant reminder of her disappearance, and as a demonstration of support for her family by the community. Terry Probyn founded a group called Jaycee's Hope, which directed the volunteer and fundraising efforts. Cassette tapes of the song \\"Jaycee Lee\\" along with T-shirts, sweatshirts, and buttons were sold to raise money for poster materials, postage, printing, and related expenses. Child Quest International and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children were involved in the effort. A reward was offered, which was noted on the posters and fliers. The kidnapping case attracted nationwide attention and was featured on the June 14, 1991, episode of the television show America's Most Wanted. The ensuing months and years were a continuous effort of child safety awareness, fundraising events, and candlelight vigils marking Dugard's disappearance keeping her story before the public.    Captivity  Immediately after he kidnapped her, Garrido forced Dugard into a shower with him, which was the first time she had ever been exposed to an unclothed man. A week after Garrido kidnapped Dugard, he raped her for the first time while she was still in handcuffs, which she wore during her first week in captivity. During that period, Dugard's only human contact was Garrido, who sometimes brought her fast food and talked to her. He provided a bucket for her to use to relieve herself. At one point, he provided her with a television, but she could not watch the news and was unaware of the publicized search for her. Almost a month and a half after her kidnapping, by Dugard's recollection, Garrido moved her to a larger room next door, where she was handcuffed to a bed. He explained that the \\"demon angels\\" let him take her and that she would help him with his sexual problems because society had ignored him. He went on methamphetamine binges he called \\"runs\\", during which he would make Dugard put on make up and dress her up and spend time with her while cutting out figures from pornographic magazines. He made her listen for the voices he said he could hear from the walls. Garrido also often professed the belief that he was a chosen servant of God. These binges would end with him sobbing and apologizing to Dugard alternating with threats to sell her to people who would put her in a cage. Seven months into her captivity, Garrido introduced Dugard to his wife, Nancy, who brought the child a stuffed animal and chocolate milk, and engaged in the same tearful apologies to her. Though Dugard craved the woman's approval at the time, in a 2011 ABC News interview she stated that Nancy was just as manipulative as Garrido. Dugard related that Nancy alternated between motherly concern and coldness and cruelty, expressing her jealousy of Dugard, whom she regarded as the one to blame for her predicament. Dugard characterized Nancy, who worked as a nursing home aide, as \\"evil\\" and \\"twisted\\". When Garrido was returned to prison for failing a drug test, Nancy replaced her husband as Dugard's jailer. The Garridos manipulated Dugard further by presenting her, on two occasions, with kittens that would later \\"mysteriously vanish\\". When Garrido discovered that she was signing her real name in a journal that she kept about the kittens, she was forced to tear out the page with her name on it, the last time she would be permitted to say or write her name until her captivity ended 18 years later. She was never allowed to see a doctor or dentist.  Pregnancy and children  Almost three years into her captivity, the Garridos began to allow Dugard freedom from her handcuffs for periods of time, though they kept her locked in the bolted room. On April 3, 1994, Easter Sunday, they gave her cooked food for the first time. They informed her that they believed that she was pregnant. Dugard, 13 years old and four and a half months pregnant, had learned of the link between sex and pregnancy from television. While Dugard was pregnant with her first daughter, Terry Probyn was holding rummage sales to pay for private investigators and distributing a million flyers across the United States featuring a sketch artist's image of a teenaged Dugard. Dugard watched programs on childbirth, in preparation for the birth of her first daughter, which occurred on August 18, 1994. Her second daughter was born on November 13, 1997. Dugard took care of her daughters using information learned from television, working to protect them from Garrido, who continued his enraged rants and lectures. Neighbor Patrick McQuaid said that he recalls, as a child, meeting Dugard through a fence in the Garridos' yard soon after the kidnapping. He said that she had identified herself by the name \\"Jaycee\\" and that when asked if she lived there or was just visiting, she answered that she lived there. At that point, Garrido came out and took her back indoors. He eventually built an eight foot tall fence around the backyard and set up a tent for Dugard, the first time that she was allowed to walk outside since her kidnapping. She coped with her continued captivity by planting flowers in a garden and homeschooling her daughters. At one point, Garrido informed Dugard that to pacify his wife, Jaycee and her daughters were to address Nancy as their mother, and that Jaycee was to teach her daughters that she, Jaycee, was their older sister. When Dugard and her daughters were eventually allowed to come into contact with other people, this fiction was continued. Garrido operated a print shop where Dugard acted as the graphic artist. Ben Daughdrill, a customer of Garrido's printing business, claimed that he met and spoke by telephone with Dugard and that she did excellent work. During this time, Dugard had access to the business phone and an email account. Another customer indicated that she never hinted to him about her childhood abduction or her true identity. Garrido kept a blog associated with what he called \\"God's Desire Church\\". In the blog, he claimed that he had the power to control sound with his mind. Garrido asked several people, including customers, to sign testimonials confirming that they witnessed his ability to \\"control sound with my mind\\" and a device he developed \\"for others to witness this \\". Law enforcement officers believe that in 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what has been described as a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a -high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings; the enclosure also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law enforcement officers visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered the front door to talk to people, but never stated there was a problem or attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.  Missed rescue opportunities  * Police failed to make the connection that Jaycee Lee Dugard was kidnapped south of South Lake Tahoe, the same location as Garrido's 1976 kidnapping and rape of Katherine Callaway Hall. * On April 22, 1992, less than a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller reported that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994. * In June 2002, the fire department responded to a report of a juvenile with a shoulder injury that occurred in a swimming pool at the Garridos' home. This information was not relayed to the parole office, which had no record of either a juvenile or a swimming pool at the Garridos' address. * In 2006, one of Garrido's neighbors called 9-1-1 to inform them that there were tents in the backyard with children living there and that Garrido was \\"psychotic\\" with sexual addictions. A deputy sheriff spoke with Garrido at the front of the house for about 30 minutes and left, after telling Garrido that there would be a code violation if people were living outside on the property. (After Dugard was found in August 2009, the local Contra Costa County Sheriff, Warren E. Rupf, issued an apology to the victims in a news conference.) * On November 4, 2009, the California Office of the Inspector General issued a report that enumerated lapses by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation that had contributed to Dugard's continued captivity. The central finding was that Garrido was incorrectly classified as needing only low-level supervision; all other lapses derived from that mistake. In his report, the inspector general detailed an instance in which a parole agent encountered a 12-year-old girl at the home, but accepted Garrido's explanation that \\"she was his brother's daughter and [the agent] did nothing to verify it,\\" despite the fact that a call to Garrido's brother verified that he did not have children.  Reappearance  On August 24, 2009, Garrido visited the San Francisco office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and left a four-page essay containing his ideas about religion and sexuality, suggesting that he had discovered a solution to problem behaviors like his past crimes. The essay described how he had cured his criminal sexual behaviors and how that information could be used to assist in curing other sexual predators by “controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts\\". On the same day, he went to a University of California police office with Dugard's two daughters, seeking permission to hold a special event on campus as a part of his \\"God's Desire\\" program. He spoke with special-events manager Lisa Campbell; she perceived his behavior as \\"erratic\\" and felt that the girls were \\"sullen and submissive.\\" She asked Garrido to make an appointment for the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. Officer Ally Jacobs ran a background check and discovered that Garrido was a registered sex offender on federal parole for kidnapping and rape. Garrido and the girls returned for their appointment at 2 p.m. the following day, and Jacobs attended the meeting. The girls appeared to Jacobs to be pale, as if they had not been exposed to sunlight, and she felt that their behavior was unusual. Garrido's several parole violations were a basis for an arrest, so Jacobs phoned the parole office to relay her concerns, leaving a report on voicemail.   After hearing Jacobs' recorded message, two parole agents drove to the Garridos' house later that day. Upon arrival, they handcuffed him and searched the house, finding only his wife Nancy and his elderly mother at home. Then, the parole agents drove him back to the parole office. En route, Garrido said that the girls who had accompanied him to UC Berkeley \\"were the daughters of a relative,” and that he had had permission from their parents to take them to the university. Although a month before, the parole office had barred Garrido from associating with minors, and although Berkeley was from the Garridos' Contra Costa residence — in excess of the limit he was allowed to travel from his home without his parole agent's permission — nothing was done about these violations. After reviewing his file with a supervisor, they drove Garrido home and ordered him to report to the office again the next day to discuss his visit to UC Berkeley, and to follow up on the office's concerns about the two girls. Garrido arrived at the parole office in Concord, California, on August 26 with his wife, Nancy, the two girls, and Dugard, who was introduced as \\"Allissa\\".While some sources give the spelling of the name as \\"Alyssa\\", others such as the August 29, 2009 Daily Telegraph story give it as \\"Allissa\\". Dugard herself states on page 151 of her memoir, \\"After a couple of days of thinking, I decide on my new name and tell Garrido and Nancy my choice. I say I want to be called Allissa. I used to love to watch Who's the Boss? and my favorite actress is Alyssa Milano. But I want a different spelling. I want it spelled A-L-L-I-S-S-A. This is what the girls [her daughters] will grow up calling me.\\" The parole officer decided to separate Garrido from the women and girls to obtain their identification. Maintaining her false identity as \\"Allissa\\", Dugard told investigators that the girls were her daughters. Although she indicated that she was aware that Garrido was a convicted sex offender, she stated that he was a \\"changed man\\", a \\"great person\\", and was \\"good with her kids\\", comments that were echoed by the two girls. When pressed for details that would confirm her identity, Dugard became \\"extremely defensive\\" and \\"agitated\\", demanding to know why she was being \\"interrogated\\", and subsequently stated that she was a battered wife from Minnesota in hiding from her abusive husband. The parole officer eventually called the Concord police. Upon the arrival of a police sergeant, Garrido admitted he had kidnapped and raped her. Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard showed signs of Stockholm syndrome. In a 2016 ABC News interview with Diane Sawyer, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were her only means of surviving, saying, \\"The phrase [Stockholm Syndrome] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors...Well, it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe that I was in love with this captor and wanted to stay with him. I mean, that is so far from the truth that it makes me want to throw up...I adapted to survive my circumstance.\\" Repeatedly during this segment of the interview, she stated that, as a way to survive, and hoping to end abuse, many victims are forced to sympathize with their captors. Garrido and his wife were placed under arrest. An FBI agent put Dugard on the telephone with her mother, Terry Probyn. Dugard retained custody of her children and was soon reunited with her mother. *  Aftermath   Reunion and afterward  Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, and a former business associate of the Garridos, Cheyvonne Molino, have commented that Dugard's children looked healthy. Tina Dugard said that upon her meeting them after their escape, they \\"always appeared and behaved like normal kids\\". Molino said of the times that she met them while they were captive \\"that in her presence the girls never acted robotically\\" and didn't wear unusual clothing. In the days following Dugard's return, Carl Probyn, her stepfather, confirmed that Dugard and her daughters were in good health and intelligent, their reunion was going well, and they were proceeding slowly. He said his stepdaughter had developed a significant emotional bond with Garrido, and the two daughters cried when they learned of their father's arrest. Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, said Dugard's daughters are clever, articulate, curious girls who have a bright future ahead of them. Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Dugard's reappearance is an important event for families of other long-term missing children, because it shows that hope remains even in long-term cases. Notable abduction survivor Elizabeth Smart has stressed the importance of focusing on the future with a positive attitude as an effective approach to accepting what has happened. Shawn Hornbeck, another abduction survivor, also commented on the case, noting: \\"Coming out of what she's had to endure is like entering a new world. It's like a door has opened for her and she's emerged from a world that's black and white into one that's full of color.\\" He opined that she was brainwashed, would feel angry, and now needs to move on with her life. Three weeks after her release, Dugard asked for the pets that were raised in the home. On October 14, 2009, People published the first verified photo of Jaycee Dugard as an adult on its cover. Dugard's memoir, A Stolen Life: A Memoir, was published on July 12, 2011, by Simon & Schuster. Dugard began animal therapy by riding or petting horses with her mother Terry and her sister Shayna.  Police investigations  Following the arrest, police searched the Garrido house extensively for evidence of other crimes. Because Garrido had access to his neighbor's house, it was also searched for evidence. Police also searched the homes and business of one of Garrido's printing business clients. Police agencies from Hayward and Dublin, California, conducted searches of the Garridos' property for evidence pertaining to missing girls from those communities, but turned up no clues. In July 2011, Hayward police announced that Garrido has not been eliminated as a suspect and is still a person of interest in the abduction case of Michaela Garecht. Garecht was kidnapped in 1988 and Hayward is from the Garridos' Antioch home.  Garrido's statements  On August 27, 2009, KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California, interviewed Garrido in his jail cell by telephone. During the interview, Garrido said, \\"In the end, this is going to be a powerful, heartwarming story\\" because, in his version of events: Investigators at the Garridos' Contra Costa home Garrido repeatedly told the reporter how he \\"filed documents\\" with the FBI on August 24, 2009, which, when they were published, would cause people to \\"fall over backwards\\", and that he could not reveal more because he \\"had to protect law enforcement\\", and \\"what happened\\" ... was \\"something that humans have not understood well\\". In the interview, Garrido denied he had ever harmed Dugard's two daughters. He said their births changed his life and, saying, \\"they slept in my arms every single night since birth. I never touched them.\\" On August 28, 2009, FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler confirmed that Garrido had indeed left the documents with the agency, as he had claimed, but declined to discuss further details. The document, titled Origin of Schizophrenia Revealed, was eventually released by the FBI. It is about stopping schizophrenics from turning violent and controlling sounds with the human mind.  Legal proceedings  On August 28, 2009, Garrido and his wife pleaded not guilty to charges including kidnapping, rape, and false imprisonment. The case was prosecuted in El Dorado County, by elected District Attorney Vern R. Pierson and Assistant District Attorney James A Clinchard. A bail review/pre- preliminary hearing was held September 14, 2009, at the El Dorado County Superior Court in Placerville, California. At the hearing, Superior Court Judge Douglas Phimister set bail for Garrido's wife Nancy at . However, there was a no-bail parole hold on Garrido. The judge initially kept Nancy in custody on a no-bail hold, but she was granted bail at a later date. At the September 14 hearing, Phimister also granted a request from Garrido's attorney to have a psychologist or psychiatrist appointed to conduct a confidential evaluation. Such examinations can be used by the defense to assist in case preparation, and additional mental health examinations can be ordered at subsequent phases in the proceedings. On October 29, 2009, a short hearing was held to set a date for the next pre-preliminary hearing when issues such as discovery were to be discussed. This hearing occurred on December 11, 2009. Katie Callaway Hall, whom Garrido kidnapped and raped in 1976, appeared in the courtroom at the October and December hearings. She did not speak during either proceeding. On November 5, 2009, Phimister ordered Nancy's defense attorney, Gilbert Maines, to be removed from the case. According to a posting on the court's website, the decision occurred in review of \\"confidential evidence\\" that has not been disclosed to the public, and details of the proceedings were kept sealed. The decision was immediately stayed until November 30, 2009. On November 12, 2009, Phimister appointed Stephen A. Tapson as interim counsel for Nancy. Gilbert Maines appealed the decision and received a favorable ruling by the California Third District Court of Appeal on December 15, 2009. On December 22, 2009, the same court gave the El Dorado Superior Court until January 2010 to respond to the ruling. Both Gilbert Maines and Stephen Tapson appeared at the discovery hearing on December 11, 2009. A hearing was held on January 21, 2010. At that hearing, Maines was removed from the case and Tapson was appointed defense counsel for Nancy. In addition, bail, in the amount of , was set for Nancy. At a press conference on February 28, 2011, Tapson said that Nancy and Phillip Garrido had both made a 'full confession' in the case. The development came as lawyers for both sides reopened discussions on a possible plea deal that had the potential to obviate the need for a trial. Nancy's attorney acknowledged that she was facing \\"241 years, eight months to life\\" and that he was working for a reduced sentence in the 30-year range. He stated that the prosecutor had acknowledged that Phillip was a master manipulator and that Nancy was under both his influence and that of substances during the period of Dugard's kidnapping, so should receive some consideration while alluding to parallels with kidnap victim Patty Hearst and to Stockholm syndrome. On Thursday, April 7, 2011, instead of pleading guilty, as had been expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended grand jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos. On April 28, 2011, the Garridos pleaded guilty to kidnapping and rape by force. On June 2, 2011, Phillip was sentenced to 431 years to life imprisonment; Nancy received 36 years to life imprisonment and both will be eligible for parole in August 2034. Phillip was imprisoned in California State Prison, Corcoran, while Nancy was incarcerated at Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla. Dugard did not attend the sentencing, instead sending a written message with her mother to read aloud in court.  Settlement with the State of California  In July 2010, the State of California approved a US$20million settlement with Jaycee Dugard to compensate her for: \\"various lapses by the Corrections Department [that contributed to] Dugard's continued captivity, ongoing sexual assault and mental and/or physical abuse\\". The settlement, part of AB1714, was approved by the California State Assembly by a 70 to 2 vote, and by the California State Senate by a 30 to 1 vote. San Francisco County Superior Court Judge Daniel Weinstein, who mediated the settlement, stated that the settlement was reached to avoid a lawsuit, which would be a: \\"greater invasion of privacy and greater publicity for the state\\". The bill was signed by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on July 9.  Lawsuit against the United States  On September 22, 2011, Dugard filed a lawsuit in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip when he was a federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal government that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido at the time he was placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable. On August 26, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed Dugard's civil claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). In a 2–1 decision authored by Judge John B. Owens, the court ruled that the federal government's sovereign immunity was not waived because the U.S. is only liable \\"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances\\" under state law. In this case, because the U.S. would not be liable under California law, Dugard could not prevail on her FTCA claim. Chief District Court Judge William Smith again dissented, stating that he believed that the majority misinterpreted California law, as the cases cited by the majority only involved FTCA liability in rehabilitation centers.  In media  * Jaycee Dugard documented her life in captivity in a book, A Stolen Life: A Memoir, which she wrote as part of her therapy with Rebecca Bailey, who specializes in post-trauma family reunification. Dugard says she wrote the book, which was published in July 2011, to assist other survivors of sexual abuse. A few days before the book was released, Dugard gave her first extensive television interview taped in Ojai, California, to ABC's Diane Sawyer. * An American crime show on the Investigation Discovery network titled Wicked Attraction aired an episode about Phillip and Nancy Garrido, which detailed Dugard's kidnapping and recovery. * A documentary that aired in October 2009 on Channel 4 in Britain titled Captive for 18 Years: Jaycee Lee focused on the story of Dugard's kidnapping, recovery, and the beginnings of the trial including interviews with Jaycee's stepfather. * Dugard was awarded a Lifetime Leadership honor at the third annual The DVF Awards on March 9, 2012, for her courage and her JAYC Foundation, which provides support to families dealing with abduction and other losses. * Dugard's second book, Freedom: My Book of Firsts, was released on July 12, 2016, by Simon & Schuster. The book focuses on her life since the publication of A Stolen Life and her recovery and reintegration into the world. She was again interviewed by Diane Sawyer a few days before publication. * The case was covered by Casefile True Crime Podcast on September 17, 2016.

Joaquín Ruiz-Giménez Cortés (Hoyo de Manzanares, Madrid, 2 August 1913 - Madrid, 27 August 2009) was a Spanish politician and jurist. He was minister of Education under Franco (1951-1955) but he drifted apart from the Francoist State since 1956 and, adopting a Christian Democrat position, steadily started to promote a quiet transition to democracy, especially through Cuadernos para el Diálogo magazine. He was considered one of the most relevant figures of the moderate inner opposition to Francoism. Failing to play a relevant role during the 1977 democratic elections, he was later elected as the first Spanish Ombudsman. Biography Early life Ruiz-Giménez was son of Joaquín Ruiz Jiménez, Liberal politician who was minister twice under Alfonso XIII and mayor of Madrid. While student at the University of Madrid, he participated actively in the students' catholic organizations and in 1935 he was elected secretary- general of the National Catholic Students Confederation. After the Civil War broke out he was imprisoned several times, but finally released he sought asylum at the Panamanian embassy, and thus he was evacuated to Marseilles via Valencia. Then, he joined the Nationalist Army and served in the front of Segovia, Teruel and Maestrazgo. After the war, he graduated in Arts and held a doctorate in Law. He was appointed councilor at the Madrid city council and the same time he was Law professor at the University of Madrid. He was elected president of the Pax Romana organization between 1939 and 1946. He collaborated actively in the redaction of the Fuero de los Españoles, i.e. a sort of bill of rights promulgated by Franco in 1945. He was appointed director of the Hispanic Culture Institute (1946-1948) and ambassador to the Holy See (1948-1951), where he negotiated the terms of the 1953 Concordat. From Francoist minister to Christian Democrat dissident Ruiz-Giménez in 1954 In 1951, caudillo Franco appointed him minister of National Education. He established a special commission to rehabilitate some teachers and scholars who were previously expelled from their tenures by the Francoism. His political stance was gradually sympathetic toward the Christian Democracy. In 1956 he confronted the minister of Interior about a students' riot and he was finally dismissed. Franco appointed him afterwards National Counselor with seat in the Parliament. He resigned from this office in 1965. Meanwhile, in 1963 he founded Cuadernos para el Diálogo, a political and cultural magazine that was very relevant for the Spanish political life of the 1960s and 1970s because it hosted the moderate debate about the future evolution of Spain toward a more pluralistic, participative and European-minded situation. Cuadernos para el Diálogo was the most dissident option within the legal narrow framework of freedom of speech allowed during the last decades of Franco's reign. Ruiz-Giménez himself was considered the leader of the Spanish Christian Democrats left wing. In June 1975 he joined the underground Democratic Convergence Platform, which gathered a wide array of anti-Francoist organizations, including Social Democrats and Communists. Nevertheless, the Christian Democracy had very little option during the first democratic elections in 1977, as its political room was occupied mainly by the Suárez's UCD. Ruiz-Giménez's Democratic Left joined the Christian Democratic Federation coalition, that dissolved after its meager 1 per cent of the ballots. First Spanish Ombudsman After his withdrawal from the political forefront, Ruiz- Giménez was appointed Ombudsman, the first one in holding this office in Spain (1982-1987). During his later years, he enjoyed a great prestige among both left and right. He involved in several humanitarian and human-rights NGOs, presided the Spanish Committee of UNICEF (1989-2001), vice-presided the Spanish Commission of Relief to Refugees, and has been awarded and decorated several times for his philanthropic activity.

He had two sons, Jacques Philippe Ledru (1754–1832), a member of the French National Academy of Medicine and a mayor of Fontenay-aux-Roses, and Jacques Auguste Ledru, an inspector of pawn-shops. The latter is the father of Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin, a lawyer and a French politician. Nicolas-Philippe Ledru styled himself Comus after the Greek god of mirth and revelry, and entertained royalty, aristocrats, and the general public with his scientific experiments. He traveled extensively throughout Europe demonstrating his tricks and acquired a huge reputation. He had an office in Paris where he performed various experiments for the public on sound, light, electricity, magnetism, incompressibility of water and so on. At his office he also introduced tricks of illusion, such as a female robot getting dressed when asked, a small face with eyes taking on the color of the pupil of the one who looked at it, an artificial hand writing thoughts of a spectator, a \\"siren\\" answering questions and so on. Comus occasionally introduced his tricks at the court of Louis XVI, and in May 1777 he gave a performance in Paris for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor.Journal de Paris, 3 juin 1777, Journal de physique, janvier 1778, pp. 49-56.. Apart from demonstrating magic acts, he devised a new system for nautical maps and an application of electricity for therapeutic purposes for illness of the nervous system or, simply, epilepsy. Louis XV, who appointed him his physician, gave him the title Professeur de Physique des Enfants de France. Louis XVI authorized him to practice at his new hospice Médico-Électrique. Comus was imprisoned during the Terror but survived the guillotine. He died in 1807 a wealthy man. His fortune ultimately descended to his grandson Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin.

It was performed by men and women.Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae xiv:30. p. 631. It is comparable to the geranos (γερανός), the ritual \\"crane dance\\" associated with Theseus. A chorus of singers at the festivals of Apollo usually danced around the altar, while several other persons were appointed to accompany the action of the song with an appropriate mimic performance. Hyporchema was thus a lyric dance, and often passed into the playful and comic, whence AthenaeusAthenaeus, xiv:30. p. 630, &c.; compares it with the cordax of comedy. It had, according to the supposition of Müller, like all the music and poetry of the Dorians, originated in Crete, but was at an early period introduced in the island of Delos, where it seems to have continued to be performed down to the time of Lucian.Athen. i. p. 15 ; Lucian, de Saltat. 16; compare Muller, Dor. ii. 8. § 14. A similar kind of dance was the geranos (crane dance), which Theseus on his return from Crete was said to have performed in Delos, and which was customary in this island as late as the time of Plutarch.Plutarch, Life of Theseus 21. The leader of this dance was called geranoulkos.Hesychius of Miletus, entry on geranoulkos. It was performed with blows, and with various turnings and windings, and was said to be an imitation of the windings of the Cretan labyrinth. When the chorus was at rest, it formed a semicircle, with leaders at the two wings.Pollux, iv. 101. The poems or songs which were accompanied by the hyporchema were likewise called hyporchemata. The first poet to whom such poems are ascribed was Thaletas of Crete: their character must have been in accordance with the playfulness of the dance which bore the same name, and by which they were accompanied. The fragments of the hyporchemata of Pindar confirm this supposition, for their rhythms are peculiarly light, and have a very imitative and graphic character.Bockh, de Meir. Find. p. 201, &c.;, and p. 270. These characteristics must have existed in a much higher degree in the hyporchematic songs of Thaletas.

Hoffman (born 1953) is an American businessman, accountant and former congressional candidate. He was the Conservative Party candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2009 special election for New York's 23rd congressional district. On November 3, 2009, he was narrowly defeated by Democratic candidate Bill Owens. Hoffman ran for the same seat in Congress in 2010, but lost the Republican primary and withdrew his candidacy. Hoffman's 2009 campaign received extensive support from the Tea Party movement and gained national attention because of his success in drawing grassroots support away from Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava, who dropped out of the race before Election Day. Early life and business career Born in Connecticut, Hoffman is the second of four children of Rita Anderson and Eugene J. Hoffman. Hoffman's parents divorced during his early life, leaving the family in poverty. He grew up in Saranac Lake, New York and graduated from Saranac Lake High School. In 1973, he received a bachelor's degree in accounting from SUNY Plattsburgh. Hoffman married Carol Torrance in 1973 and moved to Hartford, Connecticut; the Hoffmans have three children: Ashleah, Douglas, and Taylor. During the Vietnam War, Hoffman served in the New York National Guard (1970–73) and was a staff sergeant in the United States Army Reserve (1973–76). Following his college graduation, Hoffman earned a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Connecticut in 1976 and was accredited as a certified public accountant (CPA). In 1977, Hoffman and his family moved back to the North Country. Hoffman served as controller for the Lake Placid Olympic Organizing Committee for the 1980 Winter Olympics. Hoffman stated that the 1980 Olympics created jobs and infrastructure that were still driving the area's economy 30 years later. At the time of his 2009 congressional campaign, Hoffman served as managing partner at Dragon Benware Crowley & Co. In addition, he helped to lead Hoffman Family Enterprises, \\"a group of 13 companies ranging from investment and real estate firms to hospitality and tourism ventures\\". Hoffman and his wife resided in Lake Placid. Political campaigns 2009 congressional campaign After Republican Rep. John McHugh resigned from Congress to serve as Secretary of the Army, the Republican Party chose New York State Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava as its candidate in the ensuing special election to fill the vacated seat. Hoffman had also sought the Republican nod, and after Scozzafava was chosen, he congratulated her and initially offered his help. On August 7, 2009, the Conservative Party of New York opted to nominate Hoffman for Congress after three other potential candidates said they would support him, despite the fact that Hoffman did not live in the district. The Conservative Party declined to support Scozzafava, who was described by Party Chairman Michael R. Long as a \\"nice lady who is too liberal\\". The Democratic Party chose Bill Owens as its candidate. The race attracted attention across the country because of Hoffman's Tea Party affiliation and because of the large amount of support Hoffman received from the national conservative base despite Hoffman's status as a third-party candidate. Hoffman described himself as a \\"Reagan conservative,\\" expressing opposition to same-sex marriage, Obamacare, budget deficits, and abortion and support for the war on terror. During the campaign, Hoffman was interviewed by Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity. Many notable Republicans, including former Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin, endorsed Hoffman because they deemed Scozzafava insufficiently conservative and ideologically indistinguishable from the Democrat.Palin: \\"there is no real difference between the Democrat and the Republican in this race.\\" To illustrate this point, the Hoffman campaign ran television advertisements depicting Scozzafava and Owens as \\"two peas in a liberal pod.\\" In October, The Atlantic described Hoffman as \\"the next (unlikely) conservative superstar\\". Hoffman received support from the Club for Growth, RedState, former House Majority Leader Dick Armey, former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson, and columnist Michelle Malkin. After an October 31 poll showed Scozzafava trailing both Hoffman and Owens by 15% and 16% respectively, with her poll numbers collapsing, Scozzafava suspended her campaign on October 31 and endorsed Owens. On Election Day, Owens prevailed over Hoffman. While Hoffman initially conceded the race, an initial re-canvass resulted in a Hoffman gain of approximately 2,000 votes. Hoffman withdrew his concession on November 17, 2009 and later accused the Democratic Party and others of ballot tampering. Jerry O. Eaton, Jefferson County Republican elections commissioner, called Hoffman's assertion \\"absolutely false\\". With the tallying of absentee-ballots near completion, on November 20, 2009, Owens' lead over Hoffman surpassed the total number of absentee ballots left, making it mathematically impossible for Hoffman to win. On November 24, Hoffman ended his campaign. The final election results showed that Owens prevailed by a margin of 48.3% to 46%. The election was alternately described as \\"a referendum on President Barack Obama\\" and \\"a fight over the identity of the Republican Party.\\"Hoffman concedes 23rd Congressional race to Owens , Associated Press, November 4, 2009 The race was also noteworthy due to the Tea Party movement influence on its outcome, and for its impact on same-sex marriage legislation in New York. One commentator stated that Hoffman's third-party candidacy was \\"striking for how much it has galvanized the Republican Party's base.\\"Republicans work to defeat one of their own – National – NewsObserver.com According to Marilyn Musgrave of Susan B. Anthony List, \\"Republican party leaders in Washington should take the message of the campaign and the election seriously, that the Party base should not be taken for granted.\\" 2010 congressional campaign Hoffman again ran for the House of Representatives in 2010, but was defeated in the Republican primary for by Matt Doheny, a businessman and lawyer. On September 23, 2010, Hoffman announced that he would continue his campaign for the congressional seat as the Conservative Party candidate. However, on October 5, 2010, Hoffman announced that he was dropping out of the race altogether, although his name remained on the ballot. Bill Owens (D) won re-election by less than 4,000 votes, while Hoffman received 9,592 votes on the Conservative Party line.Hoffman out of Congress race , Nathan Brown, Adirondack Daily Enterprise, October 5, 2010 Hoffman has been referred to as a \\"spoiler\\" in the 2010 race.

Stereocenters  Taxifolin has two stereocenters on the C-ring, as opposed to quercetin which has none. For example, (+)-taxifolin has (2R,3R)-configuration, making it 1 out of 4 stereoisomers that comprise 2 pairs of enantiomers.  Natural occurrences  Taxifolin is found in non- glutinous rice boiled with adzuki bean (adzuki-meshi). It can be found in conifers like the Siberian larch, Larix sibirica, in Russia, in Pinus roxburghii, in Cedrus deodara and in the Chinese yew, Taxus chinensis var. mairei. It is also found in the silymarin extract from the milk thistle seeds. Taxifolin is present in vinegars aged in cherry wood. Taxifolin, and flavonoids in general, can be found in many beverages and products. Specifically, taxifolin is found in plant-based foods like fruit, vegetables, wine, tea, and cocoa.  Pharmacology  Taxifolin is not mutagenic and less toxic than the related compound quercetin. It acts as a potential chemopreventive agent by regulating genes via an ARE-dependent mechanism. Taxifolin has shown to inhibit the ovarian cancer cell growth in a dose- dependent manner. However, in this same study, taxifolin was the least effective flavonoid in the inhibition of VEGF expression. There is also a strong correlation (with a correlation coefficient of 0.93) between the antiproliferative effects of taxifolin derivatives on murine skin fibroblasts and human breast cancer cells. Taxifolin has shown to have anti-proliferative effects on many types of cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell lipogenesis. By inhibiting the fatty acid synthase in cancer cells, taxifolin is able to prevent the growth and spread of cancer cells. The capacity of taxifolin to stimulate fibril formation and promote stabilization of fibrillar forms of collagen can be used in medicine. Also taxifolin inhibited the cellular melanogenesis as effectively as arbutin, one of the most widely used hypopigmenting agents in cosmetics. However, arbutin acts as quercetin extremely mutagenic, carcinogenic and toxic. Taxifolin enhanced also the efficacy of conventional antibiotics like levofloxacin and ceftazidime in vitro, which have potential for combinatory therapy of patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Taxifolin, as well as many other flavonoids, has been found to act as a non-selective antagonist of the opioid receptors, albeit with somewhat weak affinity. Taxifolin showed promising pharmacological activities in the management of inflammation, tumors, microbial infections, oxidative stress, cardiovascular, and liver disorders Taxifolin has been found to act as an agonist of the adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2).  Metabolism  The enzyme taxifolin 8-monooxygenase uses taxifolin, NADH, NADPH, H+, and O2 to produce 2,3-dihydrogossypetin, NAD+, NADP+, and H2O. The enzyme leucocyanidin oxygenase uses leucocyanidin, alpha-ketoglutarate, and O2 to produce cis-dihydroquercetin, taxifolin, succinate, CO2, and H2O.  Glycosides  Astilbin is the 3-O-rhamnoside of taxifolin. Taxifolin deoxyhexose can be found in açai fruits. Taxifolin 3-O-glucoside isomers have been separated from Chamaecyparis obtusa. (-)-2,3-trans-Dihydroquercetin-3'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, a taxifolin glucoside has been extracted from the inner bark of Pinus densiflora and can act as an oviposition stimulant in the cerambycid beetle Monochamus alternatus. (2S,3S)-(-)-Taxifolin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside has been isolated from the root- sprouts of Agrimonia pilosa. (2R,3R)-Taxifolin-3'-O-β-D-pyranoglucoside has been isolated from the rhizome of Smilax glabra. Minor amount of taxifolin 4′-O-β-glucopyranoiside can be found in red onions. (2R,3R)-Taxifolin 3-O-arabinoside and (2S,3S)-taxifolin 3-O-arabinoside have been isolated from the leaves of Trachelospermum jasminoides (star jasmine).  Derived natural compounds  * Dihydroquercetin-3-O-rhamnoside (Astilbin) * (+)-Leucocyanidin can be synthesized from taxifolin by sodium borohydride reduction.

History Canva Sydney team Canva was founded in Sydney, Australia, by Melanie Perkins, Cliff Obrecht and Cameron Adams on 1 January 2012. In its first year, Canva had more than 750,000 users. In April 2014, social-media and technology expert Guy Kawasaki joined the company as chief evangelist (brand promoter). In 2015, Canva for Work was launched, focusing marketing materials. During the 2016-17 financial year, Canva's revenue increased from $AU 6.8m to $AU 23.5m, with a loss of $3.3m. In 2017, the company reached profitability and had 294,000 paying customers. In January 2018, Perkins announced that the company had raised $40 million from Sequoia Capital, Blackbird Ventures, and Felicis Ventures, and the company was valued at $1 billion. In May 2019, Canva experienced a security breach in which data of roughly 139 million users was hacked. The exposed data included real names of users, usernames, addresses and geographical information, and password hashes for some users. During May 2019, the company raised another round of funding of $70m from General Catalyst and Bond and its existing investors Blackbird Ventures and Felicis Ventures, valuing Canva at $2.5 billion. In October 2019, Canva announced that it had raised an additional $85 million at a valuation of $3.2 billion, and launched an enterprise product. In December 2019, Canva announced Canva for Education, a free product for schools and other educational institutions intended to facilitate collaboration between students and teachers. In January 2020, Canva published its privacy policy in both Legal English and common language, for which is was commended for making the terms of use more understandable to users. In June 2020, Canva announced a partnership with FedEx Office. In July, it announced a similar partnership with Office Depot. As of the end of June, Canva's valuation had risen to $6 billion. It was reported in August that the platform had been hacked in February that year and its graphics used in phishing emails. As of August, users reported 4,200 malicious emails created though the platform. Acquisitions In 2018, the company acquired presentations startup Zeetings for an undisclosed amount, as part of its expansion into the presentations space. In May 2019, the company announced the acquisitions of Pixabay and Pexels, two free stock photography sites based in Germany, which enabled Canva users to access their photos for designs. Criticisms In May 2019, Canva faced criticism for its handling of a cyber attack that saw the data of approximately 139 million users stolen by a hacker. Canva's handling of the breach from a technical perspective was largely commended, but it faced criticism for an initial email to customers, which buried the details below self-congratulatory marketing content.

These kings ruled the island, or at least substantial parts thereof, from maybe the 14th century to the second half of the 17th century. The title literally means \\"inside\\" (the Indonesian word dalam has the same meaning), and alludes to his ritual-symbolic role inside the palace (puri).

After meeting his Guru at the age of sixteen, Seenu performed 20 years of vigorous service and meditation under Shri Shivabalayogi's guidance at his Dehradun ashram in the foothills of the Himalayas.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395; Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 65-80; Malik, R., 2001, A Yogi Worth Watching, Hinduism Today, p. 61. Soon after the death of his Guru in 1994, Srinivas entered a stage known as tapas—intense and unbroken dhyana (meditation) in which the mind is kept in perfect thoughtlessness.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395. By performing tapas for around 20 hours a day continuously for five years, he achieved Enlightenment/Self Realization. Based in the Dehradun ashram, he now travels to many parts of the world teaching meditation and continuing his Guru's mission. He has established numerous meditation groups in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and around India.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 396-7; Malik, R., 2001, A Yogi Worth Watching, Hinduism Today, p. 61. Hinduism Today has written that, \\"Thousands have been inspired by his influence\\" and \\"When the famous Sri Sri Sri Shivabalayogi Maharaj passed away in 1994, meditators around the world wondered who would take his place.\\" Shivarudra Balayogi is counted as one of the few disciples who completed at least five years of tapas, and is revered by many followers as the successor of his Guru's legacy.A Yogi Worth Watching, Hinduism Today, p. 61. In his book on Indian spirituality, renowned Vedanta scholar Adwaita P. Ganguly writes, \\"Baba Shivarudra Balayogi is the embodiment of gentleness, compassion and service to humanity. He is also resolute and immovable as Silence itself\\".Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 396.  Life   Beginning  Shivarudra Balayogi was born Srinivas Dikshitar on 20 September 1954 to a pious Brahmin family in Kolar in the South Indian state of Karnataka.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395; Guru's Feet Online Biography. The youngest of four children (including Vijay Kumar, Vijaya Lakshmi, Satyanarayana), he was affectionately known as 'Seenu.'Guru's Feet Online Biography. His father, Shankara Dikshitar, was a doctor who dedicated much of his time to serving the poor without charge. Seenu drew inspiration from a young age from his mother's example of fervent devotion and inner strength.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395 Guru's Feet Online Biography.  Awakening  Srinivas had begun to experience an acute spiritual hunger by the age of five.Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 11; Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395; Malik, R., 2001, A Yogi Worth Watching, Hinduism Today p. 61. At the age of six or seven, he became mesmerised upon hearing his sister singing Bhaja Govindam, composed by the great Yogi-teacher Adi Shankaracharya.Young, B., 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 95-7; Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395; Guru's Feet Online Biography. The spiritually precocious child immediately learned the Sanskrit verses, began singing them and contemplating their meaning. A sudden detachment (vairagya) dawned, as a result of Adi Shankaracharya's exhortation: > Sing the Glory of God and adopt His consciousness into your mind, for when > the end comes to the physical body, none of your worldly scholarship, wealth > or possessions are going to come to your rescue. Seenu's mind became obsessed with thoughts of birth and death: \\"What is the use of living if we are simply going to die?\\", \\"Do we come into being with our physical body, and do we die with this body?\\", \\"If one is truly the Immortal Soul, the Consciousness beyond birth and death, why is it that we are unaware of it?\\", \\"If happiness exists, why is it that we do not have it all the time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week?\\"Young, B., 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 97-8; Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395; Guru's Feet Online Biography. Srinivas had become uncomfortable with the sight of the world, and wondered whether there was a technology to \\"switch off\\" the universe.Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 14; Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395.  Guru  During his teenage years, Seenu spent much of his time at various temples around his home, sitting quietly by himself. He would contemplate the meaning of jnana (knowledge), bhakti (devotion) and vairagya (detachment) from the teachings of Adi Shankaracharya, and longed for a Guru of the calibre of Shri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Shri Ramana Maharshi. At the age of fifteen, Seenu began to secretly meditate in the isolated Nagara Theertha cave in the Chamundi hills (outside Mysore) several days a week instead of going to school.Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 19-20. At the age of sixteen, Srinivas was led to the great Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj through a series of unusual events.Young, B., 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 95. Having performed a heroic twelve-year tapas (intense meditation) at the age of fourteen, Shivabalayogi Maharaj was known for his powerful presence and dazzling aura of peace.Singh, H., 2008, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life and Spiritual Ministration, p. 79. In a dream, on the night before meeting His Guru, Swamiji initiated Seenu into a mantra, which was to become an anchor for his mind on the path to Self Realization:.Young, B., 2008, Guru- Disciple, p. 105-6. > Om Shivaya Shivabalayogendraya Parabrahmanaya Taking Swamiji's darshan the next day, Seenu fell in love with his Guru at first sight, and his mind became totally concentrated on the form of Shivabalayogi. After communicating his desire to leave home immediately to serve in Shri Shivabalayogi's mission, Srinivas was persuaded by his mother to wait three years to make sure his feelings were genuine.Young, B., 2008, Guru- Disciple, p. 107-8. During this period, Seenu would visit Swamiji in Bangalore. While waiting for the time to pass and continuing his studies at Mysore College, Srinivas would practice the technique of dhyana meditation into which he had been initiated by His Guru – this was to be his technology for \\"switching off\\" the universe. In September 1974, at the age of nineteen, Seenu finally received his mother's blessing and was accepted into Swamiji's service.Young, B., 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 121; Malik, R., 2001, A Yogi Worth Watching, Hinduism Today, p. 61. Shivabalayogi sent Seenu to manage his ashram in Dehradun, in the foothills of the Himalayas, and trained him in a close Guru-disciple relationship.  Sadhana  Life at the ashram marked a new period in Srinivas's sadhana (spiritual practice). His daily practice was gruelling involving cleaning the entire ashram, cooking, 4–5 hours of meditation, as well as performing the ashram puja (worship) and evening bhajans (devotional songs).Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395; Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 65-6. In addition to these duties, Swamiji charged Seenu with taking care of two mentally retarded boys, one of whom he looked after for thirteen years, and both of whom died in his arms as he chanted and prayed.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395; Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 91-4. His Guru tested him in many ways, often scolding him harshly for up to an hour at a time.Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 71. Adopting the methods of karma yoga (service) and bhakti yoga (devotion), Seenu took it as a spiritual blessing. One day Shivabalyogi Maharaj remarked: > Look at the faith and attachment that Seenu has. Even if I cut him into > pieces and throw him in the river, he will get joined back up and come back > to me.Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 104; Guru's Feet Online Biography. On an early trip to Rishikesh for a bath in the river Ganges, Swamiji saw the poonal (sacred thread worn by the Brahmin priest caste) on Seenu's body and became furious, yelling \\"Why are you having this thread? It will simply give you the ego that you belong to a higher caste, which is not at all proper on the spiritual path.\\"Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 104. He instructed Seenu to offer the thread to Mother Ganges, which Seenu did at once, immersing the thread in the water. Then Shivabalayogi Maharaj sprinkled Ganges water on Seenu's head and slapped him on the back, declaring \\"From now, remember that you are a sannyasi (monk). You must live a simple life so that people themselves can call you a monk, but you yourself should not become egoistic by claiming or boasting of any status as such.\\" On 20 September 1978—Seenu's 24th birthday—he asked Swamiji to bless some vibhuti (sacred ash) and place him into tapas (intense meditation performed for several years).Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 98-99. Blessing the vibhuti, Swamiji said, \\"If you want to sit for tapas now, I can make you sit for tapas; but if you sit for tapas now, instead of successfully completing it you might acquire some ego and you may even go away from me physically and may not be able to serve in my mission.\\" To this Seenu replied, \\"Swamiji, then I do not want to do tapas. Because what I want is Swamiji, that's all I know. I love you and I want to be in Swamiji's mission. I want to serve you only. Whether I get Realized or not, that is not so important for me. But definitely I would like to remain at your lotus feet and serve you forever.\\" Then Swamiji smiled, saying \\"Take this vibhuti and keep it with you. In due course of time, when the time is ripe, you will get what you want.\\".Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 99.  Tapas  On 28 March 1994, Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj died.Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 137-8. Upon completion of the Mahasamadhi ceremony, Seenu immediately travelled to Mysore, walking out onto the Chamundi Hills where he had first met his Guru Shivabalayogi and where he used to secretly spend his days in meditation as a teenager.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 396; Guru's Feet Online Biography; Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 140. Going into deep meditation for two to three days, he was roused by a vision of his Guru Shri Shivabalayogi, who informed him that the time had come to do tapas.Malik, R., 2001, A Yogi Worth Watching, Hinduism Today, p. 61; Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395. Thinking that this might be an illusion created by his grieving mind, Seenu ignored the vision. On 10 November 1994, after the evening arathi (salute with lights ceremony), Seenu witnessed the shining figure of Sri Shivabalayogi manifesting from the photo kept on the dais in the darshan hall, and leading him into a neighbouring room:Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395-6 > As I was closing my eyes, it felt as if I was sinking into a deep sea of > space. Total darkness had engulfed, total silence and serenity was there. > Nothing else seemed to be there. No thoughts were coming. In that state I > heard a strong voice telling me, 'Look, from this room either you have to > come out as a Yogi, or your dead body shall come out. Do not abandon the > practice under any circumstances until you reach the goal. I want you do > this for five years as you already have the fruits of seven years of tapas. > (Beyond Bliss, 2006).Young, B., 2006, Beyond Bliss, p. 143-4; see also > Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and > Devotion, p. 395. Deep meditation continued unbroken for two or three days.Young, B., 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 222; Malik, R., 2001, A Yogi Worth Watching, p. 61. He then resumed meditation for around 20 hours a day in seven- to eight-hour cycles.Young, B., 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 222. In the fourth year of tapas, the name \\"Shiva Rudra Balayogi\\" was bestowed upon him by Shri Shivabalayogi.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 395; Young, B., 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 233. Swamiji instructed his Yogi-disciple to begin giving darshan to devotees, and thus Shivarudra Balayogi came to be affectionately known by devotees who visited as Babaji (revered father).Young, B., 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 233. On 16 November 1999, five years after he commenced tapas, Shivarudra Balayogi experienced the dazzling manifestation of the deity Ardhanarishwara—half the body of Lord Shiva and half the body of Goddess Parvati.Hopkins, C., 2006, His Master's Grace, p. 47; Guru's Feet Online Biography. They said, \\"Now that we have come due to your tapas, you do not require your Guru and can go ahead to get many followers.\\" This was the final test for any remnant of ego. Babaji spontaneously replied: > I want only the lotus feet of my Guru. I offer my life at the lotus feet of > the Divine Guru who helped and guided me to this. So please, if you want to > bless me, bless me that I can always remain at the lotus feet of my Guru and > serve him and work according to my Guru's guidance... there is no other > desire. (Guru-Disciple, 2008)Young, B., 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 237-8; > Guru's Feet Online Biography. Pleased with this reply, they blessed the Yogi and the manifestation was withdrawn back into the Self. In their place, Shivabalayogi then manifested. He directed his Yogi-disciple, \\"After you come out of tapas, inspire the people of this world to practice this dhyana meditation and know themselves. Through this practice they can achieve total Peace.\\"Young, B., 2008, Guru- Disciple, p. 238; >Guru's Feet Online Biography. Shri Swamiji then explained: \\"I am actually the Divine, your real Self. I have manifested through the power of Maya (illusion technology) in this form which is dearest to you, as Guru.\\"Young, B., 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 238. Shortly after this, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj achieved the final Nirvikalpa Samadhi in which all individuality was absorbed in the Self, permanently composed in Supreme Peace.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 396; Hopkins, C., 2006, His Master's Grace, p. 51. On 23 November 1999, Babaji emerged from his room as the Yogi, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 396; Guru's Feet Online Biography.  Mission  As word of his tapas spread, spiritual seekers from various parts of the world sought Babaji out at his base in the Dehradun ashram, at the foothills of the Himalayas.Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 396-7. He now travels the world at the invitation of devotees to continue Shri Shivabalayogi's mission, as directed by his Guru. In keeping with the tradition established by his Guru, initiation into the Jangama dhyana meditation technique that Babaji used to achieve Self Realization is given without charge and in the attitude of a friend (mitra bhava).Malik, R., 2001, A Yogi Worth Watching, Hinduism Today, p. 63; Ganguly, A., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj: A Life of Service and Devotion, p. 396-7. He does not require students who come to him to have any particular faith or accept him as Guru. While training monastic disciples, he emphasises that true reunciation (sannyas) occurs in the mind and encourages householders to perform meditation and service while retaining their way of life.  Teachings  The teachings of Shri Shivarudra Balayogi are difficult to define because they are based on his direct experience rather than any particular scripture or school of Indian philosophy.See Teachings, SRBY website Nevertheless, his philosophy is consistent with the Vedanta: > Every one, consciously or unconsciously, is searching for peace and > happiness. You are suffering because you have forgotten your real Self. Once > you Realize that you are this Immortal Self, you will Realize that your very > existence is Permanent and Supreme Peace.Teachings, SRBY website. In practical terms, his teaching is based on the Jangama dhyana meditation technique, which was taught to him by his Guru Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj. He also guides students on the bhakti marga (path of devotion) and karma marga (path of service), according to their temperament. * On meditation: \\"It is only a purifying process when you try to meditate. The mind is the tape which has acquired habits and brain acts as tape recorder. When you sit for meditation the mind gets applied (sucked) onto the brain because of its habits. Purifying process starts when the vasanas (impressions) are getting evaporated. Visions and sounds get created by a decodifying method from the brain. Then is the time you require enormous patience to allow it to happen. Then you should not analyze or judge what it is, good or bad just allow it to happen. Then only the mind can recede.\\"Interview at International Gita Society . * On miracles: \\"Efforts can bring miracles. Achieving Supreme Peace through sadhana is the real miracle. Rings and chains cannot give Peace to this world and are easily available in shops. For a few hundred dollars one can fly in the air. I have always said that if someone can wave the hand and give Peace to the world, that day I will consider it a miracle.\\"Teachings, SRBY website. * On bhava samadhi: \\"Every individual must be careful if they are genuinely interested in going towards Enlightenment. One should not imagine and deceive oneself by claiming to be some divine authority. One has to be very careful about bhava samadhi. My Guru said that it is like giving a lollipop to a child, to make them go to school. But, unfortunately, people sometimes get stuck to the lollipop and they do not go to school.\\" * On mind and brain: \\"The brain is in touch with the nervous system and the universe. Through its reflections, the mind, which is a spark of the Supreme Consciousness called the Self, comes into existence. The mind assumes everything that is reflected by the brain is real, recognizes and absorbs as an imprint, and starts wandering in the universe aimlessly – getting pampered, losing control, losing consciousness of the Self.\\"Hopkins, C&C;, 2007, From the Heart of Peace, p. 70. * On the branches of Vedanta: \\"Adi Shankaracharya spread the teaching of 'advaita' – only one single self exists. A contemporary of Shankaracharya was Ramanujacharya. He taught, \\"We are a spark of the Divine only.\\" At the same time the school of philosophy connected to Madhvacharya expressing devotion taught, \\"That individual 'jivatma' is separate from God.\\" These three are not different – there is no disunity. In the beginning, you see yourself as God's devotee. At the next stage you experience you are part of God – like a ray from the Sun or a droplet from the ocean. Finally in Nirvikalpa Samadhi, only one single Self exists; the ancient sages used the term 'Tat' which means 'That'.\\"Talks, SRBY website. * On bhakti yoga: \\"Because of imagination only the mind has gone out of control. This is the basic technique of the bhakti marga (devotional path). Using the same imagination the mind is to be brought back to its concentrated position, the composed position. So rituals and form worship or formlessness, they are all prescribed so that you can begin somewhere if you need an anchor, so that your mind can lose all other imaginations and become single-pointed into one imagination. Even it is advised during meditation also, if there are thousands of thoughts coming, you are unable to lose all the thoughts, try to stick to one particular thought before giving up all such thoughts. So that is how the worship of an idol in the temple and rituals are all prescribed.\\"Timeless Meditation Q&A;, SRBY website. * On karma yoga: \\"When you are doing karma (any work), do it without trying to analyze or judge anything. Then your Mind would surrender to the Divine Guru and that action (all such work) can get converted into sadhana. Specifically if you are trying to repeat any name of the Divine Guru, just concentrate on the name (or japa or chant) and observe from where it is coming. Your mind gets absorbed there, converting such action (sadhana) into deeper and deeper sadhana. While you try to meditate also do the same. Allow the mind to get purified without trying to imagine what it is. When vision or any experience happens do not try to see whether it is good or bad, right or wrong. Remember either way the mind gets involved and is in existence always. If you simply watch and do not bother what it is, then the mind recedes. When it recedes it is going towards its original abode, the Divine, which is beyond all imaginations and explanations.\\" * On surrender: \\"The mind can never tell the truth because it can tell you only based on its own imaginations. So meditation can definitely help you to really surrender, technologically surrender in every way. Surrender means that the mind has to become quiet. Not simply if we touch our heads and do a deep prostration do we convey surrender.\\"Q&A;, SRBY website. * On Samadhi: \\"Samadhi is when the mind totally gets absorbed into the Real Ultimate Self. The yogi becomes aware of the Self's existence but without any definitions. Even the earlier imagined false self's identity also vanishes. This means the thought of 'I' vanishes. In Samadhi, the Yogi has no mind which recognizes or identifies anything. The Yogi simply experiences the Existence, which is Supreme Peace.\\" * On the Yogi: \\"The Ultimate Truth is Supreme Consciousness which is all-pervading. A Yogi experiences the Self's existence in Nirvikalpa Samadhi. There will not be an iota of imagination, not even the thought of 'I' or 'Existence', but you experience the existence. A Yogi remains there effortlessly with contentment.\\"Hopkins, C&C;, 2007, From the Heart of Peace, p. 124. * On Self: \\"This has to be experienced. Nobody else can do it for you. You cannot demonstrate it to anyone else, or define it in words. Just like you cannot simply define what space is, and you cannot measure space by any scale. It is all pervading. It is an amazing thing. If at all you want to measure the space and know the space, you have to become space itself.\\"  References  Further reading *Ganguly, Adwaita P., 2007, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj, in India Travel Guide: Spiritual Tourism and Ground Realities, *Vedantic Research Publications *Malik, R., 2001, A Yogi Worth Watching, Hinduism Today, November/December *Young, Bruce, 2006, Beyond Bliss, () *Young, Bruce, 2008, Guru-Disciple, () *Young, Bruce (Author) and Reitze, Simon (Translator), 2018, Guru-Shishya: Das Leben von Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj und Sein Vermächtnis (SRBY UK, ). *Hopkins, Charles, 2006, His Master's Grace, () *Hopkins, Charles and Carol, 2007, From the Heart of Peace, () Category:Indian yogis Category:Living people Category:1954 births ","title":"Shivarudra Balayogi"},{"id":"24133607","text":"James Valentine (29 July 1866 – 25 July 1904), also known by the nickname of \\"Jim Val\\", was an English rugby union, and semi-professional Northern Union (Rugby Football League (RFL)) footballer who played in the 1880s, 1890s and 1900s.

He was elected captain of the Pendleton club when it was formed. For a short time he played with Broughton Rangers, but came back to Pendleton to play until 1883, when he joined Swinton. For the next 18 years, his name was synonymous with Swinton. Rugby union career Jim Valentine was first selected for England while at Swinton in 1888, but due to internal arguments with the other Home Nation unions, England failed to play an international game until 1890. A prolific scorer, during the 1889–1890 season he scored 61 tries, kicked 5 drop goals and kicked 35 goals. He gained his first international cap in 1890 against Wales, and again in 1896 against Wales, Ireland and Scotland. He also played at county level making 60 appearances for Lancashire. Change of code Jim Valentine, 1904 illustration from The Manchester Courier When Swinton converted from the rugby union code to the Northern Rugby Football Union code on Tuesday 2 June 1896, Jim Valentine was banned by the Rugby Football Union from playing rugby union as he remained with the club when it turned professional. A club favourite, he led Swinton with a 16-8 victory over local rivals Salford in their first Northern Union Challenge Cup Final in 1900, at Fallowfield in Manchester. He remained with the club until 1901. Career records Jim Valentine holds Swinton's \\"Most Tries in a Rugby Union Season\\" record, with 48-tries scored during the 1888–89 season. However, Johnny Stopford holds Swinton's \\"Most Tries in a Rugby League Season\\" record, with 42-tries scored during the 1963–64 season. Death and legacy Valentine was killed when he, his wife and her sister were struck by lightning while on holiday in Barmouth in Wales on 25 July 1904. The severe storm caused the death of several other people who were struck by lightning, although Valentine's wife and her sister recovered. According to one report, Valentine, his wife and his two sisters-in-law were walking on a hill overlooking Barmouth and Cardigan Bay in mid-afternoon when they were suddenly caught in the storm. The first lightning strike lit the gorse-covered hill on fire, and then a second bolt struck Valentine, his wife and her sister Nellie Worthington. Her other sister, nurse Mary Worthington, was walking a few yards behind them and was able to summon immediate help. However, a doctor who arrived within minutes found Jim Valentine already dead. A Manchester newspaper reported the news with sorrow: > \\"The event has cast gloom over Barmouth. \\"Jim\\" Valentine was known to all > footballers as one of the best players who ever donned a jersey. There has > been, indeed, no more popular figure in Northern Rugby football.

His tackling was about his strongest > point, and for his club and county he possessed a wonderful record as a try- > getter. Though three-quarter was his proper position.\\" He was buried on 29 July 1904, on what would have been his 38th birthday, at St. John'sSt John's Church is on Bolton Road (A666), Pendlebury and not Irlams o' th' Height churchyard in Pendlebury. Thousands of people lined the road to witness the cortège as his body was taken from his house in Pendleton to the churchyard in Pendlebury. Valentine is also believed to one of two people after whom the Valentine Cup, a long running amateur rugby competition in the Manchester area, is named.

Background It is not known when this phrase was first used or by whom. However, it or phrases closely equivalent were almost certainly first used in connection with the theory of value investing as developed initially by Benjamin Graham in his famous book Security Analysis (Graham and Dodd, 1934). This theory advocated long-term investing in stocks or assets that are underpriced compared to their intrinsic value, that is they have suffered “distress sales” and the stock or asset of company is going through a “period of financial distress.” If such a period is temporary, and the company can be expected to return to an improved condition of normal solvency, then investing in such an asset can be expected to outperform the stock market in general in the longer run. In connection with this Graham developed the Benjamin Graham formula, also known as “net current asset value.” A similar analysis was done by John Burr Williams who developed his discounted cash flow theory (Williams, 1938). A prominent advocate of Graham and his approach has been Warren Buffett, who has claimed that he is an “85% Graham investor” (Buffett, 2003). This approach has been criticized by advocates of modern portfolio theory (MPT) and the closely related doctrine of the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) most closely associated with Eugene Fama (Fama, 1970). These theories argue that if a stock or asset is selling at what appears to be a “distress value” compared to some estimate of its true value based on its current income flows, then the market has information about the expected future of the company or asset that is not reflected in its current income flow. In this regard, investors such as Buffett who have successfully used the Graham approach should expect to spend extra resources to have better information about the companies or assets they purchase compared to most agents in the market. A study that shows that the Graham approach may well do better than various other alternatives (such as the “three-factor theory” that Fama and French, 1996, have argued performs better than the EMH), is Xiao and Arnold (2008). Use in forecasting corporate bankruptcies Another use of this phrase has been in connection with efforts to predict corporate bankruptcies that may come out of such a period of financial distress. One who developed an approach to making such predictions has been Edward Altman, who developed the z-score financial analysis tool (Altman, 1968). Further study of this and related tools has been done by Altman and Hotchkiss (2005). This idea can be related to the earlier issue in that presumably why the Graham approach might not do as well as such alternatives as MPT or EMH is that it does not satisfactorily account for the risk of such bankruptcies. Again, it is clear that to outperform such models a Graham-style investor will have to have sufficiently good information about such possibilities to know whether or not such a threat can be discounted. Use in analysis of speculative bubbles and crashes Drawing on these uses from corporate finance, Hyman Minsky applied the phrase to analyzing speculative bubbles and crashes (Minsky, 1972), using it to characterize a period in a speculative bubble that follows a peak in price, in which the price gradually declines, and which is then followed by a crash in which the price falls precipitously. This analysis was adopted by Charles P. Kindleberger, who in Appendix B of the 4th edition of his book, Manias, Panics, and Crashes (2000) identified 37 out of 47 historical bubbles as exhibiting such a pattern, including most of the more famous ones. Although the phrase was not used, participants in periods of financial distress in early bubbles used a variety of colorful terms and phrases for them, such as \\"apprehension\\" or \\"an ugly drop in the market\\" during the South Sea bubble in Britain in 1720 (Carswell, 1960, p. 139). Arguably the recent global bubble in financial derivatives exhibited this pattern, with a peak in August 2007, followed by a crash in September 2008. The first to develop a mathematical model of this period of financial distress was J. Barkley Rosser, Jr. (Chapter 5, 1991), drawing on catastrophe theory, while a more detailed such model using agent-based modeling and relying on the wealth constraint idea due to Minsky has been done by Gallegati, Palestrini, and Rosser (2011.)

Named after Weston, Ontario, she was built by Midland Shipyards Ltd. in Midland, Ontario and commissioned on 6 October 1944 at Collingwood. Background Flower-class corvettes like West York serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction and career West York was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1943-44 Increased Endurance Flower-class building program, which followed the main layout of the 1942-43 program. The only significant difference is that the majority of the 43-44 program replaced the 2-pounder Mk.VIII single \\"pom-pom\\" anti-aircraft gun with 2 twin 20-mm and 2 single 20-mm anti-aircraft guns. West York was laid down by Midland Shipyards Ltd. at Midland, Ontario 23 July 1943 and launched 25 January 1944. She was commissioned into the RCN 6 October 1944 at Collingwood. HMCS West York at sea West York arrived at Halifax in mid-November, 1944 and left a month later for Bermuda to work up. In February, 1945, she joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group EG C-5 at St. John's, leaving on 16 February to rendezvous with her first transatlantic convoy, HX 338. She made three round trips across the Atlantic before the end of her career, the last one as escort to ON 305, which she joined from Londonderry at the end of May 1945. West York was paid off on 9 July 1945 and laid up at Sorel, Quebec. She was sold into mercantile service as SS West York. As SS West York, she was towing the decommissioned when the towline parted and the destroyer was wrecked on 7 November 1945 off Prince Edward Island. By 1947, she had her steam reciprocating engine replaced by diesel power and sailed under Moroccan registry as the Moulay Bouchaib. As late as 1950, she was the Italian Espresso. She returned to Canadian registry in 1959 as Federal Express. She was moored in Montreal on the evening of 5 May 1960, when she was struck by the Swedish Polaris. Holed and with her mooring lines carried away, Federal Express careened into the Danish Hilda Maersk and sank in 30 minutes. Later that year, the after part of the ship was raised and broken up for scrap.

The group is made up of Rev Tyler Hentschel, Adrienne Michelle and Amanda Curry with other members joining them from time to time. Hentschel is the project's only consistent member since he founded the group in 2001. Biography Insomniac Folklore had its start in the small town of Roseburg, Oregon, when lead singer Tyler Hentschel decided to start doing acoustic singer/songwriter sets (then known as \\"The Tyler Hentschel Band\\") as a side project to the punk and hardcore bands he was playing in at the time. Over the years Hentschel has been joined by a rotating cast of friends and family as they released six full-length records and three E.P.s and toured the continental United States. The group has become known for their somewhat unpredictable live shows and their sense of camaraderie as a group. Insomniac Folklore has toured and played with acts such as Jason Webley, Chelsea Wolfe, The Fall of Troy, Wovenhand, Unwoman, The Locust and One-Eyed Doll. Insomniac Folklore has also made appearances at Steamcon, SXSW, Steampunk Worlds Fair, Audio Feed, and Tomfest. The name \\"Insomniac Folklore\\" is a reference to Hentschel's own battle with insomnia when he started the project. Hentschel intends for the project to me more about friendship than being a \\"concise\\" band. Hentschel writes more of the material but wants everyone involved to have part of their personality in the music. Hentschel's second release, \\"Consumer Appreciation\\" gained moderate popularity in the early 2000s, but he struggled to find an audience for his music during the several years he spent living among the redwoods in Northern California. It was during this lonely period that he released the album \\"Smile or Die,\\" which in 2005 was on the HM Magazine top 5 staff pics for record of the year. In 2006, Hentschel moved back to Oregon, taking up residence in Portland. The album Oh Well celebrates this transition with ditties such as \\"North to the Future\\" (a reference to the Joe Christmas album) and \\"It rains.\\" This album also marked a turning point in the band, as the sound became darker and more theatrical, moving away from early influences such as The Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel, and showing a deeper connection with the likes of Nick Cave and Tom Waits. On May 13, 2010, E.P., was released. This is the first stand-alone EP from Insomniac Folklore. It features a full band lineup and a very raw sound. Nate and Tessa Allen from Destroy Nate Allen provided vocals on \\"Campfire Song.\\" On June 13, 2010, L.P., Insomniac Folklore's largest project to date, was released, bringing together new material with fresh recordings of early favorites, and officially uniting the group of friends now known as the Portland chapter of Insomniac Folklore. In 2011, Insomniac Folklore recorded and released a new full-length album, A Place Where Runaways Are Not Alone. Runaways was a concerted effort between members of the Portland and St. Louis bands, and the finished album features the work of every current member of Insomniac Folklore, and guest tracks by Daniel Otto Jack Petersen of the Horror Punk act, Blaster the Rocket Man. On November 3, 2011, the band released a music video for the song \\"Useless,\\" filmed by Emily Kathryn Curry. The band's most recent E.P., The Scariest Thing in the Dark (2012), features songs by both the Portland and St. Louis bands, as well as spoken word tracks by Tyler and Daniel Otto Jack Petersen. Insomniac Folklore has been associated with both the Cabaret and Steampunk movements. They have been featured on Sepiachord for the songs \\"Kids\\", \\"Useless\\" and \\"The Scariest Thing in the Dark\\". On November 5, 2013, the band's website announced a new album in the works entitled, \\"Everything Will Burn\\" would be recorded during the winter of 2013. The album has since been delayed and is now scheduled for a 2016 release. Members The only constant member of the band since the beginning is Tyler Hentschel. Every other position in the band has been filled by several of other musicians. Dennis Childers joined the band as part-time bass player in 2007. Dennis has also played with Yum Yum Children, Flock 14, Empty Tomb & Larry Norman. In 2008, Ayden Simonatti joined the band as a bass player then moved to drums while working with Hentschel on another project as alter egos \\"Runes and Numerals.\\" Around the same time, Ayden's sisters Zoe and Anavah Simonatti joined the band as backing vocalists. Ayden, Zoe and Anavah are the children of Randy and Chris Simonatti of the alternative punk group, The Clergy. Zoe and Anavah stopped being active members of the band in 2011.

The building was completed in 1811 with adjoining property of of private parkland beside the River Severn. It was once home to the Whitmore, Foster and Avery families. The Hall is a Grade II* listed building Images of England: architectural description of listed building claimed as one of the largest in the county of Shropshire. History The Whitmore family had been feudal landowners of Apley since 1572 A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain John Burke (1836) p409 when the manor was purchased by William Whitmore (d. 1593), a haberdasher of London. The will of William Whitmore, dated 6 August 1593 records:From: 'Wills: 31-40 Elizabeth I (1588-98)', Calendar of wills proved and enrolled in the Court of Husting, London: Part 2: 1358-1688 (1890), pp. 713-725 > ANNO 36 ELIZABETH.

Dated 6 August, > 35 Elizabeth [A.D. 1593]. Roll 274 (15). William Whitmore's eldest son was Sir William Whitmore of Apley, knight, High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1620, and his second son was Sir George Whitmore (d. 1654), Lord Mayor of London. Sir William resided at Apley and in 1634 purchased the manor of Balmes in Hackney, held under a lease by his father, for his brother Sir George, who there received King Charles I in 1641.Victoria County History, Middlesex, vol.10, 1995, Hackney, pp.75-91 Sir William's son and heir was Sir Thomas Whitmore, 1st Baronet (d. 1653). On the second baronet's childless death in 1699 Apley passed to his cousin William (died 1725). The existing Georgian style house was remodeled during the Regency period in Neo-Gothic style between 1808 and 1811 for Thomas Whitmore, High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1806 and Member of Parliament for Bridgnorth 1806–31. It incorporated a faux chapel, hexagonal turrets and battlements. Design work is attributed to members of the architectural Wyatt family and construction work was undertaken by the Carline family of Shrewsbury. Thomas Whitmore's son Thomas Charlton Whitmore strongly opposed the construction of the Severn Valley Railway which ran through the Apley Park estate on the opposite bank of the river Severn. The railway opened in 1862 after the Severn Valley Railway Company agreed to pay £14,000 compensation and £150 per acre for the land purchased, and also to provide a station at which at least two trains per day in each direction could be stopped on request. Linley station was built to meet that requirement. In 1867, the Foster family purchased the property for a record amount and remodelled it during a revival of Gothic style in the Victorian period. Famous English eccentric Gerald Tyrwhitt-Wilson, 14th Baron Berners was related to the Fosters (as a grandson of William Orme Foster, the purchaser) and was born at Apley in 1883. The Hall and Estate remained in Foster family ownership until 1960 when the last incumbent of the Foster family died. Due to the vastness of the house and its substantial upkeep it was difficult to find a family willing to occupy Apley Hall and so alternative uses were sought. In 1962 the house became a state secondary modern boarding school run by Shropshire County Council and remained so until its closure in 1987. Apley Hall remained empty and suffered a great deal of deterioration and vandalism during the following ten years and was listed on the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register. In 1997 the house was bought by Neil Avery, an entrepreneur and conservation specialist as a family home. The house was restored and subsequently removed from the Buildings at Risk Register. There had long been speculation that Jeeves and Wooster author P.G.Wodehouse had based his fictitious Blandings Castle on Apley. In 2003, Dr Daryl Lloyd and Dr Ian Greatbatch (two researchers in the Department of Geography and Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London) made use of a Geographic Information System to analyse a set of geographical criteria, such as a viewshed analysis of The Wrekin and drive time from Shrewsbury. Their final conclusion was that Apley was the best suited location for fulfilling the geographical criteria. During 2004 the house was sold to specialist developers who have since divided the Hall into several self-contained houses.

It offered London youngsters Spanish dancing, live rock 'n roll, and skiffle.chasmcdevitt.com\\">www.chasmcdevitt.com . It saw the invention of a new style of 'dancing' known as hand-jive, dancing using hand gestures only as there was no space to maneuver in the crowded basement.Daily Mirror 1 April 1957. The venue was closed in 1958, owing to overcrowding. History The Cat's Whisker coffee bar was started by entrepreneur Peter Evans, and was one of the first to have a jukebox. It was located in the middle of Soho at the corner of Kingly Street and Beak Street, between Carnaby Street and Regent Street, around the corner from the toy store Hamleys. It attracted large crowds, including ice skating champions, international rugby players, journalists and students, for espresso (priced at a shilling per cup) and music.What's on in London 9 March 1956. The venue was situated in the heart of theatreland, and catered for diners before or after the theatre. In 1956, Evans hired Hank HuffnerThe Cheshire Cat, Vol 1, No 2, 1956. to refurbish the bar's cellar as an exclusive 'live' venue. The L-shaped cellar had primitive paintings of cats chasing mice on the walls and six stone cats as light-sources round the walls. The basement was exclusive, there being no indication of its existence on the ground floor. At first, the cellar had the feel of \\"Hernando's Hideaway\\", with regular performances from guitarist Jose Feller and dancer Carmen Ballisteras, formerly with the Ballet Espagnol de Pilar Lopez. Together with The 2i's Coffee Bar, The Cat's Whisker from Biography (Extract from 'Skiffle the Definitive Inside Story') later spearheaded the nascent pop scene, with appearances by 'before-they-were- famous' musicians like Cliff Richard, Lonnie Donegan, Terry Dene, Tommy Steele, guitarist Barry Warren, the Chas McDevitt Skiffle Group and other artists who dropped by to unwind after working the nearby nightspots Churchill's, the Bag O'Nails, Coconut Grove, Cabaret and Eve. Like Feller and Ballisteras, the musicians were generally \\"paid with coffee and Cokes\\". The place was reputed to be the largest seller of Coca-Cola in Britain at the time. Freelance photographer Ken Russell,www.photonet.org. in his pre-film director days, captured the 'energy and excitement' of this night life in Soho for Picture Post and these atmospheric images resurfaced in the Soho Nights exhibition by The Photographers' Gallery, London, December 2008 – February 2009. Russell recalls: \\"I remember the atmosphere was very jolly. So I made a number of visits to the Cat's Whisker. Cliff Richard used to appear there. I used to join in the hand-jiving.\\" When the police closed down The Cat's Whisker because of overcrowding in 1958, Evans opened the first of the Angus Steak Houses at this venue, before later starting the London-based David Hicks–decorated restaurant chain that bore his own name, Peter Evans Eating Houses,The Observer 3 March 1975 and the upmarket Raffles night club in King's Road, Chelsea. As of 2009, The Cat's Whisker had been replaced by the Korean restaurant Myung Ga.

Early life Lech Bądkowski was born on January 24, 1920 in Toruń, Poland as Leszek, Mieczysław Zygmunt Buntkowski, He attended an elemenrtary school there as well as an all male high school. In 1938 he got admitted to a law faculty at the Józef Piłsudski University in Warsaw, but after seven days into the academic year he had been drafted into the polish army. During his service, he completed a junior officer course. When the Second World War broke out on September 1, 1939, he participated as a platoon commander in a battle of the Bzura river, which he later described in his book \\"Soldiers from the Bzura River\\". In 1940, he managed to escape to France where he joined the newly formed polish army, and in a rank of an Aspirant he fought in Norwegian and French campaigns, where he showed outstanding courage for what he was awarded in 1941, by Gen. Władysław Sikorski, the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari War medal, the highest Polish military honor. After the evacuation from France he completed a sabotage and skydiving course in Scotland but had never been dropped off behind enemy lines in the occupied Poland. He was discharged from the army as a second lieutenant. While stationed in England he learned English, continued his general education as well as participated in the activities of the Pomeranian Union which he created. In that time period he completed a booklet \\"The Pomeranian Political Thought\\" (1945). Early career (Stalin Era) He returned to Poland in 1946 and settled down in Gdynia. His life goal then was to become a politician, but he soon abandoned this idea and took up journalism. He worked in the \\"Baltic Daily\\" and wrote numerous articles published in there. In 1947 he married Zofia Janiszewska. In 1953 their daughter Sławina was born. Around this time he changed his name from Buntkowski to \\"Bądkowski\\" (Buntkowski was a germanized version of his family name during Poland’s partitions period in 19th and the beginning of the 20th century) and finished commerce and political science studies in Sopot and then also received a diploma for completing a political sciences studies from Lodz University Law Department. He moved to Gdańsk in 1951 and settled on Long Street 79/80 (Długa 79/80). His first book \\"A Fishing Boat on shore\\" (Kuter na strądzie) was published in 1952. Since 1953 he was active in the Polish Writers Union but soon was relegated from it by the communist authorities that mistrusted his ideological positions, which could have been influenced by his war experience with the western allies in England. He ended up working in a puppet theater Miniatura in Gdańsk as a literary director and later become a deputy editor of the weekly \\"The Earth and the Sea\\". After the October 1956 thaw In 1956 Lech Bądkowski co-founded the Kashubian Association (later the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association) and created its ideological manifesto. Since the beginning, he was a member of KPA leadership. He wrote an outline of the history of Kashubian literature (1958), prepared a deep analysis of the organization’ activities from the time of its creation and widen its recognition in the society and later in 1964, changed its name. Between 1957-66 he was also a Chairman of the Gdańsk branch of Polish Writers Union. In that time period, he wrote his most popular books: \\"It’s joyful in tropics\\" and \\"The Battle is going on\\" (a collection of short stories). He translated the Kashubian novel \\"The Life and Adventures of Remus\\" by Aleksander Majkowski into Polish. In 1965 he was awarded a Cross of the Order of Poland's Restitution. He also wrote a lot for the daily \\"The Voice of the Coast\\" (Glos Wybrzeża) and for well over a dozen magazines. Some of his texts were broadcast on the Polish Radio Gdańsk. He wrote and published about one book each year and some of them got reprinted. Starting in the mid sixties, his rejection of the communist rule and the censorship grew stronger and stronger, to such a level that in 1968 he openly protested with two other writers from the Pomerania region against communist party brutal clamping down on the student protest demanding more freedoms. The so called “March events” have also caused massive purges of the polish Jews from the various institutions as a manifestation of the infighting between different two factions within the communist party.  The 70s – Edward Gierek period  Starting from the early 70's Lech Bądkowski's creativity slowed down. One of the reasons was the censorship inflicted by communist apparatus and other hardships, another was his lifestyle addiction that led to health problems. That and also a variety of interests and pursuits in that period of his life also lead to losing his focus from writing. In those years Bądkowski managed to edit and prefaced the two books of Augustyn Necel “Z deszczu pod rynnę” (“When it rains it pours”) and “Rewianie” (“The citizens of Rewa”) and the work of the Rev. Juliusz Pobłocki \\"In the Kashubia 100 years ago\\". His own literary work at the time was concentrating on the Vistula river Pomerania and its history. In mid 70s he planned to write a six part cycle of novels on the beginnings of the Pomeranian state, but completed only two volumes: \\"The Young Prince\\" (Mlody ksiaze) and \\"Clouds\\" (Chmury). For his creative work and the activity promoting Pomerania he was awarded the Stolem Medal (1978). Since 1979 he was a member of the Polish branch of the PEN-Club. He wrote about 1000 articles and over 30 books and pamphlets, some of which got reprinted. He became an object of interest of the Security Service (SB) and his office and the apartment got bugged. He was tagged a code name an \\"Inspirer\\" in the Security Service files. Towards the end of the 70's he joined in the underground activity of the Gdańsk conservative and liberal circles concentrated around the Movement of Young Poland organization (“Ruch Mlodej Polski”)”. In 1978 he published a political essay “Kashubian-Pomeranian paths” (Kaszubsko-Pomorskie drogi) which was previously banned by censor, in an unofficial, underground publishing house,. Towards the end of his life he was able to welcome the birth of his grandson Barnim Bądkowski born (b. 1979). His grand daughter Miłoslawa was born after his passing.  The 80s  In August 1980, Lech Bądkowski, as a representative of the area's literary circles joined in the Gdańsk shipyard striking workers and from the August 21st, became a member of the Inter Enterprise Strike Committee and later its spokesman and also a member of the group negotiating the Gdańsk Agreements, responsible for formulating the articles related to freedom of speech. He created a discussion club of political thought named after the Constitution of May 3. In 1980 he began editing an insert called \\"Self governanace\\" (Samorządność) to the \\"Baltic Daily\\" (Dziennik Bałtycki), a regional newspaper. On August 1, 1981 he was awarded by the President of the city of Gdansk Jerzy Młynarczyk a medal for popularization of the culture, arts and knowledge about Gdańsk. On August 17 Lech Wałesa authorized him to create a weekly “Samorządność” (Self governance) based on the aforementioned insert to the “Baltic Daily”. Only three editions were published starting in November 1981 and then it got suspended during the Martial Law in Poland at the end of that year. Bądkowski reminded its editor in chief until the end of 1982. During the martial law he published in the “Bratniak” and “Wlasne Zdanie”, underground magazines and worked on preparing the fourth edition of the Samorządność weekly which didn’t get distributed during Solidarity era. In the process of doing it, he gathered around himself many young Solidariry activists. In 1982 he was awarded the Swiętopełk, the Great Golden Seal, for his lifelong activities to benefit the cause of Pomerania region. Since the end of the 70's Lech Bądkowski became sick with cancer and died from it on February 24, 1984 in his apartment on the Long Str. (Długa) in Gdańsk. He was buried at Srebrzysko cemetery in Gdańsk - Wrzeszcz. Five thousand people attended his funeral, amongst them Zbigniew Herbert, Bronisław Geremek, Lech Wałęsa and Donald Tusk, The ceremony did transform into an antigovernment manifestation. Later on, the grave was adorned with a sculpture of the Kashubian Griffin with these words inscribed on it \\" Lech Bądkowski - writer, soldier, citizen\\". Legacy In 1987 Lech Bądkowski became a patron of the literary award of the Kashubian-Pomeranian association. In 1988 the commemorative plaque was placed on the house located in Fish Market street 6c (Targ Rybny 6c) where his office was located. The inscription on it says: “In this house Lech Bądkowski lived and created between 1960 and 1984. He was a writer, a Kashubian-Pomeranian activist, a signatory of the Gdańsk Shipyard Agreements in 1980”. From May 1991 Bądkowski became a patron of the elementary school in Luzino. Around this time one of the streets was named after him in the Siedlce neighborhood of Gdańsk and the middle school in Jasień near Gdańsk. In 2000 he received posthumously the honorary title of the Citizen of Gdańsk. A remembrance gathering took place to celebrate this occasion on February 22, and on March 7 a special exhibition dedicated to Lech Bądkowski has opened in the gallery Plama entitled: “Lech Bądkowski – a human, writer, citizen” Several minor streets in Gdańsk, Rumia, Tczew and Starogad Gdański were later named after him as well. On May 3, 2006 the President Lech Kaczyński awarded Bądkowski posthumously an Order of Poland's Restitution. Since 2006 the monthly \\"Pomerania\\" keeps publishing the memories of people who knew Bądkowski. A film \\"The inspirer\\" (Inspirator) was made about Bądkowski and was shown in Gdańsk, Gdynia and Luzino and on TV. In the last few years, in addition to many commemorative gatherings, several of his books got republished, 3 books and 3 three master thesis have been written about him. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of his death, the year 2009, was proclaimed the Lech Bądkowski Year. On February 18 the Senate of the Republic of Poland officially commemorated the anniversary of his death. On the same day, the prime minister of Poland at the time, Donald Tusk, and the marshal of the senate Bogdan Borusiewicz opened an exhibition entitled “Authorities: Lech Bądkowski“ staged by the European Solidarity Center (ESC) which also published a pamphlet containing a comprehensive biographical essay. Also in February, the correspondence between Bądkowski and his long time friend Maciej Słomczyński has been re-published. Bądkowski is also a patron of a Carrilion in the main City Hall building in Gdańsk. Bibliography *J. Borzyszkowski, D. Albrecht (red.): Pomorze - mała ojczyzna Kaszubów. Historia i współczesność.

The location is about south of Mullin, and northwest of Goldthwaite, the county seat. When originally settled, Williams Ranch was located in the far southern portion of what is now Brown County. (Mills County was formed in 1887.) History Around 1855, a John Williams from North Carolina was passing through the area and decided to camp for the night beside a spring on Mullin Creek. Impressed with the location, he bought some land from a fellow whose last name was Williams(W. W. Williams) decided to stay and established a ranch on the springs. The reason the town is called Williams Ranch- because all of John Williams sons had Ranches there. During the next ten years, a community grew around Williams Ranch consisting of a number of homes, a hotel, a general store, a school and a number of other businesses including a stage stop. A post office operated in Williams Ranch from 1877 to 1892. The reason the town died was out of greed, because the railroad was going to go through there, but the people raised the price of their lands to high, so the railroad bypassed Williams Ranch, Texas. Outlaw John Wesley Hardin met Deputy Sheriff Charles Webb in Williams Ranch about a month before Hardin killed Webb. By the 1880s, the community had about 250 residents. Its demise began when it was bypassed by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885 but more for the reason of the feud that existed between the town's original settlers and its newcomers. Today, there is ample evidence of what was once a thriving ranching community including a well-maintained cemetery. The Allen family presently own property adjacent to the cemetery and are local historians. Geography Williams Ranch is sited near Mullin Creek, which rises in central Mills County and runs southwest for 12 miles to join on Brown Creek. The settlement served as a stage stop on The Wire Road, a dirt road running from Austin to Fort Phantom Hill near Abilene named for the telegraph line which was the first communication line between Austin and the military outpost. The local terrain is characterized by steep slopes and benches, surfaced by shallow clay loams or sandy soils, which support juniper, live oak, mesquite, and grasses.

Like the wooden-bodied gottan, the kankara is an inexpensive alternative to other, professional Japanese lutes – namely the sanshin and the similar, albeit larger shamisen. Unlike the gottan, however, the kankara was invented much later and served a much different purpose historically. History The kankara sanshin originates in the period following the World War II Battle of Okinawa. Okinawans, including men detained by the American military, made use of metal cans discarded by the Americans, and used them as the body for improvised sanshins. A similar type of can-based sanshin was made by Japanese-Americans in internment camps in the United States during the war. Since World War II kankara have become popular as inexpensive alternatives to the sanshin or shamisen, and professional sanshin or shamisen makers have begun to craft them and include them in their stores, online and in catalogues. The kankara itself has also evolved to some degree, with certain makers creating more ornate instruments with hand-painted frontal designs and the decorative wrappings (手掛 tiigaa) that are a feature of the sanshin proper. DIY \\"build-your-own\\" kankara sanshin kits are also readily available.  Construction and components  The following is a list of basic components that normally make up a kankara sanshin, with Japanese phrases that refer to the English terms in sanshin and shamisen parlance: * Body (胴 chiiga/dou) — An empty metal can or cylinder is used to create the body of the instrument, in lieu of the snakeskin-covered bodies typical of sanshin. ** Originally, large cans containing rations given to the Okinawan people by American soldiers were used. * Headstock (天 ten) — The headstock of the instrument is made in an unspecified way, usually resembling that of a sanshin or shamisen. It is normally an extension of the neck. * Neck (棹 sou) — The long neck of the instrument is constructed from any one of an assortment of different types of wood. ** Originally, the neck was usually crafted from the leg post of a bed and was whittled down by using old, typically worn swords or bayonets left over from the war. * Strings (絃 chiru/gen/jiru) — The kankara, normally being a less costly instrument than a sanshin proper, may have its strings made from any of a variety of materials. There is no normative material used for stringing. Nylon, sinew, metal wire, etc. may be used, depending upon the maker. ** Originally, parachute cords were utilized for this purpose. * Tuning pegs (範 karakui) — The tuning pegs/knobs/keys used for the kankara are made in an unspecified way, sometimes resembling the long pegs characteristic of the sanshin and shamisen, and at other times more akin to those found on modern and classical guitars.

Kazakhs and Kyrgyz alike traditionally make shyrdaks, but especially in Kyrgyzstan, the tradition is still alive, and many of the products are sold to tourists. Design Steps in the process of making a shyrdak It takes the wool from approximately five sheep to make one shyrdak rug. The process is slow and labour-intensive. Traditionally shyrdak rugs have been made by women. Once collected the wool is picked clean washed, dried then dyed. The Shyrdak is usually designed in an inlaid patchwork highly contrasting colours such as red and green, yellow and black, brown and white. Once the wool is dried a brightly coloured pattern is laid on to a plain background this is then soaked with soap and water rolled up and literally pressed this process is repeated. Once the pattern starts to hold, the rug is reversed soaked and rolled again after some hours the shyrdak rug is left to dry. Two contrasting layers of felt are the laid on top of one another and a pattern is then marked on the top layer in chalk. This is painstakingly and laboriously cut out with the felt maker frequently sharpening the knife which will blunt quickly. This creates a stunning positive/negative style visual image usually full of symbolic motif images that represent things around them i.e. the water, goat horns, a yurt etc. Representations of sheep and shepherds are particularly common in Kazkahstan. The felt that is cut from the top layer is not wasted and is used to create another mirror image shyrdak with the reverse colours of the original shyrdak.

She had a long career as representative, talent scout and agent with Leland Hayward, MCA and International Creative Management (\\"ICM\\"). Career Brown was born into New York high society as the daughter of Kate Ross and Henry Collins Brown, a founder of the Museum of the City of New York. In later years, her Hollywood friends were amused by the fact that she was listed in the New York Social Register. In 1924, she graduated from Wellesley College with a B.A. in English and an interest in drama. After graduation, she went to work for the Mary Arden Theater School in Peterborough, New Hampshire, which was owned by Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Boston lawyer Guy Currier. In 1926, Kennedy and Currier acquired the movie studio Film Booking Offices of America and offered Brown a job in New York reading and acquiring literary properties for the company, with the title \\"Eastern Story Editor\\". She stayed with the company, renamed RKO in 1928 after its acquisition by Radio Corporation of America, and achieved her first major success by acquiring Edna Ferber's novel Cimarron. which was being sought by many movie companies, for a then-record $125,000. The movie of the book won the 1931 Academy Award for Best Picture. Later in 1931, David O. Selznick took over RKO. Selznick left RKO in 1933 to return to MGM, but in 1935 he found a financial backer, John Hay Whitney, who allowed him to set up his own studio, Selznick International Pictures. One of his first hires was Brown, still in the role of Eastern Story Editor, but later as \\"Eastern Representative\\" as Selznick expanded her role at the studio to that of his primary assistant. In addition to Gone with the Wind, she brought Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca to the attention of Selznick. She also persuaded Ingrid Bergman to leave Stockholm for Hollywood for the Selznick production Intermezzo: A Love Story; signed Laurence Olivier to his first American contract for Rebecca, and convinced Alfred Hitchcock to sign a seven-year contract with Selznick International so that he could direct Rebecca. She also acquired the rights to Rose Franken's Claudia: The Story of a Marriage in 1939 and was involved in the screen tests for that story that led to Phylis Walker (later renamed Jennifer Jones by Brown and Selznick) being signed by the studio.

Canada's President of the Treasury Board is the lead on Canadian open government and open data at the federal level. On March 17, 2011, Stockwell Day, then president, announced the launch of the 12-month pilot period for Canada's national open data site.Minister Day Launches Open Data Portal On April 11, 2012, Tony Clement, who had become president since, announced Canada's Action Plan on Open Government, a three-year plan for open data including: * expansion of the number of datasets made available, gathering requirements for the next generation platform, in the first year; and * design and implementation of the new data.gc.ca portal, improving the level of standardization of data, in the second and third years.Canada's Action Plan on Open Government On June 18, 2013, an updated version of the portal was launched, along with an updated Open Government licence. In addition to the main portal site, other Federal department sites include: * GeoGratis from Natural Resources Canada - \\"Geospatial data available online at no cost and without restrictions\\" * data from Environment Canada On October 9, 2014, the government issued the Directive on Open Government, an \\"open by default\\" directive for government publications and data. On November 6, 2014, the government announced the 2nd Action Plan on Open Government,Canada Launches Second Action Plan on Open Government including the following open data commitments: * Open Data Canada * Canadian Open Data Exchange (ODX) * Open Data for Development (OD4D) * Open Data Core Commitment On July 15, 2016, the government released their third action plan, titled the Third Biennial Plan to the Open Government Partnership, which continued the commitments on Open Data Canada, the Open Data Core Commitment and the Open Data Exchange. It added commitments to increase the availability and usability of geospatial data and release more budgetary, spending and financial data and information. On March 12, 2018, the government adopted the Open Data Charter,Canada letter to members of the advisory board of the Open Data Charter. In 2018, the government published the fourth action plan which was built on the foundation of the first three biennial plans. This plan made ten announcements, many of which are associated to open data including: user-friendly open government, corporate transparency, open science, access to information, reconciliation and open government and open government community. This plan is aimed at continuing the Canadian government's openness, transparency and accountability. These ten announcements are: * User-friendly open government * Financial transparency and accountability * Corporate transparency * Digital government and services * Open science * Healthy democracy * Access to information * Feminist and inclusive dialogue * Reconciliation and open government * Open government community  Multi-jurisdictional  * Federal open government portal provides data search across jurisdictions. *GeoConnections Discovery Portal - \\"Enabling discovery and access of Canada's geographical information on the Internet\\" * Community Accounts covers Newfoundland only - \\"providing users at all levels with a reliable source of community, regional, and provincial data\\" - but the Senate has endorsed making it Canada-wide.  Provincial  There are 8 Provinces and 1 Territory with open data in Canada as of March 2019: Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland & Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Québec, and Yukon.  Alberta  On May 28, 2013, the Province of Alberta launched the Alberta Open Data Portal with approximately 244 datasets. In August 2015 a new portal open.alberta.ca was released to the public, adding further content to the datasets including Government of Alberta publications, a blog, descriptions of how both datasets and publications are chosen and published on the portal. As of October 2017, there are 2361 datasets available to the public, including datasets connected to GeoDiscover Alberta.  British Columbia  On July 19, 2011, the Province of British Columbia launched DataBC, Canada's first provincial open data site.https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/open-data It contains data across a broad spectrum of subjects, access to tools to analyze the data, and a blog featuring data-related posts. Previously the site had been used just to host environmental data as part of the Apps 4 Climate Action contest, Canada's first app development contest. John Anzin was the grand prize winner as the designer of the best Web App in the Apps4Climate Action Apps contest held on September 16, 2010, at the Vancouver Aquarium, and attended by the Honourable John Yap, Minister of State for Climate Action. The winning App created by John Anzin is named VELO. VELO is a web app for businesses that encourages GHG emissions reduction through measurement and benchmarking internally and against peers. The app allows users to create visuals of an organization's emissions by numerous parameters, e.g. geography, branch, division, year, etc. Businesses would have the potential to change their practices, which can have far-reaching effects.https://archive.news.gov.bc.ca/releases/news_releases_2009-2013/2010env0057-001089.htm The Open Data Catalogue is supported by CKAN open source software which the BC government played an important role in the development.  Ontario  The efforts of Ontario to build a transparent and accessible government can date back to 1988 when Ontario established Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act giving public the access to government records. In 2011, Ontario's minister of research and innovation, Glen Murray announced on Twitter that the province had an open data project \\"being built over the next few months”.Ontario launches open data portal, catches up to rest of Canada Minister Murray indicated \\"the project is fully funded through MaRS - it is being built over the next few months\\".@Glen4TC (Glen Murray) on Twitter As of November 8, 2012, the Province of Ontario has an open data portal. It launched with 63 files. As of November 7, 2018, Open Data of Ontario listed 2655 data sets and more than 700 of which are accessible. Ontario has specific requirements for government data, Open Data Directive which require that unless due to legal, privacy, security, confidentiality or commercially sensitive reason factors all data are open to public on the Ontario Data Catalogue. Ontario also let public to vote for what data should be made public, and they are working on making the top 25 datasets available online.  Quebec  The Gautrin Report (Rapport Gautrin, \\"Gouverner ensemble : Comment le Web 2.0 améliorera-t-il les services aux citoyens?\\") released May 2, 2012, announced many open government initiatives, including an open data portal.Gouverner ensemble : Comment le Web 2.0 améliorera-t-il les services aux citoyens? The open data portal went live June 28, 2012.Le gouvernement du Québec pose le premier jalon du gouvernement ouvert et lance le portail www.données.gouv.qc.caMontreal Gazette - Quebec's open data portal: early reactions  Nova Scotia  In 2017 the Premier of Nova Scotia, Steven McNeil, announced that the province would join the open data movement across the country by creating a data portal, data.novascotia.ca. Data sets hosted on the portal focus on topics such as business and economy, communities and social services, government administration, nature and environment. To encourage the use of open data, the province's Open Data team partnered with Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS to offer an event where students used the public data sets in a contest to create data products.  Newfoundland and Labrador  In 2016 the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador joined the open data movement with the launch of their open data portal: https://opendata.gov.nl.ca/public/opendata/page/?page-id=home  Prince Edward Island  The government of PEI is dedicated to proving data in open format with easy and reliable access, and started its open data portal in 2018. PEI publishes data in different formats: CSV, JSON, XML, Geo formats and shapefiles. The open government portal of PEI is https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/.  Yukon  The goal of creating an open data repository for the government of Yukon was contained in the mandate letter of January 6, 2017 issued to Richard Mostyn, Minister of Highways and Public Works and Minister responsible for the Public Service Commission. The mandate letter directed the Minister to develop an open data repository in support of economic diversification in the innovation, science, and IT sectors, and to increase the amount of information available to citizens. The open data portal for Yukon is at https://open.yukon.ca/data/.  Municipal  While national and provincial level government is where attention is usually focused, equally important innovations in public sector open data initiatives can be found at the local government level. A 2014 survey found more than thirty Canadian municipalities had undertaken open data strategies, and the number of municipalities adopting open data policies and releasing open data has been steadily increasing over the past decade. As of June 2020, there are 62 municipalities that have open data portals in Canada. In an effort to increase the utilization of municipal open data, cities across Canada such as Edmonton2017 Open Data Day Hackathon: City of Edmonton and Ottawa2013 Apps for Ottawa Contest have created various contests and hackathons for building apps that use municipal open data.  Background  NOTE: Open data in Canada dates back to the 1970s with the sharing of satellite imagery, the Data Liberation Initiative in the early 1990s, Geogratis and Geobase at the turn of the millennia, the Information Commissioner's call for Open Government, and any number of other civil society actions and events. The following is a partial and recent history/background by politicians. The governing party in the 40th Canadian Parliament was the Conservative Party of Canada. The consultation paper Digital Canada 150 consultation paper for the government's Digital Economy Strategy, released May 10, 2010, included the statement that \\"Governments can help by making publicly-funded research data more readily available to Canadian researchers and businesses\\". On September 1, 2010, Canada's Access to Information and Privacy Commissioners issued an Open Government Resolution,Open Government - Resolution of Canada’s Access to Information and Privacy Commissioners (at OIC site)Open Government - Resolution of Canada’s Access to Information and Privacy Commissioners (at Privacy Commissioner site) but this does not have the force of law. They called for governments at all levels across Canada to endorse open government, and for them to proactively disclose information in open formats (i.e. open data). On October 18, 2010 Charlie Angus, an NDP MP, introduced a Private Members' Motion M-587 who primary purpose was to support the use of open source in the government, but which also called for \\"open access to government information\\".Parliament of Canada - Order Paper and Notice Paper No. 82 - October 19, 2010 On October 21, 2010, the Liberal Party of Canada released a party platform document, the Liberal Open Government Initiative. It included a commitment to create a national open data site opendata.gc.ca / donneesouvertes.gc.ca on which to \\"make as many government datasets as possible available\\".Liberal Open Government Initiative On October 25, 2010, Green Party blogger Emma Jane Hogbin raised the issue of open data and on November 25, 2010, the Green Party called for a Federal Open Data Policy.Greens Call For Federal Open Data Policy The House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics (ETHI), 40th Parliament, 3rd Session was conducting a study of Open Government. Recorded audio (Windows Media format) and minutes of their meetings are available. In October 2018, Canada started its one-year co-chairship of the Open Government Partnership, a collaborative organization supporting open government progress worldwide. The three leadership priorities are inclusion, participation and impact. As the co-chair, the 2019 Open Government Partnership Global Summit will be hosted in Ottawa in May 2019.  Information and advocacy  * The CivicAccess.ca List is where the CivicAccess.ca network discusses how levels of government can and should make civic information and data accessible at no cost in open formats to their citizens. A similar network with a focus on British Columbia is The Open Data Society of British Columbia. * datalibre.ca is a blog which believes all levels of Canadian governments should make civic information and data accessible at no cost in open formats to their citizens. Data are collected using Canadian tax-payer funds, and use of those data should not be restricted to those who can afford the exorbitant fees. * The Lac Carling Congress annually brings together professionals from all three levels of government in Canada with private sector companies. The event focuses on the advancement of electronic delivery of government services in Canada. * There have been several ChangeCamps across Canada in 2009 and 2010. * There are several citizen advocacy groups throughout Canada that work with governments and institutions to adopt open data policies: ** Alberta *** Edmonton: Change Camp Edmonton ** British Columbia: Open Data Society of BC ** Ontario *** Guelph: OpenGuelph *** Halton: OpenHalton *** Hamilton: OpenHamilton *** London: Open Data London *** Mississauga: Mississauga Data *** Ottawa: Open Data Ottawa *** Waterloo Region: Open Data Waterloo Region *** Windsor: Open Data Windsor ** Québec: Québec ouvert *** Gatineau: Gatineau ouverte *** Montréal: Montréal Ouvert *** Québec: Capitale ouverte ** Saskatchewan: Saskatchewan Open Data  Criticisms  A number of the cities use licences that are arguably not Open Data licences as defined by the U.S.-based Sunlight Foundation, and allow for arbitrary and retroactive banning of use.

Produce traceability is an important link in protecting public health since it allows health agencies to more quickly and accurately identify the source of contaminated fruit or vegetables believed to be the cause of an outbreak of foodborne illness, remove them from the marketplace, and communicate to the supply chain. Since many fruits and vegetables are eaten raw, the produce industry‚ from farmer to retailer, works diligently to protect these foods from contamination. Despite their best efforts, foreign matter can occasionally contaminate produce in the field or orchard, in packing or processing, in transit or storage. Because traceability systems can provide information on the source, location, movement and storage conditions of produce, they also allow growers, packers, processors and distributors to identify factors affecting quality and delivery. Beginning in 2008, an industry-led effort to enhance traceability throughout the entire produce supply chain was launched as the Produce Traceability Initiative.  Trends in outbreaks of produce-related illness  An analysis of 3,500 food-poisoning outbreaks between 1990 and 2003 found that contaminated produce was responsible for the greatest number of individual foodborne illnesses. The study, by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, found that produce caused 428 outbreaks and 23,857 cases of illness.Contaminated Produce Top Food Poisoning Culprit, http://www.cspinet.org/new/200404011.html Authorities note that several factors have contributed to the rise in outbreaks: *Great consumption of fresh produce, especially cut fruits and vegetables. *Wider distribution. *Improved electronic reporting of outbreaks. *An aging population more susceptible to foodborne illness. *Unlike meat, which can be rid of bacteria through proper cooking, fresh produce is often meant to be consumed raw.E. Coli Outbreaks Reveal Food Safety Holes, The Washington Post, 12/11/2006, https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2006/12/10/AR2006121000903_pf.html Salmonella is a common source of foodborne illness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration noted in 2007 that fruit and vegetable-related outbreaks of food poisoning are on the rise and had struck in spinach, tomatoes, lettuce and cantaloupes. The agency urged fruit and vegetable processors to adopt food safety plans similar to those in the meat industry.FDA Announces New Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable Growers, http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_story/0,3566,258356,00.html An outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul in 2008 was characterized by the US Center for Disease Control as the largest foodborne outbreak in a decade. Some 1304 infected persons were identified in 43 states, at least 252 were hospitalized and two deaths were possibly linked to the outbreak. CDC noted that the trace back of fresh produce, such as tomatoes, through the supply chain could be very difficult and labor-intensive.Statement by Lonnie J. King, D.V.M., CDC, 7/30/2008, https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2008/07/t20080730g.html Ironically, the carrier item was ultimately determined to be jalapeño peppers, not tomatoes.Salmonella found on pepper; FDA strengthens warning, http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/07/21/fda.salmonella/index.html  Benefits  Tracing of an item through various stages of production, manufacturing, processing, handling, transportation, sales and consumption is a widespread practice in today's world. Manufacturers may require purchasers to register ownership of a product to facilitate possible future recall for safety reasons or warranty fulfillment. The Post Office and package delivery companies make widespread use of tracking packages from pickup to delivery, even to destinations on the other side of the world. Some often-recognized benefits of traceability include: *Ability to determine the origin of a product, ingredient or component. *Simplifies problem-solving in event of defective or contaminated product, ingredient or component. *Allows issues to be more quickly identified, contained and resolved. *Limits losses and lowers costs. *Protects public health and safety. *Builds trust and confidence in affected products, businesses or systems. *Verifies that produce is locally grown.Top 10 Produce#cite note-0 *Improves operating efficiencies for growers, packers and shippers.Produce Packing, http://www.redlineforproduce.com/main- solutions/redline-packing.html  Voluntary industry initiatives  In 1930, produce industry leaders sponsored legislation to require an internal trail of accounting between buyers and sellers along the entire produce marketing chain. This law, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) of 1930, set the foundation for basic traceability.Continuous Improvement Trends in Produce Traceability, http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/article.asp?id=2909⊂=sub1 More recently, the Bioterrorism Act of 2002 required food companies to keep records that could be traced in the produce supply chain (i.e.one step up and one step back).US Bioterrorism Act, 2002 Title III -- Protecting Safety and Security of Food and Drug Supply, https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm155769.htm Based on these records, many organizations in the fresh produce distribution chain have long maintained the ability to trace products inside their enterprise. In simple terms, they know where they got it and where they sent it, but with products that may move through multiple parties who may transform or comingle them, trying to connect many links quickly in time of crisis is a challenge. Some 30 years ago, manufacturers and retailers created an organization called GS1 to improve the efficiency of the distribution of food and consumer goods to supermarkets. Today GS1 is a leading global organization dedicated to the design and implementation of global standards and solutions to improve the efficiency and visibility of supply and demand chains globally and across sectors.About GS1, http://www.gs1.org/about/overviewGS1 Global Traceability Standard, One of its many programs was to develop the now-familiar bar code on products that can be scanned at checkout by retailers. GS1‚international standards will provide the foundation for the PTI. Multiple shippers, distributors and retailers in the produce industry have endorsed the Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI) to encourage adoption of whole chain traceability. The initiative's sponsor associations include United Fresh Produce Association (United Fresh), Canadian Produce Marketing Association (CPMA) and Produce Marketing Association (PMA).Produce Traceability Initiative, http://www.producetraceability.org/ Both internal and external traceability programs are needed in order to effectively track and trace product up and down the supply chain, achieving whole-chain traceability. At present, most companies have internal traceability programs but not external traceability. The PTI outlines a six-step course of action to achieve chain- wide adoption of electronic traceability of every case produce by the year 2012. Meanwhile, companies are putting into operation technologies that will support the PTI.  Legislative and regulatory matters  Traceability of food is legally required in the European Union (Regulation 178/2002)with dedicated initiatives in EU countries like the UKhttp://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/policy/quality- package-2010/certification-guidelines_en.pdf and Northern Ireland.https://www.lmcni.com/farm-quality-assurance/ In the United States, various government agencies have oversight or regulatory control over different aspects of fresh fruit and produce production, processing and distribution. These include the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control. Some groups have pushed for a single food-safety agency, on-farm improvements and improved reporting and surveillance of foodborne illness outbreaks.More Food Safety Measures Needed on Farms, Says CSPI, http://www.cspinet.org/new/200404011.html The draft Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009 was introduced May 27, 2009, in the U.S. House of Representatives. It would expand FDA authority, require registration of food manufacturers and processors, regulate crop cultivation and harvesting and other measures. After committee hearings and extensive amendment, the bill (HR2749) passed the House on July 30, 2009. HR2749 does not specifically endorse the PTI, or prescribe a traceability method or methodology, but instead Section 107 calls for regulations establishing a tracing system that includes: #the establishment and maintenance of lot numbers; #a standardized format for pedigree information; and #the use of a common nomenclature for food with a goal of identifying each person who grows, produces, manufactures, processes, packs, transports, holds, or sells food in as short a timeframe as practicable but no longer than 2 business days. The measure has since died in the Senate. Text of H.R. 2749: Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009, http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2749 In parallel, the White House created a Food Safety Working GroupReport of President‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Food Safety Working Group, http://www.foodsafetyworkinggroup.gov/FSWG_Fact_Sheet.pdf which has issued statements calling for a national traceability system that would enhance traceability of all food, but without specifically endorsing a particular approach.  Technology  Radio-frequency identification and barcodes (including QR-codesThe companies trying to track everything we eat, from seed to stomach) are two common technology methods used to deliver traceability. The blockchain is also sometimes usedOriginTrail. An example of a generic RFID chip. RFID is often used with track-and-trace solutions, and has a critical role to play in supply chains. RFID is a code-carrying technology, and can be used in place of a barcode to enable non-line of sight-reading. Widespread deployment of RFID has been inhibited by certain limitations of the technology: tag cost, tag readability and privacy issues. The cost of RFID tags currently limits their economic justification for item level tagging or case-level tagging in the produce industry. Reading RFID tags requires specialized equipment limiting their usefulness for consumers today. Product orientation, packing density and materials (in particular water, which is predominant in produce) can have a significant detrimental effect on read reliability of passive tags. Finally, the widespread use of RFID tags on consumer goods is anticipated to be contentious until privacy concerns can be satisfied. matrix barcodes to record data on specific produce. Barcoding is a common and cost-effective method used to implement traceability at both the item and case-level. Variable data in a barcode or a numeric or alphanumeric code format can be applied to the packaging or label. The secure data can be used as a pointer to traceability information and can also correlate with production data such as time to market and product quality.Traceability: Giving every product an authentic identity, Package Printing, June 1, 2008 Packaging converters have a choice of three different classes of technology to print barcodes: *Inkjet (dot on demand or continuous) systems are capable of printing high resolution (300 dpi or higher for dot on demand) images at press speed (up to 1000fpm). These solutions can be deployed either on-press or off- line. *Laser marking can be employed to ablate a coating or to cause a color change in certain materials. The advantage of laser is fine detail and high speed for character printing, and no consumables. Not all substrates accept a laser mark, and certain colors (e.g. red) are not suitable for barcode reading. Thermal Transfer and Direct Thermal. For lower speed off-press applications, thermal transfer and direct thermal printers are ideal for printing variable data on labels. Software systems are available for managing traceability throughout the entire production, processing, marketing and distribution system. Some of these software systems combine multiple software modules allowing the producer to capture traceability information from all farming, processing and packing activities. Others, capture data in the field and packing operations to integrate with retail buying platforms and carry data all the way to the end consumer. Leveraging new advancements in mobile technology, food brands are now incorporating mobile messaging and QR codes on product labels. Consumers can text or scan the barcode with smartphones for immediate retrieval of product information. Consumers can also trace the origins of their purchased produce at websites. Consumers can type a code found on a produce item into a search box at the tracing website and view information about the grower, field, and packing operation that the produce came from.

This would enable the battery to provide large amounts of high angle plunging fire into the Solent, targetted at the vulnerable unarmoured decks of warships. In 1873 four gun positions were constructed at the sea face of the battery for four 11-inch Rifled Muzzle Loading (RML) guns. My 1886 these four guns and 30 mortars provided the entire armament of the battery. The following year all of the mortars were removed as they were obsolete by that time.The National Archives WO33/2770, Précis of correspondence relating to coastal defences: Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, 1860-1893 In 1888 a proposal for two 10.4-inch RML guns on an Armstrong protected barbette was put forward, and these had been fitted by 1892. They were the only guns of this type to be fitted in Great Britain. In 1901 the armament of the battery was modernised with positions for two 9.2-inch Breech Loading (BL) guns and two 6-inch Breech Loading (BL) guns.The National Archives WO78/4894, Portsmouth Defences, Isle of Wight sub district: Puckpool Battery, 14 plans, 1902-1913 Gun emplacement for 9.2-inch Breech Loading (BL) gun The battery was disarmed in 1927 and sold to the local district council the following year. It was brought back into use during the Second World War as HMS Medina to train men of the Fleet Air Arm. It has been used as a public recreational space since that time and has since been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The gun positions are openly accessible and a number of original buildings survive. These include the guard room, barrack block and magazines. References Publications  Moore, David, 2010.

The controversial installation consists of a Confederate flag hanging from a noose at a gallows. The Proper way to Hang a Confederate Flag was first shown in Schmucker Gallery at Gettysburg College in 2004 as a part of Sims' Recoloration Proclamation: The Gettysburg Redress. Recoloration Proclamation targets specific traditional symbols of southern heritage, which are inextricably linked to slavery and racism in America. Included in the exhibition are recolored Confederate flags, a Confederate flag hanging from the gallows, a contemporary rewrite of the Gettysburg Address, contemporary recordings of the song \\"Dixie\\", and a documentary film. A notable piece featured in the exhibition Recoloration Proclamation: The Gettysburg Redress is ReVote, an installation featuring three voting booths used in Florida's disputed 2000 presidential election with re-colored Confederate flags hanging above, including black, red, and green for the Pan-African Flag of the African Liberation Movement. Pink and lavender Confederate flags with feathers and sequins were also created for the exhibition signifying \\"drag flags\\". John Sims received national media attention for his lynching of the Confederate flag. A related exhibition, Dread Scott's interactive installation What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag? was first shown at The Art Institute of Chicago in 1989. Scott's piece became the center of national controversy over its use of the American flag. Dread Scott's piece begins with a photomontage of American flags draped over coffins as well as South Korean citizens burning American flags while protesting American foreign policy. The question, \\"What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. flag?\\" is written across the images. The photomontage hangs above a table where exhibit visitors are invited to write their answers to Scott's question in a blank book. A American flag is placed on the ground in front of the table, and if visitors want to write in the book, they must first step on the flag. What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag? joined Sims' The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag in Sarasota, Florida, at the Crossley Gallery in 2006. Exhibitions Schmucker Gallery, Gettysburg *Schmucker Gallery, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 2004: The lynching exhibit was initially set to be installed outdoors in front of Schmucker Gallery at Gettysburg College, and would have remained open to the public for three weeks. Sons of Confederate Veterans, Gettysburg Battlefield Preservation Association (GBPA), and other members of the community objected strongly to the exhibition. Detractors interpreted the exhibit as anti- southern heritage. Sims wrote about his motivation, \\"...Our sense of history is segregated, our social identity is fractured and our vocabularies for discussing race, symbols and respect are bare.\\" Ultimately, Gettysburg College administration changed the location and duration of the exhibit. The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag was installed inside of Schmucker Gallery. John Sims boycotted the exhibition. *Georgia State University, Atlanta, 2005: The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag was shown in a group show, Potentially Harmful: The Art of American Censorship. The group exhibition examines the role of artistic controversy in shaping a free society. Through two exhibitions, presentations of spoken word and performance artists, artists' talks, panel discussions, a film screening and a series of legal seminars, this project reflects an environment that nurtures contentious art. Artists included in the exhibition are Lynda Benglis, Critical Art Ensemble, Sue Coe, Benita Carr, Alex Donis, Karen Finley, Eric Fischl, Tom Forsythe, John Jota Leaños, Gayla Lemke, Alma Lopez, Robert Mapplethorpe, Carolee Scheemann, Dread Scott, Andres Serrano, Elizabeth Sisco, Louis Hock, David Avalos, John Sims, John Anthony Trobaugh, Pat Ward Williams, Nancy Worthington, Marilyn Zimmerman, and The File. *Crossley Gallery, Sarasota, Florida, 2006: The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag was shown at Ringling College of Art and Design in the Crowley Gallery alongside Dread Scott's What is the Proper Way to Hang a U.S. Flag?:Crossley Gallery, Sarasota *Bowery Poetry Club, New York, 2006: Recoloration Proclamation: The New York City Hangings was the title of the New York City exhibition.

Background The origins of the Civil War Archive date back to the decree which, on September 13, 1936, established that \\"all properties and documents belonging to the political parties and organizations mentioned, as well as any other that opposed the movimiento nacional were to become the property of the State.\\"«cuantos bienes muebles, inmuebles, efectos y documentos pertenecieren a los referidos partidos políticos o agrupaciones, así como a cuantas organizaciones han tomado parte en la oposición hecha a las fuerzas que cooperan al movimiento nacional, pasando todo ello a la propiedad del Estado». The original decree was supplemented by successive decrees, such as that of April 20, 1937, which set up a counter-propaganda unit, the Oficina de Investigación y Propaganda Anticomunista (OIPA), and of May 29, 1937, which created the Delegación Nacional de Asuntos Especiales, charged with \\"recompiling documentation regarding sects operating in the country... in order to set up an Archive with which to establish, uncover and sanction the enemies of the Patria.\\"«...cuanta documentación relacionada con las sectas y sus actividades en España, estuviese en poder de particulares, autoridades y organismos oficiales, guardándola cuidadosamente en lugar alejado de todo peligro, y en el que pudiera ordenarse y clasificarse para constituir un Archivo que nos permitiera conocer, desenmascarar y sancionar a los enemigos de la Patria». The systematic recompilation of documents commenced with the fall of Bilbao, and in 1938 Serrano Súñer as Minister of the Interior, set up the Delegación del Estado para Recuperación de Documentos which started preparing documentation with which to prepare trials at military courts. On the other hand, the Delegación de Servicios Especiales, which reported to General Franco's Private Office, was located at Salamanca, the city Franco had established as his headquarters. In 1944, given the overlapping functions of the two bodies, they were brought together under the Delegación Nacional de Servicios Documentales, belonging to the Presidencia del Gobierno. Their function was specifically, to draw up dossiers to be used at the numerous courts set up under the regime: courts martial in general; the Tribunales de Responsabilidades Políticas; the Tribunales de Depuración de Funcionarios and the Tribunal Especial para la Represión de la Masonería y el Comunismo. With the death of Franco, the dictatorship's Document Services was suppressed by the Royal Decree 276/1977Real Decreto 2761/1977, de 28 de octubre, por el que se reorganiza la Presidencia del Gobierno. and in 1979 the collection was transferred to the newly created Ministry of CultureOrden de 7 de mayo de 1979 por la que se dispone se adscriba al Archivo Historico Nacional los fondos documentales de la extinguida Seccion de Servicios Documentales, formando en el mismo una division independiente. whose National Historic Archive set up a dedicated department.

She presented a new body of work titled Solvent Magazine at BFMAF 2018 which included sculptural and video pieces made during her six-month residency with BFMAF and Berwick Visual Arts.

He is most noted for his work as chief of staff, 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing under Lieutenant General Francis P. Mulcahy and later as chief of staff, Marine Air, West Coast under same commander. Salzman won Navy Cross, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat, while in Nicaragua with 2nd Marine Brigade. Early years Salzman was born on June 12, 1902, in Louis Corners, Wisconsin, and attended elementary school there. His family later moved to Kiel, Wisconsin, and Elmer graduated from Kiel High School in 1920. He then received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1922. During his years at the academy, Salzman competed in track and finally graduated on June 3, 1926. Many of his classmates were later promoted to the general officer ranks: Edward W. Snedeker, Thomas A. Wornham, Arthur H. Butler, Roy M. Gulick, Russell N. Jordahl, Nels H. Nelson, Kenneth W. Benner, Hartnoll J. Withers, James S. Russell, Laurence H. Frost, C. Wade McClusky, Robert B. Pirie, Charles L. Carpenter, Tom Hamilton or Henry C. Bruton. Following his commissioning as second lieutenant in the Marine Corps, Salzman was attached to the 2nd Marine Brigade under Brigadier General Logan Feland and ordered for his first expeditionary duty to Nicaragua. Marines were ordered to Nicaragua to support the Guardia Nacional in the fight with rebel bandits under Augusto César Sandino. Salzman led a patrol in the vicinity of village Zapote in Nueva Segovia Department on September 28, 1928. They ambushed a superior bandit force under the command of General Carlos Salgado and subsequently defeated them. Salzman received the Navy Cross for his courage, skill and leadership during that action. He also received Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit with Diploma. Upon his return to the States, Salzman applied for naval aviation training and after completion of his course at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, he was designated Naval aviator in 1929. He was ordered to Haiti with Observation Squadron and later served with the same unit at Marine Air Station Quantico, Virginia. He then attended a postgraduate course in ordnance at the Naval Academy, and, following the graduation in 1937, Salzman served as commanding officer of the Marine detachment aboard the heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis until 1939. World War II Salzman was appointed an instructor at United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1939 and taught there for next two years. With the activation of Naval Air Station Quonset Point, he was ordered there in summer 1941 and assumed command of 13th Provisional Company as garrison unit. Following the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, Salzman was transferred to the staff of 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing under Major General Francis P. Mulcahy and appointed wing intelligence officer. He took part in the Guadalcanal Campaign and was appointed wing chief of staff in June 1943. Salzman was later commended by his work on Guadalcanal and received the Bronze Star Medal. He reached the rank of colonel and continued as chief of staff of 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing during Solomon Islands campaign. He also simultaneously served as chief of staff, New Georgia Air Force and acting chief of staff, Marine Aircraft South Pacific. Salzman distinguished himself again and was decorated with Legion of Merit by Admiral William F. Halsey. At the end of March 1944, Salzman was ordered back to the United States and after brief reunion with his wife and kids, he was appointed chief of staff, Marine Air, West Coast with headquarters in San Diego in May of that year. Colonel Salzman was later transferred to the staff of III Marine Amphibious Corps under Lieutenant General Roy Geiger and appointed assistant chief of staff for military plans. Within this command, he took part in the Battle of Okinawa in April 1945 and received his second Legion of Merit. Salzman also worked on the plans for Army units during the campaign and received third Legion of Merit. Retirement He retired in 1949 as a brigadier general to go to work for the Aerospace division of Minneapolis-Honeywell. In 1953 his son Kenneth Salzman graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. Salzman died of a brain aneurysm September 24, 1958, survived by his wife, the former Helen Maxwell Stevenson (originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania).Obituary of Helen from USNA website General Salzman is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Navy Cross citation In 1928, Salzman received the Navy Cross for his actions during the Second Nicaraguan Campaign. His award citation reads: :The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Second Lieutenant Elmer Henry Salzman (MCSN: 0-4074), United States Marine Corps, for distinguished service in the line of his profession as commander of a patrol of the Second Brigade, U.S. Marine Corps, operating in the vicinity of Zapote, Nueva Segovia, Nicaragua on 28 September 1928. Second Lieutenant Salzman's command surprised a greatly superior bandit force under the command of General Salgado by a well planned attack on its rear which resulted in the rout of the bandits. The arrival of the Force of Second Lieutenant Salzman was particularly fortuitous as the bandits had another small patrol of Marines at a great disadvantage and it appeared that they must inevitably suffer a disastrous defeat. Although the bandits outnumbered the combined patrols more than two-to-one, Second Lieutenant Salzman displayed such courage, skill and leadership in conducting the engagement that the bandits were decisively defeated and the beleaguered patrol rescued from its perilous position.

CDI and partners create community centers in low-income, rural, indigenous communities, hospitals, prisons, and psychiatric clinics. These centers work to strengthen low-income communities by providing access to information and communication technologies. The National Digital Inclusion Alliance, a US-based nonprofit organization has defined digital inclusion as follows: Digital Inclusion refers to the activities necessary to ensure that all individuals and communities, including the most disadvantaged, have access to and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). This includes 5 elements: 1) affordable, robust broadband internet service; 2) internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user; 3) access to digital literacy training; 4) quality technical support; and 5) applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation and collaboration. Changed in 2015 to Recode and recode.org.br. Overview Rodrigo Baggio founded the Comitê para Democratização da Informática (roughly translated as \\"Committee for Democracy in Information Technology\\" in the Portuguese language) in 1995. Its plan was social entrepreneurship to overcome the digital divide. CDI is a network of self-managed and self-sustaining CDI Community Centers throughout Brazil and 13 other countries – monitored and coordinated by their 23 regional offices. Schools are located in low-income communities, indigenous communities, psychiatric clinics, hospitals for mentally and physically disabled, and detention facilities. CDI is an international non-governmental organization (NGO) headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, with operations in the US, Europe and Latin America. CDI helps disadvantaged groups use Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). CDI community centers are technology and learning centers in impoverished communities. Each community center is a partnership with an existing grassroots organization. The community-based organizations provide the infrastructure, and CDI provides free computers and software, implements educational methods, trains instructors and monitors the schools. Methodology CDI community centers are self-managed and self-sustainable. Students collectively identify a common challenge facing their community and prepare an action plan to overcome it. Issues can range from sexual abuse, pollution, violence, crime, and drugs, to lack of health care or schools. Students can take the technical skills they’ve learned in class to mobilize their communities, engage in advocacy and awareness campaigns, and work together to solve that specific problem. CDI focuses on making people active and informed citizens, capable of organizing their communities, making their voices heard, and subsequently, affecting change.  Recognition  After a pilot program in two favelas, Ashoka: Innovators for the Public provided initial funding for three years starting in 1996. The AVINA Foundation, the Inter-American Development Bank, Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, Skoll Foundation, Tech Museum, Unicef and Unesco also provided support. CDI founder Rodrigo Baggio was named by the World Economic Forum as one of “100 Global Leaders for Tomorrow”, by Time magazine as one of the 50 leaders in Latin America that will make a difference in the third millennium, by CNN, Time and Fortune as one of the world’s ten “Principal Voices in Economic Development”. In 2009 he was invited to join the Strategy Council of the UN’s new Global Alliance for Information and Communication Technologies and Development and the Clinton Global Initiative. International expansion CDI opened development offices in New York City (with 501(c)(3) US tax status) in 2007 and London in 2008 (UK Registered Charity), using the same acronym with an English language expansion (Centre for Digital Inclusion or CDI Europe in the UK). With the support of James Wolfensohn, former president of the World Bank and the Wolfensohn Institute, CDI planned to expand to the Middle East and North Africa, to be followed by India and other parts of Africa. Since 2010, CDI UK is called CDI Apps For Good. Apps for Good is an acclaimed education movement where young people in schools learn to create apps that can change their world, according to CDI's methodology. During April- June 2010, CDI Apps for Good successfully ran the first pilot course with 9 unemployed young people aged 16–25 at High Trees Development Trust in South London. Apps for Good has grown significantly and now has nearly 655 schools in the UK delivering the courses to more than 100,000 students aged 11 to 18.

Examples of such variables include financial asset prices, portfolio performance, and other antecedent and consequent variables. The theory was originally proposed by Arthur P. DempsterA. P. Dempster, \\"Normal belief functions and the Kalman filter,\\" in Data Analysis from Statistical Foundations, A. K. M. E. Saleh, Ed.: Nova Science Publishers, 2001, pp. 65–84. in the context of Kalman Filters and later was elaborated, refined, and applied to knowledge representation in artificial intelligence and decision making in finance and accounting by Liping Liu.Liu, Liping, Catherine Shenoy, and Prakash P. Shenoy, “Knowledge Representation and Integration for Portfolio Evaluation Using Linear Belief Functions,” IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Series A, vol. 36 (4), 2006, pp. 774–785.  Concept  A linear belief function intends to represent our belief regarding the location of the true value as follows: We are certain that the truth is on a so-called certainty hyperplane but we do not know its exact location; along some dimensions of the certainty hyperplane, we believe the true value could be anywhere from –∞ to +∞ and the probability of being at a particular location is described by a normal distribution; along other dimensions, our knowledge is vacuous, i.e., the true value is somewhere from –∞ to +∞ but the associated probability is unknown. A belief function in general is defined by a mass function over a class of focal elements, which may have nonempty intersections. A linear belief function is a special type of belief function in the sense that its focal elements are exclusive, parallel sub-hyperplanes over the certainty hyperplane and its mass function is a normal distribution across the sub-hyperplanes. Based on the above geometrical description, ShaferG. Shafer, \\"A note on Dempster's Gaussian belief functions,\\" School of Business, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, Technical Report 1992. and LiuL. Liu, \\"A theory of Gaussian belief functions,\\" International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, vol. 14, pp. 95–126, 1996 propose two mathematical representations of a LBF: a wide-sense inner product and a linear functional in the variable space, and as their duals over a hyperplane in the sample space. Monney P. A. Monney, A Mathematical Theory of Arguments for Statistical Evidence. New York, NY: Springer, 2003. proposes still another structure called Gaussian hints. Although these representations are mathematically neat, they tend to be unsuitable for knowledge representation in expert systems.  Knowledge representation  A linear belief function can represent both logical and probabilistic knowledge for three types of variables: deterministic such as an observable or controllable, random whose distribution is normal, and vacuous on which no knowledge bears. Logical knowledge is represented by linear equations, or geometrically, a certainty hyperplane. Probabilistic knowledge is represented by a normal distribution across all parallel focal elements. In general, assume X is a vector of multiple normal variables with mean μ and covariance Σ. Then, the multivariate normal distribution can be equivalently represented as a moment matrix: : M(X) = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma \\\\end{array} \\\\right). If the distribution is non-degenerate, i.e., Σ has a full rank and its inverse exists, the moment matrix can be fully swept: : M(\\\\vec X) = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\mu \\\\Sigma^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\Sigma^{-1} \\\\end{array} \\\\right) Except for normalization constant, the above equation completely determines the normal density function for X. Therefore, M(\\\\vec X) represents the probability distribution of X in the potential form. These two simple matrices allow us to represent three special cases of linear belief functions. First, for an ordinary normal probability distribution M(X) represents it. Second, suppose one makes a direct observation on X and obtains a value μ. In this case, since there is no uncertainty, both variance and covariance vanish, i.e., Σ = 0. Thus, a direct observation can be represented as: : M(X) = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right) Third, suppose one is completely ignorant about X. This is a very thorny case in Bayesian statistics since the density function does not exist. By using the fully swept moment matrix, we represent the vacuous linear belief functions as a zero matrix in the swept form follows: : M(\\\\vec X) = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right] One way to understand the representation is to imagine complete ignorance as the limiting case when the variance of X approaches to ∞, where one can show that Σ−1 = 0 and hence M(\\\\vec X) vanishes. However, the above equation is not the same as an improper prior or normal distribution with infinite variance. In fact, it does not correspond to any unique probability distribution. For this reason, a better way is to understand the vacuous linear belief functions as the neutral element for combination (see later). To represent the remaining three special cases, we need the concept of partial sweeping. Unlike a full sweeping, a partial sweeping is a transformation on a subset of variables. Suppose X and Y are two vectors of normal variables with the joint moment matrix: : M(X,Y) = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\mu_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma _{11} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma_{21} \\\\end{array} & \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\mu_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma _{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma_{22} \\\\end{array} \\\\end{array} \\\\right] Then M(X, Y) may be partially swept. For example, we can define the partial sweeping on X as follows: : M(\\\\vec X,Y) = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\mu _1 (\\\\Sigma_{11})^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -(\\\\Sigma_{11})^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma_{21} (\\\\Sigma_{11})^{-1} \\\\end{array} & \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\mu_2 - \\\\mu_1 (\\\\Sigma_{11} )^{-1} \\\\Sigma_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\Sigma_{11} )^{-1} \\\\Sigma_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma_{22} - \\\\Sigma_{21} (\\\\Sigma_{11})^{-1} \\\\Sigma_{12} \\\\end{array} \\\\end{array} \\\\right] If X is one- dimensional, a partial sweeping replaces the variance of X by its negative inverse and multiplies the inverse with other elements. If X is multidimensional, the operation involves the inverse of the covariance matrix of X and other multiplications. A swept matrix obtained from a partial sweeping on a subset of variables can be equivalently obtained by a sequence of partial sweepings on each individual variable in the subset and the order of the sequence does not matter. Similarly, a fully swept matrix is the result of partial sweepings on all variables. We can make two observations. First, after the partial sweeping on X, the mean vector and covariance matrix of X are respectively \\\\mu_1 (\\\\Sigma _{11} )^{-1} and -(\\\\Sigma_{11} )^{-1} , which are the same as that of a full sweeping of the marginal moment matrix of X. Thus, the elements corresponding to X in the above partial sweeping equation represent the marginal distribution of X in potential form. Second, according to statistics, \\\\mu_2 - \\\\mu_1 (\\\\Sigma_{11} )^{-1} \\\\Sigma_{12} is the conditional mean of Y given X = 0; \\\\Sigma_{22} - \\\\Sigma_{21} (\\\\Sigma_{11} )^{-1} \\\\Sigma_{12} is the conditional covariance matrix of Y given X = 0; and (\\\\Sigma_{11} )^{-1} \\\\Sigma_{12} is the slope of the regression model of Y on X. Therefore, the elements corresponding to Y indices and the intersection of X and Y in M(\\\\vec X,Y)represents the conditional distribution of Y given X = 0\\\\. These semantics render the partial sweeping operation a useful method for manipulating multivariate normal distributions. They also form the basis of the moment matrix representations for the three remaining important cases of linear belief functions, including proper belief functions, linear equations, and linear regression models.  Proper linear belief functions  For variables X and Y, assume there exists a piece of evidence justifying a normal distribution for variables Y while bearing no opinions for variables X. Also, assume that X and Y are not perfectly linearly related, i.e., their correlation is less than 1\\\\. This case involves a mix of an ordinary normal distribution for Y and a vacuous belief function for X. Thus, we represent it using a partially swept matrix as follows: : M(\\\\vec X,Y) = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{array} & \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\mu_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma_{22} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\end{array} \\\\right] This is how we could understand the representation. Since we are ignorant on X, we use its swept form and set \\\\mu_1 (\\\\Sigma_{11})^{-1} = 0 and \\\\- (\\\\Sigma_{11})^{-1} = 0. Since the correlation between X and Y is less than 1, the regression coefficient of X on Y approaches to 0 when the variance of X approaches to ∞. Therefore, (\\\\Sigma_{11})^{-1} \\\\Sigma_{12} = 0. Similarly, one can prove that \\\\mu_1 (\\\\Sigma_{11})^{-1} \\\\Sigma_{12} = 0 and \\\\Sigma_{21} (\\\\Sigma_{11})^{-1} \\\\Sigma_{12} = 0.  Linear equations  Suppose X and Y are two row vectors, and Y = XA + b, where A and b are the coefficient matrices. We represent the equation using a partially swept matrix as follows: : M(\\\\vec X,Y) = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ A^T \\\\end{array} & \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} b \\\\\\\\\\\\ A \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{array} \\\\end{array} \\\\right] We can understand the representation based on the fact that a linear equation contains two pieces of knowledge: (1) complete ignorance about all variables; and (2) a degenerate conditional distribution of dependent variables given independent variables. Since X is an independent vector in the equation, we are completely ignorant about it. Thus, \\\\mu_1 (\\\\Sigma _{11})^{-1} = 0 and -(\\\\Sigma_{11})^{-1} = 0. Given X = 0, Y is completely determined to be b. Thus, the conditional mean of Y is b and the conditional variance is 0. Also, the regression coefficient matrix is A. Note that the knowledge to be represented in linear equations is very close to that in a proper linear belief functions, except that the former assumes a perfect correlation between X and Y while the latter does not. This observation is interesting; it characterizes the difference between partial ignorance and linear equations in one parameter — correlation.  Linear regression models  A linear regression model is a more general and interesting case than previous ones. Suppose X and Y are two vectors and Y = XA + b + E, where A and b are the appropriate coefficient matrices and E is an independent white noise satisfying E ~ N(0, Σ). We represent the model as the following partially swept matrix: : M(\\\\vec X,Y) = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ A^T \\\\end{array} & \\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} b \\\\\\\\\\\\ A \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma \\\\end{array} \\\\end{array} \\\\right] This linear regression model may be considered as the combination of two pieces of knowledge (see later), one is specified by the linear equation involving three variables X, Y, and E, and the other is a simple normal distribution of E, i.e., E ~ N(0, Σ). Alternatively, one may consider it similar to a linear equation, except that, given X = 0, Y is not completely determined to be b. Instead, the conditional mean of Y is b while the conditional variance is Σ. Note that, in this alternative interpretation, a linear regression model forms a basic building block for knowledge representation and is encoded as one moment matrix. Besides, the noise term E does not appear in the representation. Therefore, it makes the representation more efficient. From representing the six special cases, we see a clear advantage of the moment matrix representation, i.e., it allows a unified representation for seemingly diverse types of knowledge, including linear equations, joint and conditional distributions, and ignorance. The unification is significant not only for knowledge representation in artificial intelligence but also for statistical analysis and engineering computation. For example, the representation treats the typical logical and probabilistic components in statistics — observations, distributions, improper priors (for Bayesian statistics), and linear equation models — not as separate concepts, but as manifestations of a single concept. It allows one to see the inner connections between these concepts or manifestations and to interplay them for computational purposes.  Knowledge operations  There are two basic operations for making inferences in expert systems using linear belief functions: combination and marginalization. Combination corresponds to the integration of knowledge whereas marginalization corresponds to the coarsening of knowledge. Making an inference involves combining relevant knowledge into a full body of knowledge and then projecting the full body of knowledge to a partial domain, in which an inference question is to be answered.  Marginalization  Marginalization projects a linear belief function into one with fewer variables. Expressed as a moment matrix, it is simply the restriction of a nonswept moment matrix to a submatrix corresponding to the remaining variables. For example, for the joint distribution M(X, Y), its marginal to Y is: : M^{\\\\downarrow Y} (X,Y) = \\\\left[ {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\mu_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma_{22} \\\\end{array}} \\\\right] When removing a variable, it is important that the variable has not been swept on in the corresponding moment matrix, i.e., it does not have an arrow sign above the variable. For example, projecting the matrix M(\\\\vec X,Y) to Y produces: : M^{ \\\\downarrow Y} (\\\\vec X,Y) = \\\\left[ {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} \\\\mu _2 - \\\\mu _1 (\\\\Sigma _{11} )^{-1} \\\\Sigma _{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Sigma_{22} - \\\\Sigma_{21} (\\\\Sigma _{11})^{-1} \\\\Sigma_{12} \\\\end{array}} \\\\right] which is not the same linear belief function of Y. However, it is easy to see that removing any or all variables in Y from the partially swept matrix will still produce the correct result — a matrix representing the same function for the remaining variables. To remove a variable that has been already swept on, we have to reverse the sweeping using partial or full reverse sweepings. Assume M(\\\\vec X) is a fully swept moment matrix, : M(\\\\vec X) = \\\\left( {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\\\bar \\\\mu } \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\bar \\\\Sigma } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right) Then a full reverse sweeping of M(\\\\vec X) will recover the moment matrix M(X) as follows: : M(X) = \\\\left( {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} { - \\\\bar \\\\mu \\\\bar \\\\Sigma ^{ - 1} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { - \\\\bar \\\\Sigma ^{ - 1} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right) If a moment matrix is in a partially swept form, say : M(\\\\vec X,Y) = \\\\left[ {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\\\bar \\\\mu _1 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{11} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{21} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} & {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\\\bar \\\\mu _2 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{12} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{22} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right] its partially reverse sweeping on X is defined as follows: : M(X,Y) = \\\\left[ {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} { - \\\\bar \\\\mu _1 (\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{11} )^{ - 1} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { - (\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{11} )^{ - 1} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { - \\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{21} (\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{11} )^{ - 1} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} & {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\\\bar \\\\mu _2 - \\\\bar \\\\mu _1 (\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{11} )^{ - 1} \\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{12} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { - (\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{11} )^{ - 1} \\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{12} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{22} - \\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{21} (\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{11} )^{ - 1} \\\\bar \\\\Sigma _{12} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right] Reverse sweepings are similar to those of forward ones, except for a sign difference for some multiplications. However, forward and reverse sweepings are opposite operations. It can be easily shown that applying the fully reverse sweeping to M(\\\\vec X) will recover the initial moment matrix M(X). It can also be proved that applying a partial reverse sweeping on X to the matrix M(\\\\vec X,Y) will recover the moment matrix M(X,Y). As a matter of fact, LiuL. Liu, \\"Local Computation of Gaussian Belief Functions,\\" International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, vol. 22, pp. 217–248, 1999 proves that a moment matrix will be recovered through a reverse sweeping after a forward sweeping on the same set of variables. It can be also recovered through a forward sweeping after a reverse sweeping. Intuitively, a partial forward sweeping factorizes a joint into a marginal and a conditional, whereas a partial reverse sweeping multiplies them into a joint.  Combination  According to Dempster’s rule, the combination of belief functions may be expressed as the intersection of focal elements and the multiplication of probability density functions. Liping Liu applies the rule to linear belief functions in particular and obtains a formula of combination in terms of density functions. Later he proves a claim by Arthur P. Dempster and reexpresses the formula as the sum of two fully swept matrices. Mathematically, assume M_1 (\\\\vec X) = \\\\left( {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\\\bar \\\\mu _1 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _1 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right) and M_2 (\\\\vec X) = \\\\left( {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\\\bar \\\\mu _2 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _2 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right) are two LBFs for the same vector of variables X. Then their combination is a fully swept matrix: : M(\\\\vec X) = \\\\left( {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\\\bar \\\\mu _1 + \\\\bar \\\\mu _2 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\bar \\\\Sigma _1 + \\\\bar \\\\Sigma _2 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right) This above equation is often used for multiplying two normal distributions. Here we use it to define the combination of two linear belief functions, which include normal distributions as a special case. Also, note that a vacuous linear belief function (0 swept matrix) is the neutral element for combination. When applying the equation, we need to consider two special cases. First, if two matrices to be combined have different dimensions, then one or both matrices must be vacuously extended, i.e., assuming ignorance on the variables that are no present in each matrix. For example, if M1(X,Y) and M2(X,Z) are to be combined, we will first extend them into M_1 (X,Y,\\\\vec Z) and M_2 (X,\\\\vec Y,Z) respectively such that M_1 (X,Y,\\\\vec Z) is ignorant about Z and M_2 (X,\\\\vec Y,Z) is ignorant about Y. The vacuous extension was initially proposed by Kong A. Kong, \\"Multivariate belief functions and graphical models,\\" in Department of Statistics. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, 1986 for discrete belief functions. Second, if a variable has zero variance, it will not permit a sweeping operation. In this case, we can pretend the variance to be an extremely small number, say ε, and perform the desired sweeping and combination. We can then apply a reverse sweeping to the combined matrix on the same variable and let ε approaches 0. Since zero variance means complete certainty about a variable, this ε-procedure will vanish ε terms in the final result. In general, to combine two linear belief functions, their moment matrices must be fully swept. However, one may combine a fully swept matrix with a partially swept one directly if the variables of the former matrix have been all swept on in the later. We can use the linear regression model — Y = XA + b + E — to illustrate the property. As we mentioned, the regression model may be considered as the combination of two pieces of knowledge: one is specified by the linear equation involving three variables X, Y, and E, and the other is a simple normal distribution of E, i.e., E ~ N(0, Σ). Let M_1 (\\\\vec X,\\\\vec {\\\\rm E},Y) = \\\\left[ {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} 0 & 0 & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & A \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & I \\\\\\\\\\\\ {A^T } & I & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right] and M_2 (\\\\vec {\\\\rm E}) = \\\\left[ {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ { - \\\\Sigma ^{ - 1} } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right] be their moment matrices respectively. Then the two matrices can be combined directly without sweeping M_1 (\\\\vec X,\\\\vec {\\\\rm E},Y) on Y first. The result of the combination is a partially swept matrix as follows: : M(\\\\vec X,\\\\vec {\\\\rm E},Y) = \\\\left[ {\\\\begin{array}{*{20}c} 0 & 0 & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & A \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & { - \\\\Sigma ^{ - 1} } & I \\\\\\\\\\\\ {A^T } & I & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}} \\\\right] If we apply a reverse sweeping on E and then remove E from the matrix, we will obtain the same representation of the regression model.  Applications  We may use an audit problem to illustrate the three types of variables as follows. Suppose we want to audit the ending balance of accounts receivable (E). As we saw earlier, E is equal to the beginning balance (B) plus the sales (S) for the period minus the cash receipts (C) on the sales plus a residual (R) that represents insignificant sales returns and cash discounts. Thus, we can represent the logical relation as a linear equation: : E=B+S-C+R Furthermore, if the auditor believes E and B are 100 thousand dollars on the average with a standard deviation 5 and the covariance 15, we can represent the belief as a multivariate normal distribution. If historical data indicate that the residual R is zero on the average with a standard deviation of 0.5 thousand dollars, we can summarize the historical data by normal distribution R ~ N(0, 0.52). If there is a direct observation on cash receipts, we can represent the evidence as an equation say, C = 50 (thousand dollars). If the auditor knows nothing about the beginning balance of accounts receivable, we can represent his or her ignorance by a vacuous LBF. Finally, if historical data suggests that, given cash receipts C, the sales S is on the average 8C + 4 and has a standard deviation 4 thousand dollars, we can represent the knowledge as a linear regression model S ~ N(4 + 8C, 16).

Early years and education His father, John Zdzieblan- Urbaniec was a diplomat. He took the first steps in art under the supervision of the sculptor Alfons Karny. His teacher of drawing was Zygmunt Kaminski - poster designer. The Urbaniec's father died in Lebanon in 1949 and his mother died in 1943 in Auschwitz. Maciej Urbaniec studied art in Wroclaw and Warsaw and became a poster designer and commercial artist. He was working as a Professor at Academy of Fine Arts (ASP) in Warsaw since 1975 until his death. By teaching he had a significant impact on the artists of the Third Generation (1960s-1980s) of Polish School of Posters. The postwar fate of Matthew Urbaniec is almost like a journey around the country: he stayed briefly in Silesia, then returned to Warsaw and there he graduated from high school in 1951. In 1952 he married Mary Kotarbinska. Matthew studied at the WSSP in Wroclaw, and at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. He received a diploma with honors in 1958. At this time he debuted: poster, \\"Not Me\\" from 1957 has been printed by the WAG and also published in the Swiss GRAPHIS magazine. In the seventies he worked for an American publisher Jack Rennert and began his collaboration with Warsaw theaters: (The Grand Theatre, National Theatre, The Ateneum Theatre). The theatre became the main theme of his works. The characteristics of Maciej Urbaniec's art Urbaniec is a graphical time traveler. On his posters we recognize postcards from various eras. His art ia a mixture of different styles. Urbaniec was inspired by some historical facts, he refers to the interwar avant-garde: geometry combined with photography, colors are reduced to black, white and red. It is undoubtedly worth seeing how naturally Urbaniec combines senses in his works: ‘Nie hałasuj niepotrzebnie’, ‘Chroń ręce’. However, most reproduced and most acclaimed work is undoubtedly his \\"ABC abc\\" - a poster diagram of 1972. Simple in form and yet brilliant, with a high emotional content. collision - Photographic image of three heavy bombs, marked the first letters of the alphabet - with inserted under them by the same lowercase letters, drawn in colored chalk, awkwardly, like a child's hand - it is very eloquent and touching. While the asceticism of expression reinforced by the strength of its impact. His style conveys simple and powerful messages; often with the use of ingenious and humorous devices as well as painterly gestures with exceptionally elaborate metaphors. His Mona Lisa CYRK poster, which is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York has been honored with a postage stamp issued in 2002 by the Polish post office.

The Bulletin was reinstated in 1915, edited by both faculty members and students. It changed its name to Iowa Law Review in 1925, indicating that the journal's focus would be on Iowa legal issues, but \\"occasionally an article of general scope [would] appear.\\" Indeed, it has published on topics of national and international law. Projects In 1933, the Iowa Law Review became the first law review to publish a symposium (on administrative law), which was entitled \\"Administrative Law Based upon Legal Writings 1931-1933.\\" Since then, the journal has continued to hold symposia on issues of national importance. In 1968, the Iowa Law Review began the \\"Contemporary Studies Project\\". These projects were large-scale, usually empirically-based, and often lasted for more than one year.

The band consists of Mark Drake (vocals), Joe Southin (keys/vocals), David Warner (guitars/vocals), Carl Bishop (guitar), Mattie Bennett (bass) and Barry Crook (drums). Following a prolonged period of writing and rehearsing, Arrows began to gig extensively across the UK in March 2008, firmly closing the door on their previous entity's past, with a new, strongly contrasting sound. The followed this heavy touring by stepping back into the studios in July 2008, recording two songs, \\"A New Way To Get By\\" and \\"Song\\" at Lost Boys Recording Studio in Bedfordshire, which they co-produced with Nick Mailing. The demo became an instant success, securing them airplay on local and national radio, and bringing them to the attention of a much wider audience. This summer the band played the BBC Introducing and Love Music Hate Racism festivals. History Delphian Complex and resurrection Arrows first incarnation, Delphian Complex, was formed in the winter of 2004, the result of four recent graduates who had been friends since school (Mark Drake, Carl Bishop, Joe Southin and David Warner) returning home and disillusioned by their surroundings and prospects. Following the recruitment of friend Chris Eagling on bass and a mutual friend Matt Bennett on drums, and a series of intense song writing and rehearsal sessions, the band released their debut demo in November of the same year. The demo, \\"Bite The Hand\\" was recorded at Bark Studios in Walthamstow with producer Brian O’Shaughnessy, who had previously worked with My Bloody Valentine, Denim and Delphian Complex favourites, Primal Scream. Tracks included on the debut recording were \\"Bite The Hand\\", \\"Narcolepsy Ballad\\" and \\"All That Remains\\". The demo got them their first gigs, at The Angel in Bedford and Bull and Gate in Kentish Town London, where they played to large, appreciative crowds. The demo was sent to that year's BBC Unsigned competition and won them praise from the judges but the first prize eluded them. Following interest from several record labels, Delphian Complex gigged around the UK for the next year before recording their next demo, \\"The Delphian Complex\\" EP, featuring the tracks \\"Opus\\", \\"To Better Days\\", and \\"Lay\\". The demo's long intros and experimental atmosphere meant it was shunned by many radio stations, but won them favour with many other bands and music industry officials; which led to an XFM interview with Clint Boon support slots with Electric 6 for a small tour, and more prestigiously New Order and Primal Scream at the request of the bands themselves. During the next year, the band continued to gig heavily and support big names such as Babyshambles, The Longcut, Alabama 3 and The Fratellis and during this time signed a single deal with cult indie label XXIV Records, whose roster also included Gemma Ray Ritual, Phoenix Drive and Budgie Reef. They went back into the studio to record the three track single \\"Jack-Knife\\" which featured the B-Side \\"Higher State\\" and a remix of Jack-Knife by producer and DJ Andrew Weatherall. Sold only through London and Manchester independents such as Rough Trade and online stores, the single was deemed a success, nearly selling out its limited 1000 copy release in 3 weeks, but creative differences between the band and the label began to put a strain on the relationship, and at the end of 2006 the band dropped the label. Following this, Matt left the band to go back to university to study music business in reaction to the events that had occurred with XXIV, and a replacement was found in the form of Steve Dowel, a mutual friend and previously of the band The Faculty. The band continued to gig in low key venues and in the Summer of 2007 recorded the experimental dance/rock EP \\"CREATE.EVADE.INSPIRE.ESCAPE\\", which also became their and later Arrows’ motto. 2008 to present During this small run of gigs through 2007 and early 2008, Delphian Complex began to draw musical influence from a much wider range of sources in their songwriting, changing their sound dramatically. Influenced by the artists that first inspired them to make music, the heavy electronic presence that once defined their sound became noticeably absent in their new songs, a move which split audiences. Eventually the band decided that the sound they were making was such a radical departure from everything Delphian Complex had done before, it would be wiser to start from scratch and begin again with the new sound being matched with a new name. Their inspiration for this new moniker arrived when playing their last gig as Delphian Complex in Manchester in 2008 at the Kro2 venue. As the band waited to begin their set, the words to William Blake's \\"Jerusalem\\" were adorned on a wall in front of them. The words \\"Bring me my arrows of desire\\" rang a chord with the band, and thus the name Arrows was born. The band promptly retreated into obscurity to begin months of writing, rehearsing and recording, which in turn inspired them to return to the studio to record two of the stand out songs that had come from the session, \\"A New Way To Get By\\" and \\"Song\\". The recording was undertaken in Lost Boys Studios, an old converted barn in Bedfordshire with Nick Mailing who had also recorded the popular \\"Delphian Complex EP\\" with the band in their former incarnation. The recording and following writing sessions and \\"test\\" gigs, where the band sought to see what reaction audiences gave their new sound were reputedly incredibly intense, such as when they supported Elks at Luton George II in November 2008. At the end of the year Chris Eagling and Steve Dowel left the band amicably for personal reasons. Eventually, Matt Bennett returned to the fold, this time on bass, and the band recruited Barry Crook form the band The Portion to take over drum duties. An intense gigging schedule was immediately put in place, which led to live sessions on BBC Introducing, air play with local radio and appearances at the BBC Introducing and Love Music Hate Racism festivals.

History  Captain Johnson Vivian Sr. was born in Cornwall, England. He worked in the mining industry in his home country, then emigrated to Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula to work as a mining captain,Copper Country Architects: Charlton & Gilbert Dany Peavey, Stevan Sliger, John Krystof, and Travis Dvorak, retrieved 8/26/09 first in Eagle Harbor, then moving to mines located in Copper Harbor, Phoenix, Hancock, and Ontonogan, among other places.Alvah L. Sawyer, History of Northern Peninsula of Michigan, and Its People, 1911, Lewis Publishing, Chicago, p. 1328-1330 Captain Vivian had four sons, one of whom was Johnson Vivian Jr. The younger Vivian was born in the United States and attended high school in the area. Captain Vivian had a number of commercial interests, and in 1886, the younger Vivian, with assistance from his father, established J. Vivian Jr. and Company, a mercantile business, in Osceola. In 1894 the father and son established a branch of their mercantile business in Laurium, constructing a building on Hecla Street. At the time, the firm was taking a risk as the store's location was viewed as remote.Laurium Historic District NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES REGISTRATION FORM, Jane C. Busch, Sept 22, 2004 However, the store was an immediate success, and by 1895 employed 50 people. Other merchants followed Vivian's example, and the block on Hecla soon became the commercial center of the area. In 1903, the store was the largest in the area. Johnson Vivian Jr. took over his father's business when the latter died in 1909. He continued as a leading citizen in Laurium. He was the president of the State Savings Bank and the Palestra (the Laurium ice rink), a director of the Laurium Park Association, and on the Board of Directors of the Calumet Public Hospital. The J. Vivian Jr. and Company was in business until 1936.  Description  J. Vivian Jr. & Co. Building, c. 1900 The J. Vivian Jr. and Company building was constructed in multiple stages. The original building, dating from 1894, was two stories tall and three bays wide, measuring 58 feet across. This soon proved too small, and in 1898 a third story was added to the structure. In 1906, a fourth bay was added on the north side, bringing the total building width to 90 feet. A one-story addition to the rear was completed in 1974. The building is constructed in an Italian Renaissance Revival design from brick with sandstone trim. The structure has four bays, each with a two-story round- arched window. A cornice features alternating marble medallions and attic windows. Brick and sandstone piers divide the plate glass windows on the first floor.

In 1429, after the death of his uncle Carlo Malatesta, he became lord of Cesena, at the age of 11, together with his brothers Galeotto Roberto (the only one of age, although he died in 1432) and Sigismondo Pandolfo. Two years later, he suppressed several riots in the city spurred by the Malatesta of Pesaro; the people turned against the leader, and hailed him and his brother Sigismondo Pandolfo as lords. Also, in 1431, he quelled a revolt in Fano. In 1433, the year since which he reigned alone in Cesena, he was created Imperial Knight by the Emperor Sigismund. Therefore, he abandoned the name Domenico to be called Malatesta Novello. At the time his lands included Cesena, Bertinoro, Meldola, Sarsina, Roncofreddo and the Piviero di Sestino. He also received Cervia by Sigismondo Pandolfo, building there important fortifications. In 1434, when he was 16, he married Violante da Montefeltro, then four. The two lived separated, joining only on her twelfth birthday (1442). Aside from his military deeds, Malatesta Novello is celebrated for his large building programs in Cesena, such as the Convent di S. Maria (1438), the strengthening of the Rocca Malatestiana and enlargement of the city walls (1441); in 1452 he founded the Biblioteca Malatestiana, the first public library in Europe. He also built public works such as bridges, tunnels and dams. He died in Cesena in 1465. His death marked the end of the Malatesta seigniory in Cesena.

Main characters   Sonny Munroe  Allison \\"Sonny\\" Munroe (Demi Lovato). The newest member of comedy sketch TV show So Random!, She is from Appleton, Wisconsin. \\"Sonny\\" is Allison's nickname. Sonny used to dislike her nickname when she was little, but now she thinks it suits her (as she says when she met Chad in \\"West Coast Story\\"). She also plays a guitar, the piano, and sings. She's usually eccentric, goofy and a bit childish, often admitting to do things that may seem strange to others. Friendly, sweet, and caring towards those around her, she is known as the nice girl of the group and does her best to help other people with their problems and achieve her dreams, but earns mixed results often due to some situations involving her meddling problems. Whenever Sonny lies, her voice becomes high pitch. Sonny had a love/hate relationship with Chad Dylan Cooper, but eventually falls in love with him. In season 2, Chad asks her out, beginning their relationship. But she breaks up with Chad towards the end of season 2. It is shown in the last episode, \\"New Girl\\", that she still has feelings for Chad. In the spin-off to Sonny with a Chance, So Random!, Demi Lovato leaves the cast for health problems. It is not explained why Sonny seems to be missing from the show.  Tawni Hart  Tawni Hart (Tiffany Thornton). Tawni is obsessed with fashion, pink, and herself. She becomes upset if she does not get her way. In the beginning, Tawni was openly jealous of Sonny to the point that she committed mail fraud by stealing all of Sonny's fan mail, but later grew more accepting of her as a member of the show. Tawni is probably the only person who initially knew about Sonny and Chad's mutual feelings for each other, but never mentioned it to anybody. Tawni has a secret - she likes Sonny. She is jealous of Sonny's fans. Despite their rocky beginnings, she has since begun to care about Sonny as a friend and eventually as a best friend. She is often seen giving her advice and is shown to be nicer than before, such as the instance of driving Sonny all the way back to Wisconsin in \\"Sonny with a Secret\\", but she tells Sonny to do projects for her, shown in \\"Falling for the Falls (Part 1)\\". Also, she still doesn't like it that Sonny's boyfriend is Chad, as do all of the So Random! cast. She has been on So Random! for five years. She says that she was homeschooled, and that her mother Tammy (also her manager) was very strict.  Chad Dylan Cooper  Chad Dylan Cooper (Sterling Knight). He is the teen heart-throb of Tween Weekly and Mackenzie Falls. He is the arch-rival of Sonny and the cast of So Random! early in the series, as well as Sonny's love/hate interest as developed later. He seems to have liked Sonny since the beginning of the show, and in one episode tries to force her to kiss him, before they were dating. He is a bratty egomaniac and thinks that he the \\"greatest actor of his generation\\", and can be seen as effeminate in his obsession with his own appearance. Despite this selfish and childish behavior, he has moments where he shows he is kind and deep, especially when he's around Sonny. He became more friendly towards the cast of So Random! because of his feelings towards Sonny, and later, he eventually falls in love with her and starts dating her. However, in \\"My Two Chads\\", it is revealed that Chad has a stunt double named Chaz, who he has to go on dates with Sonny that he deems dangerous. When Sonny finds out about this, she dumps him, but they get back together at the end. In \\"Sonny with a Choice\\", when he discovers that So Random! won the Tween Choice Awards, his ego and jealousy get the better of him, leading him to recount the votes so that Mackenzie Falls wins instead, which he later tells Sonny. Sonny is disgusted at his inability to put others before himself, causing them to break up for good. In \\"New Girl\\", it is revealed that he still has feelings for Sonny. Sonny writes a song about him and hums it at the end, hinting that she still has feelings for him as well. He later joins So Random! when Sonny leaves the show.  Nico Harris  Nico Harris (Brandon Mychal Smith). One of the primary cast members of So Random!, Nico is Grady's best friend and they always do pranks and wacky things together. He and Grady attempt many pranks but they often fail because (in Tawni's words) they are \\"full of loud music, bad choreography and things being thrown\\" as they often copy the movies. The two are shown to be a little immature. He always comes up with ideas that later turn crazy. Nico seems to think he's quite the womanizer, he hardly ever succeeds in getting dates. He also has a crush on Mackenzie Falls star Penelope, but she constantly turns him down, and not very nicely. He and Grady manage to make a body-spray that attracts girls but in the wrong way. He was on a one-man show called NICO. His dad is a lawyer. He also shares a birthday with Grady. At the very beginning of Sonny with a Chance, he had a slight crush on Sonny but he grows to only like her as a friend. Whenever he has a project, he tries to find a way to get Sonny to do it for him. Nico is absent for 2 episodes: \\"Sonny: So Far\\" (but appeared in the flashbacks) and \\"Sonny with a Grant\\".  Grady Mitchell  Grady Mitchell (Doug Brochu). A cast member of So Random!, Grady is best friends with Nico. They can be shown to be a little immature. He is also wacky and full of silliness and is always eager to eat. Together, he and Nico hatch plans such as making money by selling Tawni's trash on the Internet or getting girls by creating an extremely attractive cologne. He has also been shown to believe in the existence of fictional worlds such as Narnia and Pandora. On the Disney Channel site, it says that he is from Orlando, Florida. His father was in the military, and he has a brother, Grant, who constantly teases him for having no girlfriend. He also shares a birthday with Nico. Grady is shown to try to find a way to get Sonny to do his project homework, like Nico and Tawni. In the last episode of the series, he manages to impress Sonny's new friend, Mel. The finale ends with Mel admitting to herself she loves him. Grady is absent for 1 episode \\"Sonny: So Far\\" (but appeared in the flashbacks). He was present for all episodes in season 2.  Zora Lancaster  Zora Lancaster (Allisyn Ashley Arm). The youngest cast member of So Random!. She was 11 in season 1 and 12 in season 2. Zora has a genius IQ of 155 and is the smartest member of the group. She is known to be \\"the weird one\\" because Zora has a quirky personality and always seems to be up to something suspicious and weird. Sometimes, she is shown to be a little dangerous as seen in the title sequence to be driving a monster machine. She is also a prankster. She hates Dakota Condor and insists that she's \\"Evil\\". She also is comfortable in small spaces. Zora, Tawni, and Sonny all share one room but Zora prefers to hide up in the air vent and the sarcophagus in the prop house, eavesdropping on private conversations. She tends to wear extremely bright, unique clothes. She has a short temper and when provoked will often try to physically attack the other person to express her anger at the other person. In season two, she is shown to become more mature and a little less weird. Zora is absent for 20 episodes, and she appeared in 26 of 46 episodes.

He is currently active as an author and activist on climate change issues. In 2017 Lefebvre published his first book, All's Well - Where Thou Art Earth And Why, a work of political, moral and legal philosophy. Neteller Platform and Imprisonment Lefebvre first garnered public attention in 1999, when he was involved with Neteller (now known as Paysafe), an online money transfer facility. The firm's involvement in transactions serving the online gambling industry led to U.S. charges of money laundering, racketeering, running an unlicensed money transmitting business and promoting illegal gambling. He was arrested in January 2007 and pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to promote illegal Internet gambling transactions. He agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, and the court ordered his company to forfeit $140 million. Lefebvre and his founding partner forfeited $100 million personally between them. He ultimately served 45 days in Federal Prison in the Southern District of Manhattan. Music career In 2007, Lefebvre composed and recorded a double CD album entitled Psalngs with the help of the record producer Brian Ahern. This was John's first effort as a solo artist. Ahern gathered a skookum studio band for the album, which included Jim Keltner, Hutch Hutchinson, Greg Leisz, Patrick Warren, Dean Parks, Al Kooper, Matt Rollings and Mac McAnally. The players regrouped with Lefebvre and Ahern in the spring of 2010 to record Lefebvre's second solo effort, The Initial Album, released in 2010. News Analysis and Political Activism Lefebvre and James Hoggan are co-founders of the DeSmogBlog.com group of blogs, which focus on topics related to global warming. The site's self-described purpose is to expose \\"global warming misinformation campaigns.\\" Lefebvre is among the blog's most active commentators, in addition to substantial writing in other forums including social media. Philanthropy From July 2009 to July 2011 Lefebvre served as a director of the David Suzuki Foundation. At that time both Suzuki and Lefebvre resigned from the board of DSF to found the David Suzuki Institute (DSI), which is not a tax deductible charitable organization, and thus is more free to express political opinions. He is also a continuing supporter of the Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education, a Vancouver-based institution focused upon the teachings of Dalai Lama and \\"education of the heart.\\" References External links * www.Psalngs.com * www.johnlefebvre.com Category:Living people Category:1951 births Category:Canadian singer- songwriters Category:Canadian guitarists Category:Canadian businesspeople Category:Canadian non-fiction writers ","title":"John Lefebvre"},{"id":"24134497","text":"Walton Island is an uninhabited island in Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada.

The mill was also named Tadema's Molen after one of the millmen. In 1933, the mill was fitted with Dekkerised sails. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) In 1948/49 it was proposed that an electric motor would be installed to drive the mill. This proposal was dropped in 1950. The sails were renewed in 1959. In 1967 an electric motor was installed, but arranged so the mill could still work too. The mill was restored in 1970/71. Further restoration work was done by millwrights Bouwbedrijf Hiemstra of Tzummarum in the early 2000s, at a cost of €100,000. The official reopening by Mayor Koopmans of Bolward took place on 18 September 2002. Description Lonjé's Molen is what the Dutch describe as an \\"achtkante grondzeiler\\" . It is a smock mill winded by a winch. There is no stage, the sails reaching almost to the ground. The mill has a single-storey brick base and a three-storey smock. The smock and cap are thatched. The four Common sails have leading edges streamlined with the Dekker system. They have a span of and are carried in a cast-iron windshaft. This was cast by the Koninklijke Nederlandse Grof Smederij, Leiden, Noord Holland in 1897. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 47 cogs. This drives the wallower (28 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the crown wheel (35 cogs) drives the wooden Archimedes' screw via a gear wheel with 31 cogs.

She was a member of the House of Piast and became Duchess of Kujavia from her first marriage and Duchess of Pomerania from her second marriage.  Family  Euphrosyne's paternal grandparents were Mieszko I Tanglefoot and his wife Ludmilla, a disputed Bohemian princess from the Přemyslid dynasty. Mieszko was son of Władysław II the Exile, Duke of High Poland and his wife Agnes of Babenberg. Agnes was daughter of Leopold III, Margrave of Austria and his wife Agnes of Germany, who was a daughter of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor and his first wife Bertha of Savoy. Euphrosyne's maternal family are disputed. Some \\"Viola genere et natione Bulgara, Ducissa de Opole, moritur\\" believe her mother, Viola was a Bulgarian princess, daughter of either Kaloyan of Bulgaria or his successor Boril of Bulgaria. Boril was married to a Cuman women named Anna. The historian J. Horwat put forward another hypothesis, under which Viola could be an Hungarian princess, daughter of King Béla III (from his second marriage with Marguerite of FranceThis theory was debatable, because almost all the known sources stated that Queen Marguerite, after the premature and difficult childbirth of her only son from her first marriage in 1177, remained unable to bear any other children.), or his son and successor Emeric. Today, the opinion prevails that Viola's origins are considered unknown. Euphrosyne was the youngest of four children. She had two brothers and a sister: Mieszko II the Fat, Władysław Opolski and Wenzeslawa of Opole, who became a nun.  Marriages  Euphrosyne's first marriage was to her distant cousin Casimir I of Kuyavia. The couple married in 1257 when Euphrosyne was at most twenty-nine years of age. Casimir already had two sons: Ziemomysł of Kuyavia and Leszek II the Black from his first marriage to Constance of Silesia. Euphrosyne and Casimir had four children, three sons and one daughter: #Władysław I the Elbow-high (1261 – 2 March 1333), King of Poland (1320–1333) #Casimir (1261/62 – 10 June 1294), killed while in battle in Lithuania #Siemowit (1262/67–1309/14), Duke of Kuyavia-Brieg, married Anastasia of Galicia (daughter of Lev I of Galicia) #Euphemia (died 18 March 1308), married Yuri I of Galicia According to chronicles, Euphrosyne wished for her sons to inherit the lands of their father, but they would not inherit because of their two elder half-brothers. Euphrosyne wanted to poison her two stepsons so that her own sons could inherit Casimir's lands. This plot would explain a revolt of the two boys against their father, Casimir. On 14 December 1267 Casimir died, leaving Euphrosyne a widow with four young children, plus two stepsons. She acted as regent SILESIA, Medieval Lands for the boys. During her regency, there was a dispute with the Knights of the Teutonic Order and a land problem with Bolesław the Pious. Eventually her sons and stepsons came of age and were able to rule their lands themselves. Euphrosyne married for a second time to Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania in 1275. He had already been married to Judith of Wettin and had had two daughters: Euphemia and Catherine. It was unlikely the marriage was to produce children since Euphroyne was in her late forties at the time. After thirteen years of childless marriage, they divorced so Mestwin could remarry and possibly have more children. Euphroyne returned to Kujavia and lived out the rest of her days in Brześć Kujawski where she died on 4 November 1292 and was buried.

History  The first Holy Trinity Church in Cambridge was next to the old Roman road and was just a small thatched timber building.Holy Trinity Church Cambridge, A Brief History This church burnt down in 1174. In 1189, a new stone church was begun. The stonework of the west wall under the tower is all that remains from the church of this time. By around 1350, money was raised to widen the nave and add two aisles. In about 1348, a steeple was added to the tower. Around 1400, two transepts were constructed in the Perpendicular style. During the English Reformation (1550–1750), Holy Trinity Church developed further. In 1616, a gallery was erected along the north side of the nave for the increased size of the congregation. Charles Simeon (1759–1836), vicar of Holy Trinity Church. From 1782 to 1836, Holy Trinity Church was at the centre of spiritual life in Cambridge. The ministry of Charles Simeon (1759–1836) started when he was appointed vicar by the Bishop of Ely against the wishes of the churchwardens and congregation at the time who disliked his evangelicalism. In 1794, Simeon introduced a barrel organ with sixty hymn tunes into the church. Apart from the repair to the lower section of the steeple in 1824 and painting and varnishing inside the church, Simeon made no structural alterations until 1834. Then the small chancel with 14th century ribbed vaulting was demolished and replaced with the current much larger extension, constructed of brick and plaster. These changes were made without an architect. Simeon was also one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society in 1799. The church continued to flourish with its evangelistic reputation during Victorian times. In 1887, the chancel was finished in stone, the pews were replaced, choir stalls added and most of the galleries removed. In the same year, the Henry Martyn Memorial Hall was built next to the church as a centre for Christian undergraduates at the University of Cambridge. From 1873 to 1889, there were about 140 offers to the Church Missionary Society. In 1885, the Cambridge Seven went to China, inspiring other Christian missionaries.

Evidence of Weston's leadership has been discovered only in the early 21st century, and it changes interpretations of the discovery era. He also is believed to have been part of John Cabot's landmark 1497 expedition, the first confirmed European expedition to North America since the Vikings 500 years before.  Life and background  William Weston is believed to have been born in Bristol, where he became a fairly minor merchant, trading mostly with Lisbon.Margaret M. Condon and Evan T. jones, 'William Weston: early voyager to the New World', Historical Research (Nov. 2018, published online, 3 Oct 2018), 634. He undertook one of the earliest English trading voyages to Madeira, a Portuguese archipelago in the Atlantic.E.M. Carus-Wilson (ed.), The Overseas Trade of Bristol in the Later Middle Ages (Bristol Record Society Publications, Vol. VII, Bristol, 1937), p. 285; D.B. Quinn, England and the Discovery of America, 1481–1620 (1973), p. 57 This took place in 1480 and was likely intended as a way of gaining direct access to the sugar plantations of what was developing as an important Portuguese colony. In this period he also seems to have served as a purser or factor on the Trinity of Bristol, which was used for an expedition looking for the 'Isle of Brasil' in the Atlantic.Margaret M. Condon and Evan T. jones, 'William Weston: early voyager to the New World', Historical Research (Nov. 2018, published online, 3 Oct 2018), 635-6. In February 1488 Weston was acting as the 'attorney' to the prominent Bristol merchant, John Foster. At this time Weston managed Foster's ship, the Anthony of Bristol, a vessel of about 380 tons burden. The greatest vessel in the Bristol fleet, the Anthony sank at Kingroad (Avonmouth) at the very end of a voyage to Lisbon, with Weston on board. Bristol's merchants blamed the maritime disaster on the negligence of the master. While it is unclear whether Weston was blamed, he subsequently became embroiled in a legal dispute relating to the wreck.Margaret Condon and Evan T. Jones (eds.), 'William Weston v Thomas Smith: Chancery Petition, 1490',(PURE, 2012) By 1492 Weston married Agnes Foster, daughter of merchant John Foster.Evan. T. Jones (ed.), ‘John Esterfeld vs. William Weston of Bristol: Chancery petition transcript, c.1499’, The National Archives, C1/199/76 (University of Bristol, Bristol Repository of Scholarly Eprints (ROSE), 2009) Her father was known in Bristol as the founder of Foster's Almshouses. Weston and his wife lived at what is now 41 Corn Street.Evan T. Jones, (2009), 'Henry VII and the Bristol expeditions to North America: the Condon documents', Historical Research, 27 Aug 2009, p. 8, n. 29 It appears that Foster did not approve of his daughter's marriage to Weston, as Foster's 1492 will left nothing to his son-in-law and comparatively little to his daughter.Evan T. Jones (ed.), 'Will of John Foster, merchant of Bristol, 6 August 1492' (Bristol Repository of Scholarly Eprints (ROSE), 2008) The will included clauses that ensured that, if Agnes died before William, her inherited property would go to the almshouse rather than her husband. By the late 1490s the Westons were in trouble for failing to pay the 'quit rent' on the Corn Street property, which Foster had ordered should be paid to help fund the almshouse. The executor of Foster's estate had prosecuted Weston successfully, which was to result in William and Agnes' eviction. It was to avoid this fate that William Weston appealed to the King, asking for a suspension of the legal proceedings until after he had undertaken his expedition to the new found land.  Voyages of discovery  Suggested course of William Weston's voyage of c.1499, based on research by Alwyn Ruddock It is not certain that Weston accompanied Cabot on his expeditions, but it seems probable as his own expedition was probably related to Cabot's assigning patent rights to him for exploration in 1499. Moreover, in January 1498 Cabot and Weston received rewards from King Henry VII, following a royal audience. This suggests the two were working together by this time, with Weston probably being one of the 'great seamen' and Bristol 'companions' of the Venetian explorer, discussed in a diplomatic correspondence of December 1497.Margaret M. Condon and Evan T. jones, 'William Weston: early voyager to the New World', Historical Research (Nov. 2018, published online, 3 Oct 2018), 630. In a letter to the Duke of Milan, the Milanese ambassador noted that some of Cabot's Bristol companions on his recent voyages had accompanied the Venetian to Court and had testified to the truth of the explorer's claims about the lands [North America] he had discovered in the summer of 1497.J.A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (Hakluyt Society, 2nd series, cxx, 1962), pp. 209–11. While the exact year of Weston's independent voyage has yet to be determined, Jones and Condon suggest that it took place in 1499, a year after Cabot's final voyage. Dr Alwyn Ruddock had claimed that Weston's voyage went far up into the North West Atlantic, possibly reaching as far as the Hudson Strait. On her death in December 2005, however, Dr Ruddock left instructions for her research notes to be destroyed. Evan T. Jones (2010), Henry VII and the Bristol expeditions to North America: the Condon documents. Historical Research, 83: 444–454, pp. 1–4 Since the evidence on which she based this claim has not been located, scholars can not yet determine if she was correct about the extent of Weston's voyage. However, an article published in 2018 by Condon and Jones apparently confirms that the voyage took place, for in 1500 Weston received a reward of £30 from the king, 'pro expensis suis circa inuencionem noue terre' (for his expenses about the finding of the new land).Margaret M. Condon and Evan T. jones, 'William Weston: early voyager to the New World', Historical Research (Nov. 2018, published online, 3 Oct 2018), p. 631. This document was one of the 'new finds' Ruddock had located before them.  Documentation  Henry VII headed 'By the king', and mentioning the 'new founde land' in the seventh line The main evidence for Weston's expedition is found in a letter from Henry VII to his Lord Chancellor, John Morton, which was discovered in the late 20th century and first published in 2009.Evan T. Jones (2009), 'Henry VII and the Bristol expeditions to North America: the Condon documents', Historical Research, 27 August 2009. The King's letter provides for a suspension of legal action against Weston because it was the King's intent that Weston would \\"shortly with goddes grace passe and saille for to serche and fynde if he can the new founde land\\". Historian Evan Jones and his fellow researcher, Margaret Condon, suggest that William Weston was probably operating under the Letters patent granted to the Venetian explorer John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto in Italian), which could be assigned to third parties.Evan T. Jones, \\"The Matthew of Bristol and the financiers of John Cabot's 1497 voyage to North America\\", English Historical Review (2006) In March 1496 Cabot had been awarded the monopoly right in England to undertake voyages across the Atlantic, in search of new lands or trade routes to China. One of the stipulations of the patent was that Cabot should sail only from Bristol. He reached North America in 1497 and is believed to have landed at Newfoundland or Cape Breton Island before his return. He was the first European to do so since the Vikings had gone to Vinland 500 years before. That Weston was a deputy or assign of Cabot, seems likely given the King's personal support for the Bristol explorer. That Cabot and Weston were working together is further supported Henry VII's having made a 40-shilling reward to Weston in January 1498.Evan T. Jones and Margaret M. Condon, Cabot and Bristol's Age of Discovery: The Bristol Discovery Voyages 1480-1508 (University of Bristol, Nov. 2016), p. 42. Historians take this to mean that Weston was on Cabot's 1497 voyage. At the time of the reward, Cabot was in London sorting out business related to a pension he had been granted by the King and making preparations for a new voyage.Margaret M. Condon and Evan T. Jones (eds.), 'Warrant for the payment of John Cabot’s pension, 22 February 1498', (Bristol Repository of Scholarly Eprints (ROSE), 2011) Details of the reward were first reported in the Canadian press in August 2009.\\"Fee for discovering Canada: 40 shillings\\", The Gazette Following the expedition the King paid Weston a £30 reward, as a way of recompensing him for expenses incurred in his voyage to the New World.Evan T. Jones and Margaret M. Condon, Cabot and Bristol's Age of Discovery: The Bristol Discovery Voyages 1480-1508 (University of Bristol, Nov. 2016), pp. 57-8. Reward payment to William Weston, naming him in the third line at left The reward was paid in 1500, based on examining a 500-year-old scroll which is a long made from the skins of more than 200 sheep, by using an ultraviolet light. The translation of the transaction of the reward, written by the auditor of the account, presumably following consultation with the King, reads: This document has been published as a result of a research programme dubbed The Cabot Project at the University of Bristol, to find more information about the Bristol discovery voyages of this period.'The Cabot Project' This project, with participation of several international scholars, has also been working with researchers in Newfoundland on archeological excavations in Carbonear, identified as a potential site for a 15th-century church that may have been started by an Augustine friar, Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis, accompanying Cabot's 1498 expedition. He is believed to have stayed in Newfoundland to start the mission.  Sources  * Margaret M.

Born in Bavaria, Horowitz was a student of Moses Sofer of Pressburg before moving to Vienna in 1828 to serve as the community's supervisor of Kosher meat. There, he collaborated with Reform Jewish rabbis of his day, such as Isaak Noah Mannheimer and Adolph Jellinek regarding synagogue protocol in the central synagogues of Vienna. In 1829, he drafted the bylaws of the central Stadttempel. Although he himself was an Orthodox Jew, he continued to pray occasionally in the Reform temple. Horwitz wrote a book of halakhic responsa called \\"Yad Eleazar.\\" His responsum regarding metzitzah b'peh was strongly influenced by the Hatam Sofer's rulings, according to Meir Hershkovitz in his 1972 article on Horwitz. In 1863, Horowitz, along with Isaac Noah Mannheimer, defended Heinrich Graetz, in Viennese court when Graetz was accused of heresy for an article published by Leopold Kompert in a local journal. Graetz had written that the chapters in Isaiah referring to the Messiah were meant to be interpreted non-literally, and that they referred to a national Messiah instead of a personal one. Isaac Hirsch Weiss published a pamphlet entitled Neẓaḥ Yisrael in support of the testimony. On the other hand rabbis such Azriel Hildesheimer, criticized Horowitz for defending Graetz.

Tools such as pens and pencils mark the drawing medium. Other tools such as straight edges, assist the operator in drawing straight lines. Various scales and the protractor are used to measure the lengths of lines and angles, allowing accurate scale drawing to be carried out! The compass is used to draw arcs and circles. A drawing board was used to hold the drawing media in place; later boards included drafting machines that sped the layout of straight lines and angles. Tools such as templates and lettering guides assisted in the drawing of repetitive elements such as circles, ellipses, schematic symbols and text. Other auxiliary tools were used for special drawing purposes or for functions related to the preparation and revision of drawings. The tools used for manual technical drawing have been displaced by the advent of computer- aided drawing, draughting and design (CADD). CSS Texas, 1865 Hand drawing for the facade of Ennis House, 1969  History  The ancient Egyptians are known to have used wooden corner rulers. Ancient Nuragic people in Sardinia used compasses made of bronze, like the one displayed in showcase 25 in the Nuragic department of the National Archeological Museum G. A. Sanna in Sassari. In ancient Greece, evidence has been found of the use of styli and metal chisels, scale rulers and triangle rulers. Excavations in Pompeii have found a bronze tool kit used by the Romans, which contained triangle rulers, compasses and a ruler to use with a pen. Although a variety of styli were developed in ancient times and were still being used in the 18th century, quills were generally used as the main drawing tool. Styli were also used in the form of ivory or ebony pencils. Protractors have been used to measure and draw angles and arcs of a circle accurately since about the 13th century, although mathematics and science demanded more detailed drawing instruments. The adjustable corner ruler was developed in the 17th century, but a feasible screw-tightened version not until the 1920s. Holding a ruling-pen, 1901 In the 17th century, a stylus that could draw a line with a specific width called a ruling pen was developed. The stylus had two curved metal pieces which were joined by a screw. Ink was trickled between the blades, from which it flowed evenly across the paper. The basic model was maintained for a long time, with minor modifications, until the 1930s when the German technical drawing pens came to the market. Artists (including Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer, Nicholas Bion and George Adams) generally made drawing tools for themselves. Industrial production of technical drawing instruments started in 1853, when Englishman William Stanley (1829–1909) founded a technical manufacturing company in London. Even then, however, most tools were still made by hand. In the 1930s the equipment available expanded: drawing apparatus and Rapidograph- drawing pens appeared, improving the line quality and, especially, producing consistent line width. In addition to the Rapidograph stylus, a more traditional Grafos-type stylus was used for a long time, where different line widths were achieved by changing the pen nib. For instance in Finland Grafos was commonly used as a primary drawing tool still in the early 1970s. Equipment changed radically during the 1990s, when computer-aided design almost completely ousted drawing by hand. Technical design has changed from drawing by hand to producing computer-aided design drawings, where drawings are no longer \\"drawn\\", but are built from a virtually-produced model. Drawings are not necessarily produced in hard copy at all, and if they are needed they are printed automatically by a computer program. Hand-drawn designs however are still widely used in the draft design stage.  Drawing tools   Pencil Traditional and typical styli used for technical drawing are pencils and technical pens. Video of a 1930s dotted-line drawing pen Pencils in use are usually mechanical pencils with a standard lead thickness. The usual line widths are 0.18 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm. Hardness varies usually from HB to 2H. Softer lead gives a better contrast, but harder lead gives a more accurate line. Bad contrast of the lead line in general is problematic when photocopying, but new scanning copy techniques have improved the final result. Paper or plastic surfaces require their own lead types. A parallel ruler- equipped drawing board. Drawing from an article published in a Norwegian technical journal Teknisk Ukeblad in 1893. The article dealt with a new kind of vertical drawing apparatus. The board was equipped with a lift mechanism, improving the ergonomy when doing large drawings. In most cases, the final drawings are drawn with ink, on either plastic or tracing paper. The pen is generally a Rapidograph-type technical pen, a marker pen that draws lines of consistent width (so-called steel marker pen). The pen has an ink container which contains a metal tube, inside which is a thin metal needle or wire, the soul. Ink is absorbed between the needle and the tube wall, preventing an excessive amount of ink from being released. The needle has a weight and by waving the pen back and forth the needle is released and the ink can run. Originally, the tank was filled from an ink bottle; newer pens use ink cartridges. Each line width has its own stylus. The line width is standardized: In Finland, the most commonly used set is 0.13 mm, 0.18 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.35 mm, 0.50 mm and 0.70 mm. Separate styli are used for tracing paper and plastic, because plastic requires a harder pen tip. To function well they require regular maintenance, the finest marker pens in particular.  Drafting board  The drawing board is an essential tool. Paper will be attached and kept straight and still, so that the drawing can be done with accuracy. Generally, different kind of assistance rulers are used in drawing. The drawing board is usually mounted to a floor pedestal in which the board turns to a different position, and also its height can be adjustable. Smaller drawing boards are produced for table-top use. In the 18th and 19th centuries,drawing paper was dampened and then its edges glued to the drawing board. After drying the paper would be flat and smooth. The completed drawing was then cut free. John Fry Heather Mathematical instruments: their construction, adjustment, testing, and use, comprising drawing, measuring, optical, surveying, and astronomical instruments (Crosby, Lockwood and co., 1884) pages 1-2 Paper could also be secured to the drawing board with drawing pins The American engineer Volumes 19-20, 1890 page 107 or even C-clamps. More recent practice is to use self-adhesive tape to secure paper to the board, including the sophisticated use of individualized adhesive dots from a dispensing roll. Some drawing boards are magnetized, allowing paper to be held down by long steel strips. Boards used for overlay drafting or animation may include registration pins or peg bars to ensure alignment of multiple layers of drawing media. T-square A T-square is a straightedge which uses the edge of the drawing board as a support. It is used with the drafting board to draw horizontal lines and to align other drawing instruments. Wooden, metal, or plastic triangles with 30° and 60° angles or with two 45° angles are used to speed drawing of lines at these commonly used angles. A continuously adjustable 0–90° protractor is also in use. An alternative to the T-square is the parallel bar which is permanently attached to the drawing board. It has a set of cables and pulleys to allow it to be positioned anywhere on the drawing surface while still remaining parallel to the bottom of the board. The drafting machine replaces the T-square and triangles.  Drafting machine  Right-handed parallelogram machine with a ballast. A drafting machine is a device which is mounted to the drawing board. It has rulers whose angles can be precisely adjusted with a controlling mechanism. There are two main types of apparatus: an arm-type parallelogram apparatus based on a hinged arm; and a track-type apparatus which moves on a rail mounted to the top of the drawing board. The accuracy of the arm type apparatus is better in the middle of the board, decreasing towards the edges, whereas a track machine has a constant accuracy over the whole board. The drawing head of a track-type drafting machine slides on bearings in a vertical rail, which in turn is moved along a horizontal, top-mounted rail. Both apparatus types have an adjustable drawing- head with rules attached to a protractor scale so that the angle of the rules may be adjusted.Alan Jefferis, David A. Madsen Architectural Drafting and Design (Cengage Learning, 2004) , pages 35-36 A drafting machine allows easy drawing of parallel lines over the paper. The adjustable angle between the rulers allows the lines to be drawn in varying accurate angles. Rulers may also be used as a support for separate special rulers and letter templates. The rules are replaceable and they can be for example scale-rules. Drawing apparatus has evolved from a drawing board mounted parallel ruler and a pantograph, which is a device used for copying objects in an adjustable ratio of sizes. French Curves French curves are made of wood, plastic or celluloid. Some set squares also have these curves cut in the middle. French curves are used for drawing curves which cannot be drawn with compasses. A faint freehand curve is first drawn through the known points; the longest possible curve that coincides exactly with the freehand curve is then found out from the French curves. Finally, a neat continuous curve is drawn with the aid of the French curves.N.D.Bhatt Engineering Drawing Plane and Solid Geometry (Charotar Publishing House, 2012), pages 12-13 Rulers Rulers used in technical drawing are usually made of polystyrene. It is used for drawing lines and connecting points. Rulers come in two types according to the design of their edge. A ruler with a straight edge can be used with lead pencils and felt pens, whereas when a technical pen is used the edge must be grooved to prevent the spread of the ink. An architect's scale A scale ruler is a scaled, three-edged ruler which has six different scales marked to its sides. A typical combination for building details is 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:25, 1:75 and 1:125. There are separate rulers for zoning work as well as for inch units. Today scale rulers are made of plastic, formerly they were made of hardwood. A pocket-sized version is also available, with scales printed on flexible plastic strips. View of a drafting table: the old way of producing architectural and engineering drawings. On the top of the board is a parallel ruler. Rulers and templates Various curved rulers, commonly known as French curves. This image comes from the Lexikon der gesamten Technik (dictionary of technology) from 1904 by Otto Lueger Compass Compasses are used for drawing circles or arc segments of circles. One form has two straight legs joined by a hinge; one leg has a sharp pivot point and the other has a holder for a technical pen or pencil. Another form, the beam compass, has the pivot point and pen holder joined by a trammel bar, useful when drawing very large radius arcs. Often a circle template is used instead of a compass when predefined circle sizes are required.  Templates  Templates contain pre- dimensioned holes in the right scale to accurately draw a symbol or sign. Letter templates are used for drawing text, including digits and letter characters. Diagrams are usually of a standard letter shape and size to conform to standards of encodings (e.g. DIN or ANSI). For example, in Finland the series used is 1.8 mm, 2.5 mm, 3.5 mm, 5.0 mm and 7.0 mm. Except for the very biggest ones, the templates are only suitable for technical pen drawing. For drawing circles and circle-arcs, circle templates which contain a set of suitably-sized holes are used. Templates are also available for other geometric shapes such as squares and for drawing ellipses, as well as many specialized varieties for other purposes.. There are also specific templates to provide user with the most common symbols in use in different branches of designing. For example, the architect templates can be used to draw different sized doors with their \\"opening arcs\\", building and equipment symbols and furniture. The templates also provide the symbols for thermal insulation. Two methods of drawing smooth curves in manual drafting are the use of French curves and flat splines (flexible curves). A French curve is a drawing aid with many different smoothly-varying radiused curves on it; the manual drafter can fit the French curve to some known reference points and draw a smooth curved line between them. A spline is a flexible ruler, usually rubber or plastic coated with a metal \\"backbone\\", which can be smoothly shaped to follow a desired curve and allows drawing a smooth line between initial reference points. Sometimes a spline is temporarily held in position with small weights.  Perspective machines  A perspective machine is an instrument designed to create perspective drawings.\\"Perspective Machine\\", The New and Complete American Encyclopedia, John Low, 1810, p. 441  Drawing materials   Drafting paper  Silk-paper -like translucent drafting paper that wrinkles when wetted. It is primarily suitable for pencils and felt tip pens. Pencil marks can be corrected to some extent with an eraser.  Thick draft paper  Sandwich paper -like, thin translucent sheet of paper. Manufactured in different strengths, the surface may be slightly polished. This paper also wrinkles upon wetting. Suitable for pencil and felt tipped pens, and with limitations for technical pens. An eraser can be used for pencil lines. Ink is difficult to erase without damage. Cloth Drafting linen was formerly used for technical drawings. It was durable and held up to handling, but it was difficult to use in modern whiteprints for reproduction, and shrinking was a concern.  Tracing paper  Polished sandwich paper -like, translucent thick paper, which comes in different strengths. Wrinkles upon wetting. Suitable for both graphite pencils and technical pens. An eraser or sharp scraper tool is used for corrections. Tracing tube  Translucent plastic film, which is usually of gray or a light khaki shade. Common types are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.10 mm thick. These films are also used in photocopying. The most commonly used materials are polyesters, and sometimes also PVC or polycarbonate; arguably, a proprietary eponym or genericized trademark for this is called Mylar. In drawing, plastic's specific advantages over translucent paper are higher mechanical strength and dimensional accuracy; plastic does not, unlike paper, shrink or stretch with changing air humidity. Plastic is also as a surface completely flat, while the surface of paper is relatively rough. Plastic is suitable for both pencils and drawing pens. However, the surface tends to wear the pen tips, which must be made of hard- metal alloy. Ordinary ink is not absorbed into the plastic at all, so the lines can easily be removed with an eraser. Photocopier marks can be removed by scraping. Inks Drawing inks can be divided into two groups: India ink and polymer inks. India ink is used on paper and drafting film plastics. The most commonly used India ink is a colloidal mixture of water and carbon black. Dry transfer Dry transfer decals can speed the production of repetitive drawing elements such as borders, title blocks, line types, shading, and symbols. They were frequently used in the production of schematic drawings, maps, and printed circuit board artwork, for example. Dry transfer lettering such as Letraset was used especially in lettering larger size document annotations, or when consistency of lettering was especially required. Reproduction Many copies of technical drawings may be required in the construction of a project. Reproductions must be accurate as to size and shape, but for many purposes need not be permanent. The blueprint process was first used for mechanical reproduction of drawings. Drawing offices may use diazo or whiteprint processes. Where the volume of drawings reproduced justifies the cost of the machine, a large format photocopier using xerography can reproduce drawings at lower cost than re-plotting them.

With night approaching fast, and Conan's horse killed in his battle against the savages, they take refuge in an ice cave, despite Ilga's seemingly irrational fears of something she merely calls \\"Yakhmar\\", failing to elaborate. After building a small fire, they make love and then rest. But in the middle of the night, as Conan sleeps on, two eerie orbs of cold flame appear at the cave's mouth, and a hypnotic piping lures Ilga out of the cave. When Conan awakes the next morning, he finds the girl missing. Following her trail outside, he encounters strange tracks and finally finds the remains of his horse and of Ilga, with the flesh sucked clean from their bones and the bones themselves surprisingly sheathed in ice. It is then that Conan recalls tribal tales of a creature named Remora, a vampiric worm creature whose body radiates cold and for which Ilga's \\"Yakhmar\\" must be another name. Feeling responsible for Ilga's death, he vows to avenge her by slaying the creature. After collecting the coals of his campfire in his helmet and sticking his battle axe into it, he follows the worm's trail to a glacier cave. As the creature attempts to mesmerize him with its piping, Conan fans the coals in his helmet into white heat and then sends firstly his heated axe, and secondly the helmet with the glowing coals, into the monster's maw. Conan then runs out of the caves, barely making his escape as the Remora's death throws cause the glacier to explode in an avalanche.

It was situated on the grounds of the former Mount Vernon Arsenal, a former United States Army munitions depot dating back to 1828. It closed permanently on October 31, 2012. History In 1900, the Alabama Legislature established a mental health facility on the former site of the Mount Vernon Arsenal to relieve overcrowding at Bryce Hospital in Tuscaloosa. The new facility was named the Mount Vernon Insane Hospital upon its opening in 1902 but was renamed Searcy Hospital in 1919, in honor of Dr. J. T. Searcy, the first superintendent. It was initially known as the Mount Vernon Insane Hospital, the hospital for colored insane or the Mount Vernon Hospital for the Colored Insane, since it served African-Americans exclusively until 1969, when it was desegregated following the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1906, 57 patients died due to an outbreak of a disease at the hospital. Initially the disease was a mystery, but it was later identified as one of the first major outbreaks of pellagra in the United States. The cause of pellagra was a mystery at the time, but one of the key observations was that it only struck the patients, not the staff. Joseph Goldberger later identified the cause of pellagra as a vitamin deficiency. It was caused by a poor diet at the Hospital. In 2010 Searcy Hospital had approximately 400 extended-care beds and a 124-bed intermediate care unit for patients with severe mental illness. Patients were housed in modern buildings. It also served the female forensic in-patient psychiatric center for the southern one-third of Alabama.James F. Hooper. Forensic Psychiatry Resources, University of Alabama Department of Psychiatry & Neurology/Alabama Department of Mental Health & Retardation. It was announced on February 15, 2012 that the Alabama Department of Mental Health would close Searcy and all but two of its other state-run mental health facilities in a move to transition all but its forensic and geriatric patients to community-based treatment. All admissions to Searcy were stopped in September, with the entire facility closing on October 31, 2012.

Died c. 650, Folkestone, England), also spelled Eanswythe or Eanswide, was an Anglo Saxon princess, who is said to have founded Folkestone Priory, one of the first Christian monastic communities for women in Britain. In 2020, osteoarchaeologists were given the opportunity to examine the remains of a skeleton long thought to be the remains of St. Eanswythe. They concluded that the bones belonged to a young female. Radiocarbon dating confirmed that the remains were from the mid-7th century, adding to the evidence that this may well be St. Eanswythe. The results of DNA and isotope analysis are pending. It can never be proven that the remains are St. Eanswythe but the evidence certainly indicates that this could be the case. If so, these are the earliest remains yet discovered of an English saint, and of a relative of the British monarch. Life Tradition has it that Eanswith founded the Benedictine Folkestone Priory, the first nunnery in England. She was supported in this by her father, Eadbald, who ruled as king of Kent from 616 to 640 CE. While the monastery was under construction, a pagan prince came to Kent seeking to marry Eanswythe. King Eadbald, whose sister St. Ethelburga had married the pagan King Edwin two or three years before, recalled that this wedding resulted in Edwin's conversion. Eanswythe, however, refused. This was the first women's monastery to be founded in England. St. Eanswythe lived there with her companions in the monastic life, and they may have been guided by some of the Roman monks who had come to England with St. Augustine in 597. Veneration She remained at the abbey until her death. The first monastic site became abandoned by the 10th century, and began to be eroded by the sea, a problem which also afflicted a new foundation of 1095. A site further inland was provided for a new foundation of Folkestone Priory by William de Abrincis in 1137, with a church dedicated to St Mary and St Eanswythe. Saint Eanswith's day falls on September 12. Traditionally, this is the date on which her remains were translated to the new church in 1138. The priory was closed at the Reformation, and the Church became Folkestone Parish Church. During restoration work at the church in 1885 human remains were discovered in a lead reliquary, embedded within the church wall, which were identified as a 12th- century vessel, and the bones of a young woman.The Friends of the Church of St. Mary and St. Eanswythe accessed 21 November 2014 This led to the conclusion that they could be the translated relics of Saint Eanswith, hidden away at the Reformation. A new expert analysis by historians and archaeologists concluded in March 2020 that the remains are almost certainly that of Eanswith. Iconography Eanswith is sometimes portrayed with a fish, along with her abbess's staff, crown and a book. This appears to be a recent attribute, from Folkestone's fishing port connection.A Clerk of Oxford: St Eanswythe of Folkestone accessed 22 November 2014 Documentary sources * Goscelin of Saint-Bertin mentions Eanswith in his 11th-century Vita Sancta Werburge. * She is named in the genealogies of some versions of the Kentish Royal Legend * John of Tynemouth (14th-century chronicler) has a substantive account in his Sanctilogium. As with all the Kentish Abbesses, Bede does not name Eanswith, so John must have had another source. New Research In 2017 a collaboration began between Kent historians and archaeologists from Canterbury Christ Church University and Folkestone Museum. Church legislation was required for the removal and examination of the human remains that had been uncovered in 1885. Osteologists tested teeth and bones and determined that they had come from one person, probably a woman, aged between 17 and 21, with no signs of malnutrition, all consistent with the history of Eanswith. They sent samples to scientists at Queen's University Belfast who radiocarbon dated them to the seventh century. The project, named Finding Eanswyth, received a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

According to accepted theory, he is probably the second lineage holder of the art. Other, less credible, theories consider Bodhidharma or Yue Fei as the originators of the style. Cao Ji Wu is said to have studied with Ji Jike for twelve years, gaining great martial prowess. In 1693, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty, Cao Ji Wu passed the highest level military examinations, gaining the highest score of all the candidates, and was personally appointed by the emperor as head superintendent of one of the counties in Shaanxi Province. He is said to have died of hypothermia at the age of 36, while directing troops in the relief effort after the flooding of the Han River in Shaanxi. While other versions mentioned of him returning later in life to continue teaching. His students, the Dai Long Bang and Dai Linbang brothers became the first generation of the Shanxi branch of Xingyi practitioners. Ji Jike had another outstanding disciple called Ma Xueli. In 1750, Dai Long Bang, in “The Six Harmonies Fists” stated that “Ji Jike, also known as Ji Long Feng, born at the end of the Ming Dynasty, discovered the text of Yue Fei, and taught Cao Ji Wu in Qiu Pu”. From this text, it has confirmed that Cao Ji Wu was the first student of Ji Jike.

They are signed with Defend Music. History Christopher Anderson and Thomas Hien became close friends during their years at the historic art school in Liverpool where John Lennon and Paul McCartney had met decades before. They played the Irish pubs and they sang for the Queen while they earned music degrees in film composition. In the late 1990s the two had created \\"Cook Au Van,\\" a traveling cooking show. The vehicle for the show was an old gas board utility van that they had converted into a five star restaurant. Made from found objects, the van boasted water fountains, changing works of art and a fully functional wet bar. Inside the van, they hosted dinner parties for the Lord Mayor and countless British celebrities.http://blogcritics.org/music/article/music-review-chris-and- thomas-land/ After doing the circus lifestyle with the traveling restaurant and cooking for the likes of Jarvis Cocker, Bill Drummond, politicians and fine artists, the two had decided to turn back to their true love of music.http://www.list.co.uk/article/18196-exposure-chris-and-thomas/ The duo's live debut was on November 18, 2003, at the Hotel Café in Los Angeles, California, opening for singer-songwriter Alexi Murdoch. Their unique live performance, which involved playing with one condenser microphone and gathering around it like some modern day Carter Family, quickly earned Chris and Thomas a name on the L.A. club circuit. That was just the beginning. Returning from a weekend in Joshua Tree, the two were greeted by multiple phone messages from excited friends who had heard their song \\"Take These Thoughts\\" on L.A.'s influential KCRW. It was news to the pair. Their EP, Vista Street Sessions, was passed on by a mutual friend to the station's tastemaker DJ and music director Nic Harcourt. Harcourt programmed the disc on his show, eventually included it on NPR's syndicated Sounds Eclectic, which introduced a national audience to Chris and Thomas. On air performances on KCRW and other radio stations followed with appearances at SXSW and other venues and festivals throughout the country. More radio stations have added Chris and Thomas to their playlists in the US, and Europe. \\"Take These Thoughts\\" won best song of the year in the Americana category at the Independent Music Awards 2006. The duo's full-length debut Land Of Sea was recorded with producer/engineer Mark Howard (Bob Dylan, U2, Tom Waits). Howard, who used to work with producer Daniel Lanois for over ten years, has a unique way of recording. He rented out an old sound stage in Hollywood, where he set up vintage recording equipment, Persian rugs, Victorian lamps and brought in musicians to accompany Chris and Thomas on their record. The record was first released in the UK in 2006 in conjunction with a 5-week tour and has gained critical acclaim and positive reviews (4 stars) and runner-up to album of the month in the music magazine MOJO. The US release occurred in late August 2007. Chris and Thomas and Oscar-nominated composer John Debney wrote the title song for Garry Marshall's 2007 film Georgia Rule starring Lindsay Lohan and Jane Fonda. Most recently, the duo scored music for the 2010 Sony Pictures hit movie Friendship! (2010) directed by Markus Goller and starring Matthias Schweighöfer With their records being played on NPR, Chris and Thomas have an audience everywhere they play: places like the Roxy in Los Angeles, and the Mercury Lounge in New York.

He was also known as Ji Longfeng (). According to accepted theory, he is widely considered to be the originator of the internal martial art of Xingyiquan. (Other, less credible, theories consider Bodhidharma or Yue Fei as the originators of this art.) Ji Jike created the martial art of Xinyiquan (Heart and Intention Boxing), which is the precursor of Xingyiquan (Form and Intention Boxing). He based the fundamentals of Xinyi on the spear techniques for which he was also famous. It was Li Luo Neng, a most famous descendant of Ji Jike, who modified Xinyi and called it Xingyi. During Ji Jike's lifetime, China was taken over by the Manchu Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), descendants of the Jurchen tribes of Yue Fei's time. Ji Jike began his classical studies when he was seven years old, and Wushu training at 13. After sitting for the imperial examination, he passed with honors, which earned him a position as a court official in Shanxi. However, he was disillusioned in this position because of the corruption he encountered, and was eventually forced out of office. After leaving, he traveled throughout China to refine his martial art. He eventually made his way to the Shaolin temple in Henan province to study Shaolin Wushu. At the temple, the monks were all amazed at his skill with the spear as well as his unarmed fighting skills. Welcomed by the monks, he stayed at the Temple, where he spent more than 10 years. It was here where he created Xinyi. Legend has it that during his time at the Temple, Ji once observed two cocks fighting, and was inspired to complete his development of the art of Xinyi. He taught his art to the monks, who passed it on as Xinyi Ba (). It was also during this time that he was suspected of being involved with the resistance opposing the Qing Dynasty. Later, after leaving the temple, he taught in the region to others from Henan. The most prominent of his students was Cao Jiwu and the other, Ma Xueli. When Ji returned home to Shanxi, he taught Xinyi to family members. He was nicknamed \\"Divine Spear\\" () for his exemplary skill, and was respected like a guardian deity, for he single-handedly defeated a band of bandits raiding his village when he was of old age.

The land between the artificially raised banks of the watercourses was liable to flooding and thus only suitable for grazing (cows on Coe Fen, sheep on Sheep's Green, hence the names).

The cell is modified by the lipid tail of the FSL construct incorporating into the bilipid membrane of the cell. All kodecytes retain their normal vitality and functionality while gaining the new function of the inserted FSL constructs. The combination of dispersibility in biocompatible media, spontaneous incorporation into cell membranes, and apparent low toxicity, makes FSL constructs suitable as research tools and for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The technology space filling models of selected FSL constructs. The two FSL constructs on the left are FSL- peptides based on partially carboxymethylated oligoglycine (CMG2) spacers with 1,2- dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) lipids. The 3rd and 4th constructs are FSL-biotin based on CMG but with DOPE and sterol (δ-oxycarbonylaminovaleric acid derivative of cholesterol) lipids, respectively. The final FSL construct is a typical trisaccharide, conjugated via an O(CH2)3NH spacer to an activated adipate derivative of the diacyl lipid DOPE. Kode FSL constructs consist of three components; a functional moiety (F), a spacer (S) and a lipid (L). Function groups on FSL constructs that can be used to create kodecytes include saccharides (including ABO blood group- related determinants, sialic acids, hyaluronin polysaccharides), fluorophores, biotin, and a range of peptides. Although kodecytes are created by modifying natural cells, they are different from natural cells. For example, FSL constructs, influenced by the composition of the lipid tail, are laterally mobile in the membrane and some FSL constructs may also cluster due to the characteristics of the functional group (F). As FSL constructs are anchored in the membrane via a lipid tail (L) it is believed they do not participate in signal transduction, but may be designed to act as agonists or antagonists of the initial binding event. FSL constructs will not actively pass through the plasma membrane but may enter the cell via membrane invagination and endocytosis. The \\"koding\\" of cells is stable (subject to the rate of turnover of the membrane components). FSL constructs will remain in the membrane of inactive cells (e.g. red blood cells) for the life of the cell provided it is stored in lipid free media. In the peripheral circulation FSL constructs are observed to be lost from red cell kodecytes at a rate of about 1% per hour. The initial \\"koding\\" dose and the minimum level required for detection determine how long the presence of \\"kodecytes\\" in the circulation can be monitored. For red blood \\"kodecytes\\" reliable monitoring of the presence of the \\"kodecytes\\" for up to 3 days post intravenous administration has been demonstrated in small mammals. The spacer (S) of a FSL construct has been selected so as to have negligible cross-reactivity with serum antibodies so kodecytes can be used with undiluted serum. By increasing the length of the FSL spacer from 1.9 to 7.2 nm it has been shown sensitivity can improve two- fold in red cell agglutination based kodecyte assays. However, increasing the size of the spacer further from 7.2 to 11.5 nm did not result in any further enhancement.plasma membrane modified with FSL constructs (by analogy to sunflower), creating a kodecyte membrane.  Technology Video  To view a simple video explaining how Kode Technology works, click the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIbjAl5KYpA  Methodology  thumb|400x400px|Preparation of kodecytes. Simply mix cells with an FSL solution (containing 1 or more FSLs) and incubate for 10–120 minutes at 37 °C (or at temperatures as low as 4 °C). The constructs will spontaneously incorporate into the membrane and no further steps are required. FSL constructs, when in solution (saline) and in contact, will spontaneously incorporate into cell membranes. The methodology involves simply preparing a solution of FSL construct(s) in the range of 1–1000 μg/mL, with the concentration used determining the amount of antigen present on the kodecyte. The ability to control antigen levels on the outside of a kodecyte has allowed for manufacture of quality control sensitivity systems and serologic teaching kits incorporating the entire range of serologic agglutination reactions. The actual concentration will depend on the construct and the quantity of construct required in the membrane. One part of FSL solution is added to one part of cells (up to 100% suspension) and they are incubated at a set temperature within the range of 4–37 °C (39–99 °F) depending on temperature compatibility of the cells being modified. The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of FSL insertion into the membrane. For red blood cells incubation for 2 hours at 37 °C achieves >95% FSL insertion with at least 50% insertion being achieved within 20 minutes. In general, for carbohydrate based FSLs insertion into red blood cells, incubation for 4 hours at room temperature or 20 hours at 4 °C are similar to one hour at 37 °C . The resultant kodecytes do not required to be washed, however this option should be considered if an excess of FSL construct is used in the koding process. Kodecytes can also be created in vivo by injection of constructs directly into the circulation. However this process will modify all cells in contact with the constructs and usually require significantly more construct than in vitro preparation, as FSL constructs will preferentially associate with free lipids. The in vivo creation of kodecytes is untargeted and FSL constructs will insert into all cells non-specifically, but may show a preference for some cell types. Diagnostic serological analyses including flow cytometry and scanning electron microscopy usually can't see a difference between \\"kodecytes\\" and unmodified cells. However, when compared with natural cells there does appear to be a difference between IgM and IgG antibody reactivities when the functional group (F) is a monomeric peptide antigen. IgM antibodies appear to react poorly with kodecytes made with FSL peptides. Furthermore, FSL constructs may have a restricted antigen/epitope and may not react with a monoclonal antibody unless the FSL construct and monoclonal antibody are complementary. Kodecytes can be studied using standard histological techniques. Kodecytes can be fixed after \\"koding\\" subject to the functional moiety (F) of the FSL construct being compatible with the fixative. However, freeze cut or formalin-fixed freeze cut tissues are required because the lipid based FSL constructs (and other glycolipids) will be leached from the \\"kodecytes\\" in paraffin imbedded samples during the deparaffination steps.  Nomenclature  Koded membranes are described by the construct and the concentration of FSL (in μg/mL) used to create them. For example, kodecytes created with a 100 μg/mL solution of FSL-A would be termed A100 kodecytes. If multiple FSL constructs were used then the definition is expanded accordingly, e.g. A100+B300 kodecytes are created with a solution containing 100 μg/mL solution of FSL-A and 300 μg/mL solution of FSL-B. The \\"+\\" symbol is used to separate the construct mixes, e.g. A100+B300. If FSL concentrations are constant then the μg/mL component of the terminology can be dropped, e.g. A kodecytes. Alternatively unrelated constructs such as FSL-A and FSL-biotin will create A+biotin kodecytes, etc. If different cells are used in the same study then inclusion of the cell type into the name is recommended, e.g. RBC A100 kodecytes vs WBC A100 kodecytes, or platelet A100 kodecytes, etc. Applications Kode Technology has been used for the in vitro modification of murine embryos, spermatozoa, zebra fish, epithelial/endometrial cells and red blood cells to create cellular quality controls systems, serologic kits (teaching), rare antigen expression, add infectious markers onto cells, modified cell adhesion/interaction/separation/immobilisation, and labelling. It has also been intravascularly infused for in vivo modification of blood cells and neutralisation of circulating antibodies and in in vivo imaging of circulating bone marrow kodecytes in zebrafish. Kode FSL constructs have also been applied to non-biological surfaces such as modified cellulose, paper, silica, polymers, natural fibers, glass and metals and has been shown to be ultra-fast in labelling these surfaces.

Ayres was a household assistant and nursemaid to the family of her brother-in-law and sister, Henry and Mary Ann Chandler. The Chandlers owned an oil and paint shop in Union Street, Southwark, then just south of London, and Ayres lived with the family above the shop. In 1885 fire broke out in the shop, and Ayres rescued three of her nieces from the burning building, before falling from a window and suffering fatal injury. Britain, in the wake of the Industrial Revolution, experienced a period of great social change in which the rapidly growing news media paid increasing attention to the activities of the poorer classes. The manner of Ayres's death caused great public interest, with large numbers of people attending her funeral and contributing to the funding of a memorial. Shortly after her death, she underwent what has been described as a \\"secular canonisation\\", being widely depicted in popular culture and, although very little was known about her life, widely cited as a role model. Various social and political movements promoted Ayres as an example of the values held by their particular movement. The circumstances of her death were distorted to give the impression that she was an employee willing to die for the sake of her employer's family, rather than for children to whom she was closely related. In 1902 her name was added to the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice and in 1936 a street near the scene of the fire was renamed Ayres Street in her honour. The case of Alice Ayres came to renewed public notice with the release of Patrick Marber's 1997 play Closer, and the 2004 film based on it. An important element of the plot revolves around a central character who fabricates her identity based on the description of Ayres on the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice, with some of the film's scenes shot around the memorial. Work with the Chandler family Alice Ayres was born into a large family in 1859, the seventh of ten children of a labourer, John Ayres. In December 1877, her sister Mary Ann (older than Alice by eleven years) married an oil and paint dealer, Henry Chandler. Chandler owned a shop at 194 Union Street in Southwark, about south of the present-day Tate Modern. In 1881 Ayres worked as a household assistant to Edward Woakes, a doctor specialising in ear and throat disorders. (subscription or UK public library membership required) By 1885 she had become a household assistant and nursemaid to the Chandlers, living with the family. After her death, Ayres was described by a local resident as \\"not one of your fast sort—gentle and quiet-spoke, and always busy about her work\\". Another neighbour told the press that \\"no merry making, no excursion, no family festivity could tempt her from her self-imposed duties. The children must be bathed and put to bed, the clothes must be mended, the rooms must be 'tidied up', the cloth must be laid, the supper carefully prepared, before Alice would dream of setting forth on her own pleasures\\". Union Street fire alt=A three-storey building engulfed in flame, surrounded by a crowd. Four men on the pavement hold a mattress in front of the building. A woman leans through the window on the top floor holding a small child in her arms. The Chandlers' shop at Union Street, as depicted in a contemporary newspaper illustration, occupied the corner premises of a building of three storeys. The family lived above the shop, with Henry and Mary Ann Chandler sleeping in one bedroom with their six-year-old son Henry, and Ayres sharing a room on the second floor with her nieces, five-year-old Edith, four-year-old Ellen and three-year-old Elizabeth. On the night of 1885, fire broke out in the oil and paint shop, trapping the family upstairs. Gunpowder and casks of oil were stored in the lower floors of the building, causing the flames to spread rapidly. Although the shop was near the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade and the emergency services were quickly on scene, by the time the fire engine arrived intense flames were coming from the lower windows, making it impossible for the fire brigade to position ladders. Meanwhile, Ayres, wearing only a nightdress, had tried to reach her sister but was unable to get to her through the smoke. The crowd that had gathered outside the building were shouting to Ayres to jump. Instead she returned to the room she shared with the three young girls and threw a mattress out of the window, carefully dropping Edith onto it. Despite further calls from below to jump and save herself, she left the window and returned carrying Ellen. Ellen clung to Ayres and refused to be dropped, but Ayres threw her out of the building, and the child was caught by a member of the crowd. Ayres went back into the smoke a third time and returned carrying badly injured Elizabeth, whom she dropped safely onto the mattress. After rescuing the three girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but overcome by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, striking the projecting shop sign. She missed the mattress and the crowd below and fell onto the pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after her condition. The oil and paint stored in the shop caused the fire to burn out of control, and when the fire services were eventually able to enter the premises the rest of the family were found dead. The body of Henry Chandler was found on the staircase, still clutching a locked strongbox filled with the shop's takings, while the badly burnt remains of Mary Ann Chandler were found lying next to a first floor window, the body of six-year-old Henry by her side. Ayres's condition deteriorated and she died in Guy's Hospital on 1885. Her last words were reported as \\"I tried my best and could try no more\\". Elizabeth, the last of the children to be rescued, had suffered severe burns to her legs and died shortly after Ayres. Funeral Ayres's body was not taken to Guy's Hospital's mortuary, but was laid in a room set aside for her. The estimated value of the floral tributes came to over £1,000 (about £ as of ). Ayres was posthumously recognised by the Metropolitan Board of Works- controlled Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire (today the Society for the Protection of Life from Fire), who awarded her father John Ayres a sum of 10 guineas (about £ as of ) in her honour. A memorial service for Ayres at St Saviour's Church (now Southwark Cathedral) attracted such a large crowd that mourners were turned away due to lack of standing room, while a collection taken at the memorial service comprised 951 coins, totalling over £7. Ayres was given a large public funeral, attended by over 10,000 mourners. Her coffin was carried from her parents' house to her grave in Isleworth Cemetery by a team of 16 firemen, relieving each other in sets of four. The church service was attended by a group of 20 girls, dressed in white, from the village school that Ayres had attended. It had been planned that the girls should follow the coffin to the graveside and sing, but a severe hailstorm prevented this. Henry and Mary Ann Chandler were buried in Lambeth Cemetery along with the two children who had died in the fire. Edith and Ellen Chandler were accepted by the Orphan Working School in Kentish Town and trained as domestic servants. Memorial alt=A tall red four-sided obelisk, surrounded by much shorter gravestones Shortly after the fire it was decided to erect a monument to Ayres, to be funded by public subscription, and by August 1885 the fund had raised over £100 (about £ as of ). On 1885 work began on the memorial. The monument was erected above her grave in Isleworth Cemetery, and was of an Egyptian design inspired by Cleopatra's Needle, which had been raised in central London in 1878. It took the form of a solid red granite obelisk, and is still today the tallest grave marker in the cemetery. On the front of the obelisk is inscribed The right hand side of the monument lists the ten members of the Alice Ayres Memorial Committee, chaired by Rev H. W. P. Richards. The Union Street fire and Ayres's rescue of the children caused great public interest from the outset, and the fire, Ayres's death and funeral, and the fundraising for and erection of the memorial were all reported in detail in the local and national press and throughout the British Empire. \\"A secular canonisation\\" The British government had traditionally paid little attention to the poor, but in the wake of the Industrial Revolution attitudes towards the accomplishments of the lower classes were changing. The growth of the railways, the mechanisation of agriculture and the need for labour in the new inner-city factories had broken the traditional feudal economy and caused the rapid growth of cities, while increasing literacy rates led to a greater interest in the media and current affairs among ordinary workers. In 1856 the first military honour for bravery open to all ranks, the Victoria Cross, had been instituted, while in 1866 the Albert Medal, the first official honour open to civilians of all classes, was introduced. Additionally, a number of private and charitable organisations dedicated to lifesaving, most prominently the Royal Humane Society (1776) and Royal National Lifeboat Institution (1824), were increasing in activity and prominence, and gave awards and medals as a means of publicising their activities and lifesaving advice. Painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts and his second wife, designer and artist Mary Fraser Tytler, had long been advocates of the idea of art as a force for social change, and of the principle that narratives of great deeds would provide guidance to address the serious social problems of British cities. Watts had recently painted a series of portraits of leading figures he considered to be a positive social influence, the \\"Hall of Fame\\", which was donated to the National Portrait Gallery;Sandy Nairne, in since at least 1866 he had proposed as a companion piece a monument to \\"unknown worth\\", celebrating the bravery of ordinary people. On 5 September 1887, a letter was published in The Times from Watts, proposing a scheme to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria by means of collecting and commemorating \\"a complete record of the stories of heroism in every-day life\\". He cited the death of Alice Ayres as an example of the type of event he proposed to commemorate, and included in his letter a distorted account of Ayres's actions during the Union Street fire. Watts had originally proposed that the monument take the form of a colossal bronze figure, but by 1887 was proposing that the memorial take the form of \\"a kind of Campo Santo\\", consisting of a covered way and marble wall inscribed with the names of everyday heroes, to be built in Hyde Park. Watts's suggestion was not taken up, leading Watts to comment that \\"if I had proposed a race course round Hyde Park, there would have been plenty of sympathisers\\". However, his high-profile lobbying further raised the already high public awareness of the death of Alice Ayres. Depiction in literature and art Emilia Aylmer Blake wrote perhaps the first poem about Ayres, titled Alice Ayres, which she recited at a social gathering in June 1885. Sir Francis Hastings Doyle also wrote a well-received poem in honour of Ayres, as did leading social reformer and women's rights campaigner Laura Ormiston Chant. By the late 1880s Ayres was coming to be seen as a model of British devotion to duty, and her story was told in collections of heroic and inspirational stories for children, including as the first story in F. J. Cross's influential Beneath the Banner, in which Cross remarked that: \\"She had tried to do her best always. Her loving tenderness to the children committed to her care and her pure gentle life were remarked by those around her before there was any thought of her dying a heroic death. So, when the great trial came, she was prepared; and what seems to us Divine unselfishness appeared to her but simple duty.\\" The Union Street Fire, alt=Stylised black and white engraving in the style of Edward Burne- Jones. A woman in heroic pose in a flowing white dress stands in a window holding a child, while a fireman stands on a ladder, roughly level to the window, and reaches out to take the child. A Royal Navy sailor in full uniform, further down the ladder, holds another child. In 1890 a series of painted panels by Walter Crane were unveiled in Octavia Hill's Red Cross Hall, from the site of the Union Street fire. Inspired by George Frederic Watts's proposals, the panels depicted instances of heroism in everyday life; Watts himself refused to become involved in the project, as his proposed monument was intended to be a source of inspiration and contemplation as opposed to simply commemoration, and he felt that an artistic work would potentially distract viewers from the most important element of the cases, the heroic sacrifices of the individuals involved. The first of Crane's panels depicted the Union Street fire. It is an idealised image depicting Ayres as the rescued rather than the rescuer, blending religious imagery with traditional 19th- century symbols of British heroism, and bears no relationship to actual events.The murals are discussed in detail in chapter two of, John Price, Everyday Heroism: Victorian Constructions of the Heroic Civilian (Bloomsbury: London, 2014) Ayres, in a long and flowing pure white gown, stands at a first floor window, surrounded in flames and holding a small child. A fireman stands on a ladder and reaches out to Ayres and the child; meanwhile, a sailor in full Royal Navy uniform holds a second child. Although in reality Ayres had been at a much higher level of the building and the heat of the burning oil and gunpowder had made it impossible for the fire brigade to approach the building, by depicting Ayres with the fireman and sailor, widely seen as symbols of British heroism and British strength, Crane's picture further enhanced her growing reputation as a heroic figure. Crane's picture in the Red Cross Hall was itself mentioned in Alice Ayres, a border ballad by National Trust founder Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley published in his 1896 Ballads of Brave Deeds, for which George Frederic Watts wrote the preface. Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice In 1898 George Frederic Watts was approached by Henry Gamble, vicar of St Botolph's, Aldersgate church in the City of London. St Botolph's former churchyard had recently been converted, along with two smaller adjoining burial grounds, into Postman's Park, one of the largest public parks in the City of London, and the church was engaged in a protracted financial and legal dispute over ownership of part of the park. To provide a public justification for keeping the disputed land as part of the park, and to raise the park's profile and assist in fundraising, the church offered part of the park as a site for his proposed memorial. Watts agreed, and in 1900 the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice was unveiled by Alfred Newton, Lord Mayor of London, and Mandell Creighton, Bishop of London. The memorial consisted of a and wooden loggia with a tiled roof, designed by Ernest George, sheltering a wall with space for 120 ceramic memorial tablets. William De Morgan and added to the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice in 1902|alt=A tablet formed of six standard sized tiles, bordered by green flowers in the style of the Arts and Crafts movement, with an inscription in green capital letters on a white background The memorial tablets were handmade and expensive to produce, and at the time of the memorial's unveiling only four were in place. In 1902 a further nine tablets were unveiled, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had long lobbied. Made by William De Morgan in the Arts and Crafts style, the green-and-white tablet reads \\"Alice Ayres, daughter of a bricklayer's labourer who by intrepid conduct saved 3 children from a burning house in Union Street, Borough, at the cost of her own young life April 24, 1885\\". Changing attitudes and differing perceptions Although the public would have been familiar with the concept of a female national heroic figure following the widespread coverage and public admiration of Harriet Newell, Grace Darling and Florence Nightingale, the ongoing coverage of Ayres and her elevation as a national hero was unusual for the period. Ayres was an uneducated working-class woman, who after her death underwent what has been described as \\"a secular canonisation\\", at a time when, despite the gradual formal recognition of the contributions of the lower classes, national heroes were generally male and engaged in exploration, the military, religion or science and engineering. This was a period in which political pressures for social reform were growing. The version of Ayres presented to the public as a woman devoted entirely to duty embodied the idealised British character at the time, while the image of a hard-working but uncomplaining woman who set the welfare of others above her own embodied the idealised vision of the working class presented by social reformers, and the ideal selfless and dedicated woman presented by campaigners for women's rights. At the unveiling of the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice the Lord Mayor, Alfred Newton, had remarked that it was \\"intended to perpetuate the acts of heroism which belonged to the working classes\\", while George Frederic Watts, although he was opposed in principle to discrimination based on class and saw the Memorial as being theoretically open to all classes, had remarked that \\"the higher classes do not or ought not to require reminders or inducements\\". Watts saw the purpose of his Memorial not as a commemoration of deeds, but as a tool for the education of the lower classes. Watts's view was shared by others who sought to provide inspirational material on British heroes, and authors writing about Ayres systematically altered the fact that the children rescued were members of her family, instead describing them as the children of her employer. Press reports at the time of the fire described Ayres variously as a \\"little nursemaid\\", \\"a willing, honest, hard-working servant\\", and a \\"poor little domestic\\". As well as Watts's 1887 description of Ayres as \\"the maid of all work at an oilmonger's\\", Cross's chapter on Ayres in Beneath the Banner is titled \\"Only a Nurse Girl!\\", while Rawnsley called her \\"the nursemaid in the household\\". Barrington, writing five years after the fire at the unveiling of Price's panel, acknowledges in a footnote that Ayres was related to the Chandlers, but nonetheless describes her as displaying the \\"typical English virtues—courage, fortitude, and an unquestioning sense of duty\\". While George and Mary Watts and their fellow paternalist social reformers, along with the broadly sympathetic mainstream British press, portrayed Ayres as an inspirational selfless servant to her employer, others had a different view. The left-wing Reynolds's Weekly Newspaper complained that the lack of support for Ayres's family from the state was symbolic of poor treatment of workers as a whole. The pioneering feminist periodical The Englishwoman's Review described their \\"righteous pride\\" at Ayres's \\"instinctive motherhood\\"; on the other hand Young England, an imperialist children's story paper, said that \\"there is no sex in self-sacrifice\\", lauding Ayres as a model of devotion to duty. Later years alt=A long narrow deserted street. On the right of the picture a long row of traditional English red brick cottages line the street, while the left side of the street is lined with modern industrial units. In 1936 the new Labour administration of the London County Council renamed White Cross Street, near the site of the Red Cross Hall and the scene of the Union Street fire, to Ayres Street in tribute to Alice Ayres, a name it retains today. The Chandlers' house at 194 Union Street no longer stands, and the site is occupied by part of the Union House office complex; immediately opposite the site of the fire is the present-day headquarters of the London Fire Brigade. In popular culture Alice Ayres came to renewed public notice with the release of the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber and the 2004 BAFTA Award- and Golden Globe-winning film Closer based on it starring Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen. A key plot element revolves around the memorial tablet to Ayres at the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice in Postman's Park, in which it is revealed that the character Jane Jones (played by Portman in the film), who calls herself Alice Ayres for most of the story, has in fact fabricated her name and identity based on the tablet on the memorial, which she reads at the time of her first meeting with Dan Woolf (played by Jude Law) near the beginning of the film. The park, and the memorial to Ayres, feature prominently in the opening and closing scenes of the film.

Biography  After graduating from Brown University with a major in history, she developed an interest in experimental documentary filmmaking while attending the 1985 Robert Flaherty Documentary Film Seminar through a scholarship. There, she was inspired by the works of Bruce Conner, who would later become her mentor, and Maya Deren. That same year, Sachs moved to San Francisco to attend San Francisco State University and later the San Francisco Art Institute. It was during this time that she studied and collaborated with Trinh T. Minh-ha, George Kuchar and Gunvor Nelson. In 1989, Sachs returned to her hometown of Memphis to shoot Sermons and Sacred Pictures. This was her first long format experimental documentary. The film is a portrait of Reverend L. O. Taylor, an African-American minister and filmmaker from the 1930s and 40s. This film screened at the Museum of Modern Art and the Margaret Mead Film Festival that year. Over the last two decades she has worked in geographic locations affected by international war, such as Vietnam, Bosnia, Israel and Germany. Her films and web projects expose what she defines as the \\"limits of a conventional documentary representation of both the past and the present\\". It is in this style that she has produced five pieces (Which Way Is East, The House of Drafts, Investigation of a Flame, States of Unbelonging and The Last Happy Day) grouped together as the I Am Not A War Photographer series. Her work has been supported by fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation and Jerome Foundation, the New York State Council on the Arts, New York Foundation for the Arts https://s3.amazonaws.com/NYFA_WebAssets/Pictures/fbff420f-79fe-4f34-800a-f94a82fa5876.pdf as well as residencies at the Experimental Television Center and the MacDowell Colony. Sachs’s films have screened at the Museum of Modern Art, the Pacific Film Archive, the Sundance Film Festival and the New York Film Festival. In 2007, the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema presented a retrospective of her work. That same year, she collaborated with Chris Marker on a remake of his short film Three Cheers for the Whale. She returned to Argentina in 2008 to film her first narrative project, Wind in Our Hair, inspired by the short stories of Julio Cortázar. Additionally, she co-edited with film historian Lucas Hildebrand the Summer 2009 Millennium Film Journal issue #51 on “Experiments in Documentary”. Sachs holds an MFA in Film from the San Francisco Art Institute, an MA in Cinema from San Francisco State University, and a BA in History from Brown University. She has taught at New York University, Hunter College, The New School, Maryland Institute, and the University of California, Berkeley.  Films and other media  In her films, Sachs has said she wants to rupture traditional chronological narrative. *Drawn and Quartered (1986) *Still Life With Woman and Four Objects (1986) *Following the Object to Its Logical Beginning (1987) *Sermons and Sacred Pictures (1989) *The House of Science: a museum of false facts (1991) *Which Way Is East: Notebooks from Vietnam (1994) *A Biography of Lilith (1997) *Window Work (2000)This video-art can be found in Experimental Television Center and in the Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art, Cornell University Library. *Photograph of Wind (2001) *Horror Vacui: Nature Abhors a Vacuum (2000) *Investigation of a Flame (2001) *Tornado (2002) *The House of Drafts (2002) *Atalanta 32 Years Later (2006) *Noa, Noa (2006) *The Small Ones (2006) *States of UnBelonging (2006) *XY Chromosome Project (2007) *Abecedarium: NYC (2007) *Georgic for a Forgotten Planet (2008) *The Last Happy Day (2009) *Wind in Our Hair (2009) *The Task of the Translator (2010) *Sound of a Shadow (2011) *Your Day is My Night (2013) https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/lynne-sachs-and-your-day-is-my- night-at-the-national-gallery/2011/10/19/gIQA0OreyL_story.html*Drift and Bough (2014) *Starfish Aorta Colossus (2015) http://film- makerscoop.com/catalogue/lynne-sachs-starfish-aorta-colossus *Tip of My Tongue (2017) https://www.lafilmforum.org/archive/winter-2018/lynne-sachs- tip-of-my-tongue *A Year in Notes and Numbers (2017) http://www.lynnesachs.com/2019/02/07/a-year-in-notes-and-numbers-2 *The Washing Society (2018, co-directed) https://viff.org/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=f28977-the- washing-society *Carolee, Barbara, and Gunvor (2018) http://film- makerscoop.com/catalogue/sachs-lynne-carolee-barbara-and-gunvor *A Month of Single Frames (2019) https://www.doclisboa.org/2019/en/filmes/a-month-of- single-frames *Film About A Father Who (2020) https://deadline.com/2019/12/slamdance-2020-film-about-a-father-who-opening- night-1202812307  Multimedia and recent years (2005-present)  Commissioned in 2008 by the New York Public Library, Lynne Sachs ventured into the realm of online installations with artist and designer Susan Agliata on the piece Abecedarium NYC. The interactive project is an online alphabet of obscure words represented by short films made by Sachs and other collaborators such as filmmakers David Gatten and George Kuchar. In addition to this, the project is meant to stand as an ongoing exploration through participatory blog threads and collaboration with other online media forums open to the public. In 2010, Sachs teamed up with her brother Ira Sachs and decided to adapt his short film Last Address into an exterior window installation on the sides of the Kimmel Center in Manhattan, New York. The piece is a meditation on some of the most prolific New York-based artists of the 80's and 90's who died of AIDS in this city, such as Ethyl Eichelberger, David Wojnarowicz and Reynaldo Arenas. The installation was up for several months; designer Bernard Blythe and media artist Sofía Gallisá were collaborators. In recent years, one of the recurring themes in Sachs's work has been the translation of language and how it affects cultural interaction. Her exploration of this subject has been reflected in her last five films, which include the story of a Hungarian doctor who translated Winnie the Pooh into Latin (The Last Happy Day) and a visual haiku about her visit to Japan made in collaboration with Mark Street (Sound of a Shadow). In the Autumn of 2010, The Hungarian Quarterly journal also published an article written by Sachs on the story behind The Last Happy Day and her discovery of her cousin Sandor Lenard. In 2011, Oxford University Press published The Essay Film: From Montaigne After Marker, a book by Timothy Corrigan which dedicates a chapter to discussing Sachs's film \\"States of Unbelonging\\" in relation to works by Harun Farocki and Ari Folman. Later that same year, The National Gallery of Art presented her work as part of their American Originals Now series. In 2013, Sachs completed the hybrid-documentary Your Day is My Night which features residents of a New York City Chinatown shift-bed apartment sharing their stories of personal and political upheaval. The film premiered at the Museum of Modern Art Documentary Fortnight and later screened at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, the Images Festival, the Vancouver International Film Festival and the Traverse City Film Festival. Stuart Klawans of The Nation wrote, the film is \\"a strikingly handsome, meditative work: a mixture of reportage, dreams, memories and playacting, which immerses you in an entire world that you might unknowingly pass on the corner of Hester Street.\\" In 2014 Sachs received a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in film and video. https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/lynne-sachs/ In addition to her work with the moving image, Lynne co-edited the 2009 Millennium Film Journal issue on “Experiments in Documentary” and co-curated the 2014 film series “We Landed/ I Was Born/ Passing By: NYC’s Chinatown on Film” at Anthology Film Archives.

This open acknowledgment of the Macedonian national identity led to the creation of a revisionist historiography whose goal has been to affirm the existence of the Macedonian nation through the history. Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans. Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history. The claim is that most of the Slavic population of Macedonia in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was ethnic Macedonian. For more see: Victor Roudometof, Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, , p. 58; Victor Roudometof, Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question in Journal of Modern Greek Studies 14.2 (1996) 253-301.Yugoslav Communists recognized the existence of a Macedonian nationality during WWII to quiet fears of the Macedonian population that a communist Yugoslavia would continue to follow the former Yugoslav policy of forced Serbianization. Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia. For more see: Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R. King, Yugoslav communism and the Macedonian question, Archon Books, 1971, , Chapter 9: The encouragement of Macedonian culture. he was an ethnic Macedonian.According to pro-Bulgarian Macedonian publicist Vladimir Perev until about ten years ago, Andon Kyoseto was an unknown person in Macedonian history. About him he has heard in his childhood as a nearly mythological person. Gruevski's government wanted to present this hard Bulgarian to an ethnic Macedonian and made him a monument in Skopje, in front of the Courthouse. However the socialist government of Zoran Zaev immediately crashed the monument of this Bulgarian after its coming into power. For more see: Владимир Пеев, Когато кръчмарят потърси своето. Македония трябва да се срещне с историята. Faktor.bg 24, сеп. 2018. Biography Early years Andon Kyoseto as an IMARO freedom fighter Andon Kyoseto was born in 1855 in the village of Golozinci, Manastir Vilayet in Ottoman Empire. Until the age of 16, he worked as a shepherd with his two brothers and his two sisters. After his father was arrested and taken away to Thessaloniki, they moved in Veles into the house of their uncle. In Veles, Andon killed an eminent Turk and escaped to Thessaloniki, where he joined the revolutionary organization IMARO. At the beginning, he started to execute simple tasks that were assigned to him by the organization. He met Dame Gruev who became his superior and ordered him to do certain tasks for the organization. Later, he worked as cabman of Doctor Hristo Tatarchev in order to mask his illegal activities. At that time, his brother Nikola, who came to Thessaloniki, placed himself in the service of the Turkish authorities. At the suggestion of Andon Kyoseto, the organization killed his brother, so that he could not betray the organization. Andon also participated in the execution the Serbian teacher Peychinovich in Thessaloniki. With the help of Argir Manasiev, he executed the grecophille Tsitso from the town of Gevgelija. He returned to Thessaloniki, but only for a short time, because the Turkish authorities started investigations against him. Together with the revolutionary band of Iliya Karchovaliyata and Mihail Apostolov Popeto, they collected money from eminent inhabitants of the village of Gorno Brodi, and then they toured the region of Kilkis. There, Andon Kyoseto together with few of his friends, kidnapped the son of a rich man, and after 25 days he received 1000 lira for the ransom. Because of certain misunderstandings, his revolutionary band got arrested in Bulgaria. Gotse Delchev and Anton Bozukov helped their release. During his stay in Sofia, he executed the orders of Gotse Delchev. Later, Andon Kyoseto, Gotse Delchev and Mihail Apostolov Popeto made an unsuccessful attempt to take money by the kidnapping of a bey from Strumica. In 1897, together with Mihail Apostolov Popeto, he organized a revolutionary band, which operated in the regions of Kilkis, Dojran, Gevgelija, Ano Poroia, Maleševo, and Strumica. After the murder of the Romanian publicist Ștefan Mihăileanu, and the rumors of the coming war between Bulgaria and Romania, they went to Kyustendil and then to Sofia. There he was visited by the representative body of the Revolutionary Organization and had meetings with Gotse Delchev, Boris Sarafov, Mihail Gerdzhikov and others. Until the murder of Mihail Apostolov in March 1902, Andon Kyoseto was a leader of a revolutionary band in the region of Strumica, and later in the region of Kilkis. From 1900 he had contacts with Yane Sandanski. In 1901, he participated in the Miss Stone Affair. During the Ilinden uprising Application by Kyoseto for membership in the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps Society in G. Dzhumaya (1934). During the Ilinden- Preobrazhenie Uprising, Andon Kyoseto was ordered, together with Gyorche Petrov and Luka Ivanov, to lead a revolutionary band in the region of Prilep. In the village of Trojaci, he initiated a minor battle against the Turkish military and after he split with Gyorche Petrov, Luka Ivanov and Pere Toshev, he went to the region of Veles. On 17 October 1903, before leaving the village of Skačinci, Andon Kyoseto together with 30 freedom fighters was engaged in a battle on \\"Klepata\\" against 500 Turkish soldiers. Boris Sarafov and his group of 70 freedom fighters then came and struck the Turkish military from the rear. Only four freedom fighters were killed, as opposed to 65 casualties on the Turkish side. The bands managed to escape during the night. They also escaped two ambushes set by Turkish soldiers. From the village of Prosenikovo, they headed to the border with Bulgaria and arrived in Kyustendil in the middle of December 1903. Balkan Wars and WWI In the Balkan Wars, Andon Kyoseto, Yonko Vaptsarov, Georgi Zankov, Toshe Kolagov, Tasko Kocherinski, Mihail Chakov, Lazar Topalov, Stefan Chavdarov, Peyo Yavorov and others, formed a revolutionary band that was headed by Hristo Chernopeev. The band accompanied the 27-th Chepinski regiment of Bulgarian Army on its attack on Mehomiya. Afterwards, Andon Kyoseto served in the headquarters of the 13-th Kukush Section of the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps.\\"Македоно- одринското опълчение 1912-1913 г. Личен състав\\", Главно управление на архивите, 2006, стр.405. During the First World War he supported the Bulgarian military administration in Macedonia. After the First World War After the First World War Kyoseto moved to Bulgaria and settled in Gorna Dzumaya. In 1934 he became a member of the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps Society in Gorna Dzhumaya. After the Second World War The centre of Skopje in 2015. In left is now the nonexistent monument of Kyoto.. For a period of some years after the war, the Yugoslav and Bulgarian leaders Josip Broz Tito and Georgi Dimitrov worked on a project to merge their two countries into a Balkan Communist Federation. Bulgarian authorities agreed to the recognition of a distinct Macedonian ethnicity and language among parts of the Bulgarian population. Centre of that events was the town of Gorna Dzumaya, where Kyoseto lived at that time. On May 23-24, 1948, in Skopje the second congress of the People's Front of Macedonia was held, at which the President of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia Lazar Kolishevski delivered a speech. A month later Kyoseto sent a greeting telegram where he expressed his hope that Macedonian people will soon live, once and for all, under one roof.Ванчо Ѓорѓиев, Андон Јанев–Ќосето, Универзитет „Св. Кирил и Методиј“, Скопје: Филозофски факултет, 2016. стр.238. However, differences soon emerged with regard to the Macedonian question. Whereas Dimitrov envisaged a state where Yugoslavia and Bulgaria would be placed on an equal footing and Macedonia would be more or less attached to Bulgaria, Tito saw Bulgaria as a seventh republic in an enlarged Yugoslavia tightly ruled from Belgrade.H.R. Wilkinson Maps and Politics. A Review of the Ethnographic Cartography of Macedonia, Liverpool, 1951. pp. 311–312. Their differences also extended to the national character of the Macedonians – whereas Dimitrov considered them to be an national offshoot of the Bulgarians,Yugoslavia: A History of Its Demise, Viktor Meier, Routledge, 2013, , p. 183. Tito regarded them as an independent nation which had nothing to do with the Bulgarians.Hugh Poulton Who are the Macedonians?, C. Hurst & Co, 2000, . pp. 107–108. Thus the initial tolerance for the Macedonization of Bulgarian Macedonia gradually grew into outright alarm. As result gradual change of that policy came in Bulgaria after the Tito-Stalin split in the same year. In the next years Bulgarian Communist Party slowly reverted to the view that the Macedonian nation and language did not exist before 1945 and thus are non-existing in general. As result the Yugoslav government submitted in the early 1950s a memorandum to the UN, where the population in Bulgarian Macedonia was declared a \\"Yugoslav Macedonian minority\\", persecuted and terrorized by the authorities in Sofia. A lot of old IMRO revolutionaries as Georgi Pophristov, Dimitar Zaneshev, Lazar Tomov, Alexandra Hadzhidimova, Vasil Chekalarov 's wife Olga Chekalarova, Andon Kyoseto etc. declared themselves in a special declaration against these Yugoslav claims.Германов, Стоян, Македонският въпрос 1944 - 1989. Възникване, еволюция, съвременност. София, 2012, стр. 134. Andon Kyoseto died in Blagoevgrad in 1953. Monument controversy in the Republic of Macedonia In 2014 a memorial of Andon Kyoseto was set up at the Supreme Court in Skopje. The monument was part of the controversial project Skopje 2014, and was sharply criticized by the media of Macedonia (now known as North Macedonia), with Kyoseto declared a terrorist and mass executioner.ОКНО.мк, 11.09.2014, Виктор Цветановски, Андон Ќосето: масовен убиец што доби споменик во Скопје. In February 2018, the monument was dismantled as one of the most disputed of the Skopje 2014 project. This was the first step in the successive removal of monuments from the Project, a decision taken in the autumn of 2017 by the new government of the country.OFFNews, 22.02.2018, Македония премахна първия паметник от ерата на Груевски.

When Russia declared war on the German Empire in 1914, his father – a fervent Russian monarchist – decided to russify the family name. Shnaider choose the Russian equivalent of his surname = Shevelov, and also changed the patronymic “Karlovich” to “Yuryevich”. Such changes required a personal petition to the Tsar, and in his case it was personally granted by Nikolai II in 1916. During the World War I, Yurii and his mother moved to Kharkiv. At the beginning of 1918, Shevelov's father was missing in action and was presumed killed. In Kharkiv, Yurii initially attended the E.Druzhkova Private School, then at 3rd State Boy's Gymnasium, and then continued his education at the Technical School #7 (). In Soviet Ukraine In 1925 Shevelov graduated from the First Kharkiv Trade and Industry Union school (). From 1925 till 1927 he worked as a statistician and archive keeper for South Chemical Trust. In 1927–1931 he attended classes at the literary-linguistic branch of the Kharkiv People's Education Institute. From August 1931 he was employed as a Ukrainian language school teacher. From 1932 till 1938 he was employed as a Ukrainian language teacher at the Ukrainian Communist Newspaper Technical School (). From 1933 till 1939 he also taught Ukrainian language at the Ukrainian Communist Institute for Journalism. From September 1936 he was a postgraduate student under the guidance of Leonid Bulakhovsky. In 1939 he taught the history of the Ukrainian language and literature. From November 1939 he became the assistant professor and deputy chair of the philology department of the Kharkiv Pedagogical Institute. In 1941 he became a research fellow at the Linguistic Institute of the Academy of Science of the Ukrainian SSR. In that same year he was pressured to become an NKVD informer.Шевельов (Шерех), Ю.В. “Я – мене – мені…(і довкруги)”: Спогади. – Х.; Нью-Йорк: Вид-во М.П.Коць, 2001. – Т.1. p 8- 290Боґуміла Бердиховська.

From April 1942 Shevelov worked for the city administration and collaborated with the educational organization Prosvita.

Shevelov has been critical of Soviet novels including Honchar's major work.End of a Century.by Svitlana Matvienko. Mirror Weekly. 20–26 April 2002. Shevelov and his mother fled the returning Red Army's advance on Kharkiv in February 1943. He resided for a brief period of time in Lviv where he continued his work in the study of Ukrainian language, including the creation of a new Ukrainian grammar until the Spring of 1944, when the Soviets continued their drive Westwards. Shevelov with the assistance of the Ukrainian Central Committee moved to Poland (Krynica) and then to Slovakia, then Austria and finally to Saxony. In Europe After the fall of Nazi Germany, Shevelov worked for the Ukrainian émigré newspaper “Chas” (“Time”). In 1946 he enrolled in the Ukrainian Free University in Munich and defended his doctorate dissertation in philology in 1947, continuing on his pre-war research and work \\"До генези називного речення\\" (1941) . He was also vice- president of the MUR (), a Ukrainian literary association (1945–49). In order to avoid repatriation to Soviet Union from Germany, he moved to neutral Sweden, where he worked in 1950–52 as Russian language lecturer at Lund University. In the US In 1952, together with mother, he emigrated to the USA. After settling in the United States he worked as a lecturer in Russian and Ukrainian at Harvard University (1952-4), associate professor (1954-8) and professor of Slavic philology at Columbia University (1958–77). He was one of the founders and president of the émigré scholarly organization “Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences” (1959–61, 1981–86) and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Alberta (1983) and Lund University (1984). He was a founding member of the Slovo Association of Ukrainian Writers in Exile and was published in numerous émigré bulletins and magazines. Return to Ukraine Shevelov was almost unknown to Ukrainian academic circles after 1943. In 1990, after an extended absence, he visited Ukraine where he was elected an international member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. In 1999 he received an honorary doctorate from the Kharkiv University and from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.Почесні професори НаУКМА In 2001 he published two volumes of his memoirs “Я – мене – мені…(і довкруги).”: Спогади. He died in 2002 in New York.  Awards  * Antonovych prize (1988) Intellectual contributions Shevelov prepared and published more than 600 scholarly texts concerning different aspects of the philology of the Ukrainian and other Slavic languages. From 1943 he developed the concept of the distinct establishment and development of Ukrainian and, later, Belarusian languages. Shevelov argued against the commonly held view of an original, unified East Slavic language from which Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian languages diverged and instead proposed the existence of several dialectical groups (Kyivan-Polissyan, Galician-Podillian, Polotsk-Smolensk, Novgorodian-Tversk, Murom-Ryazansk) that had been distinct from the beginning and which later formed into separate Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian languages. According to Shevelov, the beginnings of a separate Ukrainian language could be traced to the 7th century while the language formed in approximately the 16th century Great Ukrainian Philologist On the 100 year Anniversary of the Birth of Yuri Shevelov by Roxolana Zorivchak, professor of the University of Lviv Heritage and legacy On 4 September 2013 memorial plaque to Shevelov in his native Kharkiv was unveiled.

The exhibition was described by the Daily Gleaner as \\"Epochal in the establishment of a market for West Indian art.\\"A World of Glory to Record. Review by George Campbell - Daily Gleaner, March 26, 1956 The Hills family spent weekends and holidays at Port Antonio visiting friends and clients including their neighbor, novelist Robin Moore at Blue Lagoon.\\"Robin Moore's Big Marlin Bet\\" Telepathy experiment, Supersenonics - The Science of Radiational Paraphysics, 0-916438-18-X (1975) p 593 There Hills met Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen- Bornemisza who asked Hills to curate part of his art collection. For five years many classic works of the baron's international art acquisitions decorated the walls of the Hills' home. Von Thyssen also granted Hills' children access to his private island at San San near Port Antonio. In 1955 Hills had just returned from sailing the Robanne to Havana when he met Adlai Stevenson who had given a speech honoring a visit to Jamaica by Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. At the gallery Stevenson fell in love with Hills' George III period Sheraton bow-fronted desk,\\"Jamaican Mementoes\\" - Daily Gleaner, September 18, 1955 immediately purchasing it for his own office in Chicago.Adlai Stevenson paid $328.00 with Northern Trust Company personal check No.5162 ($2,884 in today's dollars) Over dinner, Hills shared his observations of simmering revolution in Cuba, while he and Stevenson compared their concepts of justice, democracy, conflict and dictatorships — a conversation that inspired Hills to publish his ideas for uplifting the world's underprivileged masses in his landmark volume Rise of the Phoenix.Rise of the Phoenix - Universal Government by Nature's Laws, 0-916438-04-X (1979) Rastafari movement Hills also became an advocate for Jamaica's Rastafari movement, who were being oppressed in the late fifties.\\"Rasta Spirit Knows no Boundaries\\" - Daily Gleaner, June 22, 1960 He gave Rastafarians jobs as woodcarvers, free paints to poor artists, such as the now-famed Ras Dizzy and bailed them out of Spanish Town Prison while encouraging rasta brethren to sustain themselves through art and music. Christopher and Norah Hills were personally thanked for their years of support for struggling rastas by Mortimo Planno, the Rasta teacher of Bob Marley and one of the few Rastafarian elders to have met with Emperor Haile Selassie in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Hills also \\"reasoned\\" Gandhian non-violence with Leonard Howell, the original \\"Gong\\"Bob Marley named his record label Tuff Gong after Leonard \\"The Gong\\" Howell activist who founded Pinnacle, a Rastafarian community farm at Sligoville, a few miles from Hills' home. In 1958 Pinnacle was raided in a brutal crackdown by the authorities, ostensibly for growing marijuana, but in fact Rastafarianism at that time was regarded by The Crown as a threat to social harmony. Hills interceded with the Prime Minister but, with an election coming, law & order politics prevailed and many sustainable farming families had to leave the land. For his support, Hills was given the moniker \\"The First White Rasta\\". Unlike his skeptical friends and business colleagues, he saw Rastafarian spirituality as a righteous way of life, indeed growing out his hair and beard in solidarity and also in keeping with his emerging interest in the sadhus and enlightened sages of India who had much in common with the vegetarian mystical Rastafarians.\\"Back to Africa\\" movement, Christopher Hills' speech at Addis Ababa - Kingston Gleaner July 22, 1960. Spiritual awakening By 1960 Christopher Hills had accumulated a large metaphysical library on frequent trips to Samuel Weiser Books in New York, while writing his own books, Kingdom of Desire, Power of the Doctrine and The Power of Increased Perception. At 30 he retired from business\\"The Business of Art\\" - Business Sketch Magazine, July 1961 and began to research multiple spiritual paths and the physics of what Albert Einstein called Unified field theory. Prolific research papers and lectures came out of Hills' laboratory in the Blue Mountains (Jamaica) on subjects such as bioenergetics, hypnosis, tele- thought, biophysics, effects of solar radiation on living organisms, resonant systems of ionosphere, and capacitor effects of human body on static electricity and electron discharge of the nervous system. In 1960 he began a 30-year project to document the effects of sound and color on human consciousness and states of health.Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body (2nd ed.), , pp. 108, 190, 431  Global outreach  With Norah Hills running the galleries, Hills set forth on a two-year journey travelling in Asia, Europe, Pakistan and India, meeting with members of the UN and calling on politicians, scientists and religious leaders. UNESCO hired him to shoot 1,000 photographs of their projects in faraway countries, which appeared in an exhibit at United Nations headquarters. Hills' global odyssey's itinerary grew out of publishing his views on conflict resolution and alternative government in a manifesto, Framework for Unity, that was circulated to The Commission for Research in the Creative Faculties of Man, a network he had founded of thinkers around the world which, in 1961, included Prof. Oliver Reiser, Humphry Osmond, Dr. Andrija Puharich, David Ben-Gurion, and Lady Isobel Cripps, among its 500 members. After teaming up with his good friend and noted lawyer Luis Kutner (co-founder of Amnesty International), Hills decided to search the world for a spot to establish a Center where a dedicated community could live and test his World Constitution for Self-Government by Nature's Laws, which he published in a book with an introduction by Bertrand Russell.Christ Yoga of Peace - Centre Publications, 1966  Friendship with Nehru  Working his way on a speaking tour through Europe in the direction of India, Hills decided to make a precarious expedition to the remote Himalayan Hunza Valley\\"Hunza – Dreamland of the Hillside Farmer\\". Sunday Gleaner, Feb. 3, 1963 where he had long been curious about the diet and extraordinary longevity of the Pashtun, Balti and Uzbek hill tribes. In Pakistan, Hills was the guest of Professors Duranni and Walid Uddin at Peshawar's College of Engineering. Visiting Sufi holy men and Islamic scholars in Karachi, he met Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to discuss possible Indo-Pakistan cooperation in algae cultivation in the climatically suitable Gujrat-Sind border region, which is where Bhutto and his ancestors were from. Later, when Bhutto was overthrown in a military coup, Hills orchestrated urgent appeals to General Muhammad Zia-ul- Haq for clemency, but, like many westerners protesting Bhutto's imprisonment, was ignored, and Bhutto was hanged. In the 1950s Hills became known to Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru\\"The Nehru I Knew\\" – Sunday Gleaner, full page, May 31, 1964. through his friend the Deputy leader of India's Congress Party, Surendra Mohan Ghose, a Bengali revolutionary and relative of Sri Aurobindo. Hills invited Ghose to Jamaica,S.M.

Ghose\\"Indian Leader to announce World Centre project\\" – Daily Gleaner, November 4, 1964 was one of the founders of Auroville, an experimental sustainable-living International Village in Tamil Nadu. In 1962 Ghose took Hills to Sri Aurobindo Ashram for a personal audience with Aurobindo's successor, spiritual head of the ashram, Mirra Alfassa, known as \\"The Mother\\". Later Ghose arranged for Christopher Hills' son, John Hills, to give the keynote address at the World Parliament of Youth in Puducherry in 1971. Christopher Hills with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru at Teen Murti Bhavan, New Delhi In 1959 Hills had lobbied Nehru to approve a government in exile for the Dalai Lama fleeing persecution in Tibet and to grant full refugee status to exiled Tibetans. He had become connected to the Tibetans through his study of Buddhism and in 1960 provided funding for the Young Lama's Home SchoolCave in the Snow: A Western Woman's Quest for Enlightenment, Vicki Mackenzie, 1999, in Dalhousie, Himachal Pradesh founded by his English friend Freda Bedi, one of Gandhi's handpicked satyagrahisAndrew Rawlinson, \\"The Book of Enlightened Masters\\". Open Court, 1997, , p. 181 who became Gelongma Karma Kechog Palmo,The Revolutionary Life of Freda Bedi, Vicki Mackenzie, 2017, the first Western woman to take ordination in Tibetan Buddhism. Freda Bedi is the mother of film and television star Kabir Bedi. In 1968 Hills contributed to Freda Bedi's building of the Karma Drubgyu Thargay Ling nunnery at Tilokpur in the Kangra Valley and helped organize her journey to the West with the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje in 1974. When Hills arrived in India, he found Nehru besieged by border disputes with China and discussion inevitably turned to Hills' theories of conflict resolution and how to avoid war.Creative Conflict - The Secret of Heart-to-Heart Communication, 0-916438-36-8 (1980) Their connection also evolved out of the fact that India was experiencing famine in some states. With dependence on wheat shipments from the United States, Hills helped lobby President Lyndon Johnson for an increase in wheat aid, which was granted. But when Hills mentioned his research with algae as a food source, then Nehru became interested and offered to support cultivation in India. (PDF will be posted) While in New Delhi, Hills spent time with the prime minister at Teen Murti Bhavan, enjoying Jawaharlal Nehru's rose gardens and meeting his daughter Indira Gandhi. Hills was the guest of Indian industrialist G.D. Birla, where on his first day in India, he had met Swami Shantananda, an enlightened sage and a remarkably politically connected guru with whom Hills would travel throughout India for two years, much like a roaming sanyassin. On one of his \\"pilgrimages\\", Hills was taken by Shantanananda and Nehru's Parliamentary Secretary S.D. Upadhyaya to Brindavan for a private audience with India's highest female yogini Sri Anandamayi Ma, from whom he felt a \\"genuine sublime holiness\\" and received one of the most significant blessings in his life.The One I Love, , p. 96 In Patna, Bihar, Hills, along with Dr Raynor Johnson, were the only Europeans to attend the 1961 Science & Spirituality Conference, where seeds were sown for Hills' decade of cooperation with hundreds of Indian scientists and yogis, many of whom eventually journeyed to visit Hills' centers in the West and who comprised many of the delegates for a 1970 Yoga conference Hills staged in New Delhi. In 1963, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and Gandhi Peace Foundation sponsored another conference in Patna, hosted by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Mahatma Gandhi's longtime right-hand disciple and first President of India. Prasad was supposed to speak at the conference but became ill, and Hills' guru Shantananda was leading prayers for him every day at the Sadaqat Ashram in Patna. Prasad requested to meet Hills, whose goals for World Union he had heard about from Nehru. Hills considered Prasad the most spiritual of the founders of Independent India, and their meeting was a profound encounter in which Prasad gave his blessing for Hills' global endeavors, but then the president lost consciousness, tightly holding onto Hills' hand.The President's Last Words – The One I Love, , p. 153 Apparently Prasad never recovered, and at the time, there was a controversy that the man who, through satyagraha, had resisted multiple British governments and Viceroys and been jailed by them for so many years, had said his last words to an Englishman.  Microalgae International  In earlier travels from Jamaica to Japan, Hills had formed an aquaculture research company with his friend and colleague, biologist Dr Hiroshi Nakamura, Dean of Tokyo Women's University. Dr Nakamura was a noted scientist and a colleague of Emperor Hirohito (himself a marine biologist) who asked Nakamura to research alternative food sources for Japan after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had devastated food supplies. The goal of Hills and Nakmura's organization Microalgae International Union, was to develop strains of algae as a way of harnessing the sun's energy for biofuels and human nutrition and as a solution to World Hunger.Spirulina - Food for a Hungry World, 0-916438-47-3 - Micro Algae International Union, pp. 5, 69, 85 Presented with M.I.U.'s feasibility studies, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru endorsed Hills' proposal for bringing the cultivation of protein-rich Chlorella algae to the villages of India.Food from Sunlight, 0-916438-13-9, pp. 103–109 With India's Home Minister, Gulzari Lal Nanda, Hills had co-founded the Institute of Psychic and Spiritual Research in New Delhi. A devout Gandhian, Nanda feared social upheaval and possible communal violence if poor and hungry villagers started migrating to India's cities so he threw his support behind Hills' plan for developing rural economies via small footprint aquaculture that could help villages become sustainable. A detailed plan for a pilot project in the Rann of Kutch was approved by the Indian government. However, the initiative became mired in bureaucracy when Nehru died in 1964. Nanda became acting prime minister but only until the new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri was nominated to succeed Nehru. Shastri continued working with Hills and had his staff prepare a budget request for Parliament to fund the chlorella algae project. However, because it competed with traditional agricultural interests, the aquaculture project became victim to political jockeying as well as an outbreak of war with Pakistan. With Shastri's mysterious death at the 1966 India-Pakistan peace conference in Tashkent, the project lost its key sponsor. Nevertheless, the networks Hills had established with the founders of modern India proved valuable when his son, John Hills, was introduced by Nanda and S.M. Ghose to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who helped the younger Hills\\"Young British Yogi Plans World Meet\\", Hindustan Times, Sept 17, 1970, p.5 garner support among India's Congress party and religious leaders for India's largest conference of Western scientists and Indian yogis.\\"World Conference on Scientific Yoga\\" – Times of India, Nov. 30, 1970  Centre House, London  Members of Centre House community with Hatha Yoga teacher Malcolm Strutt and Yoga Master B.K.S. Iyengar Three years after Jamaica's 1962 declaration of Independence from Britain, the Hills family moved to London, at the suggestion of two of his mentors, Bertrand Russell and Sir George Trevelyan, 4th Baronet. They helped Hills find and purchase a six-story Edwardian building in London's leafy Kensington. There Christopher Hills and others, including Kevin Kingsland, founded Centre House, a self-discovery and human-potential community\\"The Superman Project\\", News of the World, Dec 5, 1966 known as a nucleus of yoga and spirituality in the emerging New Age movement throughout the late sixties and seventies.

It was here Christopher Hills wrote his magnum opus, Nuclear EvolutionNuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body (2nd ed.), \\\\- recognized as a definitive treatise on the chakras as they relate to the human endocrine system, light frequencies and human personality. Yoga Journal described the book as, \\"Synthesizing a vast amount of information ranging from the structure of DNA to the metaphysics of consciousness\\" and also as, \\"A giant step forward in integrating science with religion in a meaningful way.\\"Yoga Journal magazine - The Rainbow Body, March 1978 Centre House was an experiment in group consciousness where the majority of residents were well- educated students, teachers and scientists interested in the convergence of science and spirituality. For a while the large basement kitchen was a macrobiotic restaurant, first run by Craig Sams, then called Gandalf's Garden which counted John Lennon amongst its health-conscious patrons. Its founder, Muz Murray (Ramana Baba), was one of the early residents of Centre House and there published the first issues of Gandalf's Garden magazine, a publication chronicling the vitality of London's New Age scene. Kevin Kingsland went on to found the Centre for Human Communication in Devon and Grael Associates (a Community Company)..  World Conference on Scientific Yoga, New Delhi  In December 1970 Christopher Hills, his son John, and Kevin Kingsland organized the world's first World Conference on Scientific Yoga (WCSY)\\"World Yoga Conference\\" – Times of India, Nov. 30, 1970 in New Delhi, bringing 50 Western scientists together with 800 of India's leading swamis, yogis and lamas to discuss their research and establish a network for the creation of a World Yoga University. John Hills discusses the World Conference on Scientific Yoga program with Dhirendra Brahmachari and Amrit Desai in New Delhi The conference generated some controversy\\"Masters of Emotions – Yogis Wind Up Parley By Losing Tempers\\", Los Angeles Times, Dec 24, 1970 when Indian politics intersected with religion,\\"Yogis Act Unyogalike\\", The Daily Herald, Dec 24, 1970 particularly the concept of Christ Yoga, a book Hills had written linking Christ's teachings to those of Buddha and the Vedas. But the conclave nevertheless emerged as a milestone in the soon-to-be-booming migration of Indian yogis to the West. John Hills,\\"Young British Yogi Plans World Meet\\", Hindustan Times, Sept 17, 1970, p.5 helped by his father's prior relationship with Nehru, worked with India's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the Nehrus' yoga master Dhirendra Brahmachari to steer a fractious committee of MPs, ministers and often competitive spiritual leaders from disparate religions and castes into creating a uniquely diverse and widely hailed program of events.Time magazine, Dec 27, 1970 – \\"World Conference on Scientific Yoga\\" Presenters from the West included transpersonal psychology pioneer Dr. Stanislav Grof and Dr. Sidney Jourard who compared their research in lively sessions with Indian scholars, scientists, philosophers and yogis such as B.K.S. Iyengar, Shri K. Pattabhi Jois, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Swami Satchidananda, Padma Bhushan Murugappa Channaveerappa Modi, R.R. Diwaker, Swami Rama, Acharya Dharma Deva Vidya Martand, Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center and yoga hospital founder Dr. G. S. Melkote, M.P. The actor James Coburn, a yoga and martial arts practitioner, described the World Conference on Scientific Yoga as \\"Very rewarding for me, definitely worth the time and money getting here.\\"\\"Yogi Film Moghul\\" – Times of India, Dec 23, 1970 During the conference, Dhirendra Brahmachari presided over the wedding of organizer Kevin Kingsland and yoga teacher Venika Mehra. James Coburn also attended. Kevin and Venika Kingsland went on to establish various Centres for Human Communication in the UK, USA and India, teaching yoga, human communication and promoting community consciousness. Post-conference, the select delegates' presentations were published in CHAKRA magazine, founded with the help of Tantra scholar Ajit Mookerjee and Indian art patron Virendra Kumar and edited by John Hills whose first venture in publishing was mentored by Baburao Patel M.P., editor of Filmindia and Mother India magazines.\\"Editor's Welcome\\" - CHAKRA Magazine, Vol 1, March–May, 1971 The conference was deemed a success and Christopher Hills was elected by a majority of the delegates to establish a World Yoga University somewhere on the planet. A mission that would take him from the United Kingdom to the United States.\\"Yoga University Seeks Site\\" - San Mateo Times, March 4, 1972  University of the Trees  As the spiritual axis shifted to America, Christopher Hills visited his friend Laura Huxley who urged him to move to the United States where he settled in Boulder Creek, California, and became a U.S. citizen. There, amidst the ancient redwoods, he founded in 1973, an accredited college, University of the Trees, an alternative education and research center for the social sciences to study the laws of nature and their relation to human consciousness. Students lived on campus and studied subjects as diverse as Radionics and dowsing (Hills was a well-known diviner\\"Incredible Feat\\" – National Enquirer, June 22, 1976, p. 14 (Diviner finds stolen loot for Santa Cruz Police)), meditation, hatha yoga, the Vedas, and early forms of social networking he called \\"Group Consciousness\\". The campus housed University of the Trees Press which published Christopher Hills' writings and the research of a number of resident students who obtained degrees at the university and wrote books on light & color frequencies and the science of Radionics. A small workshop produced pendulums for dowsing and a line of negative ion generators. With the buildup of the vitamin business surrounding discoveries that spirulina had significant weight loss benefits University of the Trees became one of the largest employers in the San Lorenzo Valley\\"From Counterculture to Mainstream\\" – Santa Cruz Sentinel (Cover), Aug 19, 1984 and leased more than 10 buildings in Boulder Creek for housing students and warehousing for Light Force,\\"Spirulina – Miracle Pill or Mind Pill? \\" – The Press Democrat, September 24, 1981, p. 11 a burgeoning nutritional products brand based on spirulina. From this base in California, Hills extended his hospitality to a pantheon of visiting scientists, writers, philosophers and scholars such as Alan Watts, Edgar Mitchell, Barbara Marx Hubbard, Allen Ginsberg, Thelma Moss, Hiroshi Motoyama, Haridas Chaudhuri, Sri Lanka president Ranasinghe Premadasa, Menninger Foundation's Swami Rama, Dr. Evarts G. Loomis, Viktoras Kulvinskas, Max Lüscher, Marcia Moore, Bernard Jensen and countless others in the fields of human potential, holistic health, aquaculture, religion, quantum physics and alternative medicine.  Supersensonics  Within the campus, Hills founded an experimental laboratory, managed by physicist Dr. Robert Massy,\\"Revealing Look Into World Of Luminous Revelations\\", The Times, San Mateo, September 22, 1977 to develop his theories on the Electro Vibratory Body – documenting what Hills' colleague Stanford University's William A. Tiller Ph.D, calls \\"subtle energies\\" or \\"psychoenergetics\\". Shortly before he died radionics pioneer George de la Warr donated a substantial portion of his research files, library and instruments to Christopher Hills. In 1975 Hills wrote the book Supersensonics: The Science of Radiational Paraphysics, widely considered \\"The Bible of dowsing\\"Supersenonics: The Science of Radiational Paraphysics, 0-916438-18-X (1975) The book sheds new light on divining, telepathy, The I Ching, Egypt's Pyramids, Biblical miracles and discusses the value of low level extrasensory phenomena vs higher levels of insight, wisdom and consciousness. New Age Journal magazine called Supersensonics \\"A short course in miracles for scientist and seeker alike.\\"New Age Journal, July/August, 1976  International philanthropy  With the Cold War in full swing liberation from the evils of totalitarianism was a constant theme in Hills writings. He lobbied hard against the KGB's persecution of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and the internal exile with police surveillance of Andrei Sakharov and the denial of an exit visa for Natan Sharansky's emigration to Israel.Award presented to Christopher Hills for his humanitarian services during the Soviet–Afghan War Christopher Hills' lifelong crusade against dictatorships and Man's inhumanity was manifested in the book Rise of the Phoenix while his passionate beliefs against deficit spending were set forth in a book on the global economy—The Golden Egg.The Golden Egg – 0-916438-32-5 (1979) A recurring theme throughout all Christopher Hills' approaches to world, local and family problems was a process he developed called \\"Creative Conflict\\"—the same principles of solving differences between individuals, political parties and even nations that Hills had debated with Adlai Stevenson, Nehru and Luis Kutner. Throughout the seventies and eighties Hills focused on international affairs, particularly the emergence of democracy in the Soviet Republics, eventually traveling to Russia to meet with Mikhail Gorbachev where he joined the Soviet Peace Committee. U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush bestowed awards on Hills for his commitment to democratic freedom and his humanitarian support for victims of oppression. The Christopher Hills Foundation donated more than $9 million worth of spirulina products to charitable organizations in the U.S. and abroad. When the Soviet Union had occupied Afghanistan, Hills learned from his friends in Peshawar that Afghan freedom fighter Ahmad Shah Masoud's mujahadeen troops as well as Tajik and Pashtun tribals were starving because supply routes had been cut by Russian forces. Hills donated and shipped $300,000 worth of spirulina, which was packed in by mules with help from Senator Charlie Wilson to sustain the Afghans.Hills received a Humanitarian Award from the Afghan National Islamic Council, 1985 In 1989 Sri Lanka president Ranasinghe Premadasa, struggling to find a formula to end the Sri Lankan Civil War, traveled to Boulder Creek to meet with Hills and learn more about his conflict resolution concepts. The two men shared a spiritual connection and established a close friendship. Premadasa then brought the Ceylon conflict closer to a democratic solution than any other Sri Lankan president had. However, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam hierarchy had split and in 1993 a faction assassinated Premadasa in a suicide bombing that killed 23 people. Spirulina: food from sunlight Hills and Nakamura had a vision of feeding the world from lakes, seas and backyard aquaculture and in 1975 they authored a book, Food from Sunlight which published all their proprietary research as open source for the world to use in the cause against global famine and malnutrition. Their company, Microalgae International, invested in research and technology to find a super food for solving World Hunger. Early research focused on chlorella but its cellular structure was too small to be collected without expensive centrifuges. However, in 1967, while Dr Nakamura was living at Centre House, they discovered that women at Lake Chad were harvesting an algae in baskets to make dihé, a highly nutritious sun-baked biscuit. After studying the lakes of Africa, Hills and Dr Nakamura developed seed culture for a strain of 70% protein algae called spirulina that they had collected from Lake Aranguachi in Ethiopia. Later, in 1981, Dr Hills made an expedition to Lake Chiltu at the invitation of Mr. Wollie Chekal, Minister of Trade for the Ethiopian Revolutionary Government and brought back a new set of spirulina samples to his California laboratory for hybridizing an optimal strain for commercial cultivation. For millennia spirulina had been a food staple for natives of Lake Chad and also for the Aztecs but Hills funded much of the early experimentation needed for its successful modern day mass cultivation, described in Dr Nakamura's book Spirulina: Food for a Hungry World.Spirulina - Food for a Hungry World, 0-916438-47-3 To manufacture spirulina nutritional products Hills started the Light Force company in Santa Cruz, California, which was one of the early models for multi-level marketing. Customers began reporting weight loss and health benefits from spirulina and the success story was featured in The National Enquirer.\\"Doctors Praise Safe Diet Pill\\" – National Enquirer (Cover), June 2, 1981, p. 23 Sales skyrocketed into the millions of dollars propelling Light Force to 50,000 distributors worldwide. To grow that much spirulina Hills formed joint ventures with Koor Foods in Eilat, Israel,Hills-Koor Red Sea Negev Algae Partnership - How to Feed the Hungry, 1981 Taiwan Aqua in Taipei and Sosa Texcoco at Lake Texcoco in Mexico. Hills also had an association with Cyanotech on the Big Island of Hawaii which grew a very pure Pacifica brand of spirulina. By 1995 more than 5,000 tons of spirulina a year were being imported for Light Force products. To encourage domestic research and production Hills purchased a 150-acre farm and built raceway ponds filled from the land's own natural geothermal aquifer in Desert Hot Springs, California. Professor Nakamura's student and protégé Dr Kotaro Kawaguchi relocated from Japan as chief research scientist and working with Sebastian Thomas, an algae cultivation expert from India, they refined desert- grown spirulina into consumable powder using the world's first solar heated dryer. While a staff of 40 ran the Southern California \\"Green Gold Farms,\\" harvesting its own U.S.-grown spirulina for Light Force, Hills built a home/laboratory on a mountain in the redwoods of Boulder Creek, California, dedicated to researching neutraceuticals and as a gathering place for scientists, innovators and spiritual \\"map makers\\". Three years after moving to the new home Norah Hills died from Alzheimers eliciting an outpouring of affection from the many who had seen her as the \\"divine mother\\" and a significant force in all that Christopher Hills had achieved.  Santa Cruz sanctuary  At the property he built a Hollywood quality video production studio to produce films on Enlightenment and, through new media, to inspire people to celebrate what he called the \\"Divine Goddess\\".The Visionary State - 0-811848-35-3 (2006) The studio is run today by his second wife, artist/producer Penny Slinger Hills. In 1996, after three decades of globetrotting, Hills visited Vietnam to invest in a naturally carbonated underground spring water venture. He contracted an obscure virus which caused a deterioration of his health. Light Force and the research company Biogenics were sold to Royal Body Care which continued to market the products. Christopher Hills died at home January 31, 1997 leaving his wife Penny Slinger Hills, two sons, John Hills and Anthony Hills and four grandchildren. He believed that \\"Algae biomass was God's way of providing an inexhaustible source of energy from the sun\\". Today millions of health conscious people enjoy the health benefits of spirulina in myriad products worldwide.

Biography  Vasyl Barka's family had a Cossack origin. In 1927 Vasyl graduated from Lubny Pedagogical College, then worked as a teacher in a mining village in Donbass. There he did not get along with the local authorities, and went to the North Caucasus. In 1928 he entered the Philology faculty of Krasnodar Pedagogical Institute, worked at Krasnodar Art Museum. Supported by Pavlo Tychyna Barka first appeared in press in 1929. The publication of his first book of poems (1930) provoked much ideological criticism, accusations of \\"bourgeois nationalism\\" and \\"religious carry-overs\\". Vasyl exchanged from Krasnodar Institute into the postgraduate school of the Moscow Pedagogical Institute, wrote his thesis on the realistic and the fantastic in the Divine Comedy by Dante, and presented the thesis in 1940. He has lectured at the Philology faculty at Rostov University. In 1941, after Great Patriotic War outbroke, Vasyl Barka volunteered, in 1942 he was badly injured, was caught in occupation. After recovery, he worked as a proofreader in a newspaper. In 1943 he was sent to Germany.http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3153662.Vasyl_Barka Since then, he lived in Germany, where he was active in the MUR literary association. In 1947 he moved to France, then, in 1950 to the United States. There he worked at radio Liberty. Sometimes he was starving, and had to take any job - he used to work as fireman, window cleaner etc.  Works  Vasyl Barka was close to the New York group of Ukrainian poets. Barka's orphic works require intuitive rather than logical comprehension. His poetry developed and grew in stature, from the early lyrical collections to the monumental 4,000-strophe epic novel in verse \\"Svidok dlia sontsia shestykrylykh\\" (The Witness for the Sun of Seraphims, 1981), addressed to the theme of reconciliation between 'man and the Creator.' His first novel, \\"Rai\\" (Paradise, 1953), deals with the Soviet 'paradise.'

The headquarters is located in Columbia, Missouri in the Missouri State Teachers Association Building, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The headquarters of MSTA in Columbia, Missouri History On May 23, 1856, 110 men and women from 22 Missouri counties met in Wyman's Hall St. Louis, Missouri in St. Louis to form an organization that would “unite the different members, advancing their mutual improvement, and elevating the profession to its just intellectual and moral influence on the community.” The individuals at that St. Louis meeting became the founders of the Missouri State Teachers Association, a professional association for Missouri educators. To quote the first constitution, the group's purpose was “to promote the sacred interests of education by uniting the different members advancing their mutual improvement, and elevating the profession to its just intellectual and moral influence on the community.” Membership was open to teachers and others actively engaged in promoting the interests of education. Two significant events occurred in 1857. First, an agent was employed to represent the organization; this position became known as executive secretary in 1915 and was later changed to executive director. Second, a publication called The Missouri Journal for Education was printed and distributed. It was changed to The Missouri Educator for a few years. These publications were the forerunners of School and Community magazine, which became a monthly periodical in 1920 and is still published quarterly today. MSTA found its political voice quickly by successfully lobbying the 1870 Missouri legislature to approve funds for teacher colleges in Kirksville and Warrensburg. MSTA initiated the Reading Circle program in 1892 to encourage students of all ages to read. Since its founding, MSTA has been involved with nearly every piece of significant education legislation in Missouri. In fact, many times, the original legislation was drafted at MSTA headquarters. MSTA helped pass a teacher retirement system first in St. Louis in 1943 and then statewide in 1945. In 1991, MSTA participated in a lawsuit challenging equity in the Foundation Formula. The association supported the 1993 Outstanding Schools Act, which included a new foundation formula, funding increase and required minimum salary for teachers with a master's and 10 years of service. The association was divided into four auxiliary associations in 1878 and eight territorial divisions in 1917. Today, MSTA encompasses 10 regions. Each region has a governing body and elects members to the state Executive Board. Representation is proportional to membership. 1900 was the year that the organization became incorporated and underwent a name change to become known as the Missouri State Teachers Association. This began our existence as a corporate body, and we continue to maintain a not-for-profit status today. MSTA has had many important successes in the Missouri Legislature. Victories include a minimum school term, compulsory school attendance, state board of education, child labor laws, free textbooks, school consolidation, equal educational opportunities for all children, transportation for students, the teacher retirement system, school bus safety laws, the school foundation program, a code of professional ethics, and a revised Missouri Constitution that included sections on education and taxation, especially school levies. In its efforts to protect the interests of education and educators through the years, MSTA has also participated in many court cases. Suits were initiated concerning diversion of state taxes, reduction of state school funds, securing a share of insurance fines, the governor's veto of school appropriations, discipline of students by teachers, constitutionality of a majority vote, and constitutionality of the state cigarette tax. More recently MSTA participated in suits relating to the equality of a revised foundation formula, collection of retirement contributions on fringe benefits, and funding cuts of state school appropriations. The headquarters building was built in 1927 in Columbia and has the distinction of being the first building built by and for a state teachers' organization in the United States.http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps- nr/80002311.pdf It resembles an English manor house with steep gables, skylights, wooden paneling, leaded glass windows, and carved fireplaces and entry way. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Members are welcome there whenever they visit Columbia. The headquarters staff began to grow in 1938 with the addition of an assistant secretary. This growth continued, and today the staff consists of 27 professionals and 25 support staff at headquarters and in our regional offices located throughout the state. Until 1972 MSTA was a part of the National Education Association — in fact, they were one of its founding organizations. Two major factors — basic differences in philosophy and NEA's unification policy — contributed to the disaffiliation with NEA. NEA's insistence that CTAs, MSTA districts, and the state organization unify with NEA into one dues- structured organization led the Assembly of Delegates to vote in 1972 to remain independent so that every Missouri educator would have the choice of whether or not to join a professional association instead of a union. Other MSTA victories include: * 1982: MSTA successfully campaigned for Proposition C, which significantly increased funding for Missouri schools. * 1985: Excellence in Education Act passed, including a provision for minimum teacher salaries. * 1995: \\"25 and Out\\" becomes a retirement option. * 2003: MSTA's teacher certification bill passes, replacing the old three-tiered system with a simplified two-tier system. * 2004: MSTA joins a coalition that challenges equity and adequacy in the foundation formula, resulting in a new formula in 2005 and a boost in the minimum teacher salary. More than a century and a half later after its founding, MSTA has grown to be Missouri's largest teacher association. With more than 45,000 members, MSTA is also one of the largest independent teacher associations in the United States.

It was invented in France in 1783–84 and popular for some decades. The sitter climbed into a wooden frame (1.75m high x .65m wide), sat and turned to the side to pose. A pantograph connected to a pencil produced within a few minutes a \\"grand trait\\", a contour line on a piece of paper. With the help of a second scaling down pantograph, the basic features of the portrait were transferred from this sheet in the form of dotted lines to a copper plate which had previously been prepared with a ground for etching. One week later the sitter received an etched plate and twelve little prints.Physionotraces: galerie de portraits, de la Révolution à l’Empire Not only this device, but also the aquatint prints, are called physionotraces. History Quenedey's drawing of the tool In 1783–84 a Frenchman named Gilles-Louis Chrétien invented the \\"physionotrace\\" to aid in the production of silhouette portraits which became popular during the reign of Louis XVI. Within a few minutes a \\"grand trait\\" was produced . This life- size drawing was completed by an artist. Chrétien's device used the mechanics of the pantograph to transmit the tracing (via an eyepiece) of the subject's profile silhouette to an engraving needle. Thus it enabled the production of multiple portrait copies.Cromer \\"Le secret du physoniotrace\\" Bulletin de la société archéologique, historique et artistique, \\"Le Vieux Papier\\", 26th year, October 1925 Chrétien's first partner, Edme Quenedey, made a drawing of the instrument in 1788, which now sits in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. When Quenedey started his own business in Germany, Chrétien cooperated with the artist Jean-Baptiste Fouquet, and Jean Simon Fournier. Chrétien's workshop was taken over by Edme Bouchardy. In 1802, John Isaac Hawkins, who was born in England in 1772 and who lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, patented the second official physiognotrace, and partnered with Charles Willson Peale to market it to prospective buyers. John Hawkins's machine differed from Chrétien's in that it traced around the actual face with a small bar connected to a pantograph that reduced the silhouette to less than two inches. At that time, many versions of these instruments were being used all over the East Coast in the United States, some of which predated Hawkins's, and which were capable of quickly making machine-made profiles.http://206.180.235.133/jaic/articles/jaic41-03-001_5.html > By 1802, in response to the popularity of silhouettes, which were invented > in the late eighteenth century, Peale introduced the British inventor John > Hawkins’s (1772–1855) physiognotrace at his museum in Philadelphia. While > the operator traced the sitter’s head, the mechanism impressed the image > onto a piece of paper that was often folded to produce multiple portraits. > The operator then cut away the center of the paper, leaving a “hollow cut” > image. These silhouettes, or profiles as they were also called, could be > kept loose, framed, or compiled in albums; a black or blue piece of paper or > fabric placed behind the image provided contrast. Peale sent the watercolor sketch of this instrument to Thomas Jefferson, along with a detailed explanation. The drawing now sits with the Jefferson Papers in the Library of Congress. In April 1805, Mr. Peale wrote his friend, Dr. William Thornton to request a certified copy of a patent of a physiognotrace that was issued to John J. Hawkins. Peale, who had an interest in the instrument and who kept the original in his museum, \\"needed the certified copy to bring suit against a person who was making the device without authority. John J. Hawkins had been in England, where he sold patent rights to the polygraph (duplicating device) and drawing machine for 1,600 guineas. Mr. Peale also wrote to Dr. Thornton in May 1805 to record an assignment of the Hawkins invention to Mr. Peale for the City of Philadelphia.\\" James Sharples, an itinerant British portrait artist, who also lived for a time in Philadelphia, used a physiognotrace to draw profiles of such famous subjects as George Washington and Dolly and James Madison.

Accessed 2009-08-28 Work Eichinger defines his work as narrative sculpture: \\"I am a narrative artist. The language I use is form and anatomy, but what I try to sculpt is romantic, emotional, and perhaps mythic art.\\" Eichinger's works are typically grouped into themes. Eichinger produces sculptures in bronze. His themes explore different aspects of human life. His works are produced in series and thematically grouped: Duet, Dream, Exotic Women, Goddess, Post Modern, and Passage. In the Duet Series he examines the nature of loving, committed relationships. The Passage Series deals with transcendence, the ability and strength to move beyond difficult times. The stories depicted in each of these sculptures are more than simple narratives: they contain opinions and lead to conclusions.\\" Eichinger chooses his themes as such because he \\"want[s his] sculptures to be mythological in that they speak to others who, like [him], are formulating new values and are looking for a new sense of meaning in art and in life.\\" Eichinger's most significant commission in recent years was the Stations of the Cross at Cloisters on the Platte. This project included a team of sculptors who created about 90 figures averaging 7' tall. The magnitude of this commission has been compared to the Sistine Chapel. Participating sculptors included: Martin Eichinger, George Lundeen , Mark Lundeen, Bets Lundeen, Lynn Kircher , Jay Warren , Anne LaRose , Joey Bainer , Rob Arps , Dee Clements and a long list of assistants.
