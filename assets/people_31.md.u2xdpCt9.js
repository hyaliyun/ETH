The parish includes the hamlet of Stoney Stratton and the village of Chesterblade. History The village was recorded as Evrecriz in the Domesday Book of 1086. Small Down Knoll, (or Small Down Camp), is a Bronze Age hill fort above the village which rises to . The parish was part of the hundred of Wells Forum. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village falls in 'Creech' electoral ward. The area and population of this ward is described above. It is also part of the Somerton & Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Landmarks Evercreech has two pubs within it, The Bell Inn and the \\"Pickled Inn\\". The Pecking Mill is within a very short distance to the south. Historically, one of the local pubs, The Brewers Arms, celebrated New Year's Eve with fireworks but greeted faithful locals the very next day, New Years Day 2005, with notice that it had closed forever. Rumours were rife around the reasons for the closure (most likely due to the non- profitability of such a local enterprise) - popularly noting that the real estate value of the site was extremely high. The Shapway Inn, a locals drinking pub, opened in December 2009 after being closed for over 2 years and is now known as The Pickled Inn by new landlords. Cutterne Mill is an old watermill which is now being used for electricity generation as part of the South Somerset Hydropower Group. The market cross dates from the 15th century. It stands on four steps and a high shaft. In the 19th century the cruciform head was restored. It is a Grade II* listed building and has been scheduled as an ancient monument. Industry Historic industries in Evercreech include quarrying of blue lias and clay; brick making; milk processing; and agriculture, which remains the leading industry today. From the late 18th century until just after WW1, silk processing was an important industry for Evercreech, a spillover from mills at nearby Bruton and Sherborne. The workforce for the village's three silk factories was made up almost entirely of young women and girls, some of whom started working as young as seven or eight years of age. Fulfilling orders from London, two of the factories were throwing mills which produced high quality spun silk thread. The third mill wove silk thread into cloth. Bales of raw silk were imported to the mills from France, Italy, and India by London merchants . Employment in the mills was erratic, driven by highly volatile demand for English woven silk. This volatility, in turn was caused by embargoes on imported woven silk, duty taxes, and then the lifting of import restrictions in 1860. Transport Evercreech Junction was a railway station on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It was replaced by Evercreech New railway station from 1874 to 1966, when it closed. Nowadays, the nearest railway stations to Evercreech are in Bruton and Castle Cary. Religious sites Market Cross The Church of St Peter dates from the 14th century and is a Grade I listed building. The three- stage tower has set-back buttresses ascending to pinnacles, with a very tall transomed two-light bell-chamber with windows on each face The embattled parapet has quatrefoil piercing, with big corner pinnacles and smaller intermediate pinnacles. The four-light west window has extensively restored tracery. This tower is of the East Mendip type. On the north wall of the tower is a roll of honour to victims of World War I. It is within a rectangular wooden case with a glazed door crowned by a triangular pediment and plaque below. The church's clock features an unusual mistake as it is missing the 10th hour number, usually shown as the roman numeral 'X'. The roman numeral at the 10th hour placement is XI (11) and it is followed by the roman numeral for twelve (XII). The numbers of the last quarter read IX (9) - XI (11) - XII (12) - XII (12). Local rumour suggests that the person who paid for the clock to be made, was instructed by his wife that he had to be home from the pub by 10 o'clock. Therefore, he ensured that the 10 o'clock numeral (X) was missing. The sounds of the bells at Evercreech church were used in the opening credits of BBC's Songs of Praise for many years. At Chesterblade the tiny Church of St Mary dates from the 12th century.

It is now a division of Syngenta. Company history Northrup, King and Co. was founded in 1884 as Northrup, Braslan and Company. Its founders, Jesse E. Northrup and Charles E. Braslan, moved to Minneapolis from the Eastern United States. They chose Minneapolis because they believed seeds grown in the North were resilient and productive, and because they viewed Minneapolis as an ideal distribution center. They published their first illustrated seed catalog in 1885. It used striking full-color lithographs that made a strong impression. During the 1880s, Northrup and Braslan expanded their business but soon experienced trouble. In 1887, Northrup and Braslan invited A.H. Goodwin to partner with them. The men renamed the business Northrup, Braslan and Goodwin Company and expanded its reach; but, after the economic Panic of 1893 and a fire in the company building, the business could not pay back its debts. In 1894, they sought relief from Colonel William S. King and his son Preston. The Kings' assistance was not enough, however, and in May 1896, Northrup, Braslan and Goodwin Co. went bankrupt. Six months later, in November 1896, the men incorporated a new business: Northrup, King and Co.One Hundred Years of Trust, 1884-1984. Minneapolis, MN: Northrup King Co., 1984. Northrup, King and Co. struggled for several years but had success by 1900. Its mail-order business peaked in 1909, and the company began to send salesmen to retailers across the state. The company continued selling seeds for garden use but also began to sell field seed for farming. The cold Minnesota weather was a major selling point for Northrup, King and Co. The company created its Polar Brand to emphasize the virtues of Northern-grown seed. Northrup, King and Co. later developed other cold-weather brands called Sterling, Northland, and Viking. These brands differed in price and quality, and were targeted to different audiences. This made Northrup, King and Co. one of the first seed companies to use branding as a marketing technique. Corn hybrids became a major part of the company's business in the 1930s. In 1938, Northrup, King and Co. partnered with the University of Minnesota to test the company's hybrid corn varieties at Femco Farms in the Red River Valley. Their hybrids were bred to have the best traits of different genetic strains. They were also very profitable, because the hybrid breeding process meant that the hybrids were intellectually protected even without patents. In the 1960s, Northrup, King and Co. vice president Allenby White fought for patent protection for agricultural crops that were more difficult to hybridize. This expanded protection was initially rejected by the United States Congress but passed in 1970. It helped companies including Northrup, King and Co. but hurt horticulturists and small farmers.Doyle, Jack. Altered Harvest: Agriculture, Genetics, and the Fate of the World's Food Supply. New York: Viking Press, 1985. In 1968, Northrup, King and Co. offered its first public stock shares. The company grew rapidly after it went public, but in 1975 it saw significant losses. The next year, the company was purchased by a Swiss pharmaceutical company called Sandoz, Ltd. Sandoz bought the company for more than twice its book value, renamed it Northrup King, and invested heavily in research. Sandoz, Ltd. went through several corporate mergers and reorganizations in the 1990s. In 1997, Northrup King became a subsidiary of Syngenta, where it became known as the NK brand. Minneapolis headquarters Northrup-King's former Jackson Street facility, now home to art studios and art galleries. In 1917, Northrup, King and Co. built a new headquarters in Minneapolis at 1500 Jackson Street Northeast. The company kept a retail store on Hennepin Avenue, but its new location was ideal for distributing seed. It was located where the Great Northern and Northern Pacific railroads came together. In 1986, Northrup King moved out of its Jackson Street building. In 1996, Debbie Woodward began managing the old Northrup King building. Under her management, it became home to art studios, art galleries, and nonprofit organizations.Gihring, Tim, and Gregory J.

In those years Klim was lighter (ca. 90 kg) and physically weaker than elite Soviet throwers, but he had a strong mental balance and a superior throwing technique; he added weight only after joining the national team. The 1964 Olympics were his first international competitions. After three attempts he was third behind Gyula Zsiv√≥tzky and world record holder Hal Connolly, but then threw and won a surprising gold medal. After that Klim won the 1966 European Championships, the European Cup in 1965 and 1967, and three Soviet Championships (1966‚Äì1968).

History Near the village are the sites of the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village, and the now drained Meare Pool. During the Second World War, Godney was incorporated into the GHQ Line. Several pillboxes were constructed in the area. Natural obstacles to tanks were supplemented with an anti-tank ditch and bridges in the area were prepared for demolition at short notice.Foot, 2006, pp 275-279. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wells Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography River Sheppey in Upper Godney, facing east. To the north west of the village are the Westhay Moor and Somerset Levels National Nature Reserves. Westhay Moor is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and part of the Somerset Levels and Moors Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive and as a Ramsar site, and a national nature reserve. It is part of the Brue Valley Living Landscape conservation project. Along with the rest of South West England, Godney has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

It features Tatoosh Peak, a member of the Tatoosh Range. History Tatoosh means \\"breast\\" in the Chinook Jargon, in reference to the two large rock outcrops on the south face of Butter Peak. The Tatoosh Range was used historically by Taidnapam (Upper Cowlitz) Indians. In mid-to-late August, Taidnapam families would climb up the ridge from fishing camps at the confluence of the Muddy Fork and Clear Fork Cowlitz Rivers, to hunt, gather materials for making baskets, and pick huckleberries for drying. The dried berries were transported to home villages for eating during the winter months. Archaeological evidence suggests that these high country treks were a long tradition among the local Indian people. In 1932, a fire lookout was built.

Madla died in a house fire in the early morning hours on the Friday after Thanksgiving Day in 2006. Political career Madla was initially elected to the lower house of the Texas legislature in a San Antonio-based district in 1972. He served for twenty years in the House until he was elected to the District 24, later District 19, state Senate seat, which is geographically large and stretches from San Antonio to as far west as El Paso. (In Texas, state Senate districts are geographically and demographically larger than United States House of Representatives districts.) In 1985, Texas Monthly, in its biennial feature on the best and worst Texas legislators named Madla to the \\"Honorable Mention\\" category, as one of the top twenty legislators for that session. 2006 Democratic primary Madla had maintained his Senate seat without opposition until successfully challenged in the Democratic primary held in March 2006 by the District 118 state representative, Carlos I. \\"Charlie\\" Uresti. Uresti, a San Antonio attorney, prevailed with 56.5 percent of the vote to Madla's 43.5 percent. Carla Vela, the then Bexar County Democratic Party chairman, said that issues were less important in the Madla-Uresti race than an ongoing intraparty power struggle involving the political families who control the Southside section of San Antonio. Shortly after his primary defeat, Madla announced that he would resign his Senate seat early, effective May 31, 2006. Personal life Madla was born in just outside San Antonio in Helotes to Frank L. Madla, Sr., and the former Epigmenia Alcala. Madla attended St. Mary's University and graduated with a B.A. in Government in 1959, and in 1963, an M.A. in Government. Madla was married in 1961, and he and wife Rosemary had a son, Frank L. Madla, III. Madla was remarried in 1977 to the former Helen Cruz (born June 2, 1954), and had a daughter, Marci Morgan Madla. Madla was a junior high school teacher for ten years before he entered politics. At various times he worked as an insurance and real estate broker, and an instructor at University of the Incarnate Word. Death Madla, along with Mary Cruz, his 81-year-old mother-in-law, and Aleena, his five-year-old granddaughter, died in a house fire. Madla had been asleep in his home upstairs and had tried to escape through the bedroom window. Burglar bars on the windows trapped him, and he succumbed to smoke and flames. His granddaughter was initially thought to have survived, but was declared without brain function and died after being removed from life support a day later. Madla's wife Helen survived the blaze but was hospitalized for a time afterward. Madla's home had no smoke detectors. U.S. President George W. Bush issued his condolences to the Madla family and promised to pray for Helen Madla's full recovery: \\"Frank was a dedicated public servant who devoted more than three decades of his life to serving his state and all its people in the Texas House and Senate.\\" Texas Governor Rick Perry ordered state flags to be flown at half-staff in Madla's honor on November 30, the day of Madla's funeral, and 1 December, the date of his interment in the Texas State Cemetery. Perry issued this tribute: \\"Frank Madla was a dear friend and a dedicated public servant who was an exemplary representative for South and West Texas. Frank was a mentor to me when I came in to the legislature. He had a heart of gold and was a true Texas patriot. He and his wife, Helen, were two of Anita's [First Lady Anita Thigpen Perry] and my favorites. His death is a tragic loss to the community, to his friends and to his family. Anita and I offer our prayers on behalf of his wife Helen for her continued recovery.\\" Legacy Madla grave at Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas In January 2006, the former Royalgate Elementary School in the South San Antonio Independent School District was renamed Frank Madla Elementary School. Madla described the renaming as the \\"single best honor\\" to him ever. VIA Metropolitan Transit named its Madla Transit Center in his honor.

Carson, Wigtown Bay completed her fitting-out and sea trials on 19 January 1946. In February she sailed to Malta, joining the 5th Escort Flotilla, and was deployed for patrol duty in the Mediterranean Sea. In May 1946 the flotilla patrolled the eastern Mediterranean to intercept ships carrying illegal immigrants to Palestine. 1947-1958 In April 1947 Wigtown Bay returned to HMNB Devonport, and was decommissioned in May. Laid-up in reserve she was used as an accommodation ship for Reserve Fleet personnel, but was refitted in 1948 and 1951 to ensure that her operational availability was maintained.

Muscle hypertrophy involves an increase in size of skeletal muscle through a growth in size of its component cells. Two factors contribute to hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased muscle glycogen storage; and myofibrillar hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased myofibril size. Hypertrophy stimulation A range of stimuli can increase the volume of muscle cells. These changes occur as an adaptive response that serves to increase the ability to generate force or resist fatigue in anaerobic conditions. Strength training Strength training (resistance training) causes neural and muscular _adaptations_ which increase the capacity of an athlete to exert force through voluntary muscular contraction: After an initial period of neuro-muscular adaptation, the muscle tissue expands by creating sarcomeres (contractile elements) and increasing non-contractile elements like sarcoplasmic fluid. Muscular hypertrophy can be induced by progressive overload (a strategy of progressively increasing resistance or repetitions over successive bouts of exercise in order to maintain a high level of effort). However, the precise mechanisms are not clearly understood; currently accepted hypotheses involve some combination of mechanical tension, metabolic fatigue, and muscular damage. Muscular hypertrophy plays an important role in competitive bodybuilding and strength sports like powerlifting, football and Olympic weightlifting. Anaerobic training The best approach to specifically achieve muscle growth remains controversial (as opposed to focusing on gaining strength, power, or endurance); it was generally considered that consistent anaerobic strength training will produce hypertrophy over the long term, in addition to its effects on muscular strength and endurance. Muscular hypertrophy can be increased through strength training and other short-duration, high-intensity anaerobic exercises. Lower- intensity, longer-duration aerobic exercise generally does not result in very effective tissue hypertrophy; instead, endurance athletes enhance storage of fats and carbohydrates within the muscles, as well as neovascularization. Temporary swelling During a workout, increased blood flow to metabolically active areas causes muscles to temporarily increase in size, also known as being \\"pumped up\\" or getting \\"a pump\\". About two hours after a workout and typically for seven to eleven days, muscles swell due to an inflammation response as tissue damage is repaired. Longer-term hypertrophy occurs due to more permanent changes in muscle structure. Factors affecting hypertrophy Biological factors (such as DNA and sex), nutrition, and training variables can affect muscle hypertrophy. Individual differences in genetics account for a substantial portion of the variance in existing muscle mass. A classical twin study design (similar to those of behavioral genetics) estimated that about 53% of the variance in lean body mass is heritable,Arden, N. K. and Spector, T. D. (1997), Genetic Influences on Muscle Strength, Lean Body Mass, and Bone Mineral Density: A Twin Study. J Bone Miner Res, 12: 2076-2081. doi:10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.12.2076 along with about 45% of the variance in muscle fiber proportion. During puberty in males, hypertrophy occurs at an increased rate. Natural hypertrophy normally stops at full growth in the late teens. As testosterone is one of the body's major growth hormones, on average, males find hypertrophy much easier (on an absolute scale) to achieve than females and on average, have about 60% more muscle mass than women. Taking additional testosterone, as in anabolic steroids, will increase results. It is also considered a performance-enhancing drug, the use of which can cause competitors to be suspended or banned from competitions. Testosterone is also a medically regulated substance in most countries, making it illegal to possess without a medical prescription. Anabolic steroid use can cause testicular atrophy, cardiac arrest, and gynecomastia. A positive energy balance, when more calories are consumed rather than burned, is required for anabolism and therefore muscle hypertrophy. An increased requirement for protein, especially branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), is required for elevated protein synthesis that is seen in athletes training for muscle hypertrophy. Training variables, in the context of strength training, such as frequency, intensity, and total volume also directly affect the increase of muscle hypertrophy. A gradual increase in all of these training variables will yield the muscular hypertrophy. Changes in protein synthesis and muscle cell biology associated with stimuli Protein synthesis The message filters down to alter the pattern of gene expression. The additional contractile proteins appear to be incorporated into existing myofibrils (the chains of sarcomeres within a muscle cell). There appears to be some limit to how large a myofibril can become: at some point, they split. These events appear to occur within each muscle fiber. That is, hypertrophy results primarily from the growth of each muscle cell, rather than an increase in the number of cells. Skeletal muscle cells are however unique in the body in that they can contain multiple nuclei, and the number of nuclei can increase. Cortisol decreases amino acid uptake by muscle tissue, and inhibits protein synthesis. The short-term increase in protein synthesis that occurs subsequent to resistance training returns to normal after approximately 28 hours in adequately fed male youths. Another study determined that muscle protein synthesis was elevated even 72 hours following training. A small study performed on young and elderly found that ingestion of 340 grams of lean beef (90 g protein) did not increase muscle protein synthesis any more than ingestion of 113 grams of lean beef (30 g protein). In both groups, muscle protein synthesis increased by 50%. The study concluded that more than 30 g protein in a single meal did not further enhance the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis in young and elderly. However, this study didn't check protein synthesis in relation to training; therefore conclusions from this research are controversial. A 2018 review of the scientific literature concluded that for the purpose of building lean muscle tissue, a minimum of 1.6 g protein per kilogram of body weight is required, which can for example be divided over 4 meals or snacks and spread out over the day. It is not uncommon for bodybuilders to advise a protein intake as high as 2‚Äì4 g per kilogram of bodyweight per day. However, scientific literature has suggested this is higher than necessary, as protein intakes greater than 1.8 g per kilogram of body weight showed to have no greater effect on muscle hypertrophy. A study carried out by American College of Sports Medicine (2002) put the recommended daily protein intake for athletes at 1.2‚Äì1.8 g per kilogram of body weight. Conversely, Di Pasquale (2008), citing recent studies, recommends a minimum protein intake of 2.2 g/kg \\"for anyone involved in competitive or intense recreational sports who wants to maximize lean body mass but does not wish to gain weight. However athletes involved in strength events (..) may need even more to maximize body composition and athletic performance. In those attempting to minimize body fat and thus maximize body composition, for example in sports with weight classes and in bodybuilding, it's possible that protein may well make up over 50% of their daily caloric intake.\\" Microtrauma Microtrauma, which is tiny damage to the fibers, may play a significant role in muscle growth. When microtrauma occurs (from weight training or other strenuous activities), the body responds by overcompensating, replacing the damaged tissue and adding more, so that the risk of repeat damage is reduced. Damage to these fibers has been theorized as the possible cause for the symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and is why progressive overload is essential to continued improvement, as the body adapts and becomes more resistant to stress. However, work examining the time course of changes in muscle protein synthesis and their relationship to hypertrophy showed that damage was unrelated to hypertrophy. In fact, in that study the authors showed that it was not until the damage subsided that protein synthesis was directed to muscle growth. Myofibrillar vs. sarcoplasmic hypertrophy In the bodybuilding and fitness community and even in some academic books skeletal muscle hypertrophy is described as being in one of two types: Sarcoplasmic or myofibrillar. According to this hypothesis, during sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, the volume of sarcoplasmic fluid in the muscle cell increases with no accompanying increase in muscular strength, whereas during myofibrillar hypertrophy, actin and myosin contractile proteins increase in number and add to muscular strength as well as a small increase in the size of the muscle. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is greater in the muscles of bodybuilders because studies suggest sarcoplasmic hypertrophy shows a greater increase in muscle size while myofibrillar hypertrophy proves to increase overall muscular strength making it more dominant in Olympic weightlifters. These two forms of adaptations rarely occur completely independently of one another; one can experience a large increase in fluid with a slight increase in proteins, a large increase in proteins with a small increase in fluid, or a relatively balanced combination of the two. In sports Examples of increased muscle hypertrophy are seen in various professional sports, mainly strength related sports such as boxing, olympic weightlifting, mixed martial arts, rugby, professional wrestling and various forms of gymnastics. Athletes in other more skill-based sports such as basketball, baseball, ice hockey, and soccer may also train for increased muscle hypertrophy to better suit their position of play. For example, a center (basketball) may want to be bigger and more muscular to better overpower his or her opponents in the low post. Athletes training for these sports train extensively not only in strength but also in cardiovascular and muscular endurance training.

The order was cancelled in December 1943 and the ship was re-ordered as a Bay-class frigate from Charles Hill & Sons of Bristol in 1944. She was laid down on 21 September 1944 as Job No. J601 (Yard No. 301) and launched by Mrs A.V. Alexander, wife of the 1st Lord of the Admiralty on 3 March 1945. Royal Navy service Commissioned for service on 20 September 1945, Burghead Bay carried out sea trials in October, and was deployed in November to the Plymouth Local Flotilla, where she stayed until the end of 1952, carrying out exercises, search and rescue in the Channel, and sea training. In 1948 her pennant number was changed to F622. In January 1952 Burghead Bay sailed via La Plata and Montevideo to the Falkland Islands for guard ship duty, making calls to the South Orkney Islands, Graham Land, the South Shetland Islands and South Georgia carrying out survey work. In February, she was involved in the Hope Bay incident in Antarctica. In April she was relieved by sister ship . She then sailed to Bermuda to join the West Indies Squadron, taking part in exercises and patrols, and making port visits around the Caribbean, before returning to the UK in October to refit.

With its historic atmosphere, this city is known for its 15th- and 16th-century ecclesiastic and secular architectural heritage and for the B√°thory family, former landowners. Geography It covers an area of and has a population of 12,259 (2015). History The first written record of the settlement dates from 1279. Its name stems from the Old Turkish word 'batir' or Mongolian 'bator' (originally meaning a 'good hero', and corresponding to 'b√°tor' in modern Hungarian). At that time, the ancestors of the B√°thorys, the Gutkeled clan, already owned the land. The town became the administrative centre of their estates and also the family burial site. The family owned the town until the death of Gabriel B√°thory, Prince of Transylvania in 1613. The town was of great significance in Hungarian history during the 16th century. In 1549, the legates of King Ferdinand I and of Isabella agreed to return Transylvania to the Kingdom of Hungary. During the decades that followed there was a lasting dispute as to whom the town belonged since the local aristocrats were more inclined to recognise the sovereignty of the ruling prince of Transylvania. By the 18th century the town had become impoverished. In the course of the 1872 reorganisation of public administration it lost its city rights that were returned only in 1973. Numerous heritage buildings have remained from the town's heyday. The best known is what is now the Reformed Church. Built between 1488 and 1511, it is one of the most beautiful International Gothic structures in Hungary. The late Renaissance-style belfry next to it is the largest wooden bell tower in the country. Franciscan friars built their friary church around 1480 in a late Gothic style. Its altars and its pulpit are among the most beautifully carved Baroque works in the country. Standing near the church is the building which now houses the Istv√°n B√°thori Museum. Originally a Baroque Minorite friary, it was built on the site of an earlier monastery.

The parish includes the hamlet of Hapsford. History The name Great Elm was recorded as Telma in the Domesday Book of 1086, and then as Teames in 1236 which is a contraction of aet elm at the elm tree. Little Elm developed into the village of Chantry. At Tedbury Camp southwest of the village a pot of Roman coins was dug up in 1961. After the Norman Conquest the manor was held by the Giffards and later by the Hidges family and then the Stracheys. The parish was part of the hundred of Frome. For many years in the 18th and 19th centuries Great Elm was the site of water powered mills owned by James Fussell IV. The Stracheys owned Rock House for a period early in the 20th century. Hapsford House on Hapsford Hill is a 19th- century country house. The Jackdaws Music Education Trust has been based in the village since 1993. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Frome Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Goldstein was born in Conway, South Carolina where his father owned a business, and moved to Manhattan as a child with his family. He graduated from New York University.Goldstein, Richard. \\"Joe Goldstein, Dogged New York Sports Promoter, Dies at 81\\", The New York Times, February 15, 2009. Accessed February 15, 2009. Goldstein's public relations prowess relied on his ability to connect with reporters to create stories for his clients, which included promoting basketball for Madison Square Garden during the 1950s and for Roosevelt Raceway from the mid-1950s until 1969. In 1959, a trotter from France named Jamin was scheduled to run in the inaugural International Trot at Roosevelt Raceway. Goldstein spread the word that the horse's chances were affected by the loss of over 150 pounds of artichokes that had been impounded, and then misplaced, by the United States Department of Agriculture at Idlewild Airport. Goldstein placed ads in The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune that read \\"French Trotter Needs Artichokes. Can You Help?\\", including a phone number of Roosevelt Raceway. Newspapers gave the story extensive play, with locals bring their backyard- grown artichokes to the track and United Airlines flying artichokes in from Watsonville, California, the artichoke capital of America. The horse was energized after eating the artichokes, or so Goldstein said, and went on to win the race in front of a crowd of 45,000. At the 1962 International Trot, a French horse named Kracovie that had won that year's European circuit was missing a stablemate, either a mountain sheep or a goat, that could not be brought into the United States due to quarantine regulations, and would not eat in the absence of its companion.Daley, Robert. \\"French Trotter Here Sans Brigitte; Kracovie Pal Barred From U.S. as Goat in Sheepish Cloak\\", The New York Times, June 29, 1961.

The ship was originally ordered from Henry Robb of Leith in 1943 as the Loch Laxford, and laid down on 14 April 1944 as Admiralty Job No. J11861. However the contract was then changed, and the ship was completed to a revised design as a Bay- class anti-aircraft frigate, and launched on 28 December 1944 as Cardigan Bay, the first Royal Navy ship to carry the name. She was completed on 15 June 1945. Service history Mediterranean Fleet After sea trials, on 18 August 1945 Cardigan Bay joined the Mediterranean Fleet at Malta under the command of Commander Colin Maud. She was deployed in the Aegean Sea and at Haifa to intercept immigrant ships bound for Palestine. In July 1947 she escorted SS President Warfield (renamed Exodus 1947) to Famagusta, Cyprus, after placing a boarding party aboard, and in August escorted the British merchant ships Ocean Vigour, Empire Rival and Runnymede Park to Port-de-Bouc near Marseille, taking the immigrants from Exodus back to France. In early 1948 she intercepted the Liberty ships Pan York and Pan Crescent on passage from the Black Sea to Palestine with illegal immigrants. Cardigan Bay carried out the usual programme of Fleet exercises and visits, also deploying for surveillance operations in the Adriatic Sea following the Corfu Channel Incident, acted as guard ship at Trieste and Aqaba, and performed patrol duties in the Red Sea. In 1948 her pennant number was changed to F630. Eastern Fleet In July 1949, Cardigan Bay and sister ship were transferred to the Eastern Fleet, based at Singapore, arriving there in August, for a series of exercises and patrols off Malaya and China, deploying on the Yangtze Patrol with St Brides Bay and the sloop in November and December. Photograph of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter that was recovered off Hanchon. In October 1950 Cardigan Bay was detached for service with the United Nations as part of British and Commonwealth support for naval operations off Korea, sailing from Hong Kong on 17 November to Sasebo to join the UN Naval Task Group. In December she sailed on her first operational deployment off the west coast of Korea supporting UN personnel at Inchon. She remained there until mid-January 1951, then returned to Sasebo. Released from UN duty, she was deployed at Hong Kong for exercises and guard ship duties until June. She then returned to Sasebo, and began her second Korean tour, patrolling the west coast, supporting the aircraft carrier during coastal bombardments, and preventing movements of enemy shipping. In July she escorted an American LCU to recover wreckage from a Mikoyan MiG-15 fighter aircraft which had crashed in shallow water south-west of Hanchon. Large parts of the aircraft were recovered using the LCUs crane and smaller components by divers, while Glory and the cruiser provided radar and air cover. Further offensive patrols and survey operations in Han River estuary followed until September, when she sailed to Hong Kong to refit. Cardigan Bay resumed service with UN Naval Task Force off Korea in January 1952 for patrol duties and naval gunfire support, until April, then sailed for Sasebo and Hong Kong for repairs and Flotilla exercises. In June she returned to Korea for further patrols and bombardments, and acted as an Air Control Ship during flying operations. Released in September she sailed for Hong Kong to refit. Recommissioned for service in the 4th Frigate Squadron on 28 December, in January 1953 Cardigan Bay sailed on her fifth tour of service with the UN Task Group off Korea. On 7 April she embarked American General Maxwell D. Taylor and the Commander of the Commonwealth Naval Forces Admiral Alan Scott-Moncrieff, and sailed to Ch'o-do Island, close to the mouth of the Taedong River to carry out a shore bombardment. Shortly afterwards Cardigan Bay was involved in a collision with the Dutch frigate , sustaining some damage to her plating. Further damage was sustained when she was hit by the US Navy tug called in to assist. She sailed for Hong Kong in April for exercises and patrols off the west coast of Malaya supporting of operations against insurgents. In July 1953 an armistice was agreed and hostilities in Korea ended. However Cardigan Bay was retained for occasional UN duty on the west coast of Korea into 1955, also taking part in joint exercises with the United States Navy. She spent the rest of the time deployed at Hong Kong and Singapore, patrolling off Malaya, Borneo and Indonesia. She also took part in various joint exercises with the Royal Thai Navy, Indian Navy Royal Australian Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy, and multi- national exercises with SEATO. In early 1958 she visited New Zealand, calling at Wellington and ports in South Island before resuming service with the Fleet at Singapore and Hong Kong, where she remained until November 1960. Cardigan Bay then sailed for Australia, calling at Townsville, Queensland, then Noum√©a, New Caledonia, Suva, Fiji and Apia, Samoa before refuelling at Pearl Harbor on 9 January 1961. She then sailed for San Francisco, and called at San Diego, Manzanillo, Mexico, and Puntarenas, Costa Rica before transiting the Panama Canal on 23 February. She then called at Cartagena, Colombia, Maracaibo, Venezuela, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Bermuda before finally arriving back at Plymouth on 7 April to decommission. Cardigan Bay was put into Reserve on 30 May 1961, and was put on the Disposal List in 1962. She was sold to the BISCO for breaking-up by West of Scotland Shipbreakers at Troon, Ayrshire, where she arrived in tow on 5 March 1962.

It is located just off the A366 between Trowbridge and Radstock. The parish includes the villages of Hardington, Faulkland and Foxcote. History The name of the parish means \\"the settlement of Hemmi's (or Hemma's) people\\". The parishes of Hardington and Hemington were part of the Kilmersdon Hundred, while Foxcote was part of the Wellow Hundred. On the village green in Faulkland and at several other sites throughout the village there are standing stones of unknown origin. Between two of the stones are the 16th or 17th-century village stocks. There are two pubs in the village: The Faulkland Inn, which dates from the early 19th century, and the historic Tuckers Grave which was probably built in the early 18th century and is one of the few remaining 'Parlour' pubs with no bar counter. Foxcote was on the route of the Somerset and Dorset Railway and was the site, on 7 August 1876, of a collision between the Wimborne to Bath train and one travelling from Bath to Radstock. The crash, known as the Radstock rail accident, left 13 people killed and 51 injured. It is just off the route of NCR 24, the Colliers Way, which is named for the Somerset coalfield which included a colliery at Foxcote from 1853 to 1931. In 1896 they were owned by Writhlington, Huish and Foxcote Colliery Co., and by 1908 this had been changed to Writhlington Collieries Co. Ltd. The Upper and Lower Writhlington, Huish & Foxcote were later all merged into one colliery. In the late 19th century a local quarry owner, John Turner of Faulkland, took out a lawsuit against his neighbour Hedworth Jolliffe, 2nd Baron Hylton who owned Ammerdown House in Kilmersdon. When Turner lost he erected a tower of around high to rival the column at Ammerdown, with a dance hall and tea garden at the base. When Turner died in 1894, Lord Hylton bought the structure to demolish it. The base and dance hall were converted into workers cottages and eventually demolished in 1969. Manor of Hardington John VI Bampfield (fl. 14th century), of Poltimore, Devon, married Agnes Pederton, daughter and heiress of John Pederton of Hardington,Collinson, Rev. John, History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset, Vol.3, Bath, 1791, p.338 Somerset, by his wife Cecilia Turney, daughter and heiress of John Turney. By his wife he had two sons, the eldest Sir William Bampfield of Poltimore, the youngest Peter Bampfield of Hardington, Somerset, whose ultimate male descendant was Warwick Bampfield (1623‚Äì1695), of Hardington, whose heir was Sir Coplestone Warwick Bampfylde, 3rd Baronet (c. 1689‚Äì1727) of Poltimore. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Frome Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites Foxcote church, dedicated to St James the Less, dates from the early 18th century and incorporates a 15th-century turret. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The parish Church of St Mary dates from the 12th century and is Grade I listed.

The video is done to resemble one long shot, and uses Gondry's signature usage of special effects. In the black-and-white video, Beck walks into an empty house, tuning a radio to different stations, then sitting down in a chair, where he sings the song. Suddenly, the view of the city skyline outside morphs into a 2-dimensional humanoid figure, and the door morphs into a figure as well.

Its capital was Salzburg, while other towns in the duchy included Zell am See and Gastein.  History  In the course of the German mediatization of 1803, the Prince-archbishopric of Salzburg, an ecclesiastical State of the Holy Roman Empire, was secularized as the Electorate of Salzburg, ruled by the Habsburg archduke Ferdinand III of Austria. However, two years later, this short-lived principality was annexed by the newly established Austrian Empire according to the Peace of Pressburg and Ferdinand received the Grand Duchy of W√ºrzburg in compensation. The electoral title became obsolete with the Empire's dissolution in 1806. By the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn of 1809, Salzburg temporarily became French and was released in 1810 to the Kingdom of Bavaria, where it formed the Salzachkreis. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the 1816 Treaty of Munich, the Salzburg lands came back to Austria, with the exception of the share on the left bank of the Salzach river, the so-called Rupertiwinkel, which, like the former Prince-Provostry of Berchtesgaden, remained in Bavaria. Some smaller areas in the Ziller and Defereggen valleys fell to Tyrol; the town of Friesach was ceded to Carinthia. The Salzburg territory was administered from Linz as Salzburgkreis, the fifth district within the crown land of Upper Austria. The decreased significance led to emigration and economic crises. On the other hand, the remote province developed as a tourist destination, mainly for Alpinists like Archduke John of Austria. After the Revolutions of 1848, the Salzburg territory was again separated from Upper Austria and became a new crown land in its own right, the Duchy of Salzburg, by resolution of 26 June 1849. Caroline Augusta of Bavaria, widow of the late Emperor Francis I of Austria, chose the city of Salzburg as her residence. According to the 1861 February Patent, the duchy received a Landtag diet. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, it belonged to the Cisleithanian (Austrian) part of Austria-Hungary. With the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1918, the duchy was succeeded by the state of Salzburg, part of first German Austria and then the First Austrian Republic.

Retrieved May 13, 2010 National Association of Dental Laboratories The National Association of Dental Laboratories (NADL) was formed in the United States in 1951 after the merger of Dental Laboratory Institute of America and the American Dental Laboratory Association. It became a federation of state commercial dental laboratory associations. This merger took place in Chicago and then, in 1952, NADL established its headquarters offices in Washington, D.C., which were moved to Tallahassee, Florida later in 2001. The association was known as the National Association of Certified Dental Laboratories from 1968 to 1971 when it changed back to its original name. Its mission is to be the recognized advocate for the dental laboratory technology industry by promoting professionalism, setting technical standards and providing valued services to its membership. The stated purpose of NADL is to uphold and advance the dignity, honor and efficiency of those engaged as operators of dental laboratories, to advance their standards of service to the dental profession and to establish cooperation among its members. NADL offers several benefits to its members and one of such benefits is that it promotes high standards and aims to work as a unified voice for the dental laboratory trade. NADL establishes alliances with professional businesses to benefit its members with either discounts or services. Members also benefit from NADL's educational programs ranging from seminars, conferences, materials, the NADL University which offers a Certificate in Dental Laboratory Management, to the Wealth of Knowledge Videotape Library. These programs inform and educate NADL members on topics such as production, marketing, and promotion, and also serve as continuing education credits. Furthermore, this association offers the NADL Pillar Scholarship aimed to provide qualified dental technicians the opportunity to take the necessary examinations to complete the Certified Dental Technician examination process. NADL also has its set of communications tools to keep its members informed about the industry trends. Two examples are the Journal of Dental Technology (JDT), a journal published 9 times a year, and JDT Unbound, a mail newsletter that includes regular updates. Its Board of Directors comprises 14 members and its current President is Robert Savage. NADL also has an independent board, the National Board for Certification in Dental Laboratory Technology, founded in 1955 as an independent certification organization. It administered the first Certified Dental Technician (CDT) tests in October 1958 and awarded the first CDT certificates in March of the following year. A wide range of institutions offer associate degree programs to become a technician. In addition, an interested person can complete an apprenticeship program that lasts for five years. After the apprenticeship or associate degree has been finished, the person will need to pass an exam that is administered by the National Board for Certification in Dental Laboratory Technology. CDTs can retain certification if they apply to the NBC every year for renewal and prove they have complied with the local laws governing their work and undergone continuing technical education. They are also required to pay a renewal fee. NADL regulations It is in NADL best interests to protect the patients' health and assure their restorations are safe for use. To fulfill this objective, NADL has supported federal and state regulations since 2003 and has worked close with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state health officials and the dental industry as well. It has also developed regulatory guidelines aimed to be a basic standard of regulation. Although its main objective is to benefit the general public it is also intended to be effective for the dental technicians and the dental industry. One of the requests from NADL to the FDA has been to protect patient's safety. In this sense, the Association intends that the source of dental devices be disclosed to the patient. NADL has expressed its support to establish mandatory certification and continuing education for dental technicians dedicated to restoration manufacture; mandatory registration of all dental laboratories with the competent authority; mandatory documentation of those materials used in any restoration and their point of origin; as well as mandatory documentation of the mentioned items in the patient's dental records. In their Guidelines for Establishing Statutory Regulation, NADL has noted that certification is a way to recognize individuals who have met established qualifications, therefore, they should be the only ones legally acknowledged to use the designated title. Dental Lab Certification in the UK All Dental Technicians and Clinical Dental Technicians in the UK are required by law to be registered with the General Dental Council (GDC). The GDC is an organisation which regulates all dentists and dental care professionals, they set and maintain standards in UK dentistry. Many of those who work for Dental Laboratories are also registered with the Dental Technologists Association (DTA). The DTA is a professional association representing the interests of dental technicians in the UK. The GDC ensures that dental professionals have the necessary qualifications and are trained to the necessary levels. Dental technicians must prove their knowledge is up-to- date by taking part in Continuing Professional Development (CPD).

Carl Rosen (1918‚Äì1983), owner of clothing manufacturer Puritan Fashions Corp., purchased the unnamed filly at a Keeneland yearling sale. He named her for the tennis player Chris Evert, whom he had signed to endorse his company's line of sportswear. Carl Rosen & Associates at the NTRA Racing career Chris Evert began racing at age two. Of her five starts, she won four and finished second in the other. At age three, she dominated her class, winning the U.S. Filly Triple Crown and earning the Eclipse Award for Outstanding 3-Year-Old Filly. In 1974, Aaron Jones, the owner of the West Coast based filly Miss Musket, issued a challenge to Chris Evert's owner for their horses to meet in a match race. Miss Musket's record included winning the Hollywood Oaks, and her confident owner offered to put up $100,000 if Chris Evert's owner would match it. Hollywood Park Racetrack offered another $150,000 to the winner-take-all race that they would host and would bill as the Hollywood Special Stakes. Rosen accepted the offer for a match race to be held on July 20, 1974. Chris Evert won by 50 lengths, the large purse significantly contributing to her becoming 1974's leading money earner in U.S. Thoroughbred racing.

This tree is often found near creeks and drainage swales growing in moist cool microhabitats. Its leaves are a glossy dark green on the upper surface with prominent spines; a further rapid identification arises from the leaves of canyon live oak being geometrically flat. They are often sympatric with Quercus agrifolia and several other oak species. Fossil data supports a much wider distribution throughout the western United States during the early Holocene period. Native Americans used the acorns of this species as a food staple, after leaching of the tannins; moreover, its roasted seed is a coffee substitute. After forest fires, canyon live oak regenerates vigorously by basal sprouting, and the clonal diversity of this species has been shown to be high.A.M. Montalvo, S.G. Conard, M.T. Conkle and P.D. Hodgskiss, Population structure, genetic diversity, and clone formation in Quercus chrysolepis (Fagaceae), American Journal of Botany, Vol 84, 1553, (1997)  Description  Q. chrysolepis is an evergreen tree with significant-sized spreading, horizontal branches, and a broad, rounded crown; it attains a height of six to thirty meters (20‚Äì100 feet) and is often found in a shrubby growth form. The trunk diameter can range from 30 to 100 centimeters. The elliptical to oblong leaves are 2.5 to 8.0 centimeters (1.0‚Äì3.2 inches) in length with widths of about half that dimension; leaves are short-pointed at the tip, but rounded or blunt at base. Although the leaves appear generally flat, they may have edge margins slightly turned under, typically with spiny teeth, particularly on young twigs. These leathery leaves are a glossy dark green above, with a nether surface a dull golden down,Bruce M. Pavlik, Pamela C. Muick, Sharon Johnson and Marjorie Popper, Oaks of California, Cachuma Press (1992) often becoming gray and nearly glabrous the second year. Bark of the canyon live oak is of a light gray coloration, and is rather smooth or sometimes scaly. Acorns occur solitarily or in pairs, exhibiting lengths of two to five centimeters; these fruits are variable in size and shape, but generally ovoid, turban-like with a shallow, thick cup of scales densely covered with yellowish hairs; the stalk is barely evident.  Distribution and habitat  The trunk bark is gray and rough. Q. chrysolepis is found in a variety of forest communities in the southwestern United States. It is common in the mountainous regions of California (Sierra Nevada, Coast Ranges, Klamath Mountains, Cascades, San Gabriel Mountains, etc.) with additional populations in southwestern Oregon, western Nevada, northern Baja California, Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and Chihuahua.SEINet, Southwestern Biodiversity, Arizona chapter Canyon live oak is tolerant of a variety of soil types, including very rocky or cobbly environments. It is hardy to cold temperatures down to ‚àí11 ¬∞F, and will grow in neutral to moderately acidic soils with pH ranges of 4.5 to 7.5. An example of very rocky and serpentine soil tolerance is the species occurrence at the Cedars of Sonoma County, California.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Leather oak. eds. Mark McGinley & C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC Canyon live oak grows at elevations of about 500 to 1500 meters in southwestern Oregon; in Northern California, from 100 to 1400 meters; and in Southern California, up to approximately 2700 meters. Q. chrysolepis can be the dominant tree on steep canyon walls, especially in locations of shallow rocky soils.McDonald, Philip M., and Edward E. Littrell, 1976. The bigcone Douglas-fir-canyon live oak community in southern California, Madro√±o 23:310‚Äì320 In areas of moderate to high rainfall, it occurs on south facing slopes, and in the hotter, drier parts of its distribution, on northerly slope faces.  Ecology  Besides the prehistoric use of canyon live oaks as a human food source, the acorns are consumed by a variety of wildlife as diverse as acorn woodpecker, California ground squirrel, dusky-footed wood rat, western harvest mouse and black-tailed deer. Surprisingly there seems little difference in food preference by wildlife among different oak species.Peter G. Kennedy, Post-dispersal seed predation varies by habitat not acorn size for Quercus chrysolepis (Fagaceae) and Lithocarpus Densiflora (Fagaceae) in central coastal California, Madrono: Vol. 52, No. 1, pp. 30‚Äì34 Extensive hybridization of Q. chrysolepis has been documented with several other sympatric oak species, probably to a greater extent than for any other Quercus species.Kevin C. Brown, Biodiversity of Oak (Quercus) Species in California and Adjacent Regions, Fifth Symposium on Oak Woodlands, San Diego, Ca., Oct. 22‚Äì25, 2001 The ability of Q. chrysolepis to compete with other dominant trees within its range has been analyzed from the standpoint of leaf architecture and photosynthetic capability. The study results explain that, in low light environments, Q. chrysolepis out-competes species with superior leaf size and crown mass per unit volume by its greater photosynthetic efficiency and leaf lifespan.J. C. Hunter, Correspondence of environmental tolerances with leaf and branch attributes for six co-occurring species of broadleaf evergreen trees in northern California, Journal: Trees ‚Äì Structure and Function, Volume 11, Number 3, Pages 169‚Äì175, January, 1997; Springer, Berlin / Heidelberg, ISSN 0931-1890 Canyon live oak gives functional habitat for many fauna by providing perching, nesting, resting, or foraging sites for numerous species of birds, and shade and cover for diverse other mammals. Young Q. chrysolepis readily available browse. Canyon live oak woodlands serve as excellent mountain lion habitat because of the large population of deer frequenting these areas. Many species forage on canyon live oak foliage including black-tailed jackrabbit, beaver, brush rabbit, red- backed vole, Sonoma chipmunk, cactus mouse, deer mouse, and porcupine. Pocket gophers often feed on the cambium of young canyon live oaks. In southern California Q. chrysolepis is the food plant of a small moth, Neocrania bifasciata. Allergenicity The pollen of the canyon live oak is a severe allergen.

It is named in honour of the Scottish conservationist John Muir, who was born in Dunbar in 1838 and became a founder of the United States National Park Service. The route provides a coast-to-coast route across Scotland, linking Muir's birthplace with Scotland's first national park, Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, and Helensburgh, from where he left Scotland for the United States. It is suitable for walkers and cyclists although some sections are on rougher terrain and may not be suitable for road bicycles. The John Muir Way opened on 21 April 2014. Previously a shorter 'John Muir Way' existed only in East Lothian, but the majority of this older route has now been absorbed into the much longer new route. A shorter section of the older route from Dunbar to the Scottish Borders has been renamed as the 'John Muir Link'. In 2017 the route was designated as one of Scotland's Great Trails by NatureScot. The Independent declared the original John Muir Way its Walk of the Month for February 2014. Between 240,000 and 300,000 people use the path every year, of whom about 5,500 walk the entire route. Route The John Muir Way is signposted throughout using a purple-brown logo. Taking the trail from west to east, the John Muir Way starts in Helensburgh. The trail follows over the hills, providing views of Loch Lomond and the Trossach mountains, before descending into Balloch, with its National Park centre. This is one of the wilder sections of the route with the most rugged terrain: windswept, high moorland with little shelter. From here the route winds its way towards Strathblane and Scotland's most famous long distance walk, the West Highland Way which it crosses near Dumgoyne hill and Glengoyne Distillery. At Kirkintilloch, the trail picks up the Forth and Clyde Canal and heads through Strathkelvin to Falkirk and its wheel which provides a link between waterways for travelling craft. Roman forts and the Antonine Wall are the next attractions en route to the ancient town of Linlithgow and its impressive palace of Mary, Queen of Scots. It leaves Linlithgow with its low lying loch for the seashore and the harbour town of Bo'ness, coasting along to Blackness Castle and the bridge town of South Queensferry. The trail follows the greener places in the capital city, Edinburgh, before guiding travellers east, past famous, coastal birding and golf spots via Aberlady and North Berwick. The trail ends in Dunbar, where Muir was born and there is a museum dedicated to him.

It lies south east of Shepton Mallet, north east of Castle Cary, and south of Evercreech. The parish has a population of 183. History A square, Roman-period Celtic temple built in the late 3rd century, is situated a mile north-west of the parish on the summit of Lamyatt Beacon. It fell into disuse around 370 or perhaps 410. Lamyatt was recorded in the Domesday book as Lamieta meaning \\"the lamb's gate\\" from the Old English lamb and goat. The Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey owned the land and 5 hides (660 acres) were sublet to Nigel the Doctor. The parish of Lamyatt was part of the Whitstone Hundred. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Biography Harbutt was born in Camden, New Jersey, and raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, and learned much of his photography skills from the township's amateur camera club. He attended Regis High School in New York City where he took photographs for the school newspaper. He later graduated from Marquette University. Harbutt's work is deeply rooted in the modern photojournalist tradition. For the first twenty years of his career he contributed to major magazines in the United States, Europe and Japan. His work was often intrinsically political, exhibiting social and economic contingencies. In 1959, while working as a writer and photographer for the Catholic magazine Jubilee, he was invited by members of the Castro underground to document the Cuban Revolution on the strength of three photographs he had published in Modern Photography. An editor at Jubilee while Harbutt was working there, Robert Lax, used photographs taken by Harbutt for the front and back cover of his first book of poetry, The Circus of the Sun. Harbutt joined Magnum Photos and was elected president of the organization twice, first in 1979. He left the group in 1981, citing its increasingly commercial ambitions and the desire to pursue more personal work. He taught photography workshops, exhibited in solo and group shows around the world, and joined the faculty of the Parsons School of Design at New School University as a full-time professor, in addition to serving as guest artist at MIT, The Art Institute of Chicago, and the Rhode Island School of Design. Harbutt was a founding member of Archive Pictures Inc., an international documentary photographers' cooperative, and a member of the American Society of Magazine Photographers. His work was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, the National Museum of American History, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the U.S. Library of Congress, George Eastman House, the Art Institute of Chicago, the International Center of Photography, the Center for Creative Photography, and at the Biblioth√®que Nationale, the Beaubourg, and the Maison europ√©enne de la photographie in Paris. In 1997, his negatives, master prints, and archives were acquired for the collection of the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson, Arizona. He mounted a large exhibition of his work at the Centro de la Imagen in Mexico City in December 2000 and received the medal of the City of Perpignan at a retrospective of his work there in 2004. He died in Monteagle, Tennessee, on June 30, 2015, at the age of 79. He had emphysema.

Commissioned in 1946, she served on the American and West Indies Station only until 1947 before being put into reserve, and then sold for scrapping in 1959. Construction The ship was originally ordered on 19 January 1944 as the Loch Coulside. However, the contract was then changed, and the ship was laid down by Henry Robb of Leith on 25 September 1944 to a revised design as a Bay-class. Admiralty Job No. J11867 was launched as Padstow Bay on 28 August 1945, and completed on 11 March 1946. Service history After sea trials, Padstow Bay sailed to Plymouth still lacking her full complement. The ship was finally commissioned in June to serve on the American and West Indies Station. In July she sailed for Bermuda, calling at Ponta Delgada, Azores for fuel, and arriving at Bermuda on 8 August. In September and October she carried out an extensive series of visits, stopping at Havana, Cuba, Veracruz, Mexico, Honduras, Kingston, Jamaica, Bluefields, Nicaragua, Cartagena, Colombia, Cura√ßao, La Guaira, Venezuela, Trinidad, Georgetown, British Guiana, Paramaribo, Surinam, and Cayenne, French Guiana, returning to Bermuda by 15 November. After local duties, she sailed on 31 December 1945 with ships of the Squadron for more exercises and another visits programme. In January 1946 she called at Antigua and Tobago, in February, Grenada, then Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante and Sint Eustatius in March. After a routine docking at the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda, in June she embarked on a visit to North America with the cruiser . On 1 July she arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, to take part in joint exercises with ships of the Royal Canadian Navy. In August she sailed from Halifax to ports in the Eastern Canadian Provinces, calling at Bathurst, New Brunswick, Ellis Bay, Anticosti, Miquelon, and Argentia and St. John's, Newfoundland. In September she visited Montreal with Sheffield, before returning to Bermuda via Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In October she sailed for the UK, arriving back at Plymouth on 18 November, was decommissioned, and laid-up with the Reserve Fleet in December. Padstow Bay remained in the Reserve Fleet until 1958 when the ship was placed on the Disposal List. In 1959 she was sold to BISCO for demolition by an Italian shipbreaker and towed to La Spezia, arriving on 11 August.

It is found in Asia. Description In Buxa Tiger Reserve, West Bengal, India ;Male Male upperside, forewing: velvety black, an elongate broad medial patch dark orange red, that extends from base outwards for about three-fourths the length of the wing and fills the area from vein 1 to the middle of the cell; in some specimens diffusely, spread below vein 1 near base, but there shaded with dusky black; the outer margin of this red patch unevenly rounded. Hindwing: brownish black, a large orange-red spot above vein 3 to near apex, inwardly extended into the cell to near the base of the wing and posteriorly diffuse below vein 3, but in the cell thickly overlaid with dusky-black scaling and posteriorly shaded with long brown hairs that in certain lights take a golden tint; above the cell extended from the base of the wing to the inner margin of the orange spot is a prominent broad streak of a shade darker than the ground colour; abdominal fold pale pinkish brown. Underside: silvery white with sparsely scattered minute black dots. Forewing: a discal and inner subterminal series of very indistinct somewhat lunular black markings that form broken anteriorly convergent bands, which are continued over the hindwing to the tornus; beyond these, on both forewings and hindwings, succeeds an outer subterminal series of minute black dots, in most specimens very indistinct. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown; sides of the abdomen golden brown; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. ;Female Female upperside: more or less as in the male, but the dark orange-red medial patches replaced by white and much larger. On the forewing this white patch extends above the cell, the discocellulars closing which are prominently marked by a black tooth, and posteriorly it reaches the dorsal margin. On the hindwing the white patch is very large and in some specimens very diffuse. Both forewings and hindwings are shaded at the base by dusky scales and in many specimens the markings of the underside are plainly visible by transparency; the broad black streak above the cell on the hindwing is present in some, absent in other specimens. Underside: ground colour and markings as in the male, but much more prominent. Variety dentata ;Male Upperside golden or coppery orange o¬£ a shade paler than the orange patch in the typical form. Forewing: costal margin broadly black, the width of the black colour increasing to the apex and continued from below that in an even border along the termen to the tornus, thence along the apical third of the dorsum, ending more or less diffusely in a point; discocellulars marked by a prominent tooth extended from the black costal border. Hindwing: base and dorsal area lightly irrorated (sprinkled) with fuscous scales, the latter also shaded with long pale brown hairs; termen with a blackish border of varying width but generally widest in the middle, its inner margin more or less diffuse; costal margin broadly pale yellow. Underside: silvery white; markings similar to but in some specimens even more indistinct than in bulis. Antennae, head and thorax of a paler brown than in bulis; sides of the abdomen golden yellow; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. ;Female Female upperside: similar to that of the male, but the orange replaced by white, the black costal and terminal borders on the forewing broader; on the dorsal margin the border is continued further towards the base; the diseocellular black tooth-like mark as prominent as in the male. Hindwing: the white area very much smaller than the similar orange area on the hindwing of the male and confined to the apical third of the wing; a short, broad, clavate (club like), black streak extends from the base outwards above the cell. Underside as in the male but the markings more prominent. Variety angulata Moore Differs from bulis in the shape of the hindwing, which has the termen very strongly angulate in the middle in both sexes. In both male and female also the apex of the fore and tornal angle of the hindwing are highly acuminate, in the forewing the apex is, in most specimens, falcate (sickle shaped). Male upperside: differs from the upperside of the typical form in the greater extent and paler colour of the orange-red areas on both forewings and hindwings. On the forewing the discocellulars are marked by a black tooth as in var. dentata, and on the hindwing the orange-red ground colour extends posteriorly to vein 2, but along the dorsum it is heavily shaded with dusty-black scales. Underside: as in typical bulis. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, the sides of the abdomen not reddish or golden; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female upper and undersides: similar to those of the male, but the ground colour on the upperside white. Variety malayica Felder Upperside, forewing: closely resembles that of typical bulis, but the medial orange-red area is larger and extends slightly further outwards, upwards and downwards so that the black on the tornal area forms a broad triangle and is continued along the dorsal margin, narrowing to a slender line near the base of the wing; anteriorly the black border along the costa projects as a slender black tooth along the discocellulars, which however, is absent in many specimens. Hindwing: the orange-red area that in bulis forms an upper discal patch, in this variety or form spreads inwards to the base, posteriorly towards the tornus and leaves only a comparatively narrow terminal margin; the tornal area broadly black, the inner margin of the black very diffuse, rarely so clearly defined as in Felder's figure; near the base, above the subcostal vein, there is a short, broad, black streak; abdominal fold pale greyish white. Underside: silvery white, the markings faint and ill-defined as in all forms of Curetis; the discal oblique band of the forewing carried over the hindwing, but not in any specimen that I have seen continued in even a disjointed line (as in bulis) to the tornal angle. The rest as in typical bulis. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of bulis.‚Äî Female Very similar to that of bulis. Differs on the upperside, in some specimens only, by the extent of the white area on the hindwing, which spreads practically over the whole wing, but is heavily shaded along the terminal margin and posteriorly on the dorsal area with dusky brownish-black or fuscous. On the underside the ground colour and markings are as in bulis. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of bulis. Life history Larva About 10 mm long. Colour velvety green; head dark brown; 3rd and 4th segments with narrow, obliquely placed lateral stripes of crimson, edged posteriorly with yellow; 6th to 11th segments with a slender longitudinal dorsal stripe of the same colour; the spiracles on each side surmounted by a slender, lunulated, pale yellow line; on the 9th segment a conspicuous quadrate patch of white between the spiracular yellow lunule and the crimson dorsal line; 12th and remaining segments dark green; on the 12th two greenish-yellow, erect, rigid processes slightly divergent at their apices; the tentacles protruded from their processes seem to be pinkish brown, with a tuft of black and white hairs at their apices; but it is not easy to note the colour of the hairs, as they are protruded, whirled round and withdrawn with great rapidity. There is no opening or honey-gland on the 11th or other segment, as in many lycaenid larvae. In shape also these do not resemble the larva of the Lycaenidae which as a rule, are onisciform. In these the head is small and almost always completely hidden under the 2nd segment; the 3rd, 4th, and 5th segments sloped upwards posteriorly, form each a well- marked transverse ridge. Pupa A rounded slightly convex disc with a protrusion posteriorly; colour translucent dark green. Seen under a magnifying glass they seem to be studded with tiny pits, except on the lateral areas; on the anterior portion there is an oval yellowish-white mark.

The quarry is popular with rock climbers due to its rural setting, ease of access and selection of routes on good quality limestone. The average height of the quarried rock is approximately .  Location  Pot Hole Quarry is located near the village of Llanferres, on the A494 between Mold and Ruthin, in Denbighshire, North Wales, United Kingdom.  Climbing  The routes range in grade from V-Diff to E3, the emphasis of the majority of routes being on single pitch finger cracks and pockets. The hardest graded route at the quarry is Vetta Variation (E3 5c). The easiest graded route is Sunset (VD). Although some of the easier routes on the Main Wall are now becoming polished, routes graded HVS and above are in fair condition. The crag has been popular since the late 1970s/early 1980s and is often visited on the way to or from Snowdonia, when traveling from the North West of England. The quarry, and much of the Clwyd Area, was pioneered by Stuart Cathcart. The crag remains a favourite for group usage, with school parties and military outward- bound groups both frequenting Pot Hole.  Prominent climbs  The main wall of the quarry has a few outstanding routes, the star of the crag being 'The Dog' (HVS 5a), a thin finger crack with well protected, absorbing and sustained climbing. The routes are chiefly mid-grade, with routes of VS level dominating much of the main wall, 'Tre-Fynnon' (VS 4b) and 'The Watzman' (VS 4b) being the routes most worthy of note. The Right Angle (HS 4b) is an interesting climb requiring a bridge of two faces and wide crack jamming methods; a route marred by dampness, loose rock inside the crack and awkward protection.

In commission from 1945 until 1956, she served in the Mediterranean Fleet and on the America and West Indies Squadron. Construction The ship was originally ordered from Harland and Wolff of Belfast on 2 February 1943 as the Loch Lydoch. However the contract was then changed, and the ship was built to a revised design as a Bay-class anti-aircraft frigate, launched on 18 November 1944, and completed on 29 May 1945. Service history After commissioning and sea trials St Austell Bay was assigned to duty in the British Pacific Fleet. However, she was still at Malta with other ships of the 33rd Escort Group when news of the surrender of Japan arrived on 15 August. St Austell Bay remained in the Mediterranean Sea for the next five years, mainly operating in the Aegean and Adriatic, on patrols, guardship duties, and several periods as part of the Haifa Patrol, attempting to intercept ships carrying illegal Jewish immigrants to Palestine. In April 1950 St Austell Bay and sister ship exchanged with the Royal New Zealand Navy frigates and , arriving at Auckland on 3 July to join the RNZN 11th Frigate Flotilla for exercises, patrols and visits in the Pacific, finally returning to the flotilla at Malta on 4 January 1951. In March she returned to the UK for service in the 7th Frigate Flotilla, Home Fleet, and almost immediately took part on the search for the missing submarine . Patrols, visits, and fleet exercises occupied the rest of the year, including an exercise with a submarine of the Royal Norwegian Navy in September. In June 1952 she arrived at Hamilton, Bermuda, to join the America and West Indies Squadron, and in July was sent to Port Stanley to act as Guardship in the Falkland Islands. In October she left the Falklands and sailed up the west coast of South America, making calls at Puerto Montt, Valpara√≠so and Antofagasta in Chile, and Callao in Peru, before transiting the Panama Canal, and returning to Bermuda in December. In 1953 she visited various Caribbean ports, and carried out exercises, including one in May with ships of the Royal Canadian Navy. In June she sailed to Devonport to refit, then returned to Bermuda in November. From March to June 1954 she was Guardship at the Falklands, again returning to Bermuda by way of the Pacific coast of South America. In September she visited the United States, calling at ports in New England, then returned to the UK in November to refit at Plymouth. St Austell Bay was recommissioned in May 1955, but significant problems with the refit delayed deployment until November when she returned to Bermuda for the usual programme of joint exercises, training and port visits in the Caribbean and to North America. She returned to Plymouth in August 1956 to decommission and was put into Reserve. St Austell Bay remained in the Reserve Fleet at Plymouth until 1959 when she was placed on the Disposal List. She was sold to BISCO for demolition by Shipbreaking Industries and arrived in tow at the breakers yard at Charlestown near Rosyth on 5 July 1959.

The parish includes the hamlet of Laverton, where the Church of St Mary dates from the 11th century. History The name Lullington means the settlement of Lulla's people. Before the Norman Conquest the estate belonged to King Harold, later passing to Longleat Priory and after the Dissolution of the Monasteries was acquired by the Thynne family. It was sold in the early 19th century by the Marquess of Bath and bought by William Duckworth, who rebuilt the village. The parish was part of the hundred of Frome. Just to the south of the village is the Orchardleigh Estate, which comprises a Victorian stately home, built in 1856 by Thomas Henry Wyatt for William Duckworth, a 13th-century island church, and an 18-hole golf course. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

He spent his entire career in PAOK. Due to his fierce competitiveness and his Macedonian heritage, his nickname was ŒëŒªŒ≠ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ œå ŒúŒ≠Œ≥Œ±œÇ, Alexander the Great. Playing career Born in Agios Pavlos, Thessaloniki, Koudas began playing football for PAOK where he made his first-team debut in December 1963, aged 17. Koudas, nicknamed Alexander the Great, spent his entire football career with PAOK, making 504 appearances in the Alpha Ethniki from 1963 to 1984, and 607 appearances in all competitions (PAOK all-time records). Koudas won two out of nine Greek Cup finals he appeared in and in the 1972 Cup final, he scored both goals as PAOK defeated Panathinaikos 2‚Äì1 and earned their first domestic title in club's history. During the summer of 1966, Olympiacos unsuccessfully tried to acquire Koudas from PAOK, approaching him directly without going into a negotiation with his club. PAOK president Giorgos Pantelakis never gave his consent for the transfer to be completed and for the next 2 seasons, Koudas participated only in Olympiacos friendly games. In the summer of 1968, he returned to PAOK and led the great team of the 1970s to glorious days. Fueled by this incident, Olympiacos‚ÄìPAOK rivalry is considered nowadays the fiercest intercity football rivalry in Greece. He retired in 1984, aged 37, serving for over 20 years at PAOK. Koudas became even inspiration for a popular song by the Greek songwriter and PAOK supporter Nikos Papazoglou and lyricist Manolis Rasoulis. National team Koudas made 43 appearances for the Greece national team, scoring 4 goals, between 1967 and 1982. He appeared at UEFA Euro 1980 in Italy, along with PAOK teammates Konstantinos Iosifidis, Ioannis Damanakis, Ioannis Gounaris and Georgios Kostikos. After he had retired, Koudas made a final appearance for the national team in a friendly against Yugoslavia on 20 September 1995. That made him the oldest international player (at age 48) until George Weah (at age 51) beat the record in September 2018. Managerial career Koudas had a short managerial career as the co-manager of Iraklis together with Kostas Aidiniou.

The 2001 census recorded 56,112 people born in Ghana living in the UK, and by 2011 this figure was 95,666. Most British Ghanaians migrated to the United Kingdom from the 1960s to the 1980s, after Ghana's independence from Britain in 1957, due to economic conditions at those times in Ghana. History Early Although modern Ghana gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957 and was the first African country to do so, small numbers of people from that region have been arriving and living in Britain since at least the mid-sixteenth century. At that time, there were many Africans living and working in London, some of whom were based at the royal court. Even Shakespeare, it is rumoured, sought the company of an African lady, Lucy Morgan. In 1555, John Lok, a London merchant and Alderman, brought five Africans from the town of Shama, in what is present-day Ghana, to London to be trained as interpreters in order to assist England‚Äôs trade with the western coast of Africa. From that time onwards, economic links were established between West Africa and England. The English were most concerned with acquiring gold from the region that came to be known as the Gold Coast. Pepper and other spices were also much in demand in Europe. Besides a number of West Africans arriving in Britain during the 16th‚Äì18th centuries, there were Britons who went to the Gold Coast and married Ghanaian women. Some Ghanaians have Scottish and English ancestry, since a number of Scots and Englishmen married in local customary ceremonies and had children who became successful, such as Gold Coast's James Bannerman and Robert William Wallace Bruce. Most Scottish and English settlers left the Gold Coast after it won independence. Modern By the 1980s and early-1990s, ten to twenty percent of Ghanaians were living outside Ghana, with many migrating to other countries in Africa, the Middle East, the United States and Europe from the 1970s to the 1980s due to poor economic conditions at those times in Ghana. Culture Film and television Ghanaian British actors such as Freema Agyeman, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Idris Elba and Peter Mensah have successfully crossed over into the international market and primarily work in Hollywood. Music Ghanaian music and musicians have a strong influence on the overall Ghanaian British community as well as British music in general, from traditional Ghanaian music to Afrobeats, hip-hop and grime, the UK has produced many fine artists. The Ghana Music Awards UK began in 2002 with an aim to promote and award the best achieving Ghanaian British musicians. By the 1980s, the UK was experiencing a boom in African music as Ghanaians and others moved there, immediately they made their presence felt in the form of local gigs and carnivals, and to this day Ghanaians and other African groups prevail as the most successful ethnic groups in the UK R&B; and rap scene. Artiste such as Stormzy, Dizzee Rascal and Fuse ODG are a household names in the UK and have won numerous awards, Tinchy Stryder, Donae'o, Oxide & Neutrino, Abra Cadabra, Headie One, Sway DaSafo, Tempa T, Lethal Bizzle, Novelist and The Mitchell Brothers have also received numerous nominations and awards (including the MOBO Awards, Mercury Prize and BET Awards). Another notable Ghanaian British musician who chose to stray away from the typical hip-hop scene is Rhian Benson, who now lives in Los Angeles and is noted for being a Singer-songwriter, composer, instrumentalist and record producer who performs mainly jazz and soul music. Cuisine Other Miss Ghana UK is a beauty pageant that has been up and running since 1995, it aims to highlight Ghana's rich cultural heritage. Attendances per show attracted over 3,000 by 2009. In London, Ghana's Official Independence Celebration is a celebration of the African nation's independence. The event was founded by Abrantee Boateng also known as DJ Abrantee and business partners, Alordia and Edmond in 2000. Demographics Population At the time of the 1961 United Kingdom census, around 10,000 people born in Ghana were resident in the UK. The 2001 UK census recorded 56,112 Ghanaian-born people. The 2011 UK census recorded 93,312 Ghanaian-born residents in England, 534 in Wales, 1,658 in Scotland, and 162 in Northern Ireland. The Office for National Statistics estimates that the Ghanaian-born population of the UK was 114,000 in 2019. Distribution Most Ghanaians in the UK live in Greater London. At the time of the 2011 census, the largest Ghanaian-born populations were found in the London boroughs of Southwark, Newham, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Lewisham, Waltham Forest, Brent and Barking and Dagenham, and in Milton Keynes, the county of West Midlands, and Greater Manchester. Economics Research published in 2005 showed that 63.70% of recent Ghanaian immigrants to the UK of working age were employed (compared to 73.49% for British-born people regardless of race or ethnic background). 17.19% of recent immigrants were low earners, paid less than ¬£149.20 per week (compared to 21.08% for British-born people), and 3.13% were high earners, paid more than ¬£750 per week (compared to 6.98% for British-born people).

It was situated on the Yorkshire Coast Line from Scarborough to Hull and was opened on 20 October 1847 by the York and North Midland Railway. However, there were several other railway stations also called Marton, so on 1 July 1884 the North Eastern Railway renamed it after the village of Flamborough several miles away. The station was north of Hull, and south of railway station. History The station was opened by the York and North Midland Railway in October 1847. It was on the last section of the Hull to Scarborough line to be opened; Hull to Bridlington had been achieved in October 1846, and southwards from to was in use by the same month. The station was located immediately north of the gated level crossing that spanned the road from Marton, and had a G T Andrews designed building. The extra effort put into Flamborough station was due to the influence of the Yarburgh family of nearby Sewerby Hall, who used the station. It was located north of Hull and south of Seamer. The station had a small goods yard which was the nearest loading point for fish landed at Flamborough. Previous to the opening of the railway, carts of fresh fish used to travel the south to Hull. Even so, the demand of transporting the fish the to the station from Flamborough Head, was seen as a bar to good business. The distance between the station and coast was also seen as detrimental to the burgeoning tourist trade and in the 1890s, a branch was proposed by the residents, something which the North Eastern Railway considered, but refused to undertake. The goods yard handled mostly fish (notably of herring in August 1889), corn and coal. The NER had a policy of making their stationmasters the agent for the handling of coal, which guaranteed traffic for the railway company. The station master at Flamborough in 1920 had an annual wage of ¬£230, but the profit on the coal handled at the station was ¬£95. Wagons loaded with fish were allowed to be attached to Hull- bound trains via gravity whilst the Hull service was waiting in the southbound platform. Cattle and stone were also handled at the station; the chalk cutting just to the north of the station was opened out into a quarry in 1876. During the First World War, the line was singled as an economy measure. Double track was restored in 1923, though three years after the station closed (1973), British Rail singled the section between and Filey. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1935 to 1939. The station closed to goods traffic in August 1964, and closed completely on 5 January 1970. In 1976, the station was given Grade II listed building status.

The ship was ordered from Harland and Wolff at Belfast on 2 May 1943 as a to be named Loch Arnish. The contract was changed in 1944, and the Bay-class ship was laid down on 31 August 1944, launched on 29 March 1945, and completed on 11 October 1945 after the end of hostilities. Service history After sea trials and weapons testing, Tremadoc Bay sailed on her first mission; towing a German Type XXI submarine to the Baltic Sea to be handed over to the Soviet Navy. The Tripartite Naval Agreement had agreed that all German U-boats would be sunk, apart from 30 that would be preserved and divided equally between the USSR, United Kingdom and United States for experimental and technical purposes. On 24 November, as part of \\"Operation Cabal\\", Tremadoc Bay left Lisahally, Northern Ireland, with in tow, in company with the frigate towing . Unfortunately bad weather in the North Sea, and problems with the towing gear forced them to divert to Rosyth. She eventually sailed again on 7 December, arriving at Libau, Latvia, on the 14th, before sailing to Plymouth. In February 1946 she towed the Type XXIII submarine , in company with the tug Bustler towing the Type XXI submarine , from Lisahally to Cherbourg for hand- over to the French Navy in \\"Operation Thankful\\". Once again towing problems in heavy weather forced her to take shelter, this time in Dublin Bay. In March Tremadoc Bay was deployed for training and emergency duties with Plymouth Local Flotilla. In September 1947 she was deployed with sister ship to the Mediterranean to escort the ships SS Ocean Vigour, SS Empire Rival and SS Runnymede Park from Port-de-Bouc near Marseille to Gibraltar. These ships were transporting Jewish illegal immigrants, detained from while attempting to enter Palestine, back to Europe. Tremadoc Bay then resumed Local Flotilla duties at Plymouth, remaining there until April 1951, when she was decommissioned and put into Reserve at Devonport. She remained at Devonport until 1953 when she was refitted at Falmouth, then towed to Gibraltar still in Reserve. In 1958 she was placed on the Disposal List, in 1959, prior to being sold to an Italian shipbreaker, Tremadoc Bay made an appearance in the Film Silent Enemy, the film of Lt. Lionel Buster Crabb RNVR about the work defusing mines in Gibraltar during WW2, some time after this, she was taken under tow, and arrived at Genoa on 18 September for scrapping.

The parish includes the village of West Lydford and hamlet of East Lydford. History Lydford-on-Fosse straddles the Fosse Way, an ancient Roman road which linked the cities of Lincoln and Exeter. The village takes its name from two Saxon words, Lyd torrent or noisy stream and Ford a passage crossing a river, and was established before the Norman Conquest. The villages of East and West Lydford are to the east and west of the ford which was where the Fosse Way crossed the river Brue. A place where a river could be forded became a meeting place and a centre for trade and the granting of a charter for a fair and weekly market in the reign of Henry III (1216‚Äì1272) suggests that Lydford was already a place of some importance by that time. Fair Place, West Lydford, is where the fair was held. The Manor of West Lydford was bequeathed by the 4th Earl of Derby in his will of 1593 to his second son the Hon William Stanley of Lathom, Lancashire. In 1594 William became the 6th Earl on the sudden death of his older brother Ferdinando the 5th Earl. At least 1800 years of recorded history of East and West Lydford, with entries for both in the Doomsday Book, have led to the Parish now known as Lydford on Fosse. The parish of West Lydford was part of the hundred of Catsash, while East Lydford was in Somerton Hundred. The modern A37 trunk road follows the route of the ancient Fosse Way through the parish. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Facilities Lydford on Fosse is served by a pub (the Cross Keys), petrol station (with shop) and a motorhome shop. Religious sites The Church of St Mary in East Lydford was built in 1866 by Benjamin Ferrey for the rector, J. J. Moss. It was last used for worship in 1987 and has been privately owned since 1993. The building is Grade II listed, but is disused and derelict, and is described in the Mendip District Council Buildings at Risk Register as being in 'poor' condition and possibly being structurally unsound. Ferrey also built the Anglican parish Church of St Peter on the site of an earlier church in the village of West Lydford.

He received every medal for valor in combat except for the Medal of Honor which was promised to him by General Douglas MacArthur. However, his paperwork was lost and he never received the medal. Military career Drafted in April 1942, he was able to skip basic training due to civilian military training and left the Continental United States in May. Possinger was assigned to B Company, 35th Infantry Regiment, of the 25th Infantry Division. The 25th Infantry was called into Guadalcanal to relieve the 1st Marine Division in November. Possinger, along with the rest of his unit, arrived at Guadalcanal on December 17, 1942. After weeks of heavy fighting, the island was secure. This was the first major victory for American forces and the first piece of real estate the U.S. took back from Japan. The next mission for the 35th Infantry (dubbed ‚ÄúThe Cacti‚Äù) was to seize and secure the island of Vella Lavella in the Northern Solomons. They made their assault on the island on August 15, 1943 and had it secure by September 18 of the same year. Possinger was wounded three times on Vella Lavalla and was awarded the Bronze Star for his heroic actions throughout the campaign in the Northern Solomons. Next up was the island of Luzon in the Philippines. Possinger was hit in the left arm and on March 8, 1945 he was wounded for the fifth and final time; this time he took a bullet to the chest at Belete Pass. He was hit trying to save his buddies who were ambushed. They sent Possinger home after that, saying it was because he was to receive the Medal of Honor.

It is also near the hill Indragiri 7th century Old Kannada inscription on Chandragiri hill, Shravanabelagola History The recorded history surrounding the hill started in 300 BC when last Shruthakevali Bhadrabahu and Chandragupta Maurya visited the place in order to attain kaivalya(beatitude). The small hill derives its name of Chandra because Chandragupta was the first of the rishis who lived and performed penance there. Kalbappu was the early name of the hill and it dominates the history of the town of Shravanabelagola between 3rd century BC and 12th century AD. The Jain traditions link the Maurya Empire Emperor Chandragupta and his teacher Bhadrabahu with this place. Of the total number of 106 memorials found at Shravanabelagola, 92 are located on the small hill. Of these, about 47 memorials of monks, 9 of nuns, and 5 of householders belong to the 7th and 8th century. This points out at the popularity of the custom, and of its extensive prevalence on the small hill. Geography The hill is situated about 3049 feet from mean sea level and 200 feet from the above the ground level and is situated in the northwest entrance of the town. A vast expanse of granite rock, scattered large and small boulders can be found en route to the peak.

Biography Hofmann was the son of a highly educated civil servant, and at the age of seven became a chorister in the chapel of the Empress Elisabeth Christine, where his choral director and teacher was very likely Franti≈°ek T≈Øma. He was also a student later on of Georg Christoph Wagenseil and Giuseppe Trani (violin). His studies included at various points violin, harpsichord and composition. In 1758 Hofmann secured what may have been his first appointment, as \\"musicus\\" at St. Michael's. He is known to have become choral director at St. Peter's Church in 1764 and, in 1766, kapellmeister. In 1769 he became a teacher to the royal family. The position of Kapellmeister at the Cathedral of St. Stephan, a post he acquired in 1772, was among his next responsibilities. At this time he declined the directorship of the Imperial Chapel, but did apply there two years later in 1774, failing in his application. (Giuseppe Bonno became director of the Imperial Chapel instead, which had become open upon the death of Florian Leopold Gassmann.) On 9 May 1791, at his own request, Mozart was appointed assistant-Kapellmeister to Hofmann, an unpaid position. At the time Hofmann was ill and Mozart anticipated becoming Kapellmeister upon Hofmann's death. However, Hofmann survived Mozart and kept his post as Cathedral Kapellmeister until he died.H.C.

The canal link was never constructed. History The Lancaster Canal Company obtained an Act of Parliament (32 Geo. III c. 101) in 1792 to construct a canal linking the towns of Kendal, Lancaster and Preston to the coalfields around Wigan. Coal was to be the chief traffic northwards and limestone southwards. Most of the canal was completed quickly, including the impressive aqueduct across the River Lune near Lancaster, but the part across the wide valley of the River Ribble remained to be built when the construction capital became exhausted. The original plan foresaw an impressive stone aqueduct across the river and up to 32 locks to complete the route. As a temporary measure, the canal company constructed a tramroad to link the two halves and allow revenue traffic to start flowing. Construction took three years. The tramroad In 1794, the canal company engaged the services of William Cartwright, first to supervise the construction of the foundations for the Lune Aqueduct and later as Resident Engineer. John Rennie and William Jessop were the chief engineers to the company, but such was the demand for their services at this time of Canal Mania that they were much in demand elsewhere and Cartwright was solely responsible for the construction of the tramroad. His house in Preston is still extant and now forms the fa√ßade of a new shopping arcade. The five-mile- long tramroad comprised a double-track plateway, except for a short section of single track through a tunnel under Fishergate in Preston, just south of the canal basin. The iron rails were ‚ÄòL‚Äô shaped in section and were spiked to large limestone blocks. The wheels on the wagons were not flanged and it was the vertical section on the iron rails that kept the wheels on the track. The gauge was 4 foot 3 inches (1295 mm) between the verticals, which were on the inside of the track. The wagons were pulled by horses, up to six at a time, and each wagon had a capacity of two tons. Originally there were three inclined planes where the wagons were hauled via stationary steam engines and a continuous chain. The 1960s replica bridge across the Ribble The tramroad crossed the River Ribble on a timber trestle bridge. This structure outlived the tramroad by nearly one hundred years and was replaced by a precast concrete structure to the same design in the 1960s.(Engineering Timelines, 2007) There were many accidents during the life of the tramroad, many involving the inclined planes with wagons running away. As was common on early ‚Äòrailway‚Äô systems, the wagons could be privately owned by the hauliers themselves (known locally as halers) who paid the company a toll to use the tramroad. The last haler to work the tramroad, John Procter, walked the 10-mile return journey twice a day for 32 years. It has been estimated (Barritt, 2000) that he walked or rode nearly during his career on the tramroad, and needed his clogs resoling once per week. Decline and closure In 1813, estimates were prepared to replace the tramroad by a canal but the cost of ¬£160,000 was too much for the company at the time. In 1831 the coming of the Preston and Wigan Railway sounded the death knell for the tramroad and proposals were made to convert it into a railway or amalgamate with the new railway company. This never happened and the tramroad became embroiled in the railway politics of the day.(Barritt, 2000) In 1837 the new Bolton and Preston Railway leased the tramroad as a potential alternative route into Preston that avoided the rival North Union Railway. However, an agreement was concluded between the two parties before this proved necessary. Nevertheless, the lease arrangements were incorporated into the Bolton and Preston Railway‚Äôs Act of Parliament and the ownership of the tramroad passed to the railway. In 1844 the Bolton and Preston merged with the rival North Union Railway and shortly afterwards a branch line to the canal basin in Preston was built. This created a railhead for Wigan coal in Preston and removed the raison d‚Äô√™tre of the tramroad. All that remains of the terminus of the South branch of the Lancaster canal Although the North Union wanted to close the tramroad immediately the canal company objected and they were forced to maintain it in an increasingly decrepit state until the Lancaster Canal Transfer Act of 1864 provided for the canal north of Preston to be leased in perpetuity to the railway and that south of Walton Summit to be leased to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The Act also allowed closure of the tramroad between Preston and Bamber Bridge. In 1872, a land exchange between Preston Corporation and the railway saw the formation between Preston and Carr Wood pass into municipal ownership. This part, including the tramroad bridge over the River Ribble, was turned into a footpath, which remains to the present day. A further Act in 1879 enabled the last part of the tramroad between Bamber Bridge and Walton Summit, to be closed. The north end of the canal was eventually sold to the London & North Western Railway and the Lancaster Canal Company was wound up at the beginning of 1886.(Barritt, 2000) Preserved remains The tunnel under Fishergate is now used to access a car park Remains of the bridge over Garden Street in Preston A well-preserved section of track from the south side of the McKenzie Inn on Station Road in Bamber Bridge was taken up and relaid in Worden Park in Leyland. Plates and stone sleepers are in South Ribble Museum in Leyland and the Harris Museum in Preston. The Harris Museum also has a model of a wagon and a wheel and axle of a wagon recovered from the bed of the River Ribble (Clegg et al., 2001). They had lain there since an accident involving the failure of the endless chain on the Avenham Incline, which caused a train of wagons to run away and plunge into the river at the bottom. A later (>1885?) enlargement of the tunnel under Fishergate (Moss, 1968) continues in use for vehicle access to the Fishergate Shopping Centre car park - it formerly accessed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Butler Street goods yard (Biddle, 1989). Part of a support for a bridge over Garden Street remains. A path on the northern edge of Avenham Park follows the route of the tramway, down the Avenham Incline and across a footbridge over the River Ribble on the site of the original trestle bridge. The footpath continues along the flood plain embankment to the Penwortham Incline. Notes See also *Canals of the United Kingdom *History of the British canal system References * Barritt, S.

There have been sporadic subsequent occurrences. The phenomenon consists of anonymous people placing homemade dog sculptures, typically made of wood (or sometimes plastic, metal or textile) in roundabouts. Occurrences were reported all over Sweden, and the phenomenon also spread to other countries, including Spain after it was mentioned on television. Swedish tabloid paper Expressen even placed one at Piccadilly Circus. History Roundabout dog on the Piccotts End roundabout in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK The roundabout dogs started appearing in Link√∂ping, √ñsterg√∂tland, Sweden after a sculptured dog that was part of the official roundabout installation Cirkulation II () by sculptor Stina Opitz had been vandalised and later removed. The original dog had been made of concrete, and Opitz was planning to make a new version of it after the vandalism, when someone placed a homemade wooden dog on the roundabout. The dog was given a concrete dogbone by another anonymous artist. Soon after the media reported these developments, roundabout dogs started appearing in various places around the country. In some smaller towns where there were no roundabouts, dog sculptures were placed in ordinary intersections with traffic islands. In 2009, similar dogs appeared on some of the roundabouts in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.

It is about long and wide, and flows from Lake Nipigon to Nipigon Bay on Lake Superior at the community of Nipigon, dropping from an elevation of . History The Nipigon River was formerly known for the size and quantity of the brook trout that were to be found there. However, four dams built on the Nipigon led to a major decline in their population. The four dams are as follows: * Cameron Falls Dam built in 1918 * Virgin Falls Dam built in 1925 * Alexander Dam built in 1930 * Pine Portage Dam built in 1950 Modern uses Three hydroelectric dams, Cameron Falls Dam, Alexander Dam, and Pine Portage Dam on the Nipigon provided 2,144 gigawatt- hours in 2000. The river is also a popular fishing destination. Fishing Prince Edward, Prince of Wales talks with river guide Neil McDougall at their camp on the Nipigon River, 1919. In 1915 Dr Cook caught the world record for the largest brook trout, aka speckled trout, or coaster trout. Four years later, Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII and Duke of Windsor), spent time fishing on the Nipigon; a trout that he caught was mounted and today is displayed at the National Archives of Canada. The river also has a run of lake trout, rainbow trout and salmon during various times of the year. Fish that migrate up the river are able to get to the first dam which is located approximately from the mouth of the river system. The reservoir between the dams are good fishery, especially for large speckled trout and lake trout. Fishing starts the first of May until freeze up at the end of November. The river can be accessed from boat, or fished by shore from various strategic locations.

This part of the renal tubule is divided into a thin and thick ascending limb; the thick portion is also known as the distal straight tubule, in contrast with the distal convoluted tubule downstream.  Structure  The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is a direct continuation from the descending limb of loop of Henle, and one of the structures in the nephron of the kidney. The ascending limb has a thin and a thick segment. The ascending limb drains urine into the distal convoluted tubule. The thin ascending limb is found in the medulla of the kidney, and the thick ascending limb can be divided into a part that is in the renal medulla and a part that is in the renal cortex. The ascending limb is much thicker than the descending limb. At the junction of the thick ascending limb and the distal convoluted tubule are a subset of 15-25 cells known as the macula densa that are part of renal autoregulation through the mechanism of tubuloglomerular feedback. Histology As in the descending limb, the epithelium is simple squamous epithelium.Pawlina, Wojciech and Ross, Michael. Histology: A text and Atlas. 5th ed. N.p: Clipping,2006. 663+.Print.  Function  Thin ascending limb The thin ascending limb is impermeable to water; but is permeable to ions allowing for some sodium reabsorption. Na/K-ATPase is expressed at very low levels in this segment and thus this reabsorption is likely through passive diffusion. Salt moves out of the tubule and into the interstitium due to osmotic pressure created by the countercurrent system. Thick ascending limb Functionally, the parts of the ascending limb in the medulla and cortex are very similar. The medullary ascending limb is largely impermeable to water. Sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl‚àí) ions are reabsorbed by active transport. The predominant mechanism of active transport in this segment is through the Na+/K+/Cl‚àí co- transporter NKCC2 as well as the sodium/hydrogen exchanger NHE3. In total this segment accounts for approximately 25-30% of total Na+ reabsorption along the nephron. This is of clinical importance since commonly used \\"loop diuretics\\" act by inhibiting the NKCC2. This active transport enables the kidney to establish an osmotic gradient that is essential to the kidneys ability to concentrate the urine past isotonicity. K+ is passively transported along its concentration gradient through a K+ leak channel in the apical aspect of the cells, back into the lumen of the ascending limb. This K+ \\"leak\\" generates a positive electrochemical potential difference in the lumen. This drives more paracellular reabsorption of Na+, as well as other cations such as magnesium (Mg2+) and importantly calcium Ca2+ due to charge repulsion. This is also the part of the tubule that generates Tamm-Horsfall protein. The function of this protein is not well understood, but is responsible for creating urinary casts.

The parish includes the village of Westhay. History Meare is a marshland village in typical Somerset \\"rhyne\\" country, standing on the site of pre-historic lake dwellings. The site of the Meare Lake Village is marked by groups of mounds. It has been occupied for thousands of years and some of the archaeological finds are now being reported. A 14th-century fish house at Meare was once the abode of Glastonbury Abbey fishermen, who fished the, now drained, Meare Pool. The Manor Farmhouse was built at the same time as the summer residence of the Abbots from Glastonbury Abbey and is now a farmhouse. Along with its outbuildings the farmhouse has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The parish was part of the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wells Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The parish Church of St Mary was formerly in the keeping of Glastonbury Abbey, and dates from 1323. It was built for Abbot Adam of Sodbury, and is a Grade I listed building.

Confusingly, biochemical protocols published between the 1960s and 2000s refer to Shell's Nonidet P-40 as NP-40. Shell's original Nonidet P-40 had a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value of 13.5,TERGITOL NP-9 Surfactant as opposed to 12.9 for the currently available IGEPAL CA-630, indicating that the currently available compound is more potent than the compound used in older publications.

In commission from 1945 until 1957, she saw service in the Pacific, Mediterranean, Home, West Indies and South Atlantic Fleets. Construction The ship was ordered from Charles Hill & Sons of Bristol on 6 March 1943 as Admiralty Job No. J600, and laid down on 8 June 1944 as the Loch Swannay. However the contract was then changed, and the ship was completed to a revised design as a Bay-class anti- aircraft frigate. Veryan Bay was launched on 11 November 1944, and completed on 13 May 1945.

He is known primarily for his semi-autobiographical book about Rasputin. In this work he was supported by Maxim Gorky, since 1902 a friend of Lenin. Gorky hoped that Trufanov's story on Rasputin would discredit the Tsar's family and eventually contribute to the revolutionary propaganda. Biography Rasputin, Hermogen and Iliodor next to each other in 1906. In 1912 Alexandra ordered Hermogen to be banished to a monastery, after beating Rasputin with a crucifix; Iliodor went into exile after the attack by Khioniya Guseva in June 1914. Iliodor during a procession in 1910 Sergei Trufanov was born in stanitsa Mariinskaya and grew up in a small cottage near the Don river as the son of a local deacon. He was one of thirteen children; according to himself five died young of starvation. At the age of ten he went to school in Novocherkassk. At the age of 15 he entered the local theological seminary. Five years later he graduated and went to the capital to attend the St. Petersburg Theological Academy. In 1903 he was ordained a hieromonk under the name Iliodor; two years later he graduated from the academy. There he met Father Gapon. Iliodor worked with the poor and expected that the clergy, not the revolutionaries could change the country. He was discovered by Theofan of Poltava and met Rasputin. Iliodor was appointed a lecturer at the seminary in Jaroslavl, but returned to the capital within a year. He was invited to the Peterhof Palace but scandalized his audience in a sermon, defending a land reform, which should be ordered by the Tsar. The Russian aristocrats and the Most Holy Synod were shocked with his behavior. The Synod decided to ban Iliodor, but Rasputin and the Tsar defended him. Instead Iliodor moved to Volhynia and lived in Pochayiv Lavra, the center of Panslavism. In a paper he attacked the revolutionaries and the Jews.Mad Monk of Russia, Iliodor: Memoirs and Confessions of Sergei Michailovich Trufanoff, Iliodor According to himself Iliodor turned against the right-wing Union of the Russian People and the Black Hundreds movement, because they believed in the Tsar's autocracy. He gained notoriety for attacking the prime-minister Pyotr Stolypin, industrialists, and local politicians. Then he was prohibited to preach by the Most Holy Synod. In 1908 he was rescued by Bishop Hermogen and appointed in Tsaritsyn, where the URP had founded its first branch and Iliodor gathered huge crowds. Iliodor created Holy Spirit Monastery in 1909. In the year after he was forbidden to preach any longer and exiled to Minsk. He was invited to Tsarskoye Selo to meet with the Tsarina; not in the Alexander Palace, but in the house of Anna Vyrubova.J.T. Fuhrmann, p. 69; Iliodor, p. 57. Mad Monk of Russia, Iliodor: Memoirs and Confessions of Sergei Michailovich Trufanoff, Iliodor. Iliodor was allowed to go back to Tsaritsyn on request of Rasputin. Stolypin demanded Iliodor had to be banned to Novosil, and the Tsar agreed, but the abbot escaped and went back to Tsaritsyn. Svyato-Duhov Monastery in Tsaritsyn, built within a year and like a fortress Rasputin In 1909 Iliodor and Grigori Rasputin visited his village by train.Mad Monk of Russia, Iliodor: Memoirs and Confessions of Sergei Michailovich Trufanoff, Iliodor Iliodor began to wonder if Rasputin was a devil or a saint, but defended him against attacks in the press in 1910. In early 1911 Rasputin traveled to the Holy Land. On his way back he visited Tsaritsyn. Iliodor had been invited by the Tsar on 21 May, who asked him not to attack his ministers, but the revolutionaries and the Jews.https://archive.org/stream/madmonkofrussiai00trufuoft#page/102/mode/2up Five days later Iliodor was promoted and became archimandrite. In December 1911 Hermogenes and Iliodor came into conflict with Rasputin, who liked to touch and kiss and had almost free access to the Imperial family. After having been beaten by Hermogen,Out of My Past: Memoirs of Count Kokovtsov, p. 293. ; Felix Yusupov (1952) Lost Splendor in a monastery on Vasilyevsky Island, Rasputin complained to the Imperial couple. Iliodor started a slander and blackmail campaign against Rasputin. Hinting that Alexandra and Rasputin were lovers, he showed Makarov a satchel of letters, one written by the Tsarina and four by her daughters.Out of My Past: Memoirs of Count Kokovtsov, p. 299 The given or stolenM.

In 1912, Iliodor renounced the Russian Orthodox Church, published an apology to Jews, and was defrocked. His monastery was closed; he was banned to the Frolishi monastery in the Volodarsky District, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. He seems to have escaped to Peter Badmayev in St Petersburg. Frolishi monastery In Summer 1914, after an attack on Rasputin by Khioniya Kozmishna Guseva, he fled all the way around the Gulf of Bothnia to Christiania (present-day Oslo), Norway with the help of Grand Duke Nicholas and Maxim Gorki. Rasputin believed Iliodor and Vladimir Dzhunkovsky had organized the attack.Edward Radsinski, Die Geheimakte Rasputin, Albrecht Knaus Verlag, 2000E. Radzinsky, p. 257-258. Guseva, a fanatically religious woman, had been his adherent in earlier years and \\"denied Iliodor's participation, declaring that she attempted to kill Rasputin because he was spreading temptation among the innocent.\\"Russiapedia The local procurator decided to suspend any action against Iliodor for undisclosed reasons,M.

Stolypin was dead, Count Kokovtsov fallen from power, Theofan of Poltava exiled, Bishop Hermogen illegally banished and Iliodor in hiding.G. King (1994), p. 192. Together with Alexei Khvostov he concocted a plan to kill Rasputin early 1916. Then Iliodor tried to bribe the Tsarina with publishing his book on Rasputin.Mad Monk of Russia, Iliodor: Memoirs and Confessions of Sergei Michailovich Trufanoff, Iliodir In June 1916 he sailed to New York. In the lost silent film The Fall of the Romanoffs (1917), Iliodor played himself. In the following he published his book. Casimir Pilenas, in his correspondence with the American Jewish Committee, claimed to be his \\"agent\\". In 1918, he returned to Soviet Russia, offering his services to Lenin, and lived for several years in Tsaritsyn. In 1922 he took his family to NYC, where he became a Baptist and worked as a janitor in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Tower, and spent the remainder of his life in New York City.

However the contract was changed on 5 October 1944, and the ship was completed to a revised design as a Bay-class anti-aircraft frigate, launched on 16 December 1944, and completed on 30 July 1945 with the pennant number K633. Service history Pacific Fleet Whitesand Bay was commissioned under the command of Lieutenant-Commander B.C. Longbottom for service with the Pacific Escort Force. After sea trials at Tobermory in August, and weapons testing at Portland in September, she sailed on 5 October in company with her sister ship . After exercises with ships of Mediterranean Fleet she sailed to Hong Kong, arriving in December 1945. Whitesand Bay was initially deployed in the South China Sea for patrols and trade defence, including the escort of colliers from French Indochina to Hong Kong. In May 1946 she sailed to Auckland, New Zealand to refit, returning to Hong Kong in August to resume patrol and escort duties. In September she was deployed in the Formosa Strait, returning to Singapore in December. In February 1947 she was deployed at Hong Kong for trade defence and patrol duties, and took part in Fleet exercises.

There Lieutenant-Commander R.F.C. O'Sullivan took command of Whitesand Bay and prepared for her new duty which was to intercept, board and detain ships carrying illegal Jewish immigrants to Palestine.

Korean War Whitesand Bay proceeded to Sasebo, Japan, to join the British U.N. Task Group. As part of elaborate deception operations intended to make the enemy believe that a major U.N. amphibious invasion actually planned for Incheon on 15 September 1950 would take place at Kunsan, she landed Royal Marine Commandos and United States Army special forces troops on the docks at Kunsan, with those forces making sure that the enemy noticed their visit.

Dutch is spoken as a native language by about 60% of the population, most of them being bilingual with Sranan Tongo, Hindustani, Javanese, and other languages. Nevertheless, Dutch is the sole official language of the country. Surinamese Dutch is easily intelligible with other forms of Dutch. Furthermore, as opposed to other languages that have different forms in the Americas (e.g., American English vs. British English) the regulation and thus standardised spelling of the Dutch language is done through a joint Dutch- Belgian-Surinamese organization, the Dutch Language Union, and thus has no regional differences regarding spelling. Suriname has been an associate member of this Nederlandse Taalunie since 2005. Therefore, many typical Surinamese words were added to the official Wordlist of Standard Dutch, known as \\"the Green Booklet\\" (Groene Boekje). Surinamese Dutch is generally easily distinguishable from other standardized forms of Dutch due to many loanwords and phrases adopted from other languages spoken in Suriname. Phonology In Surinamese Dutch, the voiced fricatives have completely merged into the voiceless fricatives . History Dutch was introduced in what is now Suriname when Paramaribo and its environs became a Dutch colony. The remainder of Suriname, however, remained in British hands. Only after the Dutch had lost New Netherland (now New York) to the British did they in exchange receive the rest of Suriname. Then, Dutch became the language of communication between Native Surinamese, African slaves, and the Dutch colonial administration. In 1876, the language also became official in the Surinamese education system, and new immigrants from British India and the Dutch East Indies also picked up the language. The immigrants also added features to spoken Dutch that are not present in the original European variants of Dutch.

Green Bay's coach, Curly Lambeau, learned the Notre Dame Box while playing for Knute Rockne in the late 1910s. Rockne learned it from Jesse Harper, who learned it from coach Amos Alonzo Stagg. It contained two ends, and four backs. The formation often featured an unbalanced line where the center (that is, the player who snapped the ball) was not strictly in the center of the line, but close to the weakside. Players line up in T formation then shift to a box formation.http://www.stetson.edu/law/lawreview/media/remebering-a-great- dean-harold-l-tom-sebring.pdf The Notre Dame Box differed from the traditional single-wing formation in that the line was balanced and the halfback who normally played the \\"wing\\" in the single-wing was brought in more tightly, with the option of shifting out to the wing. These two changes made the backs' formation resemble a square (hence \\"box\\") and made the formation less predictable, allowing offenses to run more easily to the \\"weak\\" side. Additionally, the halfback became a more viable runner than in the single-wing and the quarterback, normally just a blocking back in the single-wing, could become a passer since the center could snap the ball directly to him. The Notre Dame Box relied on a great deal of deception, caused by backs shifting frequently, rather than the pure power of the single-wing. Teams would often adopt the Notre Dame Box if they lacked a true \\"triple threat\\" tailback, necessary for effective single-wing use. Rockne's innovations with this formation involved using complicated backfield shifts and motion to confuse defenses, and adapting it as a passing formation. The formation was originally designed as a brute-force running formation, since it had seven players to one side of the center and only two on the other. Although modern use of this offensive formation is largely defunct and exterminated among college and professional teams, several high school football teams across the United States have revived the Notre Dame Box offense and have been highly efficient and successful. Three notable high schools that successfully implemented the Notre Dame Box offense extensively are Western Harnett High School in Lillington, North Carolina, Nauset Regional High School in Eastham, Massachusetts, and Isabella High School in Maplesville, Alabama. Professional use The Packers, using the Notre Dame Box almost exclusively, won three straight NFL titles from 1929‚Äì1931. From 1936 through 1945, Green Bay made use of the Notre Dame Box to exploit Don Hutson's receiving ability. Bringing the halfback in tight allowed Hutson to split out from the line, making him an even more potent threat. Hutson, impossible to cover one-on-one by any defensive back of his day, averaged a touchdown every five times he caught the ball, a mark that no receiver has rivaled in NFL history. Green Bay added three more championships employing the Notre Dame Box after 1933 (when official championship games began), beating the Boston Redskins 21-6 in 1936, defeating the New York Giants 27-0 in 1939, and beating the Giants again in 1944 by a score of 14-7. Green Bay tailbacks of those years were among the first NFL passers to post \\"modern\\" numbers. Arnie Herber was the first NFL player to pass for over 1,000 yards in 1936, throwing for 1239 yards and 11 touchdowns. Of that, 526 yards and 8 touchdowns were to Hutson. In 1939, Herber and Cecil Isbell combined for 1856 yards passing and 14 touchdowns. In 1941, Isbell broke Herber's single season record with 1470 yards passing and 15 touchdowns; he bettered his own marks in 1942 with 2021 yards passing and 24 touchdowns. 1942 was also the year Don Hutson shattered his own NFL records with 1211 yards receiving and 17 touchdowns, all in 11 games. The Chicago Bears's and Clark Shaughnessy's Stanford Indians success with a modernized version of the T-formation in the 1940s eventually led to the demise of the Notre Dame Box, as well as all single-wing variants. The Packers finally switched to the T-formation, after Don Hutson had retired, in 1947. No major NCAA or NFL team has used this formation since and much of the knowledge (i.e. playbooks and, if it ever existed, film) associated with this formation is no longer available. Modern use of the Notre Dame Box Use of the Notre Dame Box in modern times has been limited in part due to changes in football rulebooks regarding motion. The frequent shifts in the backfield that are employed by the system are still legal, but teams must now set themselves in a formation for at least one second before snapping the ball or sending a player into motion. This motion player must be moving backward or laterally. Canadian football never adopted these changes, and (even though it is not used in that variant of the sport) the original version of the system is still legal. In the late 1990s, Western Harnett High School of Lillington, North Carolina was featured on ESPN after their program experienced a major turnaround credited to their employment of the Notre Dame Box.Old-Time Football Earns Western Harnett National Attention :: WRAL.com The head coach of that team, Travis Conner, later moved on to Jacksonville High School in nearby Jacksonville, North Carolina and installed the Notre Dame Box there, as well. He then moved onto Bunker Hill High School and completely transformed their football program, with the new system Bunker Hill produced 3 top 10 rushers with the leader being Reggie Davis who rushed for a single season near 2,000 yards. In 2010, Keith Kenyon took over the head coaching duties of the Varsity Football team at Nauset Regional High School in Massachusetts. His single wing offense is largely based on the Notre Dame Box formation. Since his arrival, he has taken a downtrodden Nauset team to a playoff contender in his first 2 years. Nauset went 6-5 in 2010, 8-3 in 2011, and 9-2 in 2012 due to the success of the Notre Dame Box. Also during the 2011 season, Nauset played in the Atlantic Coast League Championship game on Thanksgiving Day against rival, and eventual undefeated D-II State Champion, Dennis-Yarmouth, for a chance to qualify for the playoffs. In 2012, Nauset once again played for the Atlantic Coast League Championship against Plymouth South. Nauset came into the game undefeated, but ultimately lost 13-12 on a last second hook-and-ladder pass, barely missing out on the MIAA State Playoffs for the second year in a row. Before coach Kenyon arrived at Nauset in 2010, the football team had a combined record of 5-46 since 2005, including back-to-back winless seasons in 2005 and 2006, and also a 27-game losing streak from 2004‚Äì2007. Kenyon's single wing Notre Dame Box undoubtedly turned around the Nauset football program and turned them into one of the most dangerous and prolific teams in Eastern Massachusetts. The formation is very prevalent in the north of England, and is used by many teams in BUAFL due to the lack of talented passers as well at the unpredictable weather conditions.

In commission from 1946 to 1965, she served in the Mediterranean Fleet as a Despatch Vessel for the Commander-in-Chief. Although principally employed for the use as a yacht by the CinC, Surprise was also deployed in its operational role as an anti-aircraft frigate. The archaic term \\"Despatch Vessel\\" was replaced by \\"Flag Frigate\\" in 1961. Construction The ship was originally ordered from the Smiths Dock Company of South Bank, Middlesbrough on 25 January 1943 as the Loch Carron. However the contract was changed in 1944, and the ship was laid down as Admiralty Job No J4788 on 21 April 1944 to a revised design as a Bay-class anti-aircraft frigate. She was launched on 14 March 1945 as Gerrans Bay, but after the end of the war the plans were changed again and the ship was converted to a Despatch Vessel for use by the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet. The aft twin gun mounting was removed and replaced by offices and accommodation for the CinC and his staff. The ship was completed on 7 September 1946 and renamed Surprise with the pennant number K346. Service history After sea trials Surprise was commissioned in September 1946, and sailed to Valletta, Malta, where she remained with the ships of the Mediterranean Fleet for exercises and visits throughout the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, with periodic refits at HM Dockyard, Valletta. In November 1952 Surprise returned to Portsmouth. As the Royal Yacht was still under construction Surprise was selected for conversion for use by Queen Elizabeth II in the Coronation Review. The forward twin 4 inch mounting was replaced by a special viewing platform. The work was completed in March 1953, and after trials in the English Channel, the ship was deployed at Portsmouth. She then sailed to the Solent and took part in the Fleet Review by Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June 1953.Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden All members of ship's company were subsequently awarded Coronation Medal. The Royal Crest fitted in front of the bridge was retained as a permanent feature to commemorate her service. Surprise returned to Malta in July to resume her previous duties. In 1961 a decision was made to retain the ship in service as the Flag Frigate as long as possible without a major refit, and the complement was reduced to 80. In late 1964 Surprise returned to the UK, arriving at Portsmouth on 12 December. In January 1965 she was decommissioned and placed on the Disposal List. She was sold to BISCO for breaking-up by P&W; McLellan at Bo'ness where she arrived in tow on 29 June 1965. No other warship has since been deployed for use by the CinC Mediterranean as a Flag Frigate.

She was originally laid down as the vessel Loch Scamdale, and re-ordered as Dundrum Bay while building. She was completed as Alert, an Admiralty Yacht for command and gunboat diplomacy duties in the Mediterranean and Far Eastern stations. Alert was sold to be broken up for scrap in October 1971. Service history Alert was commissioned for service on 24 October 1946, and arrived at Singapore, her home port, on 29 November, to join the British Pacific Fleet. She spent the next 18 years carrying out an extensive series of visits to ports in China, Japan, Malaya, Vietnam, Borneo, and the Philippines, as well as being deployed operationally as a frigate in support of anti-insurgent operations during the Malayan Emergency, and taking part in various joint and multi-national fleet exercises. In late 1951 Alert was temporarily deployed with United Nations Task Group to carry out naval fire support operations off the west coast of Korea. In October 1952 she sailed to the north-west coast of Western Australia to take part in \\"Operation Hurricane\\", the first British atom bomb test.

Shen Shaomin's art is designed to make people think about the world around them and the impact that they have on the world, as individuals and as members of the human race. He first became famous for creating fantastic creatures out of skeletons. These include a giant mosquito, a centaur, and a three-headed beast. In an interview from December 2006, Shen said, \\"Some people seem to think that I make only one type of work. But they are only works from one stage of my life. In each stage I choose a different material.\\" He has since passed through many stages of artistic creation. Today, his works include skeletons of mythical creatures, experimental fields (also constructed out of bones), bonsai, the Summit installation, Fighter X, and Kowtow Pump. Early years Shen grew up in A Cheng Town, Heilongjiang Province. His father was a carpenter. As a child, he was fascinated by mechanics, and he liked to deconstruct and reconstruct objects. Shen studied art history for three years at Harbin College of Education. His artistic career began with print-making in 1979. He later switched to making soft sculptures out of defective fabric prints from a textile printing and dying factory. He visited Australia in 1989 for an international print conference; he returned a month later for an exhibition, and then returned again in 1990. Shen returned to China while working on his skeletal creatures because of the many animal protection laws in Australia preventing him from acquiring bones. Unknown Creatures Each creature from Shen's original set of bone sculptures bears the title of \\"Unknown Creature No. __\\". (The pieces are numbered according to when they were created). They include a giant mosquito, a centaur, and a three-headed beast. Each skeleton consists of bones from real animals, bone meal, and glue. The bones come from creatures such as rats, rabbits, oxen, monkeys, and even humans. (He did not kill any humans to acquire the bones. He bought them from the Institute of Anatomy of the Harbin Medical School. The only animals killed were the rats for the Two Thousand Rats Project.) To create each creature, Shen collected the bones from a variety of animals, mixed them together to give them autonomy from the original creature, and then reconstructed a new skeleton that bore no resemblance to the original creature. By creating his sculptures in this manner, Shen's skeletons gained an appearance of authenticity, encouraging viewers to view them as if they were real skeletons of extinct creatures such as they might encounter in a museum. Shen hoped that this kind of presentation would precipitate discussion about current issues such as genetic engineering. He says that he is \\"entirely convinced that scientists are capable of creating dragons\\" and points out that each element of his creatures comes from the bones of actual animals, thus demonstrating that the building blocks for creating such fantastical creatures already exist. Shen's first work in this series, titled \\"Unknown Creature No. 1\\", also known as \\"Three-Headed Monster\\", is a skeleton of a beast with a long body, eight legs, and three heads made of cow skulls. Every bone is engraved with writing from the Koran, the Bible, and the Buddhist Sutra. These writings are jumbled to create an appearance of absurdity. The three heads look in different directions, although they share one body, thus hinting at the conflicts that religion can incite. Fighter X Fighter X connects the past, present, and future. Shen got the idea for this work when he was perusing a second-hand market and found confidential plans for the military aircraft Fighter-6. It reminded him of his childhood fascination with mechanics and weaponry. He created it as a model of the ideal military aircraft. It highlights the deadly, brutal nature of weapons of war by exposing the machinery beneath the metal exterior. It also questions the dream many developing countries have of creating the latest military weapons. The model is five meters long. It was shown at an exhibition from 9 September to 21 October 2007. Bonsai series Shen began his bonsai series in 2007. He created these bonsai by using wires, pulleys, cages, and other tools to make them appear tortured. He did this as a commentary on the brutality with which humans control their environment. It was also a commentary on how humans control each other, as a boss controls an employee and a parent or school controls a child. As Michael Young points out, the wires and pulleys on Shen's plants are ‚Äúimplements of torture and the props on which the organism depends to survive.‚Äùhttp://www.freynorris.com/media/Art_Asia_Pacific_Shen_Shaomin_2011.pdf Shen was inspired to create these bonsai while looking for books about Chinese foot binding. During his research, he happened upon a manual detailing the process of bonsai-making and recognised its similarities to foot binding: They both drag and twist limbs to make them serve human interests.http://www.blackbookmag.com/art/shen-shaomin-at-the-eli-klein- gallery-1.25488 In an interview, Shen said, ‚ÄúI think the process of bonsai- making is basically the abuse of plants. You grow a sapling, then twist it to make it grow into artificial shapes. Despite the whole deforming process being extremely cruel, people find the bonsai beautiful.‚Äù According to Shen, each tree took at least ten years to grow. He enlisted the help of many people from the Anhui province, as bonsai growing is a very common practice in that region. Shen Shaomin, Bonsai Project No. 1: Tiananmen Reconstruction Shen's Tiananmen Reconstruction Project, titled \\"Project No. 1\\", is a wooden model of the Tiananmen gate, re-designed so that it is twice as large as Tiananmen as it now stands. It is \\"accompanied by precise and detailed blueprints, construction progress photos, stills and an animated film of the interior.\\" It was doubled in size to highlight the Chinese tendency to create oversize, extravagant buildings that stand in stark contrast to the poverty of the population. Many of the buildings surrounding Tiananmen are larger or more extravagant than Tiananmen itself, despite their lesser importance. Thus, Shen created this model to show how much larger and more extravagant Tiananmen would need to become to maintain its appearance in relation to these other buildings. Shen's version includes underground passageways, soldiers, and tanks. In addition, one room is set aside for soldiers to receive massages from young women wearing cute outfits.https://www.flickr.com/photos/joepdegraaff/2476794756/in/photostream/ Shen says that ‚Äú[o]nly a Tiananmen of this scale could match the scale of China's modern urban development\\". I Sleep on Top of Myself This series is composed of several hyperreal silicone animals stripped of their fur, including a cat, a chicken, pigs, sheep, and a lamb (among others). Each lies on a bed of its own fur, wool and feathers, arranged on top of a mound of salt. Each animal has a mechanical respiratory system, giving the sculptures an appearance of life. This series was shown at Shen's solo exhibition, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" in 2011 at 4A Centre for Contemporary Asian Art, Sydney. The exhibition's title refers to the work's focus on themes of evolution and uncertainty, and particularly emphasises the impact of humans in the world as a consequence of their search for freedom and progress.

He promises that his culture will survive if all Chicano people stand proud and demand acceptance. The Chicano movement inspired much new poetry. I Am Joaquin is one of the earliest and most widely read works associated with the movement. In its entirety, the poem describes the then modern dilemma of Chicanos in the 1960s trying to assimilate with American culture while trying to keep some semblance of their culture intact for future generations, then proceeds to outline 2000 years of Mexican and Mexican-American history, highlighting the different, often opposing strains that make up the Chicano heritage.

Palazzo Bianco () is one of the main buildings of the center of Genoa, Italy. It is situated at 11, via Garibaldi (known at one time as Strada Nuova, and before that, Via Aurea). It contains the Gallery of the White Palace, one of the larger city art galleries, and together with those of its neighbors Palazzo Rosso and Palazzo Doria Tursi, it forms part of the Strada Nuova Museums, a cluster of museums at that end of the street.  History  Constructed between 1530 and 1540 by Luca Grimaldi, a member of the House of Grimaldi, one of the most important Genoese families, in 1658 the palace passed into the possession of the De Franchi Toso family, and in 1711 it was given by its inheritor Federico de Franchi Toso, to Maria Durazzo Brignole- Sale, his main creditor. The new owners, between 1714 and 1716, carried out a decisive restoration of the building, adapting it to the tastes of the age. It subsequently earned the name White for the clear color of its exterior decoration. In 1899, Maria Brignole Sale, the Duchess of Galliera and the last member of the family, divested the palace to become municipal property and thus destined it to become a public gallery.  The gallery  \\"For the formation of a public gallery\\": with these words, in her testament of 1884, the Duchess dedicated the Gallery of the Palace as a public space, with the intention to increase its collection yet further. This constituted the first nucleus of the civic museum. After 1887, the gallery was enriched by the purchase of numerous private collections. It has since benefited from a transformation due to reordering of the collections and the post-war reconstruction of the palace, curated by Orlando Grosso, Caterina Marcenaro and the architect Franco Albini, and from the inward transfer of sculpture and fresco from other museums and galleries. The gallery offers a panorama of European painting from the 12th century to the 17th century, with a large prevalence of Genoese, Flemish, French and Spanish painters. Of the 13th and 16th century, works are shown by authors such as Barnaba da Modena, Ludovico Brea and Luca Cambiaso (including La Madonna della candela). 16th-century paintings include work by Paolo Veronese from the Venetian school, and Filippino Lippi of Florence. Dutch and Flemish paintings from the 16th to 18th century feature Rubens (including Venus and Mars) and Van Dyck (including Vertummo and Pomona). Notable Spanish artists of the 17th century included are Zurbar√°n, Murillo and Ribera. The activity of the Genoese painters of the 17th and 18th centuries is documented from the works of Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, Giovanni Andrea Ansaldo, Bernardo Strozzi, Valerio Castello, Domenico Piola, Paolo Girolamo Piola, Gregorio De Ferrari and Alessandro Magnasco.

Incidents  1979 In 1979, police arrested a man named Cengiz Ayhan in Mersin on charges of being the leader of the Turkish Revenge Brigade. Ayhan denied the charges and claimed he was falsely accused of involvement in the group due to his opposition to leftist groups in Turkey. 1993 According to Human Rights Watch, murders of parliamentary deputy Mehmet Sincar and the journalist Ferhat Tepe in 1993 have been carried out in Tƒ∞T's name. Later, it was found that Mehmet Sincar was assassinated by Turkish Hezbollah, who were aiming to assassinate Nizamettin Toƒüu√ß. 1996 In 1996, it is reported that they were involved with the murder of Turkish Cypriot journalist Kutlu Adalƒ±.Nancy J.

He was a prosecutor in the trial that followed the Abraham Lincoln assassination. He was appointed to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers in 1866, to rank from March 13, 1865. Early life Burnett was born in Youngstown, Ohio, in 1838. He was the son of Henry Burnett (1801‚Äì1876), an abolitionist, and Nancy (n√©e Jones) Burnett (d. 1880). His paternal grandfather, Samuel Burnett, a native of Morristown, New Jersey was, at one time, prominent and influential. He as educated had a considerable fortune, but lost most of his property during the Revolutionary War, along with Robert Morris, and emigrated west to Ohio around 1798. He was also a descendant of William Burnett, a colonial governor of New York and New Jersey. He was determined not to become a farmer, he ran away from home to get an education. He attended Chester Academy and, later, Hiram College where he was taught by later President James A. Garfield. In 1855, he began his studies at Ohio State National Law School, in Poland, Ohio, graduating in 1859. Following his graduation, he begins reading law with Judge Benjamin F. Hoffman, law partner of David Tod, who later served as Governor of Ohio. He was admitted to the bar in 1860, and began practicing in Warren, Ohio. Career In 1861 when the Civil War broke out, Burnett joined the 2nd Ohio Cavalry, where he rose to the rank of major in 1862. In this capacity he commanded 400 cavalry soldiers during an operation into the Oklahoma Territory, and defended the actions of a colonel who placed General James Blunt under arrest.Joshua E. Kastenberg, Law in War, Law as War: Brigadier General Joseph Holt and the Judge Advocate General‚Äôs Department in the Civil War and Early Reconstruction, 1861-1865 (Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2011), 139 After being trampled by a horse and seriously injured in 1863, however, he transferred to the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Department of the Ohio, working for Joseph Holt, the Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army. In 1865, he was appointed brevet colonel in the Judge Advocate Corps. Lincoln assassination trial Henry Burnett (right) along with John Bingham (left) and Joseph Holt (center) were the three judges in charge of the Lincoln assassination trial.Brig. Gen. Henry Lawrence Burnett After the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, Burnett was called upon by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to be an Assistant Judge Advocate General. Along with him were John Bingham and Joseph Holt, the Judge Advocate General. The accused conspirators where George Atzerodt, David Herold, Lewis Powell, Samuel Arnold, Michael O'Laughlen, Edman Spangler, Samuel Mudd and Mary Surratt. The trial began on May 10, 1865. The three spent nearly two months in court, awaiting a verdict from the jury. Holt and Bingham attempted to obscure the fact that there were two plots. The first plot was to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the Confederate prisoners the Union had. The second was to assassinate Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward to throw the government into chaos. It was important for the prosecution not to reveal the existence of a diary taken from the body of Lincoln's assassin John Wilkes Booth. The diary made it clear that the assassination plan dated from 14 April. The defence surprisingly did not call for Booth's diary to be produced in court. Holt was accused of withholding evidence, but it was never proven. On June 29, the eight were found guilty for their involvement in the conspiracy to kill Lincoln. Arnold, O'Laughlen and Mudd were sentenced to life in prison, Spangler six years in prison and Atzerodt, Herold, Paine and Surratt were to hang. They were executed July 7, 1865. Surratt was the first woman in American history to be executed. O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Arnold, Spangler, and Mudd were pardoned by Andrew Johnson in early 1869. Following the completion of the trial, in October 1865, Burnett asked to be mustered out on December 1, 1865, which was granted. Senator John Sherman and Holt asked for him to be appointed a brevet brigadier general, which he accepted in May 1866. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Burnett for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 741. Post-Civil War career In late 1865, he moved to New York City, where he resumed the practice of law with Judge Thomas W. Bartley, former Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court and governor of Ohio, until 1869. Following his practice in New York, Burnett and his second wife moved back to Ohio, where he then practiced law with Jacob Dolson Cox, another former governor, and John F. Follett, who later served as a U.S. Representative, until 1872, when he started a practice in New York with Edwin W. Stoughton. Burnett again moved to New York, this time in Buffalo, where he served as counsel to the Buffalo and Erie Railroad (where his father-in-law was treasurer), until 1874. After the railroad, he formed several law practices in New York with various prominent men, including Emott, Burnett & Hammond (with former judge James Emott, Henry B. Hammond, and Charles C. Emott in 1875), which litigated for and against the Railways, Emott, Burnett & Kidder (with Camillus George Kidder in 1877), Bristow, Peet, Burnett, & Opdyke (with Benjamin Bristow, a former Secretary of the Treasury, William Peet, and W. S. Opdyke in 1878), and Burnett & Whitney (with Edward Baldwin Whitney in 1883). He was notable involved in representing the English bondholders in the Emma Silver Mine litigation. In 1898, President William McKinley, his close friend, appointed Burnett federal district attorney for the southern district of New York. Upon completion of his four-year term, he was reappointed by McKinley's successor, Theodore Roosevelt, for another four-year term in 1901, which he served in until his retirement in 1906. Personal life On October 27, 1858, Burnett married Grace \\"Kitty\\" Hoffman (1842‚Äì1864), the daughter of Benjamin F. Hoffman, a judge. Together, they were the parents of: * Grace Hoffman Burnett (1860‚Äì1945), who married Baron Victor Siegmund von Oertzen (1854‚Äì1934), a Maj. Gen. in the Imperial German army, in 1878.

She died, childless, in Bad Doberan. * Catharine \\"Kitty\\" Cleveland Burnett (b. 1864), After his first wife's death in 1864, he married Sarah Gibson Lansing (1846‚Äì1877), the daughter of Brig. Gen. Henry Livingston Lansing (1818‚Äì1889), treasurer of the Buffalo and Erie Railroad, and Catharine Olivia (n√©e Gibson) Lansing (1818‚Äì1897), on September 4, 1867. Her paternal grandfather was Barent Bleecker Lansing and her maternal grandparents were Henry Bicker Gibson (1783‚Äì1863), banker and president of the Rochester and Syracuse Railroad, and one of the richest men in Western New York, and Sarah (n√©e Sherman) Gibson (herself the aunt of William Watts Sherman). Before her death in 1877, they were the parents of: * Catherine Olivia Gibson Burnett (1873‚Äì1934), who married Robert Jewett Mercur (1854‚Äì1929) in 1895. They divorced and she married John Evans Bell (1864‚Äì1952). Her last marriage was to Robert Meade Van Deusen. * Lansing Burnett (1869‚Äì1893), who died unmarried. After his second wife's death and burial at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo in 1877, he married for the third and final time to Agnes Suffern Tailer (1858‚Äì1932) on January 31, 1882, at the Church of the Ascension at Fifth Avenue and 10th Street in Manhattan. She was the daughter of Edward Neufville Tailer, a prominent New York merchant and banker, and the granddaughter of Thomas Suffern and Edward Neufville Tailer, Sr. (descendants of William Tailer, colonial governor of Massachusetts). The guests at their wedding included Mr. and Mrs. William H. Vanderbilt, William and Alva Vanderbilt, Cornelius and Alice Claypoole Vanderbilt, William Seward and Eliza Vanderbilt Webb, Gen. James Watson Webb, Ogden and Mary Wilson Goelet, Col. and Mrs. Delancey Kane, and others. Together, they were the parents of: * Henry Lawrence Burnett, Jr. (1882‚Äì1918), a Columbia University graduate who served as a U.S. Marine aboard the U.S.S. Connecticut and died after a fall down the stairs at his home. * Edward Neufville Tailer Burnett (1885‚Äì1966), a Yale University graduate who moved to Coachella, California. * Robert Suffern Tailer Burnett (1895‚Äì1895), who dies young. He died on January 4, 1916, at his home, 7 East 12th Street, in New York City. He had been ill for the previous year with pneumonia, traveling between his city home and country home. After a large funeral, he was interred in Slate Hill Cemetery in Goshen. Society life In 1892, both Burnett and his wife Agnes were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. He was a member of the Metropolitan Club, the Century Association, Union Club, the Colonial Club, and the Goshen Driving Club. He also served as past president of the Ohio Society of New York, for four years, and the Loyal Legion. Seeking a country home away from the city, Burnett and his wife purchased a horse-breeding farm in Goshen, New York, known as \\"Hillside Farm,\\" where he raced his stock on the amateur circuit. The 193-acre estate was sold in 1917.

She was completed to deal with the large numbers of uncharted wrecks and mines around the British Isles as a result of World War II. For this purpose she was fitted for minesweeping. She was named for the pioneering Hydrographer of the Admiralty Alexander Dalrymple (1737‚Äì1808). Construction The ship was originally ordered from William Pickersgill & Sons Ltd. of Southwick, Sunderland, on 25 January 1943 as the Loch Glass. However the contract was changed in 1944, and the ship was laid down as Admiralty Job Number 4795 on 29 April 1944 to a revised design as a Bay-class anti-aircraft frigate, and launched on 12 April 1945 as Luce Bay. After launching the contract was terminated and the ship was towed to Devonport Dockyard for completion, but while fitting out it was decided to complete her as a survey ship. In January 1947 her name was changed to Dalrymple and her pennant number to A302. She was completed on 10 February 1948. Four vessels, originally intended as were converted to survey ships. HMS Dalrymple was named for Alexander Dalrymple (1737‚Äì1808) the first Hydrographer of the Royal Navy. The other three were Dampier [after explorer of Australia William Dampier (1651‚Äì1715)], Cook [after the historic figure of Captain James Cook (1728‚Äì1779)] and Owen (after William Fitzwilliam Owen (1774‚Äì1857) RN commander and a global explorer]. Service history Dalrymple was commissioned for service on 10 February 1948 and after sea trials, sailed for the Mediterranean. She spent much of her career in the Persian Gulf, often with sister ship , as well as carrying our extensive surveys of the Grand Harbour at Valletta, the Malta Channel and the Strait of Sicily. She also spent some time in the Indian Ocean, mostly working around Zanzibar. During \\"Operation Musketeer\\" (the Suez invasion) in late 1956, she was deployed at Port Said, clearing obstructions from the Suez Canal. In 1957 Dalrymple operated off the West Coast of Scotland, carrying out trials of a new radio-location system, before being extensively refitted, with improved radar, working spaces, messing and crew accommodation. Dalrymple then returned to the Persian Gulf for further surveys. She also operated off Cyprus in 1962, and served as Guard ship at Gan in the Maldives in early 1963. She then returned to the UK, remaining in home waters and surveying the North-West Approaches, particularly around Rockall and the coast of Northern Ireland. The ship sailed into Plymouth on 28 November 1965 for her final return after 17 years surveying service. She was put into Reserve on 2 February 1966 and placed on Disposal List. Dalrymple was sold to Portugal in March 1966, who had already bought four other frigates of the same class (, , and ), and renamed NRP Afonso de Albuquerque. She continued to be used as a survey ship, operating on the Portuguese coast and around the Azores and the Madeira Islands. Decommissioned on 14 January 1983, the ship was used as an accommodation ship at Lisbon Dockyard up until 1988. She was expended as a target in July 1994.

The three sisters married the most important historical figures ‚Äì Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek and K'ung Hsiang- hsi ‚Äì in the founding of the Republic of China, making their family the focal point of every major decision made in modern Chinese history. Directed by Mabel Cheung, the film starred Maggie Cheung, Michelle Yeoh and Vivian Wu as the sisters. It was written by Mabel Cheung's husband Alex Law, they frequently collaborate. Plot The film opens with a scene of the three Soong sisters in their childhood in the late Qing dynasty. Their father, Charlie Soong, demonstrates the wealth and prestige of his family by running one of the most successful printing businesses. The sisters later travel abroad to attend Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, United States. Of the three sisters, the eldest, Soong Ai-ling, is the first to get married in 1914. Her husband is K'ung Hsiang-hsi, a wealthy banker and descendant of Confucius. Sun Yat-sen is a fugitive of the weakening Qing government and he lives in exile in Japan. He weds Soong Ching-ling, despite stern opposition from Charlie Soong. After the Qing dynasty is overthrown by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, Sun becomes the Republic of China's first provisional president and founds the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party). Sun dies of liver cancer in 1925 and leaves his wife with his dying wish of Chinese reunification. Chiang Kai- shek succeeds Sun Yat-sen as the new chief of the Kuomintang. In 1927, he marries Soong Mei-ling, the youngest of the three sisters. The Chiang couple oppose the Communist Party. The widowed Soong Ching-ling often quarrels with the family, accusing Chiang Kai-shek and his followers of persecuting the Communists and hindering the Chinese reunification. She leaves the Kuomintang and openly voices dissent against Chiang. The three sisters were hardly reunited again, except at their parents' deathbeds and on other special occasions. While the Kuomintang and Communists are fighting with each other, the Empire of Japan takes advantage of the situation to invade China in the 1930s. In 1936, Chiang Kai-shek is kidnapped by Zhang Xueliang in the Xi'an Incident. He is forced to make peace with the Communists and focus on dealing with the Japanese invaders, leading to the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Chinese Civil War continues after the Japanese surrender in 1945 until around late 1949. The film ends with actual footage of the Kuomintang relocating the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan, and a quick glimpse of Communist leader Mao Zedong proclaiming the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949 in Beijing. Cast * Maggie Cheung as Soong Ching-ling * Michelle Yeoh as Soong Ai-ling * Vivian Wu as Soong Mei-ling * Winston Chao as Sun Yat-sen * Wu Hsing-kuo as Chiang Kai-shek * Jiang Wen as Charlie Soong * Elaine Jin as Ni Kwei-tsen (Mrs Soong) * Niu Zhenhua as K'ung Hsiang-hsi * Liu Jin as Zhang Xueliang Production note The film premiered an the Berlin International Film Festival in 1997. While the focus is on the politics and political figures of the Republic of China, the film is heavily influenced by Chinese politics in the 1990s. Its release in 1997 coincided with the British transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. The desire to start relations on favorable grounds may have created some biased screenwriting, even though the perspective will vary depending on the audience. Lines such as \\"Before we were slaves of Old China. Now we are slaves of slaves of Old China\\" may have multiple meanings. The film seems to suggest that regardless of past differences and conflicts, there were strong ties that prevailed because of familial love. Another feature worth noting is the characterisation of historical figures. Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling and Zhang Xueliang are portrayed as noble individuals while Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling are portrayed less favourably. A reason for this may be that filming took place in Beijing, where the Chinese government imposed rules on the portrayal of controversial figures such as Chiang Kai-shek. In fact, director Mabel Cheung has stated that in the 14 minutes that were cut from the final release, there were scenes of romance between Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling. The Soong Sisters presents one interpretation of the 1936 Xi'an Incident as the event was never documented. Other pivotal moments include the founding of the Republic of China in 1911, the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition in 1926‚Äì27 against the Beiyang government and other warlords, and the 1931 Mukden Incident which marked the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The film was not released in cinemas in the United States and United Kingdom. Perspective The film has been characterised as having a feminist stance. Apart from the sisters, there were also their three brothers, who were equally prominent in the Republic of China. None from the latter group appear or are mentioned in the film. Scenes of bloodshed were toned down to appeal to a mass audience for educational purposes, and the film avoids describing the violence associated with that era. Key figures from the Communist Party such as Mao Zedong, Zhu De and Zhou Enlai do not make any appearances in the film, even though historically they played significant roles in the Xi'an Incident. Instead, the Communists are portrayed as a whole entity without any personification. On most accounts, those who support the Communist Party are portrayed as victims at the mercy of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang.  History inaccuracy  When the sisters are handing out military equipment to the National Revolutionary Army during a parade, some of the helmets appear to be U.S. M1 helmets, even though the M1 was not issued in the U.S. military until 1941. The standard combat helmet worn by Chinese soldiers at the time was the German-made Stahlhelm.

The ship was in commission from 1948 to 1968, spending her entire career based at Singapore, carrying out survey work. Construction The ship was ordered on 23 January 1943 from Smiths Dock Company, South Bank, Middlesbrough, as the Loch Eil. The ship was laid down on 7 August 1944, but the contract was then changed, and the ship was completed to a revised design as a Bay-class anti- aircraft frigate, and launched on 15 May 1945 as Herne Bay (K611). Work on the ship was suspended on 26 September 1945, and she was towed to Chatham Dockyard. In July 1946 work recommenced to convert her into a survey ship. She was renamed Dampier and assigned the pennant number A303. Service history Dampier was commissioned on 4 May 1948, and in June arrived at Singapore, which would be her home port for almost the next twenty years. There she was employed in carrying out oceanographic and hydrographic surveys around the coasts of Malaya, Borneo, and Hong Kong, in the South China and Java Seas, with regular annual refits at Hong Kong, and inspections at Singapore. On 5 October 1967 Dampier finally left Singapore to return to the UK, arriving at Simon's Town, South Africa, on 17 November. A week later, after local exercises, it was discovered that the ship's starboard propeller shaft was broken. The ship was obliged to continue her voyage on only one shaft. At Freetown, Sierra Leone, she found that there was no suitable equipment available to make repairs. With only three weeks remaining to make the 3,000 miles back to England in time for Christmas, the ship took the unusual step of manufacturing and hoisting a set of sails. Three lug sails made from awning canvas were hoisted on 11 December, and four days later a set of square sails. With the assistance of this rig, Dampier arrived at Chatham on 23 December to be greeted by Flag Officer Medway and the Hydrographer of the Navy. Dampier was decommissioned at Chatham on 31 January 1968 and reduced to the Reserve. The ship was later placed on the Disposal List, and then sold to a Belgian shipbreaker.

Tradition tells of a Drumdurno maiden who bet a stranger she could bake a \\"firlot\\" (an old Scottish measure) of meal before he could forge a path to the top of Bennachie, a nearby mountain. As usual, the 'stranger' was the Devil in disguise, who, having completed the path in time, returned to chase after the fleeing maiden. As he caught her, she was turned to stone; the triangular chunk missing from the side of the stone supposedly marks where he reached out and grabbed her shoulder. The firlot was a dry measure used in Scotland. For centuries it was the primary measure for all grains sold in the country. In the Scottish system a firlot was equal to 4 pecks, and the boll was equal to 4 firlots. The first attempt of the Scottish Parliament to define the firlot was in 1426. They set it as 1,200 Scottish cubic inches or 19.98 litres, but effectively the exact volume continued to be defined by local custom and varied across the country. Over the years the common definition seems to have increased. By an Act of Parliament of Scotland of 1617, the commissioners' firlot of Linlithgow was made the standard for the whole of Scotland, but, in fact, two units were defined for different commodities. The first, which ‚Äúcontained 21 pints and a mutchkin of the water of Leith,‚Äù (approximately 35 litres) was for wheat, pease, beans, rye, and white salt, commodities which had been sold by striken, or level measure. The second firlot, which contained 31 pints of water, about 50 litres, was for oats, barley and malt, which had been sold by heaped measure. The pint mentioned is the Scottish Sterling jug. The measure became less common in 1696 when laws were passed requiring all oatmeal to be sold by weight rather than measure. It finally disappeared with the introduction of Imperial units by the Weights and Measures Act 1824.

It was founded in 1958 as the Modern Gallery. It was moved into the current building in the U≈°ƒáe neighborhood of New Belgrade in 1965. The building is a masterpiece of architects Ivan Antiƒá and Ivanka Raspopoviƒá, a short-lived but highly successful partnership, which also produced the 21 October Museum in ≈†umarice Memorial Park in Kragujevac. The collection contains more than 35,000 works of art. The museum collects and displays art works produced since 1900 in Serbia and Yugoslavia. It also organizes international exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The museum was closed for renovation between 2007 and 2017. After several deadlines were pushed back, the museum was finally reopened for visitors on 20 October 2017. History Construction The museum building is located near the confluence of the rivers Sava and Danube, in U≈°ƒáe park in the Novi Beograd municipality. It was designed by Ivan Antiƒá and Ivanka Raspopoviƒá in 1960, with construction beginning that year and continuing until 1965. The architects received the October Prize from the City of Belgrade on 20 October 1965, the same day the museum was opened to the public. Due to its shape, architecture and location, it has been described as the \\"crystal at the confluence\\" or an \\"(architectural) jewel\\". 2007‚Äì17 renovation When renovation talks first began in the early 2000s, both original architects were still alive. However, Antiƒá died in 2005 and Raspopoviƒá in 2015. Reconstruction began in 2007, but dragged on for a decade, due to numerous reasons. After 10 years of renovation work, the museum was finally re-opened to the public on 20 October 2017, on the anniversary of the first museum opening 52 years earlier. The entire building was renovated and upgraded to meet current museum standards. The park surrounding the museum building was also reconstructed. The first exhibition to be held in the newly renovated museum was \\"Sequences\\" by Dejan Sretenoviƒá. Raspopoviƒá contributed to the reconstruction project by suggesting that the glass, belonging to the building‚Äôs domes, be replaced with a darker shade. The newly added blue panels change their tone, depending on the weather and time of day. The domes have therefore become interactive and dynamic, complementing the surrounding park and the nearby modernistic glass-and-steel U≈°ƒáe Tower. The main criticism, regarding the renovations, revolves around the use of too much concrete in the access paths leading to the museum. Despite new lighting, as well as the addition of pebbles and tartan, critics believe that the concrete makes the area appear less \\"humane\\" and could hamper the future growth of avenue-like trees along the paths. The parceling and concrete work done in the surrounding park area was also criticized, as was the apparent haste in the latter stages to finish the reconstruction quickly. The first company chosen to do the construction work was \\"Montera\\". It was paid fully for the job, but went bankrupt leaving the renovation unfinished for years. During the next public bidding in 2014, aimed specifically at redoing the roof, the company \\"Jedinstvo\\" from U≈æice was chosen. The following bidding, which covered the remaining work, failed. \\"Jedinstvo\\" applied again and was selected by the museum, even though it had the highest offer. The Ministry of Culture, headed by Ivan Tasovac at the time, insisted that the lowest bidder should be picked instead, which was \\"Modulor\\", a company from Zemun. As a result, the museum director, Jovan Despotoviƒá, was let go and the \\"Termoin≈æenjering\\" company was chosen at the next bidding. They finished the entire reconstruction, renovating the roof a second time. Yet, already in July 2018 the reconstructed roof began to leak when it rained.  Departments  The collection began to form in 1958. As of 2018, 8,000 paintings and sculptures are exhibited. The museum has several departments and collections: *Collection of Paintings before 1945 *Collection of Paintings after 1945 *Collection of Graphics, Prints and foreign Paintings **Serbian and Yugoslav painters represented in the collection include: Sava ≈†umanoviƒá, Milena Pavloviƒá-Barili, Vasa Pomori≈°ac, ƒêorƒëe Andrejeviƒá Kun, Vane Bor, Leonid ≈†ejka, Julije Knifer, Vladimir Veliƒçkoviƒá, Petar Lubarda, Krsto Hegedu≈°iƒá, Petar Omƒçikus, Miƒáa Popoviƒá, Milovan Destil Markoviƒá, etc. **The foreign art collection has 323 works, mostly graphic prints and drawings. *** Graphic works are by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Joan Mir√≥, Georges Braque, Salvador Dal√≠, Jacques Villon, David Hockney, Robert Rauschenberg, Eduardo Paolozzi, Victor Vasarely, Hans Hartung, James Rosenquist, Josef Albers, Albert Gleizes, Max Bill, Lucio Fontana, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Frank Stella, Antoni T√†pies, Richard Hamilton (artist), etc. ***Drawings works by : Fritz Wotruba ***Paintings by Max Ernst, Andre Masson Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade, facade. *Collection of Sculptures **There are 752 sculptures by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, Antun Augustinƒçiƒá, Toma Rosandiƒá, Walter S.

Club career Juventus Venitucci began his youth career with his hometown club Juventus, and was promoted to the Primavera youth set-up in 2004. He was part of the squad that won the 2006 Campionato Nazionale Primavera, the first time Juventus have won it in twelve years. Venitucci was called up to the first team squad in for the 2006-07 season when Juventus had been relegated to Serie B due to the Calciopoli scandal, and was part of the team that led Juventus back to Serie A in 2007. Venitucci made his first team debut on 25 November 2006 against U.S. Lecce, replacing Claudio Marchisio in the 74th minute. He also made his first start for Juventus against Lecce later in the season, in a 3‚Äì1 win. In all Venitucci made 12 appearances in all competitions for Juventus that season. F.B.C. Treviso After Juventus were promoted back to Serie A, Venitucci was sent out on loan like many of his fellow youngsters. In July 2007, he was signed by Serie B side Treviso on a season long loan. Venitucci scored 3 goals in 20 league matches for the club, helping the club avoid relegation to the Lega Pro Prima Divisione. On 30 June 2008 Venitucci returned to Juventus. Mantova and Avellino Following his return, Juventus again opted to loan out the rising star to Serie B side Mantova, in order to gain first team experience. However, in January 2009 Juventus decided to recall him due to the lack of games. He was simultaneously loaned out to Serie B strugglers US Avellino, as they felt this move would prove more successful than the short lived loan at Mantova. With Avellino, Venitucci established himself in the club's starting line-up and he scored 2 goals in 18 league appearances. A.C. Arezzo In June 2009, Venitucci returned to Turin but did not figure in Ciro Ferrara's plans. He moved to third division club A.C. Arezzo on loan along with teammates Oussama Essabr, Andrea Pisani, and Riccardo Maniero. With Arezzo, he was a regular starter and performed well in his lone season with the club, making, in all 29 league appearances, scoring 3 goals. Bassano Virtus On 30 June 2010 Venitucci returned to his parent club but was almost instantly sold to Lega Pro side Bassano Virtus on a co-ownership agreement. With the third division side, Venitucci again established himself in the starting line- up and went on to make 27 league appearances, scoring a single goal, and notching up 8 yellow cards. In June 2011 Bassano acquired Venitucci and Samon Reider Rodriguez outright from Juventus.Riscattati Venitucci e Rodriguez Following a stellar season with the mid-table side, Venitucci was signed by U.S. Foggia, a club that nearly gained promotion to Serie B in the 2010-11 Lega Pro season. Foggia On 15 July 2011 Venitucci was signed by Lega Pro Prima Divisione team U.S. Foggia. Carrarese  After the bankruptcy of Foggia, he joined Carrarese Calcio.

It also remains one of the very few featuring Philips' wOOx subwoofer technology. The DSS80 speaker system The DSS80 featured technological innovations in comparison with contemporary systems. For instance, it didn't require a sound card installed but actually featured its own integrated sound hardware which could be connected via USB and allowed digital quality playback, synchronized hardware and software volume controls, the use of a 10-band graphic equalizer and Microsoft Surround Sound. To support computers without USB, and to enable users to take advantage of present high-end sound hardware, it additionally featured 3.5mm analog line-in.

It is a proprietary connector. To say the connector is ADB (Apple desktop Bus) is incorrect; any ADB device plugged into this port would not operate and likewise if the DSS80 were plugged into an Apple ADB port it would not function. Therefore, the only similarity is the Mini-DIN 4 connector type. The pins on the DSS80 plug are connected to the following wires: with the index mark (labeled \\"B\\") at 12 o'clock, the pin at 2 o'clock connects to the black wire (speaker ground); the pin at 4 o'clock connects to the red wire (speaker hot); the pin at 8 o'clock connects to the yellow wire; the pin at 10 o'clock connects to the blue wire; and the ground sheath connects to the white wire. If you bypass the plug and wire the cable directly to the subwoofer, remember to mirror these connections. The subwoofer and satellite speaker are both held together with Torx #10 screws. Controls and indicators On top of the Right speaker are the manual controls of the DSS80. There are five pushbutton controls: Mute on/off Bass - Bass + Volume - Volume + There is also one indicator on the Right speaker. It shows Green when the unit is operational, Amber on stand-by and flashing Green/Amber when muted. Volume control issue The DSS80 was afflicted with a glitch concerning the main volume control. At times, when one of the buttons was held down, the volume would quickly increase to the maximum, or decrease to the minimum setting. The only way to stop this process was to hit the mute button. These issues seem to be resolved when connected to Windows Vista and Windows 7.

Compostela, March, 1999 History Foundation and first stage inside the Galician Nationalist Bloc Primeira Linha was formed in Galicia, in 1996, with the objective of organizing the independentist and communist groups which were within the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG). Primeira Linha remained a part of the BNG, but was in constant conflict with the current controlling power, the Galician People's Union. During this time, Primeira Linha was working with other militant organizations, such as ANA-ANOC and CAF, among others. In 1998, Primeira Linha held its first congress. Given the contradictions and conflicts resulting from the political work within the Galician Nationalist Bloc, Primeira Linha members resolved to leave the Nationalist Bloc in 1999, after the majority decision was made at their second congress. In its quarterly publication, Abrente, Primeira Linha explained that, \\"An unbreathable climate of harassment was obstructing our political work, it was forcing us to use vast energies and resources in mere defense.\\"Documents of the second Congress, 1999 Independentist Reorganization outside of the Galician Nationalist Bloc The second congress also set forth a policy of unity and collaboration with other independentist organizations outside the Galician Nationalist Block. They allied with the AMI and the FPG, with the goal of forming an organic whole. They called this conglomeration the National Unit Commission of the Independentist Left, a dynamic unit which broke apart in 2000 because of differing expectations from each organization. That same year, Primeira Linha participated in the creation of \\"Popular Regional Meetings\\", which formed the precedent for the Processo Espiral, which led to the creation, in 2001, of N√ìS-Unidade Popular. Primeira Linha has been doing political work in the heart of N√≥s-Unidade Popular since 2001, and has also participated in youth organizations, independent student organizations, and feminist, cultural and trade unions. Model of Socialism In 2002, Primeira Linha held its third congress, in which the members defined the organization's theoretical model of socialism, and worked out, \\"the essential composition and working direction of the movement for Galicia's national liberation\\", rejecting the traditional inter-class formula used by earlier nationalist organizations. Primeira Linha also affirmed that, \\"the morphology of classes in Galicia is more similar to that of advanced capitalist societies than of the so-called Third World.Documents of the third Congress, 2002 Publications and Supporting Activities Giving priority to their work within larger entities and other sectors of the Galician national left, Primeira Linha maintains several publications supporting its own initiatives. Since 1996, Primeira Linha has published its quarterly newspaper, Abrente, which already exceedes fifty editions. In its editorial stamp, Abrente Editora, numerous titles were published, as well some Marxist classics previously unpublished in Galicia, and other works of Galician authors. Primeira Linha has also been organizing the annual Galician Independentist Conference for the last ten years.

It is used as an insecticide on livestock and as an acaricide on citrus fruits, deciduous fruits and nuts. Uses Under the trade name Delnav, it can be used to control insects and mites on apples, pears, quince, grapes, and walnuts, and finds use in the control of ticks, horn flies, lice and sheep keds in various livestock, either as a spray or as a dip. Under the trade name Deltic, it is a restricted use pesticide for exterior control of fleas, ticks and mites, in kennels, dog houses, yards, and other recreational areas. Toxicity Dioxathion is an Extremely Hazardous Substance, as defined by Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, and is no longer allowed to be sold in the United States. However, it continues to see use in some other countries. It has been known to cause inhibition of the enzyme cholinesterase in rats, and it is recommended that people who have exposure to dioxathion regularly get their plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase levels assessed. Persons exposed to other chemicals which affect cholinesterase levels, e.g. other organophosphates or carbamates, may be at an increased risk. There are no known carcinogenic or reproductive effects, but long term exposure may result in nerve damage, poor motor coordination, and personality changes of anxiety, depression or irritability. Short-term effects may include irritation to the eyes, pupil constriction and blurring of vision, abdominal cramps, laboured breathing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle cramps and excess salivation. These are mostly classic symptoms of organophosphate poisoning. Dioxathion must be stored away from alkalis, iron, tin and strong acids. Contact can be avoided by using protective clothing and eyeware. If poisoning occurs, a physician may administer atropine sulfate, or pralidoxime in case of severe poisoning.

Her wardrobe (William Ivey Long's best costume work in the show), including her jaw-droppingly gaudy fur coat, is outrageous, but Seldes makes it work splendidly for Rayleen. Whether asking for linen tablecloths, the most complicated tea brewing imaginable, or items you'd never expect to find on the menu, Seldes makes her compellingly lovable and impossible to resist.

Ugunja is located on the Kisumu-Busia highway, which links Kenya and Uganda. Ugunja town is 72 km north of the nearest city, Kisumu, which sits on the shores of Lake Victoria. The equator is 40 km south of Ugunja town. Rural residents of Ugunja mainly depend on agriculture as their main source of food and income. The area receives two rainy seasons a year: March to June and September to December. The farming is mostly subsistence based, and major crops grown are sorghum, potatoes, cassava, beans, and maize. When farmers have surplus crops, they sell in local markets for income. In the past some farmers have grown cotton and coffee as cash crops, but due to market unreliability most farmers now prefer to grow food crops for their own families and local markets.

It is a critical event in Ethiopian history because N…ôgus√§ N√§g√§st (or Emperor) Yohannes IV was killed in this battle, and because it was the last major battle on the Ethiopian front of the Mahdist War. The fighting occurred at the site of the twin settlements of Gallabat (in modern Sudan) and Metemma (in modern Ethiopia), so both names are commonly used and either can be argued to be correct. Background When the Mahdists rebelled against the Egyptians, many Egyptian garrisons found themselves isolated in Sudan. As a result, the British, who had taken over the government of Egypt, negotiated the Treaty of Adowa with Emperor Yohannes IV of Ethiopia on 3 June 1884 whereby the Egyptian garrisons were allowed to evacuate to Massawa through Ethiopian territory. After that, the Mahdist Khalifa, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, considered the Ethiopians as his enemies and sent his forces to attack them. The twin communities of Gallabat and Metemma were located on the trade route from the Nile to Gondar, the old Imperial capital; the Mahdists used these communities as their base for attacks on Ethiopia. These raids led to a Mahdist defeat by Ras Alula on 23 September 1885 at Kufit. Sack of Gondar A few years later, the Negus of Gojjam, Tekle Haymanot (a vassal of Emperor Yohannes) attacked the Mahdists at Metemma in January 1887 and sacked the town. In response, that next year the Mahdists under Abu Anga campaigned out of Metemma into Ethiopia; their objective was the town of Gondar. Tekle Haymanot confronted him at Sar Weha on 18 January 1888, but was badly defeated. The Mahdists proceeded to Gondar, and set about ransacking the town. Churches were pillaged and burnt, and many inhabitants have carried away into slavery. Despite this damage to the historic capital, Emperor Yohannes held back from a counter attack due to his suspicions of Menelik II, then only the ruler of Shewa. He wanted to campaign against Menelik, but the clergy and his senior officers pressed him to handle the Mahdist threat first. The Abyssinians under Ras Gobana Dacche did defeat the Mahdists in the Battle of Gut√© Dili in the province of Wellega on 14 October 1888. Following this victory, the Emperor accepted the advice of his people, and according to Alaqa Lamlam concluded \\"if I come back I can fight Shewa later on when I return. And if I die at Matamma in the hands of the heathens I shall go to heaven.\\" Battle The Battlefield Where King John Was Killed - Gallabat In the Early 20th Century In late January 1889, Yohannes mustered a huge army of 130,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry in Dembiya. The Sudanese gathered an army of 85,000 and fortified themselves in Gallabat, surrounding the town with a huge zariba, a barrier made of entwined thorn bushes, replicating the effect of barbed wire. On 8 March 1889 the Ethiopian army arrived within sight of Gallabat, and the attack began in earnest the next day. The wings were commanded by the Emperor's nephews, Ras Haile Maryam Gugsa over the left wing and Ras Mengesha the right.Erlich, Ras Alula, p. 134 The Ethiopians managed to set the zariba alight, and, by concentrating their attack against one part of the defense managed to break through the Mahdist lines into the town. The defenders suffered heavy losses and were about to break down completely, when the battle turned unexpectedly in their favour. The Emperor Yohannes, who led his army from the front, had shrugged off one bullet wound to his hand, but a second lodged in his chest, fatally wounding him. He was carried back to his tent, where he died that night; before he died, Yohannes commanded his nobles to recognize his natural son, Ras Mengesha, as his successor.Erlich (Ras Alula, p. 134) states that until the Emperor's dying declaration, Ras Mangesha had been considered the Emperor's nephew. The Ethiopians, demoralized by the death of their ruler, began to melt away, leaving the field‚Äîand victory‚Äîto the Mahdists. According to David L. Lewis, the Mahdists were unaware of the Emperor's death until \\"stench from the rapidly decaying imperial corpse alerted a spy, and the nearly beaten Sudanese thundered out of their zariba to scatter the downcast Ethiopians like starlings.\\"David L. Lewis, The Race to Fashoda (New York: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1987), p. 107 A few days later (12 March) the forces of the Mahdist commander, Zeki Tummal, overtook Rasses Mangasha and Alula and their remaining followers near the Atbara River, who were escorting the Emperor's body to safety. The Mahdists inflicted heavy losses upon the Ethiopians and captured the body of the dead Emperor, whose head they cut off and sent back to Omdurman as a trophy.Erlich, Ras Alula, p. 135f Aftermath The death of the Emperor caused a period of political turmoil in Ethiopia. Although Yohannes on his deathbed named his son Ras Mengesha as his heir, and begged Ras Alula and his other nobles to support him, within a matter of weeks Menelik II was recognized throughout Ethiopia as the new emperor. For the Mahdists the consequences were severe, as many of their best soldiers had perished in the battle, seriously weakening their military strength. The Khalifa prudently decided to stop offensive actions against Ethiopia and the conflict dwindled to small-scale cross-border raiding.Churchill, Winston, The River War (London, Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1952) p. 83 Notes External links * \\"Yohannes IV\\" ethiopianhistory.com * Category:Conflicts in 1889 Category:1889 in Ethiopia Category:1889 in Sudan Category:Battles involving Sudan Category:Battles involving Ethiopia Category:Battles of the Mahdist War Category:March 1889 events ","title":"Battle of Gallabat"},{"id":"8116166","text":"Zeng Fanzhi's artwork auction Mao's Song Poem of Snow, No.2 Zeng Fanzhi (; born 1964) is a contemporary Chinese artist based in Beijing. From the earliest stages of his career, his paintings have been marked by their emotional directness, the artist's intuitive psychological sense, and his carefully calibrated expressionistic technique. Moving to Beijing in the early 1990s, Zeng's art displayed an immediate shift, responding to his immersion in a more superficial environment, his seminal Mask series displaying the tensions between the artist's dominant existential concerns and an ironic treatment of the pomposity and posturing inherent to his new contemporary urban life. Throughout, Zeng's expressionistic techniques run counter to such techniques' conventional usage. That is, Zeng's representation of raw, exposed flesh or awkwardly oversized hands is not an attempt at pure emotional expression, but instead play against the superficially composed appearances of his subjects, an ironic treatment of emotional performance as a metaphor for a lost self, of stunted self-realization. Early life Zeng was born in 1964 in Wuhan, Hubei and lives and works in Beijing. He grew up during the Cultural Revolution, after which he attended Hubei Academy of Fine Arts. There, he was largely influenced by Expressionism. Zeng is one of the most popular artists of his era, in addition to being one of Asia's most financially successful artists. In May 2008, he set a world auction record when one of his contemporary Chinese art pieces \\"Mask Series 1996 No. 6\\" was sold for $9.6 million in Hong Kong. Zeng has lived and worked in Beijing since 1993, and has been exhibited all over the globe in venues such as the Shanghai Art Museum, National Art Museum of China, Kunst Museum Bonn, Kunstmuseum Bern, Santa Monica Art Centre, Art Centre, and Le Mus√©e d'Art moderne de la Ville de Paris.Official Show Website Art school Zeng was in art school from 1987 to 1991, and paid a particular interest in German expressionist painters. During his third year of schooling, he began instead to learn more about the actual approaches that the expressionists would take to painting. By the time his first show came to fruition, it was apparent that he had gained his very own style and the work gained him a large amount of respect in the Chinese art scene. Artistic progression From the start, Zeng has been heavily influenced by his physical and emotional circumstances. Zeng's first mature series was his \\"Hospital Series\\", inspired by the scenes he witnessed in the local clinic near where he lived. At the same time, as an art student, Zeng studied German Expressionism, and the preponderance of social upheaval and intensely felt emotion, against a backdrop of social upheaval, had resonance in his own life. In his Hospital series, Zeng moved to a theme that included the use of hospital interiors, where he devoted much of the detail to the patients' moods and the power that certain brush stroking techniques could yield. These paintings often hinted at a sadomasochistic relationship in the world with his pale colors and blood colored flesh of the patients. In using these techniques, he shows a somewhat pessimistic view of the world. His expressionist technique shined through in these works further with an extreme expression in the eyes of the characters. Also, the hands of the patients are notably oversized and the joints are much larger as well. The scenes he depicts seem to show patients caught up in seeming hysteria, and the deep red colors show anger of sorts. After 1994, Zeng's work shifted toward his Mask series in which his style takes a drastic shift that is considered the second period in his work. Instead of the anger and brutal nature of the hospital series, the Mask series is more apathetic. The scenes are painted from a distance, and have a mask of some sort as the center of focus. The groups are often small or include a single person, and that seems to show that Zeng is touching on personal relationships and the fact that society is filled with false relationships. By using a mask, even if a person is with a group, there is a sense of solitude for the person wearing the mask. He also explores new techniques that include using a palette knife as a paintbrush. This causes the characters to have an even more blurred edge to them, which essentially masks the painting as a whole. The lighting on the paintings are not coming from an obvious source, and the characters seem to be separated from the world around them through an awkward placement in the background. Through the different techniques, the characters seem much more calm than his earlier hospital series. The figures' hands are in fists and also much more realistic and apparent than in the past, and this causes them to seem as though they are controlling an emotion instead of venting anger, etc. The art by Zeng after 1997 becomes much more stylish through the incorporation of new types of backgrounds like the sea. He uses softer colors that are more blended into each other and this makes for a more comfortable viewing experience. Rather than anger or a controlled emotion, these figures are more relaxed and their hands are sometimes in their pockets. This seems to show that the artist's mood at the time is also more relaxed and has an understanding of life. What was once angry and bold has become more calm through different brush strokes, but there is still a sort of anxiety that can be noted by the fact that the characters have larger-than-normal heads. Rather than his expressionist beginnings, his work now seems to consist largely of symbolism. We n:2 We n:2 is both an abstract and a self-portrait of Zeng Fanzhi. The fact that the face is so large and dominating causes the viewer to feel almost minuscule in its presence. He uses squiggle lines that create a screen that describes the impossibility of truly knowing someone. The marks that he makes over his face almost cause a \\"ghost image, echoing multiplicity and technological distortion.\\" This Land Is So Rich in Beauty 2 Considering the expressionist style of Zeng's work, the viewer seems to feel violent tension. His landscapes are some of his best work, and while painting them he uses two separate brushes. In doing so, one brush demonstrates the purpose of what he is painting, and the other is \\"leaving traces of his subconscious through processes.\\" This causes his landscapes to not only have a real feel to them, but also an abstract sense of expression. Tiananmen In an effort to describe the rocky past, Zeng places an abstract version of chairman Mao over the building in Tiananmen Square. The bright reds and oranges show both an ironic sense of great courage over the top of an uncertain future. The painting is given animation with a flurry of brush strokes that replace what would normally be depicted as stoic and strait-laced. The fact that chairman Mao's portrait dominates the painting is possibly a symbol for his dominance over Chinese culture. Art market In May 2008, Christie's Hong Kong pioneered the Asian Contemporary Art Evening sale. Zeng Fanzhi's Mask Series No.6 was sold for HK$75,367,500. Christie's Hong Kong set a world auction record for the artist in 2008. In October 2013, Sotheby's Hong Kong at the Asian Contemporary 40th Anniversary Sale, Zeng Fanzhi's The Last Supper was sold for US$23.3 million, setting a new record for contemporary Asian artwork.

The River Browney rises from a spring in Head Plantation, on the eastern slope of Skaylock Hill, about a mile south east of Waskerley. The spring rises approximately from a tributary stream to the River Wear, in an area of moorland, forestry and springs, and of disused coal mines, quarries and mineral railway lines, remnants of an industrial past. Running eastwards towards Lanchester, the river skirts to the south of the village. Continuing eastwards past Langley Park and Witton Gilbert, the river then turns south and skirts the western edge of Durham. The Browney is joined by the River Deerness north of Langley Moor and finally joins the Wear to the south of Durham, close to Sunderland Bridge. Until the last Ice Age, the Browney entered the River Wear just north of Durham City, in Pelaw Woods. The Browney was contaminated by local industry, particularly lead and coal mining, but has recovered in recent years. The river was stocked with around 3,000 grayling in September 2006.

His best-known work is his Portrait of China series, very large Warhol-style oil portraits, in a red-and-turquoise palette, of Chinese fashion model faces with vacant diverging eyes (his signature style). Critics view his work as a critique of contemporary consumer society.Profile , The Red Mansion Foundation His early paintings were inspired by 1930s Shanghai posters. His more recent work is based on the red and green of traditional Chinese New Year art, the colors made \\"more acid, a representation of the flashy, commercial nature of modern China\\".The fine art of becoming rich, Lindsey Hilsum, Channel 4 News, 11 May 2007 (orig. in New Statesman) Zhengjie has exhibited internationally in many shows including Dialogue With Asia at the Du Store Verden! -initiated Vika Gallery in Oslo, the 2002 Korea Contemporary Art Festival in Seoul, China Femmes de Chine at Veronique Maxe Gallery in Paris, Primary Colors at the Singapore Art Museum in Singapore and New Perspectives in Chinese Painting at Marella Gallery in Milan. Style Feng Zhengjie‚Äôs ‚Äúexotically colorful style‚Äù is originated from a traditional drawing called ‚ÄúMian Zhu Nian Hua,‚Äù which is created and used in a village in Si Chuan called ‚ÄúMian Zhu.‚Äù Mian Zhu Nian Hua‚Äôs first appearance can be traced back to Song Dynasty and it becomes very popular during Ming Dynasty and reaches its prime during Qing Dynasty. It reflects people‚Äôs optimistic attitude toward life and work. In an interview, Feng said that he grew up in a very small village in Si Chuan province and the colorful traditional drawings reminded him of the memory of his childhood, which was also the main reason for him to start his unique drawing style. In his paintings, Feng loves to use very flashy colors such as pure bright red, bright pink and flashy green to draw the background and characters. Most characters in his drawings are females with sexy lips and vacant diverging eyes. Although Feng has been quite successful in the international art market these years, his brave usage of bright colors has drawn criticism. In Chinese culture, red, green, and pink colors are usually associated with the superficial and shallow; people also accuse Feng because they think he paints to meet the western taste as well as to make money. Despite all the negative opinions, Feng claims that he never considers making any changes and he will carry on this style to the end. According to him, any art piece that is designed to make an impression cannot be achieved with the idea of contrast. Feng denies that his drawings are satires or protests; instead, he says that his drawings are simply objective expression of the influence of consuming cultures on people. He has stated, \\"Today‚Äôs society is developing so rapidly in every aspects and following the development are more temptations. These temptations will make people unable to focus and confused. The dynamic motion of the ladies‚Äô eyes portrays the fact that females can only catch up with what‚Äôs going on around them by moving their eyes constantly.\\" Opinion Feng Zhengjie has been firmly carrying on his style even facing the huge economic crisis during 2008. When he is asked if he will regard the economic crisis as an opportunity to change his painting style, Feng says that he will not change his style to meet any change of other people‚Äôs taste. His has been painting for more than two decades and people can tell his style also changes from time to time; however, none of those changes is related to market considerations. He finds his confidence from working hard constantly, and more importantly he enjoys every single change he makes in his paintings. ‚ÄúA little change on the contour of a character‚Äôs nose will get me excited, but in the audience‚Äôs eyes this little change makes almost no difference at all. They simply cannot comprehend the joyfulness I have experienced during the painting. One can argue that artists are ‚Äòselfish‚Äô to certain extent. It is just like you watch a worker digging a hole on the ground. In your eyes the worker is doing the exactly same thing over and over again, but actually the worker digs to different depth every single time,‚Äù Feng explains.

Concerning a small group of children on Jupiter's moon Io, the series ran for 13 episodes. When one of Io's volcanoes erupts, the surviving colonists must flee the moon and try to reach the safety of Earth. Using a derelict space station in orbit of Io, they convert it into a rudimentary space craft and set off, having many adventures and forming close relationships along the way. The series was followed by Return to Jupiter. Introduction The main character is Michael Faraday, a boy in his teens who has lived in space his whole life. Having never been to Earth, he resides with his father on the moon Io. Despite being a mining colony habituated predominantly by adults, a few have their families with them. Michael's best friend is Kingston, the son of the medical officer of the colony. In addition to this duo are Jarrod and Anna, both children of a fellow miner Carl. Jarrod and Michael always compete with each other, Jarrod being the brawn and Michael being the brains. Michael's father is the local space tug pilot who ferries passengers and equipment to and from the moon to the orbiting space craft. The series is set in the not too distant future. The mine's administrator is a company man called Duffy who oversees and runs the colony. An older and often regarded as aloof expert, Professor Jacob Ingasole, has been studying the mining operations and the effects of the mining on the planet and to the colony. Although his predictions have been regarded as \\"hairbrained\\" (his previous prediction was that a comet would come and destroy the colony) his latest work regarding the mines and the lava flow have credit. Despite the imminent danger, the deep drilling mining operations continue. To this mix of people comes a group of scientists from the company. This is where we meet Kumiko and her parents. Kumiko is the typical spoilt daughter of her very successful father and mother who both specialise in seismology. She's rarely been away from Earth and getting \\"thrown into the deep end\\" presents us with a hostile young lady. Her pride and joy is her computer which she carries with her all the time. Plot The first time we meet this motley crew is in the mines on Io. Although forbidden from being in the mines, the older teens manage to sneak their way in despite elaborate security systems. The introduction to the show is through the experience of the kids as they meet the newest additions to the colony, a team of seismologists sent to examine the continuance of the highly profitable mining of resources on Io. Upon arrival, in an attempt to show off, both Michael and Jarrod take Kumiko into the mines asking Kingston and Anna to \\"cover for them\\". Whilst in the mines, the automated mining operations system hits a lava pocket. The resulting explosion destroys the rig and causes widespread tunnel collapses. After finding their way into a disused miners shelter, the trio find themselves trapped. With access to the main shaft cut off with sulfur and lava being forced up the main shaft, they climb up a disused ventilation shaft. After being covered in debris in the Jupiter bar whilst playing a computer game, Kingston and Anna watch as the adults go over the maps to the tunnels and how to best get to the children. With the adults gone, Kingston works out that the trio would have gone away from the main shaft and through another subsidiary tunnel to get back. It isn't long before both groups meet up coming out of a ventilation shaft much to the relief of all parents. After the incident, Duffy the administrator announces that all is safe and that mining operations will recommence soon. It is this that Professor Ingosol disagrees. He believes that they \\"must evacuate immediately!\\" to which Duffy replies, \\"where to?\\" \\"To KL-5.\\" KL-5 was the original set up ship to get to Io. It was designed to provide the colonists with all the systems necessary to begin the colony. However, the ship was also designed to not be used for long-distance travel; most of the station has been gutted out to install the systems on Io. KL-5 is also a derelict station, not having been used for nearly 10 years. Michael talks his dad into taking up professor Ingosol to check out the station after hearing his and Duffy's exchange. Against his better judgment, they are soon jetting up to KL-5 on the tug with 2 stowaways, Michael and Kumiko. Due to the security system designed to monitor the colony and surrounding space, Duffy is alerted to an unauthorised tug takeoff. With this he tries to contact the tug. The explanation by the 'rogue pilot' is that he was giving the tug's engines a test fire. As they approach the station, the remote access system designed to reactivate the system does not respond. Professor Ingosol suggests that they go in through the garbage chute and reactivate the power. There's only one problem, it's too small for adults but just the right size for a pair of teenagers. Michael and Kumiko, who have now been discovered, become the reluctant explorers of the derelict station. There's also another catch: the power packs on the environmental suits are both very low; only 10 minutes of air is available. The location of the garbage chute is close to the stations hub so they should make it in time. Meanwhile, back on the colony, Carl and the other scientists run into the control station and explain to Duffy that the mining charges they were using to redirect the lava flow away from the main shaft have now fractured the substrata, and lava is now pouring into all of the tunnels. It is now just a race against time. Duffy recontacts the tug and orders them to reactivate the station. At this time, Michael and Kumiko have both made it into the station. However, the station was redesigned and no longer fits the layout as explained by Professor Ingosol. Just as they are about to turn back, Kumiko leads them following computer cables into the main hub. At this, the view screen back in the colony and in the tug of the operation is disrupted due to company security systems designed to secure the station. As they descend the stairs into the station, warning lights come on indicating that they only have 1 minute of air left. After getting to the main terminal and inserting the main boot disc, the system remains dead. After several tries, there is not much time left. Michael hits the computer and the station begins whirring to life. The station's magnificent solar sails open up to absorb the sunlight from the sun and to also restart the power and life systems. Soon the station has breathable oxygen and both Michael and Kumiko declare that \\"KL-5 is ready for passengers.\\" After reactivating the once derelict space station KL-5, the next task is to evacuate everyone up to the station. With more damage being done to the colony, certain areas are off limits, one now being the residential quarters. Kingston and Anna only want their stuff so they go on an expedition to reclaim their material possessions. Unbeknownst to everyone else, the group of teens help in the packing up for evacuation. Kumiko, who was put in charge of Kingston and Anna realises they are missing and asks Michael and Jarrod for help. Jarrod is too busy so Michael escorts Kumiko. Meanwhile, Kingston and Anna are about to return with their possessions when they run into Mr Duffy. Despite his anger, his attention is diverted when another explosion rocks the colony. This now isolates Michael and Kumiko from the rest of the evacuees. With the majority of people now loaded onto KL-5, Michael and Kumiko move to the old abandoned landing platform originally used when the colony was being first set up. There, they find a pressure sensor which they activate hoping their signal will show the others where they are. Meanwhile, Michael's father is upset at the prospect of leaving his son on the colony and attempts to go through the now collapsed main hallway tunnel. Despite being pulled back from the debris he refuses to take off. Over in KL-5's control room, Professor Ingosol begins getting an errant signal and alerts the team on the ground. At Kingston's exclamation that it must be them, the group set off and recover the last two evacuees just before the entire colony explodes and is engulfed into Io's lava flows. Now safely on the station, the survivors must now face a decision. Do they stay, or do they leave? With the last ore carrier having left only in the past week, it would be 6 months before the next ore carrier arrives. Some however, have reservations about sending a derelict space station halfway across the solar system. After all the alternatives have been weighed up, it is determined that they will go. In order to break Jupiter's massive gravitational pull, they couple the space tug up to KL-5. As the systems begin to countdown for launch, an error appears in the space station control room. They are unable to fire the thrusters from there. Meanwhile, on the tug, Jarrod and his father and Michael's father are attempting to fix the problem. They test fire the tugs engines determining that the tug is fine but it must be the computer controls. With less than 1 minute to go, they still do not have a response in the control room. The three in the tug decide to fire it manually from the tug. As the time comes, the engines roar into life at full power. At 65% escape velocity, the engines of the tug can't take much more. The whole station begins shaking violently as they attempt to get out of the gas giant's gravitational pull. With the tug's engines at 115%, the station begins accelerating and soon hits escape velocity. Next stop Saturn. We next meet Michael, Kingston and Jarrod in the hydroponics bay. This device also produces the oxygen for the station. Whilst cultivating algae Kingston asks Michael why they're going to Saturn despite it being further away from Earth. Michael explains that it's necessary in order to conserve fuel. They will use Saturn to slingshot around and head straight to Earth. A solar sail failure threatens to derail the voyage but after much work, Carl is able to fix the hydraulics allowing the solar sail to retract and then slingshot around Saturn. On the approach to the inner planets, the next big hurdle is now the asteroid belt.

It also offers high school equivalency, community extension, student development, and certificate programs. The College primarily serves students from within the Micronesian region and is designated as the national post-secondary institution for the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), as enacted in RMI PL 1992-13, The College of the Marshall Islands Act. Accreditation status The College of the Marshall Islands is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The ACCJC accredits associate degree granting institutions in California, Hawaii, the Territories of Guam and American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. ACCJC is one of three commissions under the regional accrediting entity known as WASC. In January 2009 the ACCJC reaffirmed CMI's accreditation for a six-year term pending a self study review the spring of 2009. History The main campus of the College of the Marshall Islands is located in Uliga, Majuro Atoll. The College Administration Offices and the Library are located in the buildings formerly used as a hospital, as are some classrooms. The two-story Classroom Building, completed in 1991, has a 1996 four-classroom addition. The building also contains the Business Computer Lab, the College Achievement Project Learning Lab, and the Student Center, for study and quiet relaxation. Adjacent buildings house Land Grant Cooperative Research and Extension programs and PEACESAT administration, Upward Bound and College Achievement Project (SSSP). Academic year 1999-2000 was a period of major campus growth and development. The two-story Science Complex, completed in mid-2000, added three large new classrooms, a small Science Computer Lab, and science research rooms that include an Agricultural Grow Room. The Administration Annex, just beyond the men's and women's dormitories, includes the Maintenance Office and facilities, Personnel and the Personnel Conference Room. Oscar deBrum Hall, redeveloped and given that name in late 1999, houses the Continuing Education program on the first floor and faculty offices on the second. The College grounds were also much increased during this period by the replacement of a large service-road area with grassy areas and pathways that center on the College flagpole. The community college now known as the College of the Marshall Islands (CMI) came into existence officially when the Board of Regents of the Community College of Micronesia (CCM) issued its charter on October 10, 1989, designating it as the College of Micronesia-Majuro . Two years later, in January 1991, it was given its present name and accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges. In April 1993, CMI became an independent entity with its own Board of Regents and was chartered to serve as the post-secondary agency for RMI. CMI, as an institution, can trace its origins to several earlier programs; of these, the oldest was a school of nursing established by the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands . Begun on Moen Island in Chuuk (1953), it was later moved to Pohnpei, to Palau, to Saipan in the Northern Marianas, and finally, in 1986, to Majuro. This School of Nursing was affiliated in 1972 with the University of Guam, to confer the Associate of Science degree in Nursing. Two jurisdictional changes occurred later: in 1975, the Trust Territory Department of Public Health assigned responsibility for the school to the Community College of Micronesia (CCM) under the Trust Territory Department of Education; and, in 1978, to the newly created College of Micronesia's (COM) first Board of Regents. The origins of education courses at CMI can be traced to the Micronesia Teacher Education Center (MTEC), opened in 1963 on Pohnpei for in- service instruction. It soon established a branch on Majuro, known as Marshalls ‚Äô Teacher Education Center (MARTEC). In 1970, the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory issued a directive making the education centers into the Community College of Micronesia (CCM); thus, Majuro's program became an extension of CCM, offering pre-service elementary teacher education. Three years later, in 1973, it added a Curriculum, Learning and Training Center (CLT) which awarded graduates a two-year degree in education. The dual focus of CLT was on teacher education and curriculum development; this latter covered most elementary subjects and was tested in Majuro's Rita Elementary School . In 1990, the program, now called the Continuing Education Center, ceased to be an extension of CCM and it was renamed CMI Division of Instructional Services. Another component of the present institution dates from 1981, when CCM, based in Pohnpei, was awarded U.S. Land Grant status. It began operations on Majuro in 1983, offering non-credit courses in agriculture and home economics, among others, and it continues to do so. By 1987, all three programs‚Äînursing, education, and Land Grant extension‚Äîwere housed together in Majuro on the present campus; in 1988, they were integrated under a single administrator by directive of the COM Board of Regents. In 1989, they were combined to constitute the College of Micronesia-Majuro which became independent in April 1993 as the College of the Marshall Islands (CMI).

All NAYSA aircraft were operated under a franchise agreement as Binter Canarias into which it has been merged in spring 2018.  History  The airline was founded by Alfonso Carrero, it was established and started operations on 7 May 1969 at C√≥rdoba as NAYSA (Navegacion y Servicios A√©reos) and added Canarias to the title when operations in the Canary Islands were started in 1973. The fleet consisted originally of a Lear 35, four Piper Navajo Chieftain, a Piper Aztec, a Piper Cherokee and a PA-18. This company was credited by being one of the first Third Level or Commuter Airlines in Europe. It established the first regular services between the Canary Islands and the Spanish Sahara and linked Madrid Barajas with smaller airports throughout Spain. On 1975 Spain lost the Spanish Sahara and several Government subsidised contracts were lost. The company changed owners in 1977 and transferred its headquarters to Las Palmas. It is owned by Canarias de Aviaci√≥n (75%) and Serair (25%) and has 28 employees as of March 2007.

A lacuna acts as \\"negative music\\" to induce a state of serenity (or tension) in the listener through its contrast to \\"normal\\" music consisting of sounded notes. Though no notes are sounded during a lacuna, it is a purposeful musical passage used for a specific effect in the context of the overall work. Lacunae may be of any duration, as indicated by the composer. Contrast this to a musical rest, which is of much shorter duration and a normal part of musical performance that serves to create rhythm and movement between notes. In general, rests do not call attention to themselves in the perception of the listener, whereas lacunae actively force the listener to experience silence as part of the overall performance. In classical music, John Cage's famous piece 4'33\\" consists of three long silences, and may be considered a piece made entirely of lacunae. Alternative, indie band The Choir incorporated a lacuna in their song \\"Circle Slide\\" of the celebrated, eponymous album, as a guitar and sax fade to absolute silence on the record, a feat that drummer Steve Hindalong described as tricky to pull off in a pre-digital environment.The Choir. \\"Circle Slide: Band Commentary\\".

Krishnashastry has remained popular four decades after his death through his work Vachana Bharata, and his narration of Mahabharata in the Kannada language. Early life Krishnashastry was born on 12 February 1890, in Ambale, Chikkamagalur district ( Karnataka, India) into a Smarta Hoysala Karnataka Brahmin family. His parents were Ramakrishna Shastry, Distinguished grammarian and principal of Sanskrit school in Mysore and Shankaramma a home maker. Krishnashastry lost his mother Shankaramma to plague when he was ten. His father, Ramakrishna Shastry raised all the children. Due to poverty, Krishnashastry was compelled to study Kannada and Sanskrit for his Bachelor of Arts degree (1914) though he wanted to pursue a career as a scientist. His career started as a clerk in the Athara Kacheri (\\"Secretariat\\") in Mysore. He worked as a tutor and a researcher at Oriental Library (later renamed the Oriental Research Institute) at Mysore before enrolling for his Master of Arts degree at the Madras University. Finally he became Professor of Kannada and served as a professor and researcher at the Mysore University(group photo) until his retirement. Krishnashastry married at the age of sixteen to Venkatalakshamma who was only ten at that time. Prof A.R. Krishnashastry was called as \\"Kannada Senani\\" by famous Kannada writer and folklorist Haa. Maa. Naayak( H. M. Nayak). He was the first one to start a Karnataka Sangha at Central College, Bengaluru. Later these Sanghas spread throughout Karnataka. Some of his famous disciples were Kuvempu, T. N. Srikantaiah (Thi Nam shree), M. V. Seetharamiah and G. P. Rajarathnam amongst others. Literary works Prof KrishnaShastry was a polyglot. Apart from Kannada (mother tongue), Sanskrit and English, he was also proficient in Pali, Bengali (self taught), Hindi, and German. He had a good working knowledge of English and German and this helped him to work and translate some of the great works from those languages to Kannada. Krishnashastry brought out many of nuances of great Sanskrit plays of KƒÅlidƒÅsa, Bhavabhuti and Bhasa during his translations to Kannada. Krishnashastry's biography of Bankim Chandra Chattarjee, a noted Bengali novelist earned him a Central Sahitya Academy award. Krishnashastri wrote numerous other short stories and novels including Vachana bharata, Nirmalabharati and Kathaamruta. Vachanabharata and Nirmalabharati are an abridged versions of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Kathaamruta is a collection of stories from Kathasaritsagara, huge anthology of hundreds of fables, parables and other stories in Sanskrit. Kathaamruta has a well written introduction to Indian and western cultural traditions. In 1918, Krishnashastry started Prabuddha Karnataka, a Kannada language newspaper and worked as its editor.

It was founded in 1816 as Corps of Gendarmes by Pope Pius VII, renamed the Central Security Office in 1970, the Security Corps in 1991, and was restored to its original name in 2002. The corps numbered 130 as of 2017. It is led by Inspector General Gianluca Gauzzi Broccoletti, a cybersecurity expert who has served on the Vatican gendarmerie since 1995 and who was made deputy leader in 2018. He was appointed by Pope Francis on 15 October 2019.  History  Kepi was formerly worn by Vatican Gendarmes, the current one has the Vatican City State crest In 1816, after the dissolution of the Napoleonic empire, Pope Pius VII founded the Papal Carabinieri Corps for the service of the Papal States. In 1849, under Pope Pius IX, it was renamed, first as the Papal Velites Regiment, and then as the Papal Gendarmerie Corps. It was charged with ensuring public security and passed from dependence on the Ministry of the Army to dependence on the Cardinal Secretary of State. It took an active part in the battles that finally led to the complete conquest of the Papal States by the victorious Kingdom of Italy. After the capture of Rome in 1870, a small group of members of the Corps continued to serve in the papal residence and the gardens. In 1929, the force was expanded to deal with its duties in the newly founded Vatican City State and in the buildings and other areas over which the Holy See had extraterritorial rights. When in 1970 Pope Paul VI abolished all the military bodies at his service except the Swiss Guards, the Gendarmerie was transformed into a Central Security Office, with the duties of protecting the Pope, defending Vatican City, and providing police and security services within its territory. Its name was changed in 1991 to Security Corps of Vatican City State and in 2002 to Gendarmerie Corps of Vatican City State. Map of Vatican City, the barracks of the Gendarmerie is shown top-right  Organization  Vatican gendarme standing guard. The corps is responsible for security, public order, border control, traffic control, criminal investigation, and other general police duties in Vatican City. The Vatican Gendarmerie includes two special units, the Rapid Intervention Group (; G.I.R.) and an anti-sabotage unit (). Since 2000 an operations and control room, staffed 24 hours a day, coordinates the response of the Vatican security services in the case of an emergency. The Interpol National Central Bureau for Vatican City, tasked with collecting and sharing relevant information on crime and security with Interpol, an organisation of which Vatican City is a full member since 2008, is also part of the Vatican Gendarmerie. While the protection of the Pope's person is primarily the Swiss Guard's responsibility, the gendarmes ensure public order at the audiences, meetings and ceremonies at which he is present. In Italian territory and other countries, this is done in liaison with the local police authorities. In 2015, the Gendarmerie made eight arrests.https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/10/vatican-city-pd-gendarmes- continue-centuries-old-military-tradition/ Vatican police officers Saint Peter's square, in shirt sleeves every-day uniform (October 2014)  Gendarmes  To qualify for enrollment as a gendarme, a person must be an unmarried male between the ages of 21 to 24 of good health and a practicing Catholic. There are also minimum requirements of height and education‚Äîstanding at least 5‚Äô8‚Äù, and being a high school graduate. Military service is not a requirement, but is advantageous (in Italy there are two national military-police forces in addition to civilian police forces). The Gendarmerie's patron saint is Saint Michael the Archangel. Since 1977, the oratory of San Pellegrino in Vaticano serves as the chapel of the Gendarmerie. The church previously served as the chapel of the Pontifical Swiss Guard.  Band  The Band of the Gendarmerie () is a uniformed band of musicians that serves at Gendarmerie events and also serves as the official marching band of Vatican City. In October 2007, the band and is the heir to the Papal Gendarmerie band founded in 1851 and in turn descended from the musical formations of the body of the Pontifical Velites. The band is made up of about 100 musicians and volunteers coming from the Italian military bands such as the Italian Army Music Band and the National Carabinieri Band.  Training and operations  The Gendarmerie are responsible for policing the whole of Vatican City State (however the Italian Polizia di Stato and sometimes Italian Carabinieri patrol St. Peter's Square.) Twenty of the one hundred and thirty-eight Vatican officers have received ‚Äúspecial training‚Äù for countering ‚Äúanti-terrorist actions.‚Äù Some of these officers accompany the Pope during his international travels.‚Äù The Vatican has an operational centre ‚Äúof high technological level,‚Äù and thousands of surveillance cameras, as well as in extraterritorial Vatican properties.  Rapid Intervention Group (GIR)  The Gendarmerie has a Rapid Intervention Group (GIR) trained in: *shooting procedures, *combat in restricted environment, *anti-sabotage, *breaching. Thus the Gendarmerie can respond to threats more effectively.  Other security services in the Vatican  The Commandant of the Gendarmerie Corps is the head of the Directorate of Security and Civil Protection Services, which also oversees the Vatican fire brigade. Security in Vatican City is also provided by the Pontifical Swiss Guard, a military unit of the Holy See, not Vatican City State. The Swiss Guard are responsible for the security of the Pope, dignitaries and all papal buildings. The Swiss Guard have maintained a centuries-long tradition of carrying swords and spears, unlike the Gendarmerie Corps.  Relationship with Italy  As Vatican City State is a country within another country and due to the nature of the policing duties of the Gendarmerie, the Vatican Government and Gendarmerie maintain strong links with the Italian police and authorities. Sometimes, they will visibly assist each other in times of crisis, such as the earthquake in 2016, when the Pope reportedly sent some gendarmes to assist in the rescue but also keeping law and order. The gendarmes sent were in their uniform and carrying their firearms, as it was reported that there were looters in and amongst the area. Members of the Vatican Fire Bridgade and Pontifical Swiss Guard, were also sent to help. Likewise, the Italian Arma dei Carabinieri (Italian state military police) and Polizia di Stato (Italian national civil state police) are seen in and around St. Peter's Square (Vatican territory) policing the crowds and carrying out protective duties.  Equipment and vehicles  The Gendarmerie is equipped with weapons to protect Vatican City State. The Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol in 9 mm Parabellum as the standard-issue weapon. They also have more powerful weapons, such as: *the Beretta M12 *the Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun, a weapon also used by the Italian police. Against possible riots, they are supplied with batons, tasers, pepper sprays and tear gas. For the elite-unit Rapid Intervention Group (GIR), members are equipped with the Carbon 15 carbine and Heckler & Koch FABARM FP6 shotguns. In June 2018, it was reported that the Gendarmerie would be adding tasers to their armoury. Swords are carried for ceremonial duties. In 2010, Ducati presented two police motorbikes to the Gendarmeria, designed in the white and yellow colors of the Vatican. In September 2012, the Gendarmerie was equipped with one Kangoo Maxi ZE electric car. Later, in 2012 the donations of a Fiat Bravo and a Renault Kangoo led to the debut of a blue livery with a white- gold band, initially with the words \\"Gendarmeria Vaticana\\" then simply changed to \\"Gendarmeria \\".

Uniforms Before 1970, the 180 Pontifical Gendarmes wore elaborate ceremonial uniforms of 19th-century origin. These included bearskin headdresses with red plumes, black coatees with white-fringed epaulettes, white doeskin breeches and knee-high riding boots.

Life  Miao Xiaochun was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province. In 1986 he received his bachelor's degree and graduated from Nanjing University. In 1989 Miao graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, China and from Kassel Academy of Fine Arts in Germany in 1999 for two master's degrees. Until now he is teaching Art Photography and Digital Media at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. He is best known for his large scale photographs, often assembled panoramas, of modern Chinese cityscapes. His signature element is the presence of \\"He\\", a figure in ancient Chinese scholar costume. Other works include computer graphics installations such as The Last Judgement in Cyberspace, a 3D monochrome reworking of Michelangelo's The Last Judgment from the Sistine Chapel replacing every figure with a virtual model of Miao himself. Miao Xiaochun is considered one of the most representative and influential artists In the domain of China‚Äôs new media art. He started in 90s his creative explorations on the interface between the real and the virtual. His extensive body of work includes photography, painting and 3D computer animation which are parallel to each other. He works in contemporary photography based on the ‚Äúmultiple view point‚Äù perspective to pioneer connections between history and the modern world. Miao Xiaochun successfully uses 3D technology to create upon a 2D image a virtual 3D scene, to transform a still canvas into moving images, concurrently changing the traditional way of viewing paintings and giving a completely new interpretation and significance to a masterpiece of art, especially with the striking use of his idiosyncratic imagination about history and the future. His works add an important example to contemporary negotiations with art history, and open up new potential for art as he experiments with new possibilities, taking a step forward into new potential spheres. His photographic and 3D animation works such as The Last Judgment in Cyberspace, H2O, Microcosm, Restart and Disillusion as well as his digital ink painting series \\"Beijing Handscroll\\"are worldwide exhibited. 2011 Out of Body, White Box Museum of Art, 798 Beijing; Beijing Handscrolls, Guardini Foundation, Berlin, Germany; MIAO XIAOCHUN, Galeria Arsena≈Ç w Bia≈Çymstoku, Poland 2010 Macromania, Ludwig Museum, Koblenz, Germany; Miao Xiaochun‚ÄîTwo Big Video Works, Today Art Museum, Beijing; Recent Works by Miao Xiaochun, Arario Gallery, Seoul 2009 Index, White Space Beijing and Alexander Ochs Galleries Berlin|Beijing, Beijing; Microcosm, Arario Gallery, Beijing-New York 2008 The Last Judgment in Cyberspace, Museum of Contemporary Religious Art, St. Louis, MO, USA 2007 The Last Judgment in Cyberspace, Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia, Australia; H2O‚ÄîA Study of Art History, Osage Contemporary Art and Ideas, Hong Kong 2006 Urban Landscape, John Hope Franklin Centre of Duke University, USA; A Birdview, Zhu Qizhan Art Museum, Shanghai, China; The Last Judgment in Cyberspace, Walsh Gallery, Chicago 2004 Phantasmagoria‚ÄîPhotographs by Miao Xiaochun, Walsh Gallery, Chicago 2002 Linger, Galerie Urs Meile, Lucerne, Switzerland 2001 From East to West and Back to East, Museum of CAFA, Beijing, China 1999 Kulturbegegnungen, Galerie Stellwerk, Kassel 1994 Miao Xiaochun, Beijing Art Museum and Shanghai Art Museum 1992 Miao Xiaochun, National Museum of Chinese History, Beijing 1991 Miao Xiaochun: Recents Works, Beijing Art Museum 1988 Miao Xiaochun‚Äôs Paintings, Gallery of CAFA, Beijing Group exhibitions 2013 55th Venice Biennale, The Chinese Pavilion, Venice, Italy Move on Asia-Video Art 2002 to 2012, ZKM, Karlshure, Germany Nothing to declare? ‚Äì World Maps of Art since 89, Academy of the Arts Berlin, Germany 2012 The World of Soul: As Virtual Artistic Engineering, First Shenzhen Independent Animation Biennale, B10 Art Center, Shenzhen The 7th Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art- Mountains and Waters: Chinese Animation Since the 1930s, Queensland Art Gallery l Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane, Australia Conceptual Renewal ‚Äì Short History of Chinese Contemporary Photographical Art, Si Shang Art Museum, Beijing Chinese Contemporary Public Art, Kassel, Germany The Unseen, Main Exhibition of The 4th Guangzhou Triennial, Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangzhou, China Transformation: A View on Chinese Contemporary Art, Istanbul Modern, Istanbul, Turkey Architecture China-The 100 Contemporary Projects, Reiss-EngelhornMuseen(REM), Mannheim, Germany Go figure!

Characteristics Mesangial cells are macrophages and resemble pericytes. They typically cover 30% of glomerular capillaries. They are both vimentin and desmin positive. Function There are five known functions of intraglomerular mesangial cells: structural support of glomerular capillaries, regulation of the glomerular filtration rate, mesangial matrix formation, phagocytosis, and monitoring of capillary lumen glucose concentration. Intraglomerular mesangial cells have contractile activity. The initiation of contraction of mesangial cells is similar to that of smooth muscle. Contraction of mesangial cells is coupled with contraction of the basement membrane of the endothelium of glomerular capillaries. This causes a decrease in surface area of the basement membrane and thus a decreased glomerular filtration rate. Intraglomerular mesangial cells synthesize and secrete the extracellular matrix. It contains fibronectin, type IV collagen, perlecan, and laminin. Intraglomerular mesangial cells phagocytize glomerular basal lamina components and immunoglobulins. They are an unusual example of phagocytic cells derived from smooth muscle and not monocytes. Intraglomerular mesangial cells aid neutrophils in removing other mesangial cells undergoing apoptosis, and other debris. Intraglomerular mesangial cells monitor capillary lumen glucose concentration via processes sent into the capillary lumen.

A co-founding composer-in-residence of Schola Ministries she is also the founder and director of the Kathleen Deignan, CND Institute for Earth and Spirit at Iona College New Rochelle, New York where she was professor of Religious and Environmental Studies until 2020. A collaborative of her other endeavors at Iona, the Institute for Earth and Spirit now integrates the Iona Spirituality Center, the Thomas Berry Forum for Ecological Dialogue, and the Thomas Merton Contemplative Initiative - all in service to the cultivation of an ecological civilization. Formerly the founding director of Iona's Peace and Justice Studies Program, Deignan's work now centers on the convergence of spirituality and ecology. Deignan is a GreenFaith Fellow who completed intensive training in religious environmental leadership in 2008. Her intellectual work focuses on the prophetic legacies of Father Thomas Berry and Thomas Merton. She is President Emerita of the International Thomas Merton Society. Sister Kathleen is a board member of the American Teilhard Association, and the Advisory Boards of the Buddhist/Catholic Dialogue on the Environment and the Thomas Berry Foundation. Biography Retired Professor of Religious Studies at Iona College, Deignan has founded and directed several creative initiatives for the \\"celebration and study of the spiritual life\\". Dr. Deignan received her bachelor's degree in English Literature and Education from Sacred Heart University, Fairfield, CT which later awarded her an honorary degree. Professor Deignan earned a master's degree in Spirituality Studies and a doctorate in Historical Theology from Fordham University in New York, where she studied with geologian Thomas Berry and later received the university's Sapientia et Doctrina Award for her service to renewal of the church in 2009. She is the author of Christ Spirit: The Eschatology of Shaker Christianity and writes and lectures widely on classical and contemporary spirituality, particularly the legacy of spiritual master Thomas Merton. Her 2003 book, When the Trees Say Nothing: Writings on Nature, is the first collection of Merton's writings on nature and her latest work, Thomas Merton: A Book of Hours, is a daily breviary for engaged contemplatives drawn from his nature poetry and psalms; she also released a two-disc CD \\"A Book of Hours: At Prayer with Thomas Merton\\" composed of selected readings interwoven with her original music to complement the book. She has written over two hundred songs for worship and prayer, many of which have been recorded by Schola, and she has been singer-composer with two liturgical ensembles. With friend and fellow artist, Evelyn Avoglia, she founded Schola Ministries, a publishing and performing project in service to the liturgical and contemplative arts. Sister Kathleen was a ministerial collaborator for nearly 30 years in the worship community of the Benedictine Grange founded by iconographer and sacred artist Father John Giuliani. This ministry which began in 1968 with the campus ministry community at Sacred Heart University, gave birth to a vibrant sacred song ensemble Anima Schola; that lives on in recordings since the closing of the Benedictine Grange in 2018. As a member of the Congregation of Notre Dame, founded by Saint Marguerite Bourgeoys, she is also engaged in the mission of liberating education, which at times is expressed in peace and social/ecological justice concerns, and also spiritual animation. She initiated and formerly directed the Iona College Institute for Peace and Justice Studies in Ireland and the Iona College Spirituality Institute's Celtic Spirituality Pilgrimage to Ireland which has fostered and focused her scholarly and creative interests on the richness of her Celtic inheritance. One of her current projects is exploring the images and metaphors of Celtic ways of prayer and song. Deignan is also engaged in the contemporary ministry of interreligious dialogue as a form of peace-making, and her interfaith engagements with Jews, Muslims, and Buddhists have brought her around the world. Her parents, Patrick Paul and Bridget, were born in the west of Ireland - counties Leitrim and Roscommon - and later emigrated to London where Kathleen was born. Another emigration brought the Deignans to New York City where Kathleen was raised on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Her sister, Ann Deignan, is a physician and poet, likewise engaged in creative expression, and in ministry to the childran of Nicaragua. In her first book of poems, Mythos Gate, Ann escorts us into the creative realm of the poet's imagination in its habit of deep storytelling, largely inspired by the mythologies of the ancient world. Her latest volume is Migration, with poems that explore the mystery of impermanence. Ann's first play, Mind the Way, was performed in a reading at the New Works Series at the Irish Repertory Theater in New York City in April 2006. The death of their mother has given rise to a memorial in her honor, The Bridie Fund, for orphan girls in Nicaragua. Sr. Deignan has been, acclaimed by the National Catholic Reporter as \\"marvelous, inspiring, comforting, jolting, consoling...\\".

This formation was masterminded by Giants coach Steve Owen and relied heavily upon Hall of Fame center Mel Hein for its success. The A formation differed from the traditional single-wing in that the quarterback played further back from the line and closer to the center. It also place the backfield opposite the \\"strong\\" side of the unbalanced line, providing more flexibility in the running game (though less power). The wingback is on the opposite side compared to the single-wing and the quarterback is the primary passer, rather than the tailback. The name of the formation was arbitrary, not from its slight resemblance to the letter \\"A\\", unlike formations named \\"I\\", \\"T\\", \\"V\\", and \\"Y\\" for the shapes formed by the backs' positioning; Owen labeled the standard single wing his team's \\"B\\" formation. One major advantage of the A is the center could snap the ball to any of three players; typically to the fullback or blocking back for runs and the quarterback for passes. The fourth back, the wingback, became a crucial part of the system when Owen introduced a half-spin sweep series in 1938 which featured a wide sweep play to the motioning wingback, a dive inside by the deep fullback, and a bootleg threat away from sweep action by the quarterback. This triple-threat, highly deceptive series anticipated the Wing-T Buck Sweep series by well over a decade. A great center like Hein was a major asset, albeit not essential, in running the A formation ‚Äî however only the Giants used this set-up with any frequency. This gave the Giants an advantage in that teams had to prepare specifically to defend the A whenever they played New York. Coach Owen experimented with the A from the early 1930s on. Mel Hein joined the Giants in 1931, but Owen didn't use the A full-time until 1937. The Giants, using the A, became the first team to win their second official NFL championship games when they defeated the Green Bay Packers 23‚Äì17, adding this 1938 title to their 1934 defeat of Chicago. Green Bay ran the Notre Dame Box, another unique single-wing variant. The 1938 win was the last time the A brought the Giants a title, however, as George Halas' modern T formation began to dominate professional football after 1940. Mel Hein retired after the 1945 season and proved difficult to replace. The Giants and their A formation were beaten for the NFL championship by the Chicago Bears and the T in 1941 and 1946. Owen finally installed the T formation as an additional offense in 1948, although the Giants continued to run the A through his retirement in 1954. No other team used the A formation in the NFL and the offense today is used only by some aficionados at and below high school varsity level. Ted Seay is known to many of them as a coach who decades later developed greater passing possibilities from the nearly forgotten A.

Besides writing novels, he also wrote for the Dutch newspaper, originally a resistance periodical, Trouw. Themes of his oeuvre include religious small-mindedness of small, rural communities and the 'nobility' to which adherence to the true nature of the Christian faith can elevate believers from all walks of life.  Biography  Rudolf van Reest is the pen name of Karel Cornelis van Spronsen, son of Gerard van Spronsen and Johanna Westdijk. He married Maria Taal on 27 October 1921, in Voorschoten. In 1931, Van Reest wrote his first novel, which was followed by a series of novels, such as De grote verwachting (The great expectation) and Het loon der genade (Forgiveness' reward), and also wrote histories and biographies. From 1933 to 1939 he lived in Baarn, and was editor-in-chief at the publishing firm of Oosterbaan en Le Cointre N.V. During World War II he was active in the underground. After the liberation of The Netherlands in 1945, he was made a captain in the Military Authority at Utrecht with the assignment to eliminate the press which had co-operated with the Germans, and to establish the press which had worked \\"underground.\\" In 1946, Karel and his wife, Marie, made a trip to Canada, and also to the United States to visit Karel's brother, Cornelis van Spronsen, and his wife, Anna, and their family. He remained in America a year. This visit is described in his book, Van Kust tot Kust. (From Coast to Coast). From 1947 to 1961 Van Spronsen worked as director of the publishing house Oosterbaan en Le Cointre N.V. at Goes, and later moved to Groenekan. Maria van Spronsen-Taal died 10 November 1970 and Karel van Spronsen died in 1979. Both are buried in Bilthoven.

Brea was born into a family of coopers in Nice, and later moving to Liguria, he painted numerous altarpieces that displayed both Lombardy and Flemish influences. One of his pupils was Teramo Piaggio. His earliest definite work is the Mercy between Saint Martino and Catherine of Alexandria, painted for the monastery of Cimiez, near Nice, in 1475; recent historical searches have also suggested his having painted the Madonna of the Confraternity of the Misericordia at Nice in 1465. Other notable works by Brea can be found along all the coast from Monaco to Mentone, from Taggia to Imperia (where the influence of the Lombardy painter Vincenzo Foppa can be seen, and during which time he was in the service of Pope Julius II), and from Savona to Genoa, where he was active from 1483, leaving his work to the Church of the Consolation.

The southern terminus of the route is at the Mason‚ÄìDixon line in Thompson Township, where the road becomes a local road (North Pennsylvania Avenue) in Hancock, Maryland. The northern terminus is at State Route 1005 (SR 1005), the former alignment of U.S. Route 322 (US 322), in Reedsville. Route description Fulton County PA 655 northbound past US 30 in Harrisonville PA 655 begins at the Maryland border in Thompson Township in Fulton County, where the road continues south into that state as North Pennsylvania Avenue toward the town of Hancock. From the state line, the route heads north on two-lane undivided Thompson Road, passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. The road intersects the eastern terminus of PA 484 and continues through more rural areas, bending to the north-northeast. PA 655 crosses into Belfast Township and runs through agricultural areas and woods before it bends west and heads into the residential community of Needmore, where it comes to an intersection with US 522. At this point, PA 655 turns north for a concurrency with US 522 on Great Cove Road, passing through a mix of farmland and development and curving northeast and east. PA 655 splits from US 522 by turning north onto Pleasant Ridge Road and heading into forested areas. The road curves northeast and north, continuing through a mix of farm fields and woodland with a few residences. The route curves northwest and northeast before it reaches the community of Pleasant Ridge. PA 655 enters Licking Creek Township and turns northeast and southeast as it runs through farmland and woodland. The route turns north to remain along Pleasant Ridge Road and heads north-northeast through forested areas with some farm fields and homes, passing through the community of Andover. The road winds through more rural areas a short distance to the west of Licking Creek, reaching an intersection with US 30 in the community of Harrisonville. Past the US 30 intersection, PA 655 winds north- northeast through forests with some farmland, crossing into Dublin Township. Here, the road turns to the northwest and winds through more rural land before coming to a bridge over I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike). Following this, the route heads north and crosses into Taylor Township, where it runs through residential areas in the community of Hustontown. PA 655 comes to an intersection with SR 4014 (Pitt Street), which heads east a short distance to connect to PA 475, at which point PA 655 turns west onto Pitt Street. The route leaves Hustontown and becomes Waterfall Road, heading through farmland with some homes and curving northwest. The road runs through forested areas before it passes through agricultural areas and turns to the north. PA 655 runs through a mix of farm fields and woodland, passing through the community of Gracey. Farther north, the route passes through forests and comes to a junction with the eastern terminus of PA 913 in the community of Waterfall, where it turns east-southeast to remain along Waterfall Road. The road runs between farmland to the north and forested areas to the south before making a turn to the north. Huntingdon and Mifflin counties PA 655 enters Clay Township in Huntingdon County and heads north through farmland with some homes before turning northeast and northwest. The road curves north and passes through forested areas. Farther north, the route runs through wooded areas with some fields and turns to the northeast. PA 655 winds northeast through woodland before it heads into agricultural areas and curves north, coming to an intersection with PA 994. At this point, PA 994 turns north for a short concurrency with PA 655 before splitting to the west. Following this, PA 655 runs through more farmland before it enters the borough of Saltillo. At this point, the road becomes Main Street and is lined with homes. The route leaves Saltillo for Clay Township again and becomes an unnamed road, passing through a mix of farm fields and woodland with some residences. PA 655 crosses into Cass Township and reaches an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 829 in the community of Knightsville. Past this intersection, the route becomes Hares Valley Road and runs through a narrow valley between Clear Ridge to the west and Jacks Mountain to the east. The road heads north-northeast through farmland with some homes in the valley. Farther north, PA 655 passes through the community of Barneytown and heads into Union Township, where it continues into more forested areas with some fields and residences. PA 655 enters the borough of Mapleton and becomes Campbell Street, heading into residential areas and turning southeast onto Main Street. The route turns northeast onto Bridge Street and passes under Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line before it comes to a bridge over the Juniata River, at which point it leaves Mapleton for Brady Township. After the bridge, PA 655 turns north onto Oriskany Road, running through forested areas to the east of the river. The road heads north- northeast further away from the river and passes east of an industrial plant before it comes to an intersection with US 22. At this point, PA 655 heads north concurrent with US 22 on William Penn Highway, which carries one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. The road passes through forests to the east of the Juniata River and Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line. The two routes curve northeast away from the river and railroad tracks, becoming a three-lane road with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane. The road turns to the north-northwest and narrows to two lanes before entering the borough of Mill Creek, where it passes development and gains a center left- turn lane. PA 655 splits from US 22 by turning northeast onto two-lane undivided Big Valley Pike, running through residential areas. The road leaves Mill Creek for Brady Township and heads north-northeast through forests before turning northeast through the community of Fousetown. The route turns east into wooded areas with some residences before a curve to the northeast. PA 655 heads into the Kishacoquillas Valley, an agricultural valley between Stone Mountain to the northwest and Jacks Mountain to the southeast which is home to an Amish community. After entering the valley, the route runs through farm fields with some homes and passes through the communities of Airydale and Sharpsburg. PA 655 enters Menno Township in Mifflin County and continues northeast through agricultural areas in the Kishacoquillas Valley as an unnamed road. The route runs through the community of Allensville on Main Street, where it passes homes and a few businesses. After leaving Allensville, PA 655 heads back into farmland as an unnamed road. Farther northeast, the road passes through the community of Menno before it crosses into Union Township. The route becomes West Main Street and runs through farmland with some development before it reaches the community of Belleville. Here, PA 655 heads into residential areas and comes to an intersection with the eastern terminus of PA 305. Following this intersection, The route passes homes and businesses in the center of Belleville and becomes East Main Street. The road passes more development before it leaves Belleville and runs through agricultural areas. PA 655 becomes an unnamed road as it continues northeast through rural land, running through the community of Kishacoquillas. The road heads into Brown Township and runs through more farmland with some homes, passing through the community of Cedar Hill. Farther northeast, the route passes businesses and becomes a divided highway, curving east to come to a diamond interchange with the US 322 freeway. PA 655 widens to four lanes and comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with SR 1005 (Tea Creek Road/North Main Street) north of the community of Reedsville. History Most of PA 655 was once Pennsylvania Route 76. From 1928 to Spring 1964, PA 76 occupied what is now PA 655 from the Maryland state line to Pennsylvania Route 829 in Cass Township, as well as PA 829 from Cass Township to Mill Creek and PA 655 from Mill Creek to Reedsville. The section of present PA 655 between Saltillo and Mill Creek was designated part of PA 376. In spring 1964, PA 655 was assigned to its current alignment, replacing the PA 76 and PA 376 designations. This change was made to remove numbering conflicts that resulted from the designation of I-76 and I-376 in Pennsylvania. Major intersections PA 655 Truck Pennsylvania Route 655 Truck is a truck route of PA 655 that bypasses a weight-restricted bridge over Saddlers Run on which trucks over 36 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited.

Sewed by local nuns and given to the Bulgarian volunteers in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 by the citizens of the Russian city of Samara on 18 May 1877, it became famous when it was heroically prevented from being captured by the Ottoman forces in the Battle of Stara Zagora, with many soldiers perishing while protecting it from the enemy. The flag, a tricolour 1.85 √ó 1.90 m in size, was sewed from thin silk cloth and has the pan-Slavic colours (red, white, blue). Icons of the Holy Mother of God and Cyril and Methodius were drawn on it in a golden cross by the Saint Petersburg artist Nikolay Simakov. It has a silver point designed by Graf Rochefort. The flag, originally intended for the rebels of the April Uprising, was handed to the Bulgarians near Ploie≈üti on 18 May, having been transported through Chi≈üinƒÉu, where it was on 1 May. A delegation from the city of Samara, headed by Efim Kozhevnikov and Pyotr Alabin, handed the Samara flag to the volunteers in a special ceremony, with the flag being nailed using gold nails to its pole. The last nail was nailed by the old voyvoda Tseko Petkov, a leader of a band in the Troyan part of the Balkan Mountains for 30 years, who, with his fur cap taken off and with his eyes fixed at the sky, exclaimed: His words were followed by a storm of cheers and a cap toss. The flag, entrusted to the 3rd battalion of the Bulgarian volunteer corps, was part of the battles at Stara Zagora and Nova Zagora, where a number of colour-bearers perished protecting it (including Lieutenant- Colonel Pavel Kalitin), as well as the Battles of Shipka Pass and Sheynovo. The Samara flag, initially kept in Radomir from where its last bearer Pavel Korchev descended, was housed in the royal palace in Sofia (now the National Art Gallery) between 1881 and 1946, when it was transferred to the National Museum of Military History (NMMH). It has remained there ever since, preserved in a chamber under special conditions. Two copies of the flag were made in 1958, one of which was sent to the Central Military Museum in Russia. Another two were made afterwards, one of which in 1978 in the NMMH restoration workshop by Mihail Maletski. The nuns of the Russian-founded Knyazhevo Nunnery of the Shroud of the Most Holy Mother of God gave the NMMH another precise copy made by them in 2006. The Samara flag is the only flag awarded the Bulgarian Medal for Bravery, the medal being implanted in its pole's richly decorated point. The flag has been portrayed numerous times by noted artists, the most famous paintings featuring it being arguably The Samara Flag by Jaroslav Vƒõ≈°√≠n from 1911 and Handing of the Samara Flag to the Bulgarian Volunteer Corps in Ploie≈üti by Nikolay Dmitriev-Orenburgsky. The contemporary flag of Russia's Samara Oblast (image) was based on the Samara flag when it was adopted in 1998.

Camel cavalry, or camelry (, ), is a generic designation for armed forces using camels as a means of transportation. Sometimes warriors or soldiers of this type also fought from camel-back with spears, bows or rifles. Camel cavalry were a common element in desert warfare throughout history in the Middle East, due in part to the animal's high level of adaptability. They provided a mobile element better suited to work and survive in an arid and waterless environment than the horses of conventional cavalry. The smell of the camel, according to Herodotus, alarmed and disoriented horses, making camels an effective anti-cavalry weapon when employed by the Achaemenid Persians in the Battle of Thymbra. Early history A Purbiya camel rider in Bihar, India in 1825 The first recorded use of the camel as a military animal was by the Arab king Gindibu, who is claimed to have employed as many as 1000 camels at the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC. A later instance occurred in the Battle of Thymbra in 547 BC, fought between Cyrus the Great of Persia and Croesus of Lydia. According to Xenophon, Cyrus' cavalry were outnumbered by as much as six to one. Acting on information from one of his generals that the Lydian horses shied away from camels, Cyrus formed the camels from his baggage train into an ad hoc camel corps with armed riders replacing packs. Although not technically employed as cavalry, the smell and appearance of the camels was crucial in panicking the mounts of the Lydian cavalry and turning the battle in Cyrus' favor.Jim Hicks, page 21 \\"The Persians\\", Time-Life Books, 1975 More than sixty years later, the Persian king Xerxes I recruited a large number of Arab mercenaries into his massive army during the Second Persian invasion of Greece, all of whom were equipped with bows and mounted on camels. Herodotus noted that the Arab camelry, including a massive force of Libyan charioteers, numbered as many as twenty thousand men in total strength. According to Herodian, the Parthian king Artabanus IV employed a unit consisted of heavily-armored soldiers equipped with spears (kontos) and riding on camels.Herodian of Antioch, History of the Roman Empire (1961) pp.108-134. Book 4. CHAPTER XIV The Roman Empire used locally enlisted camel riders along the Arabian frontier during the 2nd century. The first of these was the Ala I Ulpia Dromoedariorum Palmyrenorum, recruited under the Emperor Trajan from Palmyra. Arab camel troops or dromedarii were employed during the late Roman Empire for escort, desert policing and scouting duties. Pre-Islamic period and Islamic conquests The camel was used as a military mount by pre-Islamic civilizations in the Arabian Peninsula. As early as the 1st Century AD Nabatean and Palmyrene armies employed camel-mounted infantry and archers recruited from nomadic tribes of Arabian origin. Typically such levies would dismount and fight on foot rather than from camel-back. Extensive use was made of camels during the initial campaigns of Muhammad and his followers. Subsequently, the Arabs used camel-mounted infantry to outmanoeuvre their Sassanid and Byzantine enemies during the Muslim conquests. Modern era Shaffron (head defense) for a camel (Turkey, possibly 17th century) Napoleon employed a camel corps for his French campaign in Egypt and Syria. During the late 19th and much of the 20th centuries, camel troops were used for desert policing and patrol work in the British, French, German, Spanish and Italian colonial armies. Italian Dubats in Somalia in the 1930s Descendants of such units still form part of the modern Moroccan, Egyptian armies and Indian paramilitary The British-officered Egyptian Camel Corps played a significant role in the 1898 Battle of Omdurman; one of the few occasions during this period when this class of mounted troops took part in substantial numbers in a set-piece battle. The Ottoman Army maintained camel companies as part of its Yemen and Hejaz Corps, both before and during World War I. The Italians used Dubat camel troops in their Somalia Italiana, mainly for frontier patrol during the 1920s and 1930s. These Dubats participated in the Italian conquest of the Ethiopian Ogaden in 1935-1936 during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.

Influenced by both social realism and European styles, he specialises in historical paintings that insert Mao Zedong into iconic social and political photos of the 20th century - such as the Yalta Conference, the HUAC hearings, and a state procession of the British Queen Mother. He has shown work internationally in many exhibitions including Mahjong at the Kunstmuseum in Bern, China Art Now at the Marella Gallery in Milan, China Contemporary Painting at Fondazione Carisbo in Bologna, and Landscapes at the Shanghai Gallery of Art. He is represented by the Marella Gallery in Beijing and Milan, Shine Art Space in Shanghai, and by ARNDT in Berlin. Life and work Shi Xinning was born in 1969, in Liaoning Province, China to his parents who were People's Liberation Army members. Xinning received a formal education in art at the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts in Shenyang, Liaoning Province. Xinning graduated in 1990 and continued to develop his art career for 10 years before producing his Mao paintings, which are some of his most famous. Shi Xinning's works often contain subject matter related to the Chinese Cultural Revolution, which he experienced as a child. Some of his notable paintings are his paintings featuring Mao Zedong with people, places, or events which are entirely impossible to have occurred. Shi Xinning's work appears to deal with issues of history, cultural memory, Western Eurocentrism, and Chinese Isolationism. One of Xinning's first Mao paintings was his painting \\"Duchamp Retrospective Exhibition\\", which portrays Mao inspecting Marcel Duchamp's famous urinal sculpture entitled \\"Fountain\\". This work injects humor through the fact that Duchamp's Dadaist expression and avant- garde art would not be permitted in China under Mao's rule, as official art in China at the time was confined to propaganda. This is also humorous because without Duchamp's \\"R. Mutt\\" signature on the urinal, Mao could just as well be inspecting a factory-made urinal for its usefulness in aiding China. Due to the unexpected subject matter of Xinning's Mao paintings, Mao Zedong's presence often seems absurd or ironic. Mao Zedong can be seen beside celebrities Sofia Loren and Jayne Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Peggy Guggenheim, and even Andy Warhol. Not only is Mao represented next to notable western cultural figures and celebrities in these paintings, but he is also found attending historic events with western politicians and leaders. In Xinnings \\"Mao and McCarthy\\", for example, Mao can be seen attending the HUAC hearings, though he is not being questioned but is rather an observer. The irony of the Communist chairman Mao being a welcome observer of the hearing injects humor into the situation and establishes Shi Xinning's works as re-authorings of collective cultural memory. Shi Xinning¬¥s work appears in the \\"China Art Book\\", The 80 most renowned Chinese Artists, DUMONT When referring to the purpose or meaning behind his inclusion of Mao Zedong in his paintings, Xinning cited influences from his early life in China during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Xinning said regarding his work: \\"These are Shi Xinning's black-and-white visions of the way Mao's China could have been if China hadn't isolated itself from the capitalist West.\\" Despite the anachronism present in Xinning's work, the use of Mao's image in his paintings serves to also ground his work in modern China and its surrounding culture. According to Xinning, \\"today Mao is still an icon in China. He is omnipresent; he defined my childhoos and the lives of my parents. I never show him the real context of the 1960s or 1970s. I present him as a visual memory.\\" Xinning has said, however, that he has little interest in Mao as a person, and instead is interested in Mao as an icon. Xinning's artwork has seen commercial success in the art market, where his work \\"Mao and McCarthy\\" was valued in 2007 to be worth between 50,000 and 70,000 USD at auction. Shi Xinning's \\"Yalta\\" painting was valued in 2008 to be worth between 98,020 and 137,227 USD at auction. Visual Style & Themes Xinning relies heavily on the usage of icons and visual themes from the Chinese Cultural Revolution, particularly the likeness of Mao Zedong. Xinning's art deals with impossibility and anachronism, as Xinning introduces Mao into impossible situations. Xinning never paints Mao in a more accurate or relevant time period or location, as Xinning entirely avoids painting Mao in the 1960s and 1970s. The majority of Xinning's work is done in black and white, and color works usually use sepia tones. This color scheme choice by Xinning, along with his reproduction of famous press photographs from history, helps establish his \\"photographic\\" or \\"newspaper\\" style. Xinning himself confirms this interpretation of his style, as he often compares his work with that of a film director. Xinning portrays his scenes with a high level of detail, which gives his pictures a photorealistic appearance. Xinning also uses very subtle brushwork, which helps support his illusion that his paintings are historical photos.

The faction was later called the \\"extreme right-wing\\" of British and Irish politics.James J. Sack, \\"Ultra tories (act. 1827‚Äì1834)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, accessed 19 September 2011. The Ultra- Tories faction broke away from the governing party in 1829 after the passing of the Catholic Relief Act 1829. Many of those labelled Ultra-Tory rejected the label and saw themselves as upholders of the Whig Revolution settlement of 1689.J. J. Sack, From Jacobite to Conservative. Reaction and orthodoxy in Britain, c. 1760‚Äì1832 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 69. The Ultra- Tories were defending \\"a doctrine essentially similar to that which ministerial Whigs had held since the days of Burnet, Wake, Gibson and Potter\\".J. C. D. Clark, English Society, 1688‚Äì1832. Ideology, social structure and political practice during the ancien r√©gime (Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. 408.  History  A faction that was never formally organised, the Ultra-Tories were united in their antipathy towards the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel for what they saw as a betrayal of Tory political and religious principle on the issue of Catholic emancipation. They took their opposition to Peel to the extent of running a candidate against Peel when he had to resign his Oxford University seat when taking up political office, a requirement for all MPs when taking a ministerial office then. Although Peel was able to get back to Parliament via another parliamentary seat, this battle between Tory factions further embittered internal relations in the party. The Ultra-Tory faction was informally led in the House of Commons by Member of Parliament Sir Edward Knatchbull and Sir Richard Vyvyan. In the House of Lords, they enjoyed the support of many ex-cabinet ministers and leading peers like the Duke of Cumberland, the Earl of Winchilsea and the Duke of Newcastle. Their general viewpoint could be described as extreme on the matter of defending the established Anglican ascendancy and barring Catholics from political office or influence. However, they were split on the issue of electoral reform and a large group came to a view that it could strengthen the appeal of pro-Protestantism. The inability of the Tories to reunite led to losses in the 1830 general election following the death of King George IV. Combined also with the news of the July Revolution in France and a series of bad harvests in England which saw a great increase in political agitation, some Ultras returned to the party. However, there were sufficient Ultra-Tories left who were able to combine with the Whigs and the Canningite grouping, who had previously split from the main Tory party back in 1827-1828 over the issue of Catholic emancipation which they had supported, to defeat Wellington who finally resigned in November 1830. This led to the creation of a government with Lord Grey as Prime Minister and the leading Canningites such as Lord Palmerston and Lord Melbourne. One leading Ultra-Tory, the Duke of Richmond, joined the Grey Cabinet and a few others appointed in more junior ministerial positions. However, the scope of the subsequent reforms proved too much for many of the pro-government Ultras who then moved back into opposition. Eventually, Richmond left the Whig led coalition and returned to the Tory party, or the Conservative Party as it was generally now known, after 1834. Except for a few irreconcilables the vast bulk of the Ultra-Tories would eventually move over to the Conservatives, with some such as Knatchbull enjoying political office in Peel's first government in 1834. However, when the party split again in 1846 over the issue of abolishing the Corn Laws, the remaining Ultra-Tories quickly rallied to the protectionist banner and helped to vote Peel out from office once again, this time for good.Pearce and Stern, Government and Reform: Britain 1815‚Äì1918 (2nd ed.), p. 35. Hodder Murray, 2000 The Ultra-Tories were civilian politicians. In practice, they had the overwhelming support of the Anglican clergy and bishops, many of whom came under severe verbal attack in their home parishes and dioceses for opposition to the Reform Act of 1832.Owen Chadwick, The Victorian Church (1966) vol. 1, pp 24‚Äì47.  Legacy  J. C. D. Clark depicts England before 1828 as a nation in which the vast majority of the people believed in the divine right of kings, the legitimacy of a hereditary nobility and in the rights and privileges of the Anglican Church. In Clark's interpretation, the system remained virtually intact until it suddenly collapsed in 1828 because Catholic emancipation undermined Anglican supremacy which was its central symbolic prop. Clark argues that the consequences were enormous: \\"The shattering of a whole social order [...]. What was lost at that point [...] was not merely a constitutional arrangement, but the intellectual ascendancy of a worldview, the cultural hegemony of the old elite\\".J. C. D. Clark (1985). pp. 90, 409. Clark's interpretation has been widely debated in the scholarly literatureBoyd Hilton, A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People? England, 1783‚Äì1846 (Clarendon Press, 2006) pp. 668‚Äì671 and almost every single historian who has examined the issue has highlighted the substantial amount of continuity between the periods before and after 1828‚Äì1832.Professor Frank O'Gorman, review of English Society 1688-1832: Ideology, Social Structure and Political Practice During the Ancien Regime (review no. 41b), accessed 25 July 2012. Eric J. Evans emphasizes that the political importance of Catholic emancipation in 1829 was that it split the anti-reformers beyond repair and diminished their ability to block future reform laws, especially the great Reform Act of 1832. Paradoxically, Wellington's success in forcing through emancipation converted many Ultra- Tories to demand reform of Parliament. They saw that the votes of the rotten boroughs had given the government its majority. Therefore, it was the Ultra- Tory the Marquess of Blandford who in February 1830 introduced the first major reform bill, calling for the transfer of rotten borough seats to the counties and large towns, the disfranchisement of non-resident voters, preventing Crown office-holders from sitting in Parliament, the payment of a salary to MPs and the general franchise for men who owned property. Such ultras believed that somewhat more open elections would be relied upon to oppose Catholic equality.Eric J.

Unlike the Windows built-in defragmenter tool, Contig can defragment individual files, individual directories, and subsets of the file system using wildcards. Contig does not move any data except that belonging to the file in the question, so the amount it can defragment a file is limited to the largest contiguous block of free space on a system. Use of contig exchanges decreased file fragmentation for increased free space fragmentation. Combined usage of the -s parameter and the wildcard symbol * allows whole directories and drives to be defragmented: for example, contig -s C:\\\\\\\\* will defrag all the files on hard drive C.

Times Square, Hong Kong, 2008 Yue Minjun (; born 1962) is a contemporary Chinese artist based in Beijing, China. He is best known for oil paintings depicting himself in various settings, frozen in laughter. He has also reproduced this signature image in sculpture, watercolour and prints. While Yue is often classified as part of the Chinese Cynical Realist art movement developed in 1989, Yue rejects this label, but also \\"doesn't concern himself about what people call him.\\" Early life Yue was born in 1962 in Daqing, Heilongjiang, China. His family worked on an oil field, and he also taught art in oil school for a short time. In 1980, he graduated from high school, went to Tian Jing National Company. In 1983, he decided to go to He Pei and became an electrician. He was painting and working at the same time, and he could normally paint and work non-stop for 20 days. This life experience could indicate why he paints skin in red. In the 1980s, he started painting portraits of his co-workers and the sea while he was engaged in deep-sea oil drilling. In 1989, he was inspired by a painting by Geng Jianyi at an art show in Beijing, which depicted Geng's own laughing face.Guy Smiley by Ben Davis, Artnet Magazine, November 11, 2007 In 1990, he eventually moved to Hongmiao in the Chaoyang District, Beijing, which was also home to many other Chinese artists. During this period, his style of art developed out of portraits of his bohemian friends from the artists' village. It is important to note that Yue lived a \\"nomadic\\" existence for much of his life, because his family often moved in order to find work on various oil fields. Labeled by critics as a very influential member of the Cynical Realism movement, he found success and praise for his signature images in a variety of including sculpture, water color, and print.water color works http://yueminjun.artron.net/works_detail_BRT000000039147 The whole country was experiencing the complexities modernity and postmodernity, breaking down old thoughts and doing something new, very much reflected in the Chinese modern art revolution. This was crucially important for Yue. He has said he up in very a closed world, where military families gave him a protected feeling, but everything happening during this period totally changed his relationship to the world. Career A-maze-ing Laughter by Yue Minjun in Vancouver Yue Minjun's style can be traced back to the work of Geng Jianyi,Geng Jianyi http://www.artspy.cn/html/artist/0/622/opus_o18966.html who first inspired Yue with his work of his own laughing face. Over the years, Yue Minjun's style has also rapidly developed. He often challenges social and cultural conventions by depicting objects and even political issues in a radical and abstract manner. He has also shifted his focus from the technical aspects to the \\"whole concept of creation\\". 'Massacre of Chios', one of his most known works, shares its name with a painting of the same name, by Eug√®ne Delacroix, depicting the 1822 event in Greek history. As of 2007 thirteen of his paintings had sold for over a million dollars. One of his most popular series was his \\"Hat\\" collection. This series, pictures Yue's grinning head wearing a variety of hats‚Äîa chef's hat, a Special Forces beret, the helmet of a British policeman, Catwoman's mask, and so on. The artist tells us that the series is about a \\"sense of the absurdity of the ideas that govern the sociopolitical protocol surrounding hats.\\" The series nicely illustrates the way that Yue's character is universally adaptable, a sort of logo that can be attached to any setting to add value. When asked to participate in the Venice Biennale in 1999, Yue opted to begin fabricating bronze sculptural versionshttp://yueminjun.artron.net/works_detail_btr000065000122 Sculpture is one of his main working directions, he is using bronze to make figure sculptures that have very dark skin tone and fleshy muscles. The flesh covered with artery and blood and as usual the figures are wearing underwear and with their iconic smile. of his signature self-portrait paintings, playing off China's famous Qin Dynasty army of terracotta warriors. While the ancient sculptures are known for the subtle individuality of each of the warriors, his cackling modern-day version are relentlessly identical, cast from the same mold. In Noah's Ark, six of Yue's self-portraits sit in a small rowboat on a blue sea, squatting together, gripping their knees and screaming in silent laughter. In Solar System, three identical Yues are cackling at the bottom of the canvas, each clad only in underwear, giant planets wheeling behind them in outer space.  Cynical Realism  In the mid-1990s, the \\"godfather\\" of Chinese contemporary art, Li Xianting, labeled Yue Minjun with Cynical Realism.See also Fang Lijun. Cynical Realism described the status of living with a cynical and ridiculing art attitude, using self-opinion to understand the political and commercial. \\"Yue‚Äôs pieces are mocking himself and the community, free himself and vent his emotions.\\" Art critics have often associated Yue with the Cynical Realism art movement in contemporary Chinese art. Yue is currently residing with fifty other Chinese artists in the Songzhuang Village.  Art Market  Since his debut, the work of Yue Minjun has been featured in numerous galleries in Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing.

He was a distinguished artist working in a late-Baroque idiom for international clients. In Italian sources he is often referred to as Pietro Stefano Monnot, an italianised version of his name. Biography Monnot was born at Orchamps-Vennes near Besan√ßon in the Franche-Comt√©. Trained by his father, a woodcarver, he subsequently worked for Jean Dubois, a sculptor in Dijon, for a year. He then took on independent commissions for religious works in Besan√ßon and Poligny. Monnot also visited Paris on at least two occasions, probably 1679‚Äì1681 and between 1684 and 1686, where he might have had contact with or worked under some of the leading sculptors working on the various enterprises of Louis XIV.Walker, Stefanie. The Sculptor Pietro Stefano Monnot in Rome, 1687‚Äì1713 (Ann Arbor, 1994), p. 29. Leaving Besan√ßon in December 1686, he arrived in Rome in February 1687,Walker, p. 67. where he was introduced to an established, tightly knit community of Burgundian artists. Monnot quickly integrated into Rome's artistic circles and gained many commissions. With the main sculptures of the Saint Ignatius altar in the Church of the Ges√π assigned to Pierre Le Gros the Younger and Jean-Baptiste Th√©odon in 1695, French sculptors in Rome became highly prized for decades to come.Enggass 1976 provides the setting and outlines the patterns of patronage for Roman sculpture in this period; his section \\"The French in Rome\\" sets Monnot in the context of his compatriots. Monnot himself contributed a Pair of Angels holding the IHS monogramme to the Saint Ignatius altar. Monnot's first major commission was for two marble reliefs, a Nativity and a Flight into Egypt flanking Domenico Guidi's Dream of St. Joseph for the right transept altar in Santa Maria della Vittoria. Here, as in some other pieces, Monnot was to some measure influenced by Guidi, a pupil of Alessandro Algardi, who had become a prominent sculptor in late 17th- century Rome. Through his patron, Prince Livio Odescalchi, Monnot was entrusted to execute the Tomb of Pope Innocent XI for St. Peter's Basilica (1697‚Äì1704) to a design by Carlo Maratta. He was also among the select group to be commissioned with apostles of heroic scale for niches in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran. On his last of three Grand Tours in 1699‚Äì1700, the English aristocrat John Cecil, 5th Earl of Exeter, entrusted Monnot with some major commissions. For his family seat, Burghley House, the earl ordered a relief of 'The Adoration of the Child' and portrait busts of himself and his wife, still at Burghley House. Leone Pascoli mentions five large and one small statues but the other pieces are untraced. Pascoli, Leone, Vite de'pittori, scultori, ed architetti moderni, 2 vols (Rome, 1730, 1736). Vol 2 p.491. Finally, Monnot created the couple's tomb monument with reclining lifesize figures of the earl and his countess together with two standing allegorical figures to the sides. This was shipped to England and installed in the family chapel at St Martin's Church, Stamford. The earl saw none of these works completed as he died on his return journey to England in 1700, followed into the grave by his wife in 1703.According to the inscription on the tomb monument. Like all sculptors working in Rome, Monnot was called upon to restore fragmentary antiquities. Baroque restorations often took broader liberties of interpretation than eighteenth-century and later tastes permitted. Monnot restored a torso of a copy after Myron's Discobolus as a Wounded Gladiator who supports himself on his arm as he sinks to the ground; it was donated before 1734 by Pope Clement XII to the Capitoline Museums, where it remains.Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: the Lure of classical Sculpture 1500‚Äì1900 (Yale University Press), pp 200, 227. Marmorbad Monnot's masterwork is the vast complex of marble sculptures and bas-reliefs set against richly colored marble revetments of the Marmorbad (\\"Marble Bath\\") in the Orangerie at the Karlsaue in Kassel. Monnot went to Kassel in 1714, and began by executing marble portrait busts of Karl, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, and the Landgravine. In January 1715 the first contracts were signed concerning the new Appartement du Bain with its statuary, ten sculptures that were already completed in Rome, some of them as early as 1692, and commissioned four white marble high relief panels for the outerwalls of the pavilion, eight further relief panels for the vaulting and the portrait medallion of Karl himself. Monnot established a studio with assistants in Kassel and to help him produce the works. Renewed agreements in 1718 increased the marble relief panels to the eight that were installed, and the ensemble was inaugurated in 1729. The final two statues, Minerva and Aurora, were announced as ready by Monnot in 1731, but did not actually reach Kassel until 1734. The architect of the garden pavilion is unknown; Monnot's mythological sculptures occupy niches in the massive central pier, and his eight large white marble high relief panels of subjects from Ovid's Metamorphoses fill the piers between arch-headed windows. Pierre- √âtienne Monnot died in Rome. One of his pupils, Bartolomeo Cavaceppi (1716‚Äì1799), was a sculptor best known as a restorer of antiquities.

Although the exact date of construction and original owner of the Count's House are unknown, the building is believed to have been built prior to the Civil War. The plaque on the exterior denotes the house as having been completed circa 1860. The house has had a number private owners throughout its history, the most notable being Count Oskar Bopp von Oberstadt, an Austrian count for whom the house is named.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201302.pdf For its architectural significance, the Count's House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 1982. A wrought iron fence was constructed around the entire perimeter of the property under new ownership in 2005. Architecture The Count's House is particularly distinct for its two faces, a very unusual feature for a Greek Revival. The north facade, facing Waukegan Road, consists of a portico with full two-story columns of the Doric order. The south facade, facing Main Street, consists of two-story loggia with an upper balcony and several intricate mouldings. The six-over-six windows, balustrades, columns, door surrounds, and nearly all of the exterior moldings appear to be original. The house's exterior walls consist of double-wythe brick, with double-hung windows over six and a half feet in height. The only known significant modifications to the house have been additions to its wing, the replacement of the column pedestals with brick, and the replacement of the original cedar shake with asphalt shingles. Aside from these discrepancies, an old postcard published in Historic Homes of McHenry County reveals that the house remains much as it appeared in the early 1900s, if not earlier.

Also called air‚Äìfuel ratio gauge, air‚Äìfuel meter, or air‚Äìfuel gauge, it reads the voltage output of an oxygen sensor, sometimes also called AFR sensor or lambda sensor. The original narrow-band oxygen sensors became factory installed standard in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In recent years a newer and much more accurate wide-band sensor, though more expensive, has become available. Most stand-alone narrow-band meters have 10 LEDs and some have more. Also common, narrow band meters in round housings with the standard mounting 2 1/16\\" and 2 5/8\\" diameters, as other types of car 'gauges'. These usually have 10 or 20 LEDs. Analogue 'needle' style gauges are also available. As stated above, there are wide-band meters that stand alone or are mounted in housings. Nearly all of these show the air‚Äìfuel ratio on a numeric display since the wide-band sensors provide a much more accurate reading. As wide-band sensors use more accurate electronics, these meters are more expensive. Benefits of air‚Äìfuel ratio metering * Determining the condition of the oxygen sensor: A malfunctioning oxygen sensor will result in air‚Äìfuel ratios that respond more slowly to changing engine conditions. A damaged or defective sensor may lead to increased fuel consumption and increased pollutant emissions as well as decreased power and throttle response. Most engine management systems will detect a defective oxygen sensor. * Reducing emissions: Keeping the air‚Äìfuel mixture near the stoichiometric ratio of 14.7:1 (for gasoline engines) allows the catalytic converter to operate at maximum efficiency. * Fuel economy: An air‚Äìfuel mixture leaner than the stoichiometric ratio will result in near-optimal fuel mileage, costing less per distance traveled and producing the least amount of CO2 emissions. However, from the factory, cars are designed to operate at the stoichiometric ratio (rather than as lean as possible while remaining drivable) to maximize the efficiency and life of the catalytic converter. While it may be possible to run smoothly at mixtures leaner than the stoichiometric ratio, manufacturers must focus on emissions and especially catalytic converter life (which must now be 100,000 miles (160,000 km) on new vehicles ) as a higher priority due to U.S. EPA regulations. * Engine performance: Carefully mapping out air‚Äìfuel ratios throughout the range of rpm and manifold pressure will maximize power output in addition to reducing the risk of detonation. Lean mixtures improve the fuel economy but also cause sharp rises in the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOX). If the mixture becomes too lean, the engine may fail to ignite, causing misfire and a large increase in unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Lean mixtures burn hotter and may cause rough idle, hard starting and stalling, and can even damage the catalytic converter, or burn valves in the engine. The risk of spark knock/engine knocking (detonation) is also increased when the engine is under load. Mixtures that are richer than stoichiometric allow for greater peak engine power when using vaporized liquid fuel due to the mixture not being able to reach a perfectly homogenized state so extra fuel is added to ensure all oxygen is burned producing maximum power. The ideal mixture in this type of operation depends on the individual engine. For example, engines with forced induction such as turbochargers and superchargers typically require a richer mixture under wide open throttle than naturally aspirated engines. Forced induction engines can be catastrophically damaged by burning too lean for too long. The leaner the air‚Äìfuel mixture, the higher the combustion temperature is inside the cylinder. Too high a temperature will destroy an engine ‚Äì melting the pistons and valves. This can happen if one ports the head and/or manifolds or increase boost without compensating by installing larger or more injectors, and/or increasing the fuel pressure to a sufficient level. Conversely, engine performance can be lessened by increasing fueling without increasing air flow into the engine. Furthermore, if an engine is leaned to the point where its exhaust gas temperature starts to fall, its cylinder head temperature will also fall. This is only recommended in the cruising configuration, never when accelerating hard, but is becoming increasingly popular in aviation circles, where the appropriate engine monitoring gauges are fitted and the fuel air mixture can be manually adjusted. Cold engines also typically require more fuel and a richer mixture when first started (see: cold start injector), because fuel does not vaporize as well when cold and therefore requires more fuel to properly \\"saturate\\" the air. Rich mixtures also burn faster and decrease the risk of spark knock/engine knocking (detonation) when the engine is under load. However, rich mixtures sharply increase carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Sensor types Zirconia oxygen sensor The early introduction of the oxygen sensor came about in the late 1970s. Since then zirconia has been the material of choice for its construction. The zirconia O2 sensor produces its own voltage, which production makes it a type of generator. The varying voltage will display on a scope as a waveform somewhat resembling a sine wave when in closed loop control. The actual voltage that is generated is a measure of the oxygen that is needed to complete the combustion of the CO and HC present at the sensor tip. The stoichiometric air-fuel ratio mixture ratio for gasoline engine is the theoretical air-fuel ratio at which all of the fuel will react with all of the available oxygen resulting in complete combustion. At or near this ratio, the combustion process produces the best balance between power and low emissions. At the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, the generated O2 sensor voltage is about 450 mV. The Engine Control Module (ECM) recognizes a rich condition above the 450 mV level, and a lean condition below it, but does not detect the extent of the richness or leanness. It is for this reason that the zirconia O2 sensor is called a ‚Äúnarrow-band‚Äù O2 sensor. Titanium oxygen sensor The titanium O2 sensor was used throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s on a limited basis. This sensor's semiconductor construction makes its operation different from that of the zirconia O2 sensor. Instead of generating its own voltage, the titanium O2 sensor's electrical resistance changes according to the exhaust oxygen content. When the air/fuel ratio is rich, the resistance of the sensor is around 950 ohms and more than 21 kilohms when the mixture is lean. As with the zirconia sensor, the titanium O2 sensor is also considered a narrow-band O2 sensor. Narrow-band sensor Narrowband O2 oxygen sensor voltage vs AFR for a gas engine As mentioned before, the main problem with any narrow-band O2 sensor is that the ECM only detects that the mixture is slightly richer or leaner than the stoichiometric ratio. The ECM does not measure the operating air-fuel ratio outside the stoichiometric range. In effect it only detects that the mixture is richer or leaner than stoichiometry. An O2 sensor voltage that goes lower than 450 mV will cause a widening of injector pulse and vice versa. The resulting changing or cycling fuel control (closed-loop) O2 signal is what the technician sees on the scope when probing at the O2 sensor signal wire. Wide-band sensors The newer ‚Äúwide-band‚Äù O2 sensor solves the narrow sensing problem of the previous zirconia sensors. These sensors are often called by different names such as continuous lambda sensors (lambda representing air-fuel ratio), AFR (air-fuel ratio sensors), LAF (lean air-fuel sensor) and wide-band O2 sensor. Regardless of the name, the principle is the same, which is to put the ECM in a better position to control the air/fuel mixture. In effect, the wide-band O2 sensor can detect the exhaust's O2 content way below or above the perfect air/fuel ratio. Such control is needed on new lean burning engines with extremely low emission output levels. Tighter emission regulations and demands for better fuel economy are driving this newer fuel control technology. Construction and operation The wide- band O2 sensor looks similar in appearance to the regular zirconia O2 sensor. Its inner construction and operation are totally different, however. The wide- band O2 sensor is composed of two inner layers called the reference cell and the pump cell. The ECM's AFR sensor circuitry always tries to keep a perfect air/fuel ratio inside a special monitoring chamber (diffusion chamber or pump- cell circuit) by way of controlling its current. The AFR sensor uses dedicated electronic circuitry to set a pumping current in the sensor's pump cell. In other words, if the air/fuel mixture is lean, the pump cell circuit voltage momentarily goes low and the ECM immediately regulates the current going through it in order to maintain a set voltage value or stoichiometric ratio inside the diffusion chamber. The pump cell then discharges the excess oxygen through the diffusion gap by means of the current created in the pump-cell circuit. The ECM senses the current and widens injector pulsation accordingly to add fuel. If on the other hand the air/fuel mixture goes rich, the pump cell circuit voltage rapidly climbs high and the ECM immediately reverses the current polarity to readjust the pump cell circuit voltage to its set stable value. The pump cell then pumps oxygen into the monitoring chamber by way of the reversed current in the ECM's AFR pump cell circuit. The ECM detects the reversed current and an injector pulsation-reduction command is issued bringing the mixture back to lean. Since the current in the pump cell circuit is also proportional to the oxygen concentration or deficiency in the exhaust, it serves as an index of the air/fuel ratio. The ECM is constantly monitoring the pump cell current circuitry, which it always tries to keep at a set voltage. For this reason, the techniques used to test and diagnose the regular zirconia O2 sensor can not be used to test the wide-band AFR sensor. These sensors are current-driven devices and do not have a cycling voltage waveform. The testing procedures, which will be discussed later, are quite different from the older O2 sensors. Comparison with mass airflow sensor The AFR sensor operation can be thought of as being similar to the hot wire mass airflow sensor (MAF). But, instead of an MAF hot wire, the ECM tries to keep a perfectly stoichiometric air/fuel ratio inside the monitoring chamber by varying the pump cell circuit current. The sensing part at the tip of the sensor, is always held at a constant voltage (depending on manufacturer). If the mixture goes rich, the ECM will adjust the current flowing through the sensing tip or pump cell circuit until the constant operating voltage level is achieved again. The voltage change happens very fast. The current through the pump circuit also pushes along the oxygen atoms either into, or out of, the diffusion chamber (monitoring chamber) which restores the monitoring chamber's air/fuel ratio to stoichiometry. Although the ECM varies the current, it tries to maintain the pump circuit at a constant voltage potential. Testing As the ECM monitors the varying current, a special circuit (also inside the PCM or Power-train Control Module) converts the current into a voltage value and passes it on to the serial data stream as an OBD-II PID (not to be confused with a PID controller). This is why the best way to test an AFR sensor's signal is by monitoring the voltage conversion circuitry, which the ECM sends out as an AFR-voltage PID. It is possible to monitor the actual AFR sensor varying current, but the changes are very small (in the low milliamp range) and difficult to monitor. A second drawback to a manual AFR current test is that the signal wire has to be cut or broken to connect the ammeter in series with the pump circuit. Today's average clamp-on ammeter is not accurate enough at such a small scale. For this reason, the easiest (but not the only) way to test an AFR sensor is with the scanner. By using a scanner to communicate with the ECM, one can view AFR sensor activity. This data is typically displayed as WRAF (Wide Range Air Fuel), A/F, or AFR sensor voltage. However, on some vehicles and scanners it will show up as \\"lambda\\" or \\"equivalence ratio.\\" If the PID displays a voltage reading, it should be equal to the sensor's reference voltage when the air/fuel mixture is ideal. The reference voltage varies from car to car, but is often 3.3 V or 2.6 V. When the fuel mixture becomes richer (on a sudden, quick acceleration), the voltage should decrease. Under lean conditions (such as deceleration) the voltage should increase. If the scanner PID displays a \\"lambda\\" or \\"equivalence ratio,\\" the reading should be 1.0 under stoichiometric conditions. Numbers above 1.0 indicate a lean condition while numbers below 1.0 indicate rich mixtures. The ECM uses the information from the sensors to adjust the amount of fuel being injected into the engine, so corresponding changes in the short- term fuel trim PID(s) should also be seen. Lean mixture readings from the AFR sensor will prompt the ECM to add fuel, which will manifest itself as a positive (or more positive) short-term fuel trim percentage. Some technicians will force the engine to run lean by creating a vacuum leak downstream from the mass airflow sensor, and then watch scanner PIDs for a response. The engine can be forced rich by adding a metered amount of propane to the incoming airflow. In either case, if the sensor does not respond, it likely has a problem. However, these tests do not rule out other circuitry problems or ECM issues. Thorough, systematic diagnosis is recommended. Operating temperature Another major difference between the wide-band AFR sensor and a zirconia O2 sensor is that it has an operating temperature of about .LSU 4.7 / LSU 4.2 Planar Wide Band Lambda Sensor Technical Customer Information, Y 258 K01 005-000e, 1999-01-25, Robert Bosch, accessed 2015-03-26 On these units the temperature is very critical and for this reason a special pulse-width controlled heater circuit is employed to control the heater temperature precisely. The ECM controls the heater circuit. Advantages The wide operating range coupled with the inherent fast acting operation of the AFR sensor, puts the system always at stoichiometry, which reduces a great deal of emissions. With this type of fuel control, the air/fuel ratio is always hovering close to 14.7:1. If the mixture goes slightly rich the ECM adjusts the pump circuit's current to maintain the set operating voltage. The current is detected by the ECM's detection circuit, with the result of a command for a reduction in injector pulsation being issued. As soon as the air-fuel mixture changes back to stoichiometry, because of the reduction in injector pulsation, the ECM will adjust the current respectively. The end result is no current (0.00 amperes) at 14.7:1 air-fuel ratio. In this case a light negative hump is seen on the ammeter with the reading returning to 0.00 almost immediately. The fuel correction happens very quickly. Practicalities of operation A narrow-band sensor has a nonlinear output, with ranges from 0.10v to 1.0v with .450 being ideal. Narrow-band sensors are temperature-dependent. If the exhaust gases become warmer, the output voltage in the lean area will rise, and in the rich area it will be lowered. Consequently, a sensor, without pre- heating, has a lower lean-output and a higher rich-output, possibly even exceeding 1 volt. The influence of temperature on voltage is smaller in the lean mode than in the rich mode. A \\"cold\\" engine makes the computer change the fuel air ratio so the output voltage of the o2 sensor switches between about 100 and 850/900 mV and after a while the sensor may output a switch voltage between about 200 and 700/750 mV, for turbocharged cars even less. The engine control unit (ECU) when operating in \\"closed loop\\" tends to maintain zero oxygen (thus a stoichiometric balance), wherein the air‚Äìfuel mixture is approximately 14.7 times the mass of air to fuel for gasoline. This ratio maintains a \\"neutral\\" engine performance (lower fuel consumption yet decent engine power and minimal pollution). The average level of the sensor is near to 450 mV. Since catalytic converters need a cycling a/f ratio the oxygen sensor is not allowed to hold a fixed voltage, the ECU controls the engine by providing the mixture between lean (and rich) in such a sufficiently fast manner by means of shorter (or longer) time of signal to injectors, so the average level becomes as stated about 450 mV. A wide-band sensor, on the other hand, has a very linear output, 0‚Äì5 V, and requires a much hotter running temperature. Which type of air‚Äìfuel ratio meter to be used If the purpose of the air‚Äìfuel ratio meter is to detect also an existing or possible problem with the sensor above of checking the general mixture and performance, a narrow band air-fuel ratio meter is sufficient. In high-performance tuning applications, the wide-band system is desirable.

The Newton‚ÄìWigner position operators 1, 2, 3, are the premier notion of position in relativistic quantum mechanics of a single particle. They enjoy the same commutation relations with the 3 space momentum operators and transform under rotations in the same way as the , , in ordinary QM. Though formally they have the same properties with respect to 1, 2, 3, as the position in ordinary QM, they have additional properties: One of these is that : [x_i \\\\, , p_0 ] = p_i/p_0 ~. This ensures that the free particle moves at the expected velocity with the given momentum/energy. Apparently these notions were discovered when attempting to define a self adjoint operator in the relativistic setting that resembled the position operator in basic quantum mechanics in the sense that at low momenta it approximately agreed with that operator. It also has several famous strange behaviors, one of which is seen as the motivation for having to introduce quantum field theory. References M.H.L. Pryce, Proc. Roy. Soc. 195A, 62 (1948) *V.

The signal box celebrated its 25th birthday in 2006. The beginning of Doncaster PSB On Sunday 8 July 1979, the first section of the control panel in the new signal box at Doncaster became operational, controlling the movement of all trains in the immediate area of Doncaster station. Not only was this a significant landmark in the progress of the whole resignalling and track rationalisation project, but it also represented a further major step forward in British Rail's drive towards the complete modernisation of the London - Edinburgh East Coast Main Line. The signal box was completed in 1981 and was officially opened on 8 December 1981. East Coast Main Line upgrade The Doncaster installation was the third major signal box to be commissioned on the East Coast Main Line, the previous two being King's Cross, completed in 1977 and Peterborough in 1973. Before the scheme's authorisation in 1974, train movement was controlled by a mixture of outdated semaphore and colour light signals operated from 52 signal boxes mainly containing mechanical lever frames, many dating from the 19th century. Power signalling, however, was installed in two signal boxes, one at the north and the other at the south of Doncaster station. The work was planned and some equipment was on site before the Second World War but the installation was not commissioned until 1949. Searchlight colour light signals and electric point machines were controlled from switch panels. The interlocking equipment was unique being a sequence switch interlocking system manufactured by Standard Telephone Company using telephone switching techniques to the technical specification of the signal engineer of the then Southern Area of the London and North Eastern Railway. The sequence switches consisted of a rotary contact shaft which was rotated to a route position and proved a circuit through contact wipers. Each switch had a \\"home\\" position and eleven route positions. When a route was initiated, a clutch was engaged on the appropriate switch to rotate it into its correct position thus setting up the appropriate interlocking circuits through other switches and relays. The installations proved to be remarkably reliable, serving a very useful purpose but were eventually life expired. In association with the resignalling scheme was a major programme of track improvements to enable trains to run at speeds of up to 125 mph. This was achieved by simplification and rationalisation of the track layout and realignment of curves at many places. An early improvement was the adaptation of an existing railway bridge south of Doncaster to become a flyover enabling trains to and from the Lincoln Line to cross over the main line without conflicting with the mainline trains. The largest alteration to the track layout was in the Doncaster area where the work was staged over an extensive period. Marshgate Junction Marshgate Junction to the north of Doncaster station forms the junction of the lines from the station to the double track to Leeds, York (ECML) and Thorne (thence Hull, Scunthorpe and Grimsby). The new layout entailed considerable changes from the then existing layout and it was estimated that the junction remodelling would take nine months of weekend work. A decision was made to carry this out during five weeks' continuous work in the spring of 1979 when the operation of trains through the area was drastically reduced and the Leeds Line was closed for a period of time. Although there were some inevitable diversions and retiming of trains, disruption of services was kept to a minimum and the project was completed on schedule. The previous Marshgate Junction allowed for a maximum speed of 60 mph on the Doncaster - York main lines with diverging speeds of 25 mph on the main lines to and from Leeds and Thorne. Other speeds were 15 mph. The remodelling of the layout in association with other improvements in the Doncaster station area allowed speeds of 105 mph through the Doncaster section of the East Coast Main Line route. The divergence to and from the Leeds Line allowed a maximum speed of 70 mph. Other improvements on the Doncaster PSB area included raising the maximum permissible speed at Retford from 80 to 115 mph and at Newark from 80 to 100 mph. Design of the scheme was governed by the need to satisfy operating requirements of speed and headway. Besides employing what was then modern signal equipment, an associated comprehensive communication network was necessary to achieve reliability and efficiency. Track rationalisation and resignalling proceeded side-by-side, starting in the Grantham area and working progressively northwards while at the same time the new Doncaster signalling centre was constructed on a site south of the station and on the east side of the main line. Milestone Colour light signalling on the East Coast Main Line from London to Edinburgh was completed on 24 September 1978 and the achievement was marked by the ceremonial withdrawal of the last semaphore signal at Decoy, south of Doncaster. The signalling centre The signal box is a two-storey brick building, with the upper section clad in black ceramic tiles, the signal box complex houses the ground floor relay room, telecommunications room, standby generator room and also houses the maintenance team with offices and mess facilities. On the first floor is the signalling control room. Dominating the control room is a 110 feet long illuminated signalling control panel, the wings of which are inclined towards the centre. On the near-vertical portion of the panel is depicted the track layout of the area controlled. Positioned on the layout to correspond with the location of all signals are push buttons which are used for operating points and clearing signals along the route selected for the passage of a train. Track circuits, which indicate the position of trains, are also shown on the diagram in distinctive colours. Television monitor screens for two of the seven level crossings monitored by closed circuit television (CCTV) from Doncaster PSB, are inset into the panel itself (Kirton Lane & Rossington) and the other five are mounted on a separate desk console (Daw Lane, Arksey, and Moat Hills on the ECML; Bentley, and Dock Hills on the Leeds Line). Also on hand in the signal control room are read-out units for the special line side equipment, located at 16 sites, which detect overheating in the axle boxes of vehicles on passing trains. If an abnormally high temperature is recorded, the equipment will indicate the exact position in the train of the overheated axle, and the signaller can have the train stopped and the vehicle examined. Announcers A separate desk is set aside for East Coast's Doncaster station announcer and the equipment for operation train destination visual displays that are transmitted to the screens on platforms at Doncaster, Retford, Newark North Gate and Grantham. Closure In 2020, most of the signalling will be transferred to York Rail Operating Centre, with full closure in 2025. This is part of Network Rail's drive to introduce 12 national control centres with digital signalling. York Rail Operating Centre will control all of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, County Durham, Northumberland and the East Coast Main Line from Kings Cross to Berwick-Upon-Tweed. Locomotive naming In 2002, GB Railfreight locomotive 66703 was named \\"Doncaster PSB 1981-2002\\", not only to celebrate the 21st birthday of this important signal box, but also to show the close working relationship between GBRf and Doncaster PSB.

Xiang graduated from the Department of Sculpture of China Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA) in Beijing. Her graduating works won first prize in the \\"Graduation Show of Central Academy of Fine Arts 1995\\" and she also won the Okamatsu Family Fund. These sculptures that won these prizes were collected by the school because of the beauty and interest that were shown in them. After graduation, she continued to sculpt women and a few other objects. She taught at Shanghai Normal University from 1997 to 2009.http://www.xiangjingart.com/en/index.php?m=list&a;=index&id;=47 Her work can be divided into \\"Mirror Image\\" (1999‚Äì2002), \\"Keep in Silence\\" (2003‚Äì2005), and \\"Naked Beyond Skin\\" (2006‚Äì2008) series. She moved back to her hometown Beijing in 2009. Most of her sculptures are based on women whose shows the imperfect nature and realness of women. She does not make her sculptures perfect; instead, she gives them flaws that are common in women. These flaws often include a flabby waistline, a lack of expression on the face, and often an off shaped body. Xiang Jing seems to convey the humility or emptiness of the everyday woman on the surface. The artist is truly interested in the \\"psychological truth\\" of human beings and seeks the existential truth of human life. Her latest series of works \\"Will Things Ever Get Better?\\" (2009‚Äì2011)http://www.xiangjingart.com/en/index.php?g=portal&m;=list&a;=index&id;=6 is composed of the \\"animals\\" and the \\"acrobats\\", which reflects on the predicament of our human condition. Works Xiang Jing is considered highly satirical and there are questions that are raised surrounding the plight of the post-feminist movement of women. She shows the emotions and expresses the mindset of women which causes her work to shift from personal to political. Xiang Jing matches the outward appearance of the sculpture with inner philosophy and emotions of the same image. She is a well-rounded sculptor whose works include: some animal figures, clothed women, and naked women. The sculptures are made from different things; some of them are cast in bronze or polyurethane while others are painted fiberglass. As an artist, she seems to keep most of her focus on women and how she portrays them in her work. She captures the current trends, some popular activities that contemporary women indulge in (clubbing, shopping, etc.). Xiang Jing hardly ever uses synthetic materials in her works. She uses some props such as cigarettes. She is phenomenal at expressing the emotions of the women she sculpts. Depending on the work, most of the women seem to have the emotion of depression. In some of them, there seems to be a sense of reflection or vulnerability. These sculptures have an eerie glow about them that conveys the emotion of anger or sadness. Happiness does not seem to be a theme in any of her creations. Your Body (2005) Your Body (2005, fiberglass & paint, 270√ó160√ó150cm) at The Saatchi Gallery, The Revolution Continues: New Art from China, 2008 In one of her most famous works, Your Body, Xiang Jing made a huge naked women slumping in a large wooden chair. The women is sculpted and painted with porcelain. This is a prime example of the type of works Xiang Jing creates. The naked woman seems to have silky smooth skin which makes it look like plastic. This is done on purpose by Xiang Jing to show the material feel of women in the contemporary world. The face of the woman has a sort of blank look to it which makes it very interesting to look at. When looking into the eyes of the sculpture, the observer cannot help but feel the emotions they would see in a living human being. She seems slightly depressed while in a deep reflection. Her reflection leaves her in a place of humility and emptiness while the vulnerability of herself is shown through her nudity and posture. The body of the woman is imperfect. She has a flabby body and there is no clear beauty she has about her. Her face is intriguing but it does not have the \\"normal\\" aspects of beauty. The whole body seems real. She is just a normal woman with her own problems which she is contemplating. The slacking position gives a feel of comfort. She seems comfortable for where she is at but depressed on where her life is going. Xiang Jing presents the woman's body naked because it instantly grabs the attention of the viewers. It is slightly controversial which makes it a topic for discussion. After the audience gets past the nakedness, they will look closer and see the features that tell the rest of the meaning behind the work. Bang! (2002) Bang!, 2002, fiberglass & paint, 162√ó160√ó110cm, Xiang Jing This is one of the more interesting Works of Xiang Jing. It shows two women in modern clothing, one of which is cowering in fear while the other is smiling. The woman that is smiling has her hand shaped as a gun and it pointing it directly towards the head of the other woman. The woman that is in fear does not seem to realize the feeling on her head is just the finger of the other woman. She truly believes she is about to die. After looking closely, her eyes are shut and it feels like she is letting out a terrified scream. The other woman seems to be taking joy in this action. This is a good example of how Xiang Jing shows a sense of violence through her work. The woman is taking pleasure in the fear and fear of the other woman. The woman who is in fear is vulnerable because of her fear of death. The women are in modern clothes, Xiang Jing is trying to show that some women live in this sort of fear in the modern day. She is showing that there are two different types of women; the ones who fear and those who are feared. She could also be playing on the violence of society causing people to live in fear or society causing the violence. This is another sculpture painted in porcelain. It is very realistic. Unlike Your Body, the women are in shape but they seem real still. Xiang Jing creates lifelike sculpture to portray a stronger message to the audience. Are A Hundred Playing You? Or Only One? (2007) This work is a good example of a work by Xiang Jing. The figures in this work are very realistic. They could easily be mistaken as real women if they were viewed from a distance, but once the viewer gets closer to the work, they can tell that they are just sculptures. This work shows mystery behind the work of Xiang Jing. The viewers can not understand what is trying to be conveyed to them through the women. The women clearly have something wrong but it is not clear what it is. Their eyes seem like they are in depression or some sort of discomfort. It is up to the viewer to decide what is wrong and what the women are doing to try to fix it. In all of Xiang Jing's works, there is a sense of mystery behind the women. She conveys different emotions with their eyes but it is the individual viewer to imagine what experiences the woman has gone through and what she is feeling.

In 2003, the school was renamed in honor of Walter Francis Sullivan, Bishop Emeritus of the Diocese of Richmond and a significant benefactor during the school's move to Virginia Beach. The Barry Robinson Theater and Fine Arts Center opened that same year. In 2019, the school was renamed Catholic High School amid direction that all diocesan institutions, schools and parish buildings must \\"no longer be named after an individual bishop, pastor, founder or individual\\". Academics Catholic High School is a college preparatory school and fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Virginia Catholic Education Association. Over 98% of CHS' senior classes enrolls in an institution of higher learning upon graduation. Catholic High School offers a variety of AP courses for advanced preparatory education, including: English Literature, English Language, World History, U.S. History, U.S. Government and Politics, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Environmental Science, German, Spanish, Latin: Literature, Latin: Vergil, and Studio Art. Religious Education In keeping with its Catholic tradition, CHS also gives the students a chance to get in touch with their relationship to God. Students receive various aspects of religious education and are required to perform community service to better understand their place in the wider community, serve as Eucharistic Ministers & Lectors at religious celebrations, and help with the planning and preparation of services and community events. CHS's Campus Ministry program is one of the strongest and most active on campus. Students, whether Catholic or not, participate in retreats, communal prayer services, and lead prayer each day. Catholic High School is a Roman Catholic school in the Diocese of Richmond. The Mass is celebrated each week for the whole campus and confessions are available weekly and celebrated as a community twice yearly. CHS also marks several significant events (Rites of Passage, Baccalaureate) with Mass. In addition each student is required to take 4 years of theology. Athletics Catholic High School offers 41 sports teams for students to be involved in high school athletics and is a founding member of the Tidewater Conference of Independent Schools as well as a member of the Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association (VISAA). Catholic High School is a college preparatory school where students are asked to push themselves every day with a rigorous academic program. At the same time, athletics are very important to the students at CHS. Over 85% of the student body participates on at least one of various sports teams. In 2013, the football team won its first state championship, defeating Potomac School (McLean, Virginia) 50‚Äì44 in the Virginia Independent Schools title game to cap off an undefeated season. However, the tenure of football coach Carl Turner ended after the season; the school released a statement saying that Turner had resigned for personal reasons, but Turner then said that he had been fired because he had \\"run the score up on opposing teams\\" after being told not to do so.

The principle of event symmetry  What it means  Since general relativity was discovered by Albert Einstein in 1915, observation and experiment have demonstrated that it is an accurate gravitation theory up to cosmic scales. On small scales, the laws of quantum mechanics have likewise been found to describe nature in a way consistent with every experiment performed, so far. To describe the laws of the universe fully a synthesis of general relativity and quantum mechanics must be found. Only then can physicists hope to understand the realms where gravity and quantum come together. The Big Bang is one such place. The task to find such a theory of quantum gravity is one of the major scientific endeavours of our time. Many physicists believe that string theory is the leading candidate, but string theory has so far failed to provide an adequate description of the Big Bang, and its success is just as incomplete in other ways. That could be because physicists do not really know what the correct underlying principles of string theory are, so they do not have the right formulation that would allow them to answer the important questions. In particular, string theory treats spacetime in quite an old fashioned way even though it indicates that spacetime must be very different at small scales from what we are familiar with. General relativity by contrast, is a model theory based on a geometric symmetry principle from which its dynamics can be elegantly derived. The symmetry is called general covariance or diffeomorphism invariance. It says that the dynamical equations of the gravitational field and any matter must be unchanged in form under any smooth transformation of spacetime coordinates. To understand what that means you have to think of a region of spacetime as a set of events, each one labelled by unique values of four coordinate values x,y,z, and t. The first three tell us where in space the event happened, while the fourth is time and tells us when it happened. But the choice of coordinates that are used is arbitrary, so the laws of physics should not depend on what the choice is. It follows that if any smooth mathematical function is used to map one coordinate system to any other, the equations of dynamics must transform in such a way that they look the same as they did before. This symmetry principle is a strong constraint on the possible range of equations and can be used to derive the laws of gravity almost uniquely. The principle of general covariance works on the assumption that spacetime is smooth and continuous. Although this fits in with our normal experience, there are reasons to suspect that it may not be a suitable assumption for quantum gravity. In quantum field theory, continuous fields are replaced with a more complex structure that has a dual particle-wave nature as if they can be both continuous and discrete depending on how you measure them. Research in string theory and several other approaches to quantum gravity suggest that spacetime must also have a dual continuous and discrete nature, but without the power to probe spacetime at sufficient energies it is difficult to measure its properties directly to find out how such a quantised spacetime should work. This is where event symmetry comes in. In a discrete spacetime treated as a disordered set of events it is natural to extend the symmetry of general covariance to a discrete event symmetry in which any function mapping the set of events to itself replaces the smooth functions used in general relativity. Such a function is also called a permutation, so the principle of event symmetry states that the equations governing the laws of physics must be unchanged when transformed by any permutation of spacetime events.  How it works  It is not immediately obvious how event symmetry could work. It seems to say that taking one part of space time and swapping it with another part a long distance away is a valid physical operation, and that the laws of physics must be written to support this. Clearly this symmetry can only be correct if it is hidden or broken. To get this in perspective consider what the symmetry of general relativity seems to say. A smooth coordinate transformation or diffeomorphism can stretch and twist spacetime in any way so long as it is not torn. The laws of general relativity are unchanged in form under such a transformation. Yet this does not mean that objects can be stretched or bent without being opposed by a physical force. Likewise, event symmetry does not mean that objects can be torn apart in the way the permutations of spacetime would make us believe. In the case of general relativity the gravitational force acts as a background field that controls the measurement properties of spacetime. In ordinary circumstances the geometry of space is flat and Euclidean and the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity is hidden thanks to this background field. Only in the extreme proximity of a violent collision of black holes would the flexibility of spacetime become apparent. In a similar way, event symmetry could be hidden by a background field that determines not just the geometry of spacetime, but also its topology. General relativity is often explained in terms of curved spacetime. We can picture the universe as the curved surface of a membrane like a soap film that changes dynamically in time. The same picture can help us understand how event symmetry would be broken. A soap bubble is made from molecules that interact via forces that depend on the orientations of the molecules and the distance between them. If you wrote down the equations of motion for all the molecules in terms of their positions, velocities and orientations, then those equations would be unchanged in form under any permutation of the molecules (which we will assume are all the same). This is mathematically analogous to the event symmetry of spacetime events. The equations may be different, and unlike the molecules on the surface of a bubble, the events of spacetime are not embedded in a higher-dimensional space, yet the mathematical principle is the same. Physicists do not presently know if event symmetry is a correct symmetry of nature, but the example of a soap bubble shows that it is a logical possibility. If it can be used to explain real physical observations then it merits serious consideration.  Maximal permutability  American philosopher of physics John Stachel has used permutability of spacetime events to generalize Einstein's hole argument.J Stachel, \\"\`The Relations Between Things' versus \`The Things Between Relations': The Deeper Meaning of the Hole Argument\\", in Reading Natural Philosophy/ Essays in the History and Philosophy of Science and Mathematics, ed. David Malament Chicago and LaSalle, IL, Open Court pp 231-266 (2002) Stachel uses the term quiddity to describe the universal qualities of an entity and haecceity to describe its individuality. He makes use of the analogy with quantum mechanical particles, that have quiddity but no haecceity. The permutation symmetry of systems of particles leaves the equations of motion and the description of the system invariant. This is generalised to a principle of maximal permutabilityJ. Stachel, \\"Structure, individuality and quantum gravity\\" in Structural Foundations of Quantum Gravity, edited by D.P. Rickles, S.R.D. French and J. Saatsi Oxford University Press (2005) that should be applied to physical entities. In an approach to quantum gravity where spacetime events are discrete, the principle implies that physics must be symmetric under any permutations of events, so the principle of event symmetry is a special case of the principle of maximal permutability. Stachel's view builds on the work of philosophers such as Gottfried Leibniz whose monadology proposed that the world should be viewed only in terms of relations between objects rather than their absolute positions. Ernst Mach used this to formulate his relational principle, which influenced Einstein in his formulation of general relativity. Some quantum gravity physicists believe that the true theory of quantum gravity will be a relational theory with no spacetime. The events of spacetime are then no longer a background in which physics happens. Instead they are just the set of events where an interaction between entities took place. Characteristics of spacetime that we are familiar with (such as distance, continuity and dimension) should be emergent in such a theory, rather than put in by hand.  and other random graph models In a random graph model of spacetime, points in space or events in spacetime are represented by nodes of a graph. Each node may be connected to any other node by a link. In mathematical terms this structure is called a graph. The smallest number of links that it takes to go between two nodes of the graph can be interpreted as a measure of the distance between them in space. The dynamics can be represented either by using a Hamiltonian formalism if the nodes are points in space, or a Lagrangian formalism if the nodes are events in spacetime. Either way, the dynamics allow the links to connect or disconnect in a random way according to specified probability rule. The model is event-symmetric if the rules are invariant under any permutation of the graph nodes. The mathematical discipline of random graph theory was founded in the 1950s by Paul Erd≈ës and Alfr√©d R√©nyi.P. Erd≈ës, A R√©nyi, \\"On Random Graphs I\\", Publ. Math. Debrecen 6, p. 290‚Äì297, (1959) They proved the existence of sudden changes in characteristics of a random graph as parameters of the model varied. These are similar to phase transitions in physical systems. The subject has been extensively studied since with applications in many areas including computation and biology. A standard text is \\"Random Graphs\\" by B√©la Bollob√°s.B. Bollob√°s, \\"Random Graphs\\", 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, (2001) Application to quantum gravity came later. Early random graph models of space-time have been proposed by Frank Antonsen (1993), Manfred Requardt (1996)M. Requardt, \\"Emergence of Space-Time on the Planck Scale within the Scheme of Dynamical Cellular Networks and Random Graphs\\", (1996), and Thomas Filk (2000). Tomasz Konopka, Fotini Markopoulou-Kalamara, Simone Severini, and Lee Smolin of the Canadian Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics introduced a graph model that they called Quantum Graphity.T Konopka, F Markopoulou, L Smolin, \\"Quantum Graphity\\", (2006), An argument based on quantum graphity combined with the holographic principle can resolve the horizon problem and explain the observed scale invariance of cosmic background radiation fluctuations without the need for cosmic inflation. In the quantum graphity model, points in spacetime are represented by nodes on a graph connected by links that can be on or off. This indicates whether or not the two points are directly connected as if they are next to each other in spacetime. When they are on the links have additional state variables that define the random dynamics of the graph under the influence of quantum fluctuations and temperature. At high temperature, the graph is in Phase I where all the points are randomly connected to each other and no concept of spacetime as we know it exists. As the temperature drops and the graph cools, it is conjectured to undergo a phase transition to a Phase II where spacetime forms. It will then look like a spacetime manifold on large scales with only nearest-neighbour points being connected in the graph. The hypothesis of quantum graphity is that this geometrogenesis models the condensation of spacetime in the Big Bang, and in support of the quantum foam idea . Event symmetry and string theory String theory is formulated on a background spacetime just as quantum field theory is. Such a background fixes spacetime curvature, which in general relativity is like saying that the gravitational field is fixed. However, analysis shows that the excitations of the string fields act as gravitons, which can perturb the gravitational field away from the fixed background. So, string theory actually includes dynamic quantised gravity. More detailed studies have shown that different string theories in different background spacetimes can be related by dualities. There is also good evidence that string theory supports changes in topology of spacetime. Relativists have therefore criticised string theory for not being formulated in a background independent way, so that changes of spacetime geometry and topology can be more directly expressed in terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom of the strings. The difficulty in achieving a truly background independent formulation for string theory is demonstrated by a problem known as Witten's Puzzle.E. Witten, \\"Space-time Transitions in String Theory\\", (1993) Ed Witten asked the question \\"What could the full symmetry group of string theory be if it includes diffeomorphism invariance on a spacetime with changing topology?\\". This is hard to answer because the diffeomorphism group for each spacetime topology is different and there is no natural way to form a larger group containing them all such that the action of the group on continuous spacetime events makes sense. This puzzle is solved if the spacetime is regarded as a discrete set of events with different topologies formed dynamically as different string field configurations. Then the full symmetry need only contain the permutation group of spacetime events. Since any diffeomorphism for any topology is a special kind of permutation on the discrete events, the permutation group does contain all the different diffeomorphism groups for all possible topologies. There is some evidence from Matrix Models that event-symmetry is included in string theory. A random matrix model can be formed from a random graph model by taking the variables on the links of the graph and arranging them in a N by N square matrix, where N is the number of nodes on the graph. The element of the matrix in the nth column and mth row gives the variable on the link joining the nth nodes to the mth node. The event-symmetry can then be extended to a larger N dimensional rotational symmetry. In string theory, random matrix models were introduced to provide a non-perturbative formulation of M-Theory using noncommutative geometry. Coordinates of spacetime are normally commutative but in noncommutative geometry they are replaced by matrix operators that do not commute. In the original M(atrix) Theory these matrices were interpreted as connections between instantons (also known as D0-branes), and the matrix rotations were a gauge symmetry. Later, Iso and Kawai reinterpreted this as a permutation symmetry of space-time events and argued that diffeomorphism invariance was included in this symmetry. The two interpretations are equivalent if no distinction is made between instantons and events, which is what would be expected in a relational theory. This shows that Event Symmetry can already be regarded as part of string theory. Trivia  Greg Egan's dust theory  The first known publication of the idea of event symmetry is in a work of science fiction rather than a journal of science. Greg Egan used the idea in a short story called \\"Dust\\" in 1992G. Egan, \\"Dust\\", Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, July 1992. and expanded it into the novel Permutation City in 1994. Egan used dust theory as a way of exploring the question of whether a perfect computer simulation of a person differs from the real thing. However, his description of the dust theory as an extension of general relativity is also a consistent statement of the principle of event symmetry as used in quantum gravity. The essence of the argument can be found in chapter 12 of \\"Permutation City\\". Paul, the main character of the story set in the future, has created a copy of himself in a computer simulator. The simulation runs on a distributed network sufficiently powerful to emulate his thoughts and experiences. Paul argues that the events of his simulated world have been remapped to events in the real world by the computer in a way that resembles a coordinate transformation in relativity. General relativity only allows for covariance under continuous transformations whereas the computer network has formed a discontinuous mapping that permutes events like \\"a cosmic anagram\\". Yet Paul's copy in the simulator experiences physics as if it were unchanged. Paul realises that this is \\"Like [‚Ä¶] gravity and acceleration in General Relativity ‚Äî it all depends on what you can't tell apart. This is a new Principle of Equivalence, a new symmetry between observers.\\" References Category:Quantum gravity Category:General relativity Category:Differential geometry ","title":"Event symmetry"},{"id":"8117065","text":"ORVYL is a timesharing monitor developed by Stanford University for IBM System/360 and System/370 computers in 1967‚Äì68.ORVYL/370 Timesharing System Functional Description, Stanford University, 1978 ORVYL was one of the first time-sharing systems to be made available for IBM computers. Wylbur is a text editor and word processor program designed to work either without ORVYL, or in conjunction with ORVYL.WYLBUR Reference Manual, Stanford University, 1984  Overview  The names ORVYL and WYLBUR are often used interchangeably, but: * ORVYL is a timesharing monitor that supports a file system, command language, program execution and debugging, and provides supervisor services. * WYLBUR is a text editor, word processor, job submission and retrieval, and e-mail program designed to work in conjunction with ORVYL or with IBM's OS/360, SVS, and MVS operating systems. and * MILTEN is terminal control software used by both ORVYL and WYLBUR for start/stop terminals. WYLBUR is not a full standalone operating system in the mold of Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) or Unix. Instead it runs on top of an IBM batch operating system (OS/360, SVS, MVS). It takes the form of an editor with a Remote Job Entry system and thus has much the same relationship to the IBM operating systems as Emacs does to Unix. For these reasons WYLBUR is often thought of as a text editor rather than a time-sharing system. However, whereas Unix does not need Emacs to provide text editing services, IBM's operating systems originally needed WYLBUR. Later innovations such as IBM's Time Sharing Option (TSO) made WYLBUR less relevant for IBM users and gradually replaced it. This article will use the full upper case spelling for commands and keywords. All references to characters and string assume an EBCDIC code page.  Use  ORVYL and WYLBUR were used at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), and many other sites. Retired from most sites in the late 1990s owing to concerns about Y2K issues, they remained in use at NIH until December 2009.\\"WYLBUR Will Be Retiring\\" , Titan News, Center for Information Technology, National Institutes of Health (NIH), April 7, 2009 ORVYL and WYLBUR are still available as open source from Stanford. Available for free as Open Source from Stanford University under a license modeled after the \\"Mozilla 1.1 License\\" certified by the \\"Open Source Initiative (OSI)\\" There are also proprietary versions such as SuperWYlbur. ORVYL and WYLBUR were much admired as shown by this excerpt from a 2004 article titled \\"Computing at CERN: the mainframe era\\": :[In 1976 the IBM S/370-168] also brought with it the MVS (Multiple Virtual Storage) operating system, with its pedantic Job Control Language, and it provided the opportunity for CERN to introduce WYLBUR, the well-loved, cleverly designed and friendly time-sharing system developed at SLAC, together with its beautifully handwritten and illustrated manual by John Ehrman. WYLBUR was a masterpiece of design, achieving miracles with little power (at the time) shared amongst many simultaneous users. It won friends with its accommodating character and began the exit of punch-card machinery as computer terminals were introduced across the lab.\\"Computing at CERN: the mainframe era\\", Chris Jones, CERN Courier, September 6, 2004  Advantages and disadvantages  ORVYL and WYLBUR first became available in 1967‚Äì68, before TSS/360, TSO, or any other official time-sharing solution from IBM. This was roughly the same time that third-party time-sharing systems such as MTS became available and the under the radar development effort of CP-67 at IBM's own Cambridge Scientific Center took place. WYLBUR had the additional advantage that it could be used in conjunction with IBM's mainstream operating system, OS/360. WYLBUR is a single-address-space system, unlike TSO. This conserved memory in the days when memory was precious. So even when TSO was available, organizations seeking to minimize memory use would often keep some or even a majority of their users on WYLBUR rather than letting them use the TSO interactive environment. WYLBUR provides compressed Partitioned Data Sets (PDSs, aka libraries) to save disk space. In MVS source code is typically stored as a sequence of card images (80 character lines). If a line contained only one or just a few characters, 80 characters were still used to store that line. Even when data, e.g., source code, are stored as variable blocked (VB), space could be wasted on strings of embedded blanks. WYLBUR implements stream- oriented storage of text in PDSs, (and sequential data sets) so that a one character line might only take 16 characters (line length, offset, chunk length, character) rather than 80 to store. WYLBUR, or an external program run via JCL was used to convert files to and from the WYLBUR EDIT format. Although TSO allows a user to do more than a locked-down WYLBUR system did, it is possible to write WYLBUR Exec scripts that execute batch jobs to perform functions that ordinarily would have required a TSO account, filling a batch job skeleton out with parameters, submitting the batch job, retrieving the output and displaying it on the screen. WYLBUR has some security advantages over TSO, and some disadvantages. Advantages include: * Being able to write rules to restrict user access to datasets other than those owned by them and stored under their prefix. This is analogous to a user's home directory on UNIX, and looks something like WYL.AV99.HCO, where AV99 is roughly analogous to the \\"group\\" and HCO the \\"user\\" within the group. * Being fairer about resource use. WYLBUR doesn't implement commands such as TSO's alloc which can intentionally or unintentionally prevent others' access to data files for an extended period of time or use tremendous amounts of memory or CPU time. In this way, it minimizes the impact of any single user on all other users. * Commands to set certain status parameters or \\"spy\\" on the commands being executed by other users were restricted to administrative users and could not be executed by regular users. Disadvantages related to security included: * WYLBUR is a single-address-space system. That means that if a user can figure out how to access raw bytes in the address space, they can potentially access information they do not own. For example, there once existed a program written by two college students in the WYLBUR Exec scripting language which could dig the password of the most recently logged on user out of WYLBUR's memory. * Because the WYLBUR process runs under the system account assigned to WYLBUR, one is completely dependent on its enforcement of dataset access protections according to the rules set up in WYLBUR. Enforcement of the access rules could be completely disabled by an administrative user, for system maintenance purposes, who might not remember to re-enable them. * WYLBUR implements disk quotas, with an interesting twist: any system user could give away all or part of their quota to other users. This functionality could be combined with typical course-related student accounts that went away at the end of every semester, and computer-savvy student staff who had non-expiring accounts with low disk quotas, in a manner not always anticipated by university staff. * In systems running the ACF2 security package, a user with accounts in both TSO and WYLBUR that are tied to the same account name could reset the contents of their WYLBUR account's security record interactively from within TSO. This could be used to turn a regular WYLBUR user into an administrative WYLBUR user, increase its disk quota, etc. * At least through the 1960s, the WYLBUR security rules were not enforced for batch jobs running on the same system. So, utilities such as IEHLIST and IEBGENER could be used to discover, read, and modify files belonging to other WYLBUR users unless you password protected those files, which was operationally awkward.  Data Management  Wylbur had a special edit format for Wylbur data sets, which are compressed and have a line number and revision flag for each line. In addition Wylbur supports standard FB and VB datasets. A Wylbur user normally specifies a default volume, which may be the special word CATLG. requesting a search of the catalogue for an existing dataset and requesting that a new dataset be cataloged. Wylbur has the ability to convert line numbers between edit and IBM data sets, either as scaled integers or with an explicit decimal point.  Editing  Wylbur provides a line editor that works with temporary data sets, similar to buffers in other editors. At any point in time one of the temporary data sets is designated as default. Wylbur maintains a current line pointer for each temporary data set. The user may specify an explicit working data set on a command; if he omits it, then the default temporary data set is used as the working data set. The unit of operation is a set of lines (associative range) and individual lines are identified with a line number in the range 0.0 to 99999.999; leading zeros in the integer part and trailing zeros in the fractional part may be omitted. The user can specify a line number in any of the following ways # Absolute line number: ddddd.ddd # FIRST: first line in the working data set # CURRENT: the current line for the working data set # LAST: last line in the working data set # END: a target for copies, following the last line in the working data set # relative: line+ordinal or line -ordinal. # macro variable containing a line Wylbur libraries have a nonstandard format, however it allows the user to export to native OS files with integer sequence numbers and to import native OS files with integer sequence and rescale the line number by a factor of 1000. A range can be specified as a combination of # An explicit range, e.g., # A pattern, e.g., # A pattern with a column range, e.g., # An ordinal, e.g., # An ordinal relative to a match, e.g., # A sequence of lines following a match, e.g., # A Boolean operation, e.g., # A specification in parentheses prefixed by SET, e.g., A pattern is similar to a regular expression, but the syntax is closer to that of SNOBOL than to that of Unix or Perl, there is no backtracking and only the NIH Wylbur has capture of subpatterns. A pattern may be: *'string' * \\"string\\" * pattern pattern * (pattern) * patern*digits * pattern*digits/digits * ABOVE 'string' * pattern AND pattern * ANY * BACKSPACE * BELOW 'string' * BLANK * BLANKS * BOL * BOS * BULLET * DASH * DIGIT * DIGITS * ECB Equal, comma, blank * ECBS Equals, commas, blanks * EMPTY * EOL * EOS * HEX [#]hexdigits * LBRACKET * LETTER * LOWER * NOT pattern * pattern OR pattern * PARAGRAPH * PUNCTUATION * RBRACKET * SECTION * SPACE * SPACES * SOME 'string' * pattern THRU pattern * UNPRINTABLE * UPLOW 'string' * UPPER Sample commands CHANGE 73/80 TO X10+10 IN EVERY 3RD LINE OF 'ABC' 1/3 in 1.5-2/3.7+2 COPY 'BAL' 10/15 TO EMD CHANGE 73/80 TO IN EVERY 3RD LINE START 2 OF 'BAL' 10/15 CHANGE '(' DIGITS*3 ')' TO SUBSTRING 2/4 The specification of base+increment means that the replacement text on the first line is base and is incremented on subsequent lines, so that X10+10 replaces the matched text on the first line with X10, on the second line with X20 and on the third line with X30. The specification of SUBSTRING 2/4 means columns 2-4 of the matched string; note that this is less flexible than captures.  Enhanced versions  Various organizations developed enhanced versions of Wylbur. These included * National Institutes of Health * Online Business Systems which was acquired by ACS (Affiliated Computer Services Inc). * Optimum Systems Inc., sold to Electronic Data Systems and later spun off as SuperWylbur¬Æ Systems, Inc. * RAND Corporation  SuperWylbur‚Ñ¢  SuperWylbur has several enhancements over the original Wylbur. The most important are #Supporting 3270, 3767 and NTO terminals via VTAM; as with other proprietary Wylbur versions, SuperWylbur does not use MILTEN for VTAM terminals. #An enhanced macro facility. #Supporting user-written full- screen panels  SuperWylbur macro Facility  The macro processor adds commands, constants, functions and expressions to Wylbur. Even when the command syntax does not include parameters defined to be expressions, the user can use the forms %(expression) and %%(expression) to force evaluation. If the expression is a function with no argument or a variable then the parentheses may be omitted, e.g., %.TIME instead of %(.TIME). A doubled % requests that the valued be quoted.  SuperWylbur constants  SuperWylbur has two types of constants: * Numeric constants ** [sign]digits[E[sign]exponent] ** #hexdigits * string constants ** 'characters' ** \\"characters\\"  SuperWylbur operators  SuperWylbur operators whose names contain only special characters need not be separated by spaces. Operators whose names contain a period and letters must be separated by spaces. SuperWylbur has the following types of operators: = SuperWylbur arithmetic operators = * + Plus * - Minus  Times * / Divide * // Integer divide * .DIV synonym for // * .MOD Modulus * Exponential = SuperWylbur relational operators = * < (.LT) Less than * <= (.LE) Less than or equal * = (.EQ) Equals * >= (.GE) Greater or equal * > (GT) Greater * ¬¨< (.NLT) Not less than * ¬¨<= (.NLE) Not less than or equal * ¬¨= (.NEQ) Not equal * ¬¨>= (.NGE) Not greater than or equal * ¬¨> (.NGT) Not greater than = SuperWylbur logical operators = * & (.AND) And * (.OR) Or * ¬¨ (.NOT) Not  SuperWylbur macro functions  The name of a macro function begins with a period. If there are arguments, a colon separates them from the name. A semicolon separates successive arguments.

Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) in 1953. The scheme proposed the introduction of two shifts or sessions in elementary schools. In one session regular teaching would be done and during the second session, the students would be sent home to learn the occupations of their parents. It became controversial and was accused of being a casteist scheme to perpetuate the caste hierarchy as Hindu Professions were caste based. Public opposition and internal dissent within the congress led to the deferment of the scheme. The discontent it triggered among the Congress legislature members forced the resignation of Rajaji as Chief Minister. The scheme was dropped completely by Rajaji's successor Kamaraj in 1954. Background According to the 1951 Census of India, the literacy rate in the Madras State was 20.86%.Yazali, P.172 During fiscal year 1950‚Äì51, the Madras State Government spent 6.87 crore Rupees (6,870,000) ‚Äì about 11.5% of total revenues for the state ‚Äì for Elementary education. The enrollment rate for children of school-going age was around 47.8%.Appendix Q : Modified Scheme of Elementary Education, Madras The Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution require the Indian state to provide education to all citizens. In accordance to this directive, in 1950 the Madras State's Directorate of Public Instruction prepared a ten-year plan to provide education to all children of school-going age. This plan called for an allocation of one crore Rs (1,00,00,000) per year for enrolling 500,000 additional students for the next ten years. Against this, the actual allocation in 1950‚Äì51 was only Rs. 500,000. The cost of educating a student was estimated to be around Rs.22.80 per year, out of which the government's contribution was Rs.16.30. Out of the 12,22,775 students who had enrolled in standard I in 1946‚Äì47, only 4,61,686 (37%) had reached the Standard V in 1950‚Äì51. It was against this background, the Congress party with Rajaji as chief minister took power on 10 April 1952. The opposition to the scheme was largely based on social background. Hindu professions are based on Varna or Caste with the Brahmins the highest in the order and studied while Kshatriya and Vaishya traders received some education. Shudra were denied education. Dalits were considered untouchables and did manual work and also denied education. When the Justice Party came to power in 1920, Brahmins disproportionately occupied over 70% of the high level posts in government, judiciary and in education. The Justice Party introduced caste based reservation and this gradually reversed this trend and allowed non-Brahmins to rise in the government and education in Madras Presidency. The first generation of Dalits, Scheduled Castes and Tribes and Backward Classes also started getting educated and their children had just begun to attend school after centuries of denial of educational opportunities under the rigid Hindu caste system. As per this policy schools were to work in the morning and students had to compulsorily learn the family vocation in the afternoon. This was seen as a ploy to ensure the domination and monopoly of Brahmins. The ulterior motive behind the scheme was understood to be that the children of non-Brahmins should undertake only the manual jobs of their ancestors such as washerman, barber, scavenger, cobbler etc. and they should not aspire for any higher education or for any white collar employment, which only Brahmins could claim as their exclusive privilege. They should follow their parents' professions and remain in their low status and lowly paid professions. Such a step would maintain caste hegemony. Earlier attempts at change In 1939, during Rajaji's first term as Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency, the girl students of standards III to V and those belonging to Scheduled Castes had been allowed to attend school for only three hours a day and spend the rest of the day helping their parents. In the academic year 1949‚Äì50, during the Chief ministership of P. S. Kumaraswamy Raja, an experimental shift system had been introduced in ten taluks and later expanded to other areas as an optional measure. Schools which adapted this system functioned in two shifts or sessions. Teachers who worked during both sessions were paid an additional allowance of 10 Rupees per month. However this system was not widely adopted and by 1951 only 155 elementary schools (out of a total 38,687) in the state were functioning in shifts. Reasons stated for the reform attempt * The cost of educating all children in the 6‚Äì12 age group would be enormous. Besides enrollment, more than half of the elementary schools lacked proper infrastructure. The reform attempted to increase the number of school-going children within the financial limitations faced by the Government.Appendix T : Modified Scheme of Elementary Education, Madras * There was an acute shortage of teachers. The state had an average of less than three teachers for five standards per school. There were 4,108 single-teacher schools and more than 60% of the schools with five standards had less than four teachers. * This poor student-teacher ratio was putting a strain on the teachers and led to students being made to stay in school for longer hours. This directly contributed to the high drop out ratio. This plural teaching had to be stopped without hiring new teachers. * Rajaji favoured Gandhi's Basic Education Scheme over the existing elementary education system. He stated that he wanted to reduce the unemployment amongst educated people.Bakshi, P.323 The Basic education system called for learning through living and training in self- reliance. * The retention rate of 37% (between 1947 and 1951) had to be improved by making schools attractive to students of poorer sections. Proposals in the new scheme The Modified Scheme of Elementary education proposed the following changes in the school system: * Reduction of School hours from five hours per day to three. * Introduction of shifts -the students were to be divided into two batches and the school would function in two sessions. Each session will be of three hours duration, consisting of four periods of 40 minutes each, with not less than two intervals totaling 20 minutes. The sessions will be arranged to suit local conditions. One batch will attend only one session a day. There were to be six working days per week. * No dilution of the previous syllabus and no reduction in duration for subjects like Language, Elementary Mathematics, Nature Study, Drawing, History, Geography, Hygiene, Civics, Moral Instruction and Singing. * The second session in which the students would be out of school was to be utilised for obtaining the objectives of the basic education system ‚Äì learning through living and training in self-reliance. * During the out of school session, the girl students were to learn house keeping from their mothers in their home environment. The boys were supposed to learn farming or other crafts from their respective fathers. * Boys whose parents did not belong to occupational groups, were to be sent to work in farms or with other craftsmen in their villages. * In addition to the learning the students were to be utilised in service to the village like building sheds,laying bricks, attending to village sanitation, improving roads, etc.. * The out of school session would have no strict attendance or work requirements. Implementation The Rajaji Government introduced the new elementary education scheme in all schools in the non-municipal (rural) areas for the academic year 1953‚Äì54 (from 18 June 1953). It was planned that eventually the scheme would be extended to 35,000 of the total 38,687 schools in the state. However, due to public opposition, it was put on hold on 29 July 1953 and dropped altogether on 18 May 1954.Chapter XIV, A Review of Madras Legislative Assembly (1952‚Äì57) Opposition From the beginning, the scheme attracted heavy opposition from the Dravidian movement led by Periyar E. V. Ramasamy. The Dravidar Kazhagam organised a conference in Erode protesting the scheme's introduction. The teachers' unions also opposed their move as they were not consulted before implementation. They also resented the increase in working hours without any increase in pay. The DMK seized the opportunity and started a campaign against the scheme. They dubbed the scheme as the Kula kalvi thittam (Hereditary/Caste Education Scheme) and as the Acharyar Education Scheme.Ryerson, P.89 The Dravidian movement viewed the scheme as an attempt to preserve and perpetuate caste based discrimination through official means. They used Rajaji's notions about caste and village craftsmen to depict the scheme as a \\"Brahminist conspiracy\\". Rajaji had earlier expressed his opinion about castes and crafts as: After the scheme was announced, Rajaji gave a speech to the washermen at the Adyar riverbank. In it he referred to Kuladharma, the social obligation of each clan or caste. The opposition used such incidents to lend credence to their \\"casteist motive\\" accusation.Gandhi. p.248 Rajaji and his education minister MV Krishna Rao responded with a counter campaign in the scheme's defense. They gave speeches and made broadcasts in the All India Radio explaining their position.Indian Review Vol.54, P.332 The month of June 1953 saw aggressive propaganda efforts by both the proponents and opponents of the scheme. On 13 July 1953, the DMK executive committee met and decided to conduct a marial (blockade) agitation outside the Chief Minister's residence. EVK Sampath was nominated to lead the agitation.Anna's Birth Centennial Anthology This agitation was part of a three pronged attack on the Government's policies by the DMK. On 14 July 1953, a possession led by Satyavani Muthu was organised to protest the scheme. Its destination was Rajaji's official residence at Bazullah road, T. Nagar. It was stopped by the police as it was unlicensed. The next day (15 July 1953) the confrontation heated up with the Government introducing a motion in the Legislative Assembly for implementing the scheme from the academic year 1953‚Äì54. On the same day another DMK procession was stopped before it could reach T Nagar. In the next fifteen days as many as twenty such processions were attempted by the DMK. Deferment By the end of July, public opinion started to turn against the scheme and at least four public petitions were tabled in the Legislative Assembly about the scheme.Table XVII, A Review of Madras Legislative Assembly (1952‚Äì57) On 29 July 1953, M.V Krishna Rao, the minister for education moved a motion for considering the new scheme. After a discussion, Communist leader K. P Gopalan moved a motion to drop the scheme. The house was deadlocked with 138 ayes to 138 noes on dropping the scheme. The speaker of the assembly J. Shivashanmugam Pillai used his casting vote to defeat the motion. A second motion to defer the scheme and refer it to a committee of experts was moved by K.R Viswanatham. This motion passed with 138 ayes against 137 noes.Table XVI, A Review of Madras Legislative Assembly (1952‚Äì57) The Scheme was stayedThe word \\"stay\\" in the motion was interpreted by Rajaji and C. Subramaniam as \\"keep the status quo\\" as on the day of the vote. In other words, the scheme would be kept in place in the schools where it was already introduced and it won't be extended to other schools. They disregarded the oppositions demands to cancel the scheme in all the schools. Gandhi. p. 247 and the Parulekar Committee was commissioned to review the scheme. Parulekar committee On 20 August 1953, the Government passed an order (Education G.O # 1888) to constitute a committee of experts for reviewing the scheme.Report, Director of Information and Publicity The committee was composed of Prof. RV. Parulekar, Director of Indian Institute of Education Bombay, as the Chairman; Dr.B.B. Dey, Retired Director of Public Instruction, Madras; Prof. Mohammad Mujeeb, Vice-Chancellor of the Jamia Millia University as members and S. Govindarajulu Naidu, the former Director of Public Instruction, Madras, and the then Director of Public Instruction, Andhra Pradesh, as the Member Secretary. The Parulekar committee submitted its report on 23 November 1953. It found the scheme to be sound and endorsed the Government's position. It made additional recommendations including extending the scheme to rural areas, opening as many as 4000 new schools, revising the existing curriculum, providing training and remuneration to the craftsmen involved. Cancellation The opposition campaign was successful in creating doubts about the scheme in the minds of the general public. There was dissent within the Congress party and Kamaraj wanted Rajaji to withdraw the scheme as it was unpopular amongst the public and with the party members.Subramaniam, p.205 On 20 October 1953, forty Congress Legislative Assembly members led by P. Varadarajulu Naidu, sent a memorandum to Nehru objecting to Rajaji's unilateral conduct. Among the issues they raised was his refusal to budge on the education scheme issue.Nehru Vol24, p.288 But Rajaji refused to drop the scheme. On 8 November 1953, Congress lost the by election for the Kangayam constituency by a narrow margin.Gazette of India, p.88 Pressure mounted from within the party to drop the scheme. On 9 March 1954, Congress leader and former Chief Minister O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiyar made an open appeal to Rajaji in the legislature: But Rajaji did not relent and his education minister C Subramaniam upped the ante by announcing that the scheme would be extended to urban areas in June 1954. This spurred the Congress legislators into open revolt. They scheduled a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party on 21 March. Faced with certain defeat in the leadership election that was bound to happen in that meeting, Rajaji tried a last minute compromise ‚Äì he would quit if C. Subramaniam was chosen as his successor and the scheme was kept. But Kamaraj, the leader of the anti-Rajaji camp, refused to accept the deal. The meeting was postponed by a week and when it happened on 31 March, C. Subramaniam was defeated by Kamaraj.Kandaswamy, p51-52 Rajaji resigned and Kamaraj took over as chief minister on 13 April 1954. This effectively ended the prospects of the new education scheme. On 18 May 1954, C Subramaniam announced in the assembly that the scheme was being dropped. The reason stated for the dropping was that the necessary acceptance, support and cooperation of the people were not forthcoming for the scheme and the atmosphere was not propitious for the success of the scheme.The Hindu report on 19 May 1954 : Scheme dropped Meanwhile, the composite Madras State had been reorganised along linguistic lines. The state of Andhra had split from Madras on 1 October 1953. The Andhra Government constituted an Elementary Education Committee with Dr. B. Kuppuswamy as chairman to review the elementary education situation. The Kuppuswamy committee report recommended the rejection of the Modified Elementary Education Scheme. In 1954 the Andhra state cancelled the scheme.Indian Review Vol.55, p.284 Criticism The main arguments made against the Modified Scheme of Elementary Education were : *That the scheme was casteist by design. It aimed to preserve and perpetuate the caste hierarchy by ensuring that children took up their parents' profession. It was designed to help Brahmins corner positions of authority .Vasantha Kandaswamy p.262-6 *That it intended to reduce the schooling imparted to children by not monitoring them during out of school sessions.Bakshi, p.325 *That it would increase the workload of teachers as it would increase their working hours and force them to handle more children without the appointment of new teachers and without an increase in their pay.Balratnam, P.91 *That it was undemocratic and dictatorial as Rajaji had not consulted his cabinet or the assembly in his decision to implement the scheme (In Rajaji's own words ‚Äì This is an executive matter, no law is involved and Did Shankara and Ramanuja announce their philosophy after consulting others?).Kannan p.203 *That it was deliberately targeted at rural children alone to keep them from getting an education.Vashisht, p.52 Writing in Viduthalai on 17 November 1953, Periyar denounced the scheme as a Brahiminical conspiracy: In another Viduthalai article written on 26 February 1954, he vowed to destroy the scheme by any means: He kept up his harangue even after Rajaji resigned and C Subramaniam became the new Education minister. On 17 April 1954 he wrote: The Andhra Elementary Education Committee Report also rejected the Modified Scheme and recommended an approach similar to the one eventually adopted by the Kamaraj Government. Defense and endorsements During and after his tenure as Chief Minister, Rajaji defended his scheme vigorously. He derided the critics as people who did not want to do physical labour: About the casteist angle of the criticism, he reasoned that it was because of him being the author of the scheme: After the Kamaraj Government scrapped the scheme, he again defended it as : Replying to Papanasam MLA Swayam Prakasam's concerns over the scheme, then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru offered his endorsement to the scheme: India's President Rajendra Prasad offered his support in a letter written to the Governor of Madras ‚Äì Sri Prakasa ‚Äì on 9 June 1953: The Central Advisory Board of Education, passed a resolution endorsing the scheme during its 21st Meeting held in February 1954: Legacy The Modified Scheme of Elementary Education even after being dropped had the unintended consequence of bringing primary education to hundreds of thousands of school children in Tamil Nadu. Rajaji's successor Kamaraj was ever mindful of the fact that it was the issue of primary education that caused his predecessor's downfall. Knowing the public opposition to Rajaji's scheme he took the diametrically opposite approach in providing education to Tamil Nadu's children ‚Äì imparting free and compulsory education till the age of 14. He set up a commissionKandaswamy, P. 65 under R.M. Alagappa Chettiar to examine the means for providing compulsory primary education. Instead of sending children away from the school, the committee recommended active Government intervention to bring more children into the schooling system by building new schools and abolishing school fees. This approach was successful and by the end of Kamaraj's tenure as Chief Minister in 1963, enrollment in primary schools had been doubled.

The transformation of concrete into decorative concrete is achieved through the use of a variety of materials that may be applied during the pouring process or after the concrete is cured, these materials and/or systems include but are not limited to stamped concrete, acid staining, decorative overlays, polished concrete, concrete countertops, vertical overlays and more.  Concrete statues  Concrete statues are made by pouring concrete into a latex mold. Often painted and sold for lawn decorations. Most popular designs are bird baths and gnomes.  Stamped concrete Board-marked concrete showing the grain of the timber Stamped Concrete is the process of adding texture and color to concrete to make it resemble stone, brick, slate, cobblestone and many other products found in nature including wood, fossils, shells and many more. This limitless array of possibilities combined with great durability and lower cost than natural products makes Stamped Concrete an easy choice for new construction and renovation projects. The installation consists of pressing molds into the concrete while the concrete is still in its plastic state. Color is achieved by using dry shakes, color hardeners, powder or liquid releases, integral colors, or acid stains. All these products may be combined to create even more intricate designs. Stamped concrete may be used on driveways, patios, commercial roads and parking lots and even interior floors. Stamped concrete is a desirable finish to concrete areas, however with time and wear the color dyes fade and the surface looks patchy and unpresentable. There are many re- coloring options which can completely restore and rejuvenate the color and presentation of faded stamped concrete.  Concrete dyes  Concrete dyes take many different forms and compositions and can be used on both residential and commercial concrete applications, including sound/retaining walls, bridges, countertops, floors, etc. Early concrete dyes consisted of generic printing inks that were dissolved in mild solutions of alcohol and applied to concrete surfaces to add a wide array of color to plain gray concrete. When alcohol- based dyes are exposed to sunlight, the color either lightens or fades out completely. Therefore, alcohol-based dyes were more prevalent in interior applications where direct sunlight or other forms of ultraviolet (UV) lighting was not present. Manufacturers later began dissolving the same printing inks in different carriers, such as acetone, lacquer thinner and other solvents, hoping to achieve increased penetration levels. In addition, UV inhibiting agents were added to new dyes to help with the UV instability issues. However, slight fading (5-8% per year) still occurs when the dye is exposed to direct sunlight. Colored concrete can be obtained from many ready mix concrete companies and many have color charts available.  Acid staining  Acid staining is not a dyeing or pigment-base coloring systems, but a chemical reaction. A mixture of water, mineral salts and a slight amount of muriatic acid is applied to the concrete surface. This chemical reaction with the existing minerals (primarily lime) in the concrete over a period of one to four hours creates new earth tone colors on the concrete surface. The concrete surface is later scrubbed to remove excess stain and neutralized by a basic solution of ammonia and water or baking soda (less likely to cause whiting later) to help raise the ph level back to normal level. Due to inconsistencies in the surface level of concrete floor, acid staining creates a variegated or mottled appearance that is unique to each slab. The color penetration ranges from 1/16 to 1/32 of an inch. Older exterior concrete surfaces may not color as well as interior surfaces because the environment has leached or percolated out the mineral content. As well, any exposed aggregate (rocks) in worn concrete will not accept staining. Chemicals commonly used in acid staining include hydrochloric acid, iron chloride, and sodium bicarbonate.  Water based staining  Water based stains are similar to acid based stains in the sense that one can still achieve a translucent look like acid; some stains are able to achieve an opaque color and/or a translucent effect. The main difference is that acid stains react to the concrete and change the physical make up of the concrete material, whereas water based stains are more of a \\"coating\\" that bonds with the concrete. There are many variations of water based stains that have come into the decorative concrete industry that perform in a number of different ways. Some are polymer based, acrylic and epoxy.  Overlaying  Concrete overlays date to the 1960s when chemical engineers from some of the larger, well known chemical companies began to experiment with acrylic paint resins as modifiers for cement and sand mixes. The result was a thin cementitious topping material that would adhere to concrete surfaces and provide a newly resurfaced coating to restore the worn surface. Concrete overlays lacked the long-term performance characteristics of acrylic resins. Acrylic resins provided good UV resistance, but lacked long term water resistance and adhesion characteristics needed to provide a long term and permanent solution.  Polymer cement overlays  Construction of a polymer cement overlay to change asphalt pavement to brick texture and color to create decorative crosswalk and traffic calming in high-pedestrian area. Polymer cement overlays, consisting of a proprietary blend of Portland cements, various aggregates and polymer resins, were introduced over 20 years ago. The purpose of adding a polymer resin to the cement and aggregate is to greatly increase the performance characteristics and versatility of conventional cements, mortars and concrete materials. Unlike conventional cement and concrete mixes, polymer cement overlays can be applied thinly or thickly without fear of delamination or typical product failure. In addition, polymer cement overlays are much more resistant to damage from salt, petrochemicals, UV, harsh weather conditions and traffic wearing. Originally intended for use as a thin surface restoration material for concrete substrates, polymer cement overlays were introduced into the architectural concrete and commercial flooring industries in the early 80s. Subsequently, its use in these industries has become standard. Polymer cement overlays are regarded as economical in providing long term, durable renovation without the need for costly and continuous repairs associated with deteriorating concrete surfaces. Polymer cement overlays are used for interior and exterior applications ranging from: *Skim coat/broom finish concrete resurfacing - Restore and protect damaged, pitted, flaking and stained concrete back to the look of a new concrete surface. *Concrete regrading & leveling - Repair and level concrete surfaces that have settled. *Existing substrate redecorating and renovating - Alter the appearance of existing concrete or wood substrates through applying \\"thin stamped\\" or \\"thin stained\\" overlays, creating new textures, colors and designs. For use on commercial or resident pool deck, this frequently takes the form of \\"splatter textures\\" or \\"knockdowns,\\" in which polymer cement is applied to the existing concrete substrate in a moderately textured finish (average of 1/8‚Äù thickness) in various patterns. Often, the texture is knocked down with a trowel to slightly modify the appearance and feel of the finished application.  Stamped overlays  Rubber imprinting tools (stamps) are impressed into thin pre-mixed concrete overlay material shortly after it is placed to create natural stone or brick textures. These rubber imprinting tools are manufactured from molds created from authentic stone or wood. Release agents are used to help release the stamps from the concrete without sticking. Release agents come in either a liquid or powder form and are available in a wide range of colors.  Epoxy coating  Applied over acid stained, dyes and/or overlays to seal and protect. Some epoxies are also colored.  Polishing  Concrete can be polished with Mechanical grinders and diamond pads of increasing grit sizes. Diamond pads come in many grit or mesh sizes. Common sizes start with 6 grit and can go up to 8500 grit although concrete can only maintain a shine of about 800 grit, it can be helped by adding a concrete hardener such as sodium silicate or lithium silicate which will allow concrete to hold an 1800 through 3000 grit shine. The work is accomplished in multiple stages by passing over the concrete with successive grit diamond pads until it has a hard-glassy finish. Both acid stains and concrete dyes can be used during the polishing process.  Engraving  Existing concrete can be remodeled by cutting lines and grooves into its surface. Intricate designs such as logos or text can be engraved using a portable CNC concrete engraving system. Concrete can also be remodeled by a CNC driven router system. Geometric patterns, straight or curved lines and custom designs can be cut directly into the surface of the concrete creating the look of tile, flagstone, cobblestone and many other common surface patterns. This is usually achieved using tools like an angle grinder fitted with diamond blades, but is more effectively accomplished using specialty tools designed specifically for cutting designs into the concrete.  Form liner  Concrete can also be cast into unique and detailed designs using urethane form liner. These projects can be seen around the United States and the world, usually on sound/retaining walls, building exteriors, and bridges. Generally, this process starts with the sculptor, who creates the design to be used in the concrete using clay, polyurethane or wax. When the original art is complete, a cast is made using synthetic liquid rubber, and from this cast, form liners are produced in the reverse image of the original. The form liner then acts as a mold for the concrete to be formed against. Once the concrete is set, the form liner is stripped from the hardened concrete surface. The concrete is permanently textured with the pattern of the form liner.  Industry publications  Concrete Decor, the world's foremost magazine on decorative concrete has been a instrumental source of information, ideas, product news and training relevant to both commercial and residential work in decorative concrete and related specialties. The majority of its readers are contractors and the publication enjoys a high pass-along readership. Now in its 20th year of publication, Concrete Decor reaches more than 40,000 professionals working in or designing for decorative concrete. It has become the most-read and most influential magazine covering decorative concrete in the world.

While several actresses have played Susan, the role is most identified with Marie Masters, who played Susan for most of the character's run. Masters stepped into the role in September 1968. Susan was at the center of several stories until the character (and Masters) left the canvas in 1979. Susan returned to town in 1986. Susan was known for her dysfunctional personality and scheming nature. A reformed alcoholic and respected physician, she played a supporting role in later years offering advice to her two daughters, Alison and Emily, who inherited their mother's penchant for controversy and trouble. 1960s-1970s Susan/Dan/Paul/Liz Susan first came to Oakdale in 1966 as the wife of Dr. Dan Stewart. They had married while they were both attending medical school and not long after they graduated, Susan intentionally caused a miscarriage. As they tried to move past the tragedy, Dan became acquainted with Elizabeth Talbot. Liz was more laid back than Susan, who cared deeply about her own career. Susan noticed her husband's new friendship and quickly set about trying to make a couple out of Liz and Dan's brother, Paul. Susan's relentlessness drove Dan closer to Liz, however, and Susan didn't know what to do. Ultimately, Dan asked for a divorce, but she didn't want to give him up. At the advice of his mother, Ellen, Susan took advantage of him one night and became pregnant. Dan was upset to learn about the pregnancy, but he became even more saddened when Liz married Paul. Dan was more than upset with Susan and, in the heat of an argument, pushed her down a staircase, causing her to lose her baby. As Susan recovered, she tried to keep Dan interested in her. She tried to make him jealous by seeing Dr. John Dixon, one of his colleagues, but nothing worked for her. Susan then turned to force tactics in keeping her marriage together when she learned that Dan and Liz had had an affair and that Liz was pregnant. She threatened to expose the truth to Paul unless Dan stayed with her. Dan succumbed to her power over him and she became expectant again. This time, a daughter was born, named Emily. Dan was finally rid of Susan when she became interested in Dr. Bruce Baxter. Bruce did not want children, so Susan divorced Dan and gave him full custody of Emily. Dan married Liz (Paul had died) and they lived together with their daughter Betsy (who believed that Paul was her father) and now Emily too. Susan knew that Bruce didn't want children, but she figured that after a while, she could make him change his mind. She realized his mind was made up, however, when he told her about his vasectomy. Susan had the marriage annulled. She found her heart wandering back to Dan and, while visiting with Emily at the Stewart home one day, she and Liz got into an argument. Liz saw baby Emily at the top of the stairs and in a rush to save her, she ran up the stairs, falling, and rupturing her spleen. Liz was taken to the hospital where she died. Drinking problem A devastated Dan left the country with Emily. Susan became an alcoholic, constantly wallowing in her own grief. She spent most of her time with her beer-buddy Kevin Thompson, to whom she was attracted. Dan and Emily came back to town, but now Susan was too drunk to raise her own daughter. Dan became involved with Kim Dixon, who was divorced from John. Susan, ever competitive and ambitious, wanted to work things out with Dan again. Kim had had amnesia for a time and, because of John, who was just as clingy as Susan, she did not know of the love she and Dan had shared. Once her memory returned, she called Dan to let him know that she remembered, but Susan hid the answering machine tape that the message was on. When Dan, still believing that Kim forgot him, started to see Valerie Conway, Susan confessed the truth about what she did to Kevin. Kevin was good friends with Valerie and urged Susan to tell the truth. She did, and Dan and Kim were married. Her drinking became much worse. When she was fired from Memorial Hospital, she appeared before the hospital board in a drunken stupor, accusing the administrator of having personal problems with her. She arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct and Kevin let her stay in jail for the night. When she was set free, Susan was upset, but Kevin soon helped her realize that she had become an alcoholic. Susan decided to change the things in her life, and unfortunately for Kevin, that meant ending their relationship. With Kevin soon killed in an accident and Dan dead from a terminal illness, Susan left town sober, with daughter Emily in tow. 1980s-2000s Affairs with Bob and John In 1986, Emily came back to Oakdale for a brand new start in an old town. Oakdale soon learned that Emily and James Stenbeck had been lovers. Susan came back to Oakdale looking for Emily, and reconnected with several old acquaintances, including John Dixon. She offered support to John and Kim's son Andy as he struggled with his own alcoholism. Susan suffered a nasty fall and injured her back, and subsequently became addicted to painkillers. Her doctor, Bob Hughes, tried his hardest to help her kick the habit. Bob was preoccupied with Susan's recovery while Kim and John were distracted by Andy's struggles. The newfound friendship led to a one-night stand between Bob and Susan. At the time, however, Bob was married to Kim. The rivalry that the two women had a decade earlier was revived by the affair. Alison's birth  Susan found love again with the much younger Larry McDermott. Susan wanted to give Larry a child, but she couldn't. Emily, now in her early 20s, came to her mother's rescue and offered to donate the egg. Emily donated the egg, Larry donated the sperm, but it was Susan who carried the baby, a girl named Alison, to term. Larry had an affair and left town; Susan decided to keep the circumstances regarding Alison's birth a secret from the little girl and even changed her name from Alison McDermott to Alison Stewart. Needless to say, Alison found out the truth and tormented her mother and sister. The teenaged Alison was a rebel who sought the affections of Aaron Snyder in a way similar to her mother's own quest for Dan Stewart's love. In order to get Aaron's attention, Alison committed arson. She turned herself into the police, but Susan was able to help her get released quickly. Dr. Rick Decker Susan's love life became active again when she met Dr. Rick Decker. Rick was a suspicious man that she met at a medical convention and both Alison and Emily felt uneasy about him. They didn't approve of their mother's new relationship, but that didn't stop Susan from accepting Rick's marriage proposal. At the same time, he was accused of several murders that took place at the hospital. Susan didn't pay any attention to the accusations and proceeded with marrying Rick. The fairy tale ended as Susan started to catch Rick in lies. He admitted to suffering from anxiety attacks and asked Susan to leave town with him so that he could get psychiatric help. Susan agreed to leave with him, but once they were gone, Susan read a newspaper headline that said that Alison had been found murdered. She rushed back to town and was shocked when Rick confessed to being the killer. Alison was not dead, however. The newspaper article was faked as a way to lure them back to Oakdale. Rick also admitted that he was only interested in Susan because of her ability to get him work at Memorial Hospital. Susan was heartbroken and depressed, but she made peace with Alison and Emily as Rick was carted away. Alison soon left town to be with Aaron. Family troubles After the ordeal with Rick finally cooled down, Susan's life as a whole became less eventful. She stood by Emily through some of her more controversial decisions (including attempting to murder Paul Ryan, among other things) and served, essentially, as Emily's enabler. In 2007, however, the reveal of two disturbing secrets about her daughters drove Susan back to the bottle. First, she learned of Alison's infamy as a Las Vegas porn actress (not to mention an addiction to crystal meth), and then found that Emily had been working as a call girl. Susan was devastated, and alcohol proved to be her only friend. She soon realized, however, that going back to that habit would not be setting a proper example for Alison. Together, the two women worked to give up the addictive substances that had worked so hard against them. While things seemed to be getting better for the Stewarts, Susan again found herself in a position between her daughters. Emily found out that Alison had had an affair with Dusty and skipped town, leaving Susan in Oakdale to try to help her daughter pick up the pieces.

Bishop Manning asked for an explanation, but was not satisfied of the propriety of the dances, and vetoed them in January, 1924. The rector continued the services, however, and in March, 1924, St. Mark's was deprived of episcopal ministrations pending the time when the Bishop's counsel should be heeded.

Aiphanes horrida is a solitary, spiny tree. In the wild it grows 3‚Äì10 metres tall (9‚Äì30 feet) tall with a stem diameter of 6‚Äì10 centimetres (2‚Äì4 inches); cultivated trees may be as much as 15 m (49') tall with a 15 cm (6\\") diameter. The epicarp and mesocarp of the fruit are rich in carotene and are eaten in Colombia, while the seeds are used to make candles. In parts of the Colombian Llanos endocarps are used to play games. The range of the species is found in dry forests between sea level and 1700 m (5600') above sea level in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela, but is not native to Ecuador. The species is cultivated as an ornamental throughout the tropics. Many authors, including Henderson et al. (1995) and Borchenius and Bernal (1996) use A. aculeata rather than A. horrida, giving Jacquin's description of Caryota horrida a publication date of 1809, three years after Willdenow's 1806 description. On the other hand, Govaerts et al. (2006) gives Jacquin's work a publication date of 1801, giving A. horrida priority over A. aculeata.

Usually tall, it sometimes grows as an understorey tree and only in height. Description Stem of Aiphanes minima showing spines and leaf scarsDetails of the stem, petioles and leaf bases of Aiphaes horrida showing its spiny nature Aiphanes minima is a single-stemmed, spiny palm with pinnately compound leaves‚Äîrows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern. Stems are usually tall, though occasionally as little as tall and in diameter. Younger stems are covered with rings of black spines, but on older stems these are often lost. Individuals bear 10‚Äì20 leaves which are pinnately compound, bearing 18 to 34 pairs of leaflets along a central rachis that is long. The leaflets are borne in a single plane, and are usually linear in shape, but sometimes widen towards their apex, especially in Puerto Rico. The lower surface of the leaf can be covered with spines up to long or can be unarmed; the upper surface has a row of spines about long along the midrib. The rachis can be unarmed but is often covered with black spines up to long. The petiole, which connects the rachis with the stem, is long and covered with black spines up to long.Borchsenius & Bernal (1996), pp. 71‚Äì75 Taxonomy Aiphanes has been placed in the subfamily Arecoideae, the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Bactridinae, together with Desmoncus, Bactris, Acrocomia and Astrocaryum. In his 1932 revision of the genus, German botanist Max Burret divided Aiphanes into two subgenera, and placed A. minima in the subgenus Macroanthera. In their 1996 monograph, Finn Borchsenius and Rodrigo Bernal concluded that Macroanthera would be a viable taxon only if it were to be reduced to three species‚ÄîA. aculeata, A eggersii and A. minima. However, this would leave the other subgenus, Brachyanthera, as an overly broad and heterogeneous entity, and they decided to abandon Burrets use of subgenera.Borchsenius & Bernal (1996), p. 33 Borchsenius and Bernal placed all Caribbean Aiphanes (except those in Trinidad and Tobago) in a single species, A. minima, but this is not universally accepted. American botanist George Proctor disagreed with this, stating that he believed that there were several species present, and maintained that populations in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic should be maintained in a separate species, A. acanthophylla.George R. Proctor, in Acevedo-Rodr√≠guez & Strong (2005), pp. 138‚Äì139 In Dominica, palm systematist Scott Zona and colleagues documented the presence of two distinct populations of Aiphanes palms on the island‚Äîone which was larger and spinier, and the other that was smaller, more slender, and less spiny. This led them to speculate that this may represent a second species of Aiphanes. History The first botanical description of the species was made by French botanist Charles Plumier. Plumier made three trips to the West Indies between 1689 and 1695, and among his descriptions were two palm species that he named Palma dactylifera, aculeata, fructu corallino, major and Palma dactylifera, aculeata, fructu corallino, minor, using pre-Linnean names. Both of these are now considered to belong to Aiphanes minima. In 1763, Dutch botanist Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin described the same species, using the name Palma Grigri Martinicensibus.Borchsenius & Bernal (1996), p. 2 The oldest description of the species that is considered valid is Joseph Gaertner's description of Bactris minima, which he published in 1791 in De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum. This name, which was based on a single fruit of unknown origins, is the basis for the modern name of the species. The name Aiphanes was coined a decade later by German botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow in 1801. Distribution Aiphanes minima is native to the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Dominica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Martinique, Barbados and Grenada and is widely cultivated elsewhere. It is the northernmost member of the genus, and the only species of Aiphanes that is absent from the mainland of South America.Borchsenius & Bernal (1996), pp. 26‚Äì30 Habitat and ecology In the northern portion of its range, Aiphanes minima grows on limestone hills and is dependent on gaps in the forest canopy to reach maturity. In the southern part it is a tree of the subcanopy or forest understorey, as it does in Turner's Hall Woods in Barbados. The flowers have a sweet scent, and are believed to be pollinated by bees.Borchsenius & Bernal (1996), pp. 30‚Äì32 The fruit, flowers and seeds of Aiphanes minima are consumed by the vulnerable Saint Vincent amazon (Amazona guildingii) and is also considered a potentially important food species for the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata). Uses Aiphanes minima is widely planted as an ornamental.Henderson et al.

It is a blending grape that, along with Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Fer, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot, is used to make the Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wine of C√¥tes du Marmandais. Abouriou can also be made into a varietal, as it is used in some vin de pays wines. The grape is known for its low acidity and high tannin content. Though Abouriou shares several synonyms (alternative names other than the full botanical name) with the Beaujolais grape Gamay, their morphology differs and DNA evidence has shown the two varieties to be distinct. In California, the grape is sometimes called Early Burgundy, another allusion to Gamay. With a tendency to bud and ripen early, the vine produces high yields and vigorous growth with a relatively high resistance to most grape diseases. History Ampelographers believe that Abouriou originated in Southwest France in the Lot-et-Garonne department, probably around the commune of Viller√©al where the grape has long been associated with. The grape was once widely planted throughout the region until the phylloxera epidemic of the mid-19th century devastated the area and sharply reduced Abouriou's numbers. The grape was near extinction until a local farmer discovered abandoned plantings of the vine growing up the wall of a ruined castle outside of Viller√©al. Numa Naug√©, a private grape breeder from Casseneuil in Lot-et-Garonne, cultivated seedlings of Abouriou from those vines and presented them to French viticultural authorities in 1882 for conservation and propagation. Naug√©'s work in saving Abouriou from extinction is honored today with the alternative name Pr√©coce Nauge.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 3-4, Allen Lane 2012 Rob Tebeau \\"Abouriou - Cotes du Marmandais, France\\" Fringe Wine, January 31st, 2013 Relationship to other grapes Through Magdeleine Noire des Charentes, Merlot (pictured) is either a half-sibling or grandchild of Abouriou. Despite the similarities in synonyms to the Beaujolais wine grape Gamay, DNA evidence has confirmed that there is no direct relationship between the two grape varieties. However, testing completed in 2009 did show a potential parent- offspring relationship between Abouriou and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes though it is not yet clear which vine is the parent and which is the offspring. As Magdeleine Noire des Charentes has been confirmed as the mother vine to the notable international varieties Malbec and Merlot this means that Abouriou is either a half-sibling or grandparent to those varieties. In the 1950s, Abouriou was crossed with Merlot to produce Ederena and with Tinta de Madeira at the Unit√© Exp√©rimentale du Domaine de Vassal & Montpellier SupAgro to produce Egiodola. In the 1970s, Abouriou was crossed with the Aveyron wine grape Castets in Slovakia at the VSSVVM Research and Breeding Station for Enology and Viticulture to produce several varieties including Hron, Nitranka, Rimava and V√°h. In California, some plantings of Abouriou (known as Early Burgundy) were discovered by DNA analysis to actually be Blauer Portugieser which has no known relation to Abouriou. Viticulture Abouriou is an early ripening variety that has good resistance to many viticultural hazards include powdery and downy mildew as well as botrytis bunch rot. Wine regions In 2008 there were 338 hectares (835 acres) of Abouriou planted in France. The vast majority were found in the Lot-et-Garonne department (200 hectares/494 acres) of South West France and the Loire-Atlantique department (100 hectares/247 acres) of the Loire Valley. It is a permitted variety in the C√¥tes du Marmandais AOC and is widely grown around the commune of Cocumont located just southwest of Marmande. It is also used as both a blending and varietal component in several vin de pays of the southwest including the 'Vin de Pays de Landes du Lot-et-Garonne that covers most of the Lot-et-Garonne department and the Vin de Pays de L'Agenais that covers the western end of the Lot-et-Garonne around the commune of Agen.Clive Coates An Encyclopedia of the Wines and Domaines of France pgs 499-501 University of California Press; First Printing edition (June 2001) AOC regulations Most of the plantings of Abouriou are found in the Lot-et-Garonne department (highlighted) of Southwest France. In the C√¥tes du Marmandais AOC Abouriou is permitted to be blended with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Fer, Malbec, Merlot and Syrah in the red wine produced on both sides of the Garonne river east of the Bordeaux wine region. Grapes destined for AOC product must be harvested to a yield no greater than 56 hectoliters/hectares ( ‚âà 3 tons/acre) with the finished wine needing to attain a minimum alcohol level of at least 10%.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 66 Firefly Books 2004 When the AOC of Cahors was first established, Abouriou was a permitted secondary variety along with Valdigui√©, Syrah and N√©grette that could be blended into the predominantly Malbec-based (at least 70%) wines. But since 1979, Abouriou's use in Cahors has been prohibited with only Malbec, Merlot, Tannat and Juran√ßon permitted to be used in the blend.  Outside France  In the United States, the variety has a long history of being grown in California, particularly in the Russian River AVA, where it was known as Early Burgundy due to its tendency to ripen early in the harvest season. In the late 20th century, ampelographer Paul Truel was able to identify most plantings of Californian Early Burgundy to be Abouriou. In recent years, other growers and DNA analysis have discovered that not all Early Burgundy plantings were Abouriou with some being the German and Austrian variety Blauer Portugieser instead. A small number of Abouriou vines in the Russian River AVA were initially planted in 1890 by Giuseppe Martinelli and the grapes produced from these vines are still used today to make wine.  Styles  According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Abouriou tends to produce deeply colored and very spicy red wines that can be tannic but often lack acidity. Wine expert Oz Clarke notes that Abouriou is often only used in the lesser quality of Southwest France due to its low acid and high tannic nature.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 34 Harcourt Books 2001  Synonyms  Over the years Abouriou has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Beaujolais, Early Burgunder, Early Burgundy, Gamay Beaujolais, Gamay du Rh√¥ne, Gamay St-Laurent, Malbec Argente, Negret de la Canourgue, Noir Hatif, Plant Abouriou, Plant Pr√©coce, Pr√©coce Naug√©, Pr√©coce Noir, Pressac de Bourgogne.Vitis International Variety Catalogue \\"Abouriou \\", accessed 2010-07-01 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Abouriou"},{"id":"8117399","text":"G√ºnther Stoll (Duisburg, 18 August 1924 ‚Äì Gelsenkirchen, 10 January 1977) was a German actor.Google Books Partial filmography * Liebe, wie die Frau sie w√ºnscht (1957) ....

In the past, these have included Frogs: A Chorus of Colors, Da Vinci‚ÄîThe Genius, DINOSAURS, Math Midway and Alien Worlds and Androids.  History  The museum was established in 1912 as the Rochester Municipal Museum. Its first curator, Edward D. Putnam, served from 1913 until 1924, when New York archaeologist Arthur C. Parker took over as museum director. Parker began to expand the museum's holdings and research in anthropology, geology, biology, natural history, and the history and industry of the Genesee Region. He created the WPA-funded Indian Arts Project and is responsible for the construction of Bausch Hall. W. Stephen Thomas, a trained museum professional from Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences, succeeded Parker as museum director in 1945. Under his leadership, the museum saw the creation of state-of-the-art dioramas and growth of collections in history, technology, natural science, archaeology, and anthropology. In 1930, the name of the museum was changed to the Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences. Ian C. McLennan, former director of the Queen Elizabeth Planetarium in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was appointed as director of the creation of a planetarium in 1965 and followed Thomas as RMSC Executive Director from 1968 to 1972. 1968 saw the name of the museum change to its current title, the Rochester Museum & Science Center. Richard C. Shultz took over as director from 1973 to 1996, and he oversaw the construction of the 400-set Eisenhart Auditorium and the Gannett School classroom building. He also established the Cumming Nature Center. Three capital campaigns provided the funding for the Elaine Wilson Hall in the museum, the giant-screen film system in the Strasenburgh Planetarium, improvements in collection storage and laboratories, and an increase in the endowment fund. RMSC President Kate Bennett took the helm in 1996. Under her presidency, partnership projects with Monroe Boces 1 brought the Challenger Learning Center at the Strasenburgh Planetarium and the Bathysphere Underwater Biological Laboratory in the museum. The Genesee Community Charter School opened on the RMSC campus in 2001. The museum continues to create new galleries and new learning experiences for visitors. Bennet retired in 2018. In late 2018, Hillary Olson, a native of the Rochester area, became the 7th President and CEO of the RMSC. Olson has a rich museum and planetarium background and has worked at the Franklin Institute Science Museum, the Milwaukee Public Museum and the Griffith Observatory and Planetarium.  Strasenburgh Planetarium  The Strasenburgh Planetarium, owned by RMSC, is located next to the museum. Open since 1968, the planetarium features star shows, giant-screen films and laser light shows under a four-story dome.

Joslyn was also involved in the development of analytical chemistry as it applied to food, leading to the advancement of food chemistry as a scientific discipline. Early life Joslyn was born in Alexandrovsk, Russia. Soon after his birth, his family emigrated to the United States and settled in Michigan. College life at Berkeley After graduating high school in Michigan, Joslyn enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley where he earned a B.S. in 1926 and a M.S. in 1928. From 1928 to 1931, Joslyn worked in the food industry before returning to Berkeley as an instructor in the \\"Division of Fruit Products,\\" then an administrative unit in the College of Agriculture. The unit would later be renamed the Department of Food Science and Technology. Joslyn would earn his Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry in 1935. Research at Berkeley Joslyn's research at Berkeley began when he was a graduate student under William V. Cruess in 1926 when their research showed that fruits and vegetables can be preserved by freezing. It would continue to where his research would show the enzymatic changes of foods during food processing and their microbial changes after processing. Joslyn published one of the first books dealing with analytical food chemistry entitled Methods in Food Analysis in 1950 with a second edition coming out in 1970. Joslyn also served as co- editor (with J.L. Held) of a three volume series entitled Food Processing in 1963 and 1964. Joslyn would also lead the research to rebirth the California wine industry following the end of Prohibition in 1933. This included quality issues with wine, including alcoholic content, and content of unfavorable items in alcohol (acidity, sulfur dioxide, and turbidity). These studies would continue until his retirement from the Department of Nutritional Sciences at Berkeley in 1972 The food science department would move to the University of California, Davis in 1951. Joslyn also wrote numerous books on fruit and vegetable juices and non-alcoholic beverages as well as food preservation by freezing and dehydration. All told he wrote or co-wrote nearly 400 articles in his career. Involvement with the Institute of Food Technologists A charter member of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) when it was founded in 1939, Joslyn served as its President in 1965-66. He was also active in IFT's Northern California Section, serving as its chair in 1957-58. Joslyn won three of IFT highest awards during his career: The IFT International Award in 1961, the Babcock-Hart Award in 1963, and the Nicholas Appert Award in 1966. Joslyn also was elected an IFT Fellow in 1972. Military service During World War II, Joslyn served in the United States Army Quartermaster Corps in Australia, New Zealand, and China, being discharged as a lieutenant-colonel. For his military service, he earned the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and a special order of Yun Hui with Ribbon from the National Government of the Republic of China. Other awards Joslyn won two Diplome d'Honneur (honor diploma) from the French Office International de la Vigne et du Vin (International French Wine and Vineyard Office) in Paris for his books of Table Wines: The Technology of Their Production in California (1951, 1970) and Dessert, Appetizer, and Related Flavored Wines: The Technology of Their Production. (1964). He also earned the Merit Award from the American Society for Enology and Viticulture in 1971. Death Joslyn died at a Veterans Administration hospital in Yountville, California on November 28, 1984. He was survived by his wife Golda, a physician of Berkeley, California.

An even greater toll was exacted on Palm Sunday, March 30, 1980, during the funeral of Saint √ìscar Romero (who was assassinated Monday, March 24, 1980, while celebrating Mass at a small chapel located in a hospital called \\"La Divina Providencia\\"), when 44 people were killed during a stampede after some elements, allegedly members of security forces (although it has never been corroborated) fired on mourners/worshippers and on Romero's funeral cortege, the real gunmen were never identified. Later, the square in front of the cathedral was the site of rapturous celebrations after the signing of the Chapultepec Peace Accords that ended the Salvadoran Civil War in 1992. The cathedral was completed and inaugurated on March 19, 1999, and finished off with a festive tiled facade by the Salvadoran master Fernando Llort., CATEDRAL METROPOLITANA.

President Barack Obama visited the cathedral and the tomb during his March 2011 trip to Latin America. In late December 2012, the Archbishop of San Salvador, Jos√© Luis Escobar Alas, ordered the removal of the tiled ceramic mural facade of the cathedral without consulting the national government or the artist, the Salvadoran master Fernando Llort.

The main altar features an image of the Divine Saviour donated by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1546. The image rests on a four-column baldacchino surrounded by images of the prophets Moses and Elijah, who take part in the Transfiguration story.

The line was extended southward the following year, from Veblen to Roslyn, and then eastward to Grenville. A steam locomotive acquired from the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway (\\"Soo Line\\") was used on the railroad. The first meeting to discuss the possibility of such a line was held February 4, 1913 at Winans Hall in Harmon Township. Construction began in April, 1913, and on November 12, 1913, the first train came through Rosholt. \\"(Rosholt) proposed that farmers along the right-of-way for the distance of roughly eight to ten miles on each side contribute $200 for each quarter section of land, either owned or farmed. The money was to be in the form of a loan, with the notes secured by a mortgage in the new railroad. By this means, Mr. Rosholt hoped to raise one-half the cost of building the railroad, with himself to furnish the balance.\\" (Orlando Bjork, 1988 Rosholt-Victor History Book) The town of Rosholt was named for Julius Rosholt, builder of the F&V;, in appreciation for his fair dealings. In 1915 the F&V; was acquired by the Soo Line, and its trackage operated as a branch line by that railroad. The portion of the line between Veblen and Grenville was abandoned in 1971, and in 2000 the trackage between Rosholt and Veblen was sold to the newly formed Sunflour Railroad. Trackage north of Rosholt remained in use in 2006, operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Soo Line's corporate successor.

Because of the pi-donation from nitrogen, dithiocarbamates are more basic than structurally related anions such as dithiocarboxylates and xanthates. Consequently, they tend to bind as bidentate ligands. Another consequence of the C‚ÄìN multiple bonding is that rotation about that bond is subject to a high barrier.

Donaghy (20 February 1954 - 30 January 1972), sometimes transcribed as Gerald Donaghey, was a native of the Bogside, Derry who was killed by members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment on Bloody Sunday in Derry, Northern Ireland. Early life Both of Donaghy's parents had died by 1966, when he was 12 years old,Pringle, Peter. Those Are Real Bullets: Bloody Sunday, Derry (1972), 12 March 2002, pp. 74-75, 114-16; / and he was raised by his elder siblings, Mary and Patrick. In 1969, at the age of 15, he and his siblings moved to Meenan Square, where he lived until his death. In 1970, he obtained a job with Carlin's Brewery as a delivery hand on a beer lorry. At the time of his death at age 17, Donaghy was unemployed. Bloody Sunday On 30 January 1972, 27 civil rights protesters were shot by members of the 1st Battalion of the British Parachute Regiment during a Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association march in the Bogside area of the city. Fourteen people, six of whom were minors, died in the incident. Donaghy was shot in the stomach while running to safety between Glenfada Park and Abbey Park. A further individual named Gerard McKinney (aged 35) was fatally shot as he attempted to assist Donaghy.Bloody Sunday in Derry: What Really Happened p. 132 Shortly after he had been shot, Gerard Donaghy was brought to a nearby house by bystanders where he was examined by a doctor. His pockets were turned out in an effort to identify him.Bloody Sunday in Derry: What Really Happened p. 114 A later Royal Ulster Constabulary photograph of Donaghy's corpse showed nail bombs in his pockets. Neither those who searched his pockets in the house immediately after the shooting nor the British army medical officer (Soldier 138) who pronounced his death shortly afterwards say they saw any bombs.

Widgery Tribunal The circumstances surrounding Donaghy's death were among the most hotly contested following Bloody Sunday. The British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary stated that nail bombs had been found inside the pockets of both his denim jacket and jeans after he was shot. The first inquiry into Bloody Sunday, the since discredited Widgery Tribunal, chaired by Lord Widgery, agreed with the military.Report of the Tribunal appointed to inquire into the events on Bloody Sunday Donaghy's family and others claim the nail bombs were planted by troops to blacken Donaghy's name and provide an excuse for the killings. Saville Inquiry In his closing statement during the Saville Inquiry, Christopher Clarke, QC, counsel to the inquiry, told the tribunal judges that they must decide if Donaghy had had nail bombs in his possession when he was shot dead. Donaghy was photographed at an army post with four nail bombs in his pockets but a number of civilians who tried to take him to hospital told the tribunal he was unarmed.\\"Gaps, contradiction and the pain of truth\\", guardian.co.uk; accessed 23 October 2015.

They are located northwest of Cape Serrat, the closest point of the Tunisian mainland coast, from which they are separated by the Galite Channel, and almost north-by-northeast of the city of Tabarka, and south of Cape Spartivento in the south of Sardinia. The islands of the group sit atop Banc de Galite. Main island The centrally situated main island La Galite is long east-west, and up to wide in the east. The area of the group is , most of which La Galite accounts for. The main island has 200m high cliffs and is accessible only in the south on the bay Escueil de Pasque. A few fishermen's families live on the island. The highest peak at 391m is Bout de Somme (Grand Sommet), which is topped by a yellow lookout tower. Piton de l'Es', a prominent cone-shaped peak close to the most southeasterly point of the island, is 360m high. Other islands Besides the main island La Galite, there are two groups of islets or rocks, which are all inaccessible. The Galitons de l'Ouest, or West Galitons, are southwest of the main island. They consist of the second largest and third largest islands of the Galite Islands, 158m high Le Galiton (area 0.4 km2) and 137m high La Fauchelle, immediately southeast of Le Galiton. On the peak of Le Galiton is a lighthouse, 14m high. In 1980, the Ministry of Agriculture declared Le Galiton a natural reserve, to protect the Mediterranean monk seals. The smaller Galitons de l'Est, or East Galitons, also called Les Chiens or The Dogs, are at a distance between 1 and northeast of the main island. This group consists of three rocks, which are, from north to south, Gallo, Pollastro and Gallina (meaning \\"rooster\\", \\"chicken\\" and \\"hen\\" in Italian). Gallo is the largest of the three and is 119 m high. About to the southwest are the Sorelle Rocks, or √âcueil des Sorelles, which consist of two shallow rocky patches. A lighted buoy, fitted with a racon, is moored to the western patch, and another buoy to the eastern patch. A two meters high concrete block stands on the western patch. to the north of the group is the submerged Banc des Mazzarilles, with depths between 21 and 49 meters. During World War II, La Galite hosted a small Italian naval base. Salvatore Todaro, an Italian war hero, died on La Galite in December 14, 1942. Tunisian independence leader Habib Bourguiba was exiled to La Galite by the French colonial authorities from May 21, 1952 through May 20, 1954.

History The name of the village means the middle settlement, possibly because it is halfway between Evercreech and Bruton. An early Iron Age earthwork, probably a stock enclosure but known as Fox Covert, occupies a spur of Creech Hill overlooking the River Alham valley. The site includes a possible barrow on the west. In the late 12th century the manor was held under the Lovels of Castle Cary by William de Clevedon who gave the church to Bruton Abbey who held it until the dissolution of the monasteries. The Mendip Hospital, built in 1845‚Äì47, is not near Milton Clevedon, it is located in St Cuthbert Out, near Wells. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District,A Vision of Britain Through Time : Shepton Mallet Rural District which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

It was first published in August 1985. Plot The Man Who Never Missed concerns an ex-soldier Emile Khadaji, formerly in the service of the \\"Confed\\", a generic star-spanning empire (formerly a confederacy, hence the name) of solar systems. The Confed has grown large and old, and to maintain its fading grip on power, uses its powerful military to brutally suppress any resistance and to colonialize further worlds. During one such campaign which results in the slaughter of three-quarters of a million people in a single pitched battle, Khadaji snaps and deserts while experiencing a religious epiphany which instills him the belief that taking the lives of sapient beings is wrong and that the Confed must be overthrown. He escapes and is believed dead by his military superiors. While wandering in the nearby city and pondering his experience, the young Khadaji runs into the mysterious priest \\"Pen\\" (Pen being not his real name but rather his title; as the current Pen, Pen goes about enshrouded such that his flesh cannot be seen), of the order of the Siblings of the Shroud. Pen takes Khadaji in as a student, training him in Pen's martial art sumito (\\"The 97 steps\\"; based on the martial art Silat, which inspired Perry). Pen also teaches Khadaji the surprisingly complex craft of bartending to the many worlds of the Confed. While working as a bartender on the world of Rim, Khadaji falls in love with an \\"exotic\\" albino‚Äîexotic is the term Perry uses for descendants of humans genetically engineered to be sexually attractive, to exude sex pheromones, and to have an extremely high libido. Eventually he realizes the extent to which she cheats on him and how she views his martial arts skills as a useful way to protect herself from lustful males. Khadaji comes to the conclusion that he needs to further his war against the Confed, but bartending on Rim was wasting time. At this point, Pen and Khadaji part ways after a relationship encompassing years. Travelling to a college planet, Khadaji begins learning economics and politics and military science. While there, he masters the nonlethal civilian weapon: the spetsd≈çd. The spetsd≈çd is a small weapon which is unobtrusively mounted on the back of one's hands; it is contacted by the index finger to fire. When hyperextended, the spetsd≈çd detonates the loaded dart, propelling it down the length of the index finger at whatever the shooter aims at. Within 20 meters, it is described as being an extremely fast and precise weapon‚Äîpointshooting taken to its logical conclusion. With his weapon and target chosen, Khadaji carefully embarks on a large-scale and careful career of smuggling‚Äîa career chosen for its ability to garner large sums of money which Khadaji needs and because it does not necessarily compromise his ethics; Khadaji reasons that as long as he does not transport health-compromising narcotics, his will be victimless crimes. His criminal empire grows quickly, and Khadaji devotes his fortunes to combat training with his spetsd≈çd. Eventually, he decides to test his skills against the best living opponents he can find, in real life-or- death situations: > He considered where he could get such experience. There was the Musashi > Flex, a loosely-organized band of modern r≈çnins who travelled around > challenging each other; he could try that. Or, there was The Maze. Such a > thing was risky, but it offered a real test. Injury was likely, death a > possibility in the game known as The Maze; if he could survive that, maybe > he would be ready....pg 160 of Ace 1985 edition. The Musashi Flex would later be the subject of Perry's 2006 novel of the same name. The Maze mentioned is a multiple-day unarmed combat tournament set in a ruined city; the last person conscious wins an extremely large monetary prize. No rules other than not interfering with the medical robots rescuing a downed contestant, and not bringing any weapons with one into the tournament, are observed. Khadaji wins, and is convinced to launch his war. This he does by buying and fortifying a bar on the recently occupied planet Greaves. While luring soldiers into his bar by day, Khadaji hunts and paralyzes them with a potent cocktail of drugs which induces total paralysis by night; the cocktail does not kill, but requires enormous sums of money and at least six months to cure. Over many months, he paralyzes 2,388 of the 10,000 troops on the planet, only missing with a handful of shots, which he carefully conceals. His guerilla tactics are so successful that the Confed forces estimate the \\"Shamba Freedom Forces\\" (or the \\"Shamba Scum\\" as the Confed calls them) to have hundreds of members. Eventually, he learns that his six months are about to lapse: the first soldiers he paralyzed are recovering. At any time one of the soldiers who saw Khadaji's face might recover and reveal to their compatriots that the genial, friendly, and generous bar-owner Khadaji is actually one of the insurgents. So Khadaji goes for broke. He calls the head commander of the Confed forces and reveals that he has learned the identity of the leaders of the Shamba Freedom Forces. When Khadaji enters the commander's office, he paralyzes the commander, and successfully escapes and locks himself inside the massive vault inside the bar (used to store receipts and the many drugs that his bar sold in addition to the usual array of alcoholic drinks). There he spends an hour meditating on his past and his life; in this flashback his history is revealed to the reader‚Äîthe novel started in medias res. The army catches up to Khadaji. His vault is proof against most of their weapons; the officer tasked with his apprehension orders an \\"implosion\\" (possibly a miniature black hole) bomb fired against the safe. It, and presumably Khadaji, are compressed into a tiny lump; Khadaji is presumed dead, although the Confed forensics can only conclude that there was a human body in the remains, and not that the remains were of Khadaji. Mysteriously, shortly before the implosion round is fired, Perry writes of Khadaji handling a heavy, large, and secured package stored in the vault for the last six months. Afterwards, the Confederation military realize that he apparently knocked out almost 2,400 soldiers without missing a single time, a record which quickly becomes a legend, striking fear into the Confederation military ranks.

Influenced by singers like Antonio Chac√≥n, he carried to the extreme the tendency to a more mellow and ornamented style of flamenco singing. Owing to his particular vocal conditions and singing style, he excelled mainly in palos (styles) like fandangos, cantes de ida y vuelta and cantes libres, contributing to making them the most popular flamenco styles in the era of the √≥pera flamenca, and created a new cante de ida y vuelta, the colombiana, later recorded by many other artists like El Lebrijano or Enrique Morente. He was also the first flamenco singer to use an orchestra to accompany flamenco singing, though later he returned to the guitar.√Ålvarez Caballero, √Ångel: Introductory leaflet to Un monumento al cante, Quej√≠o collection, EMI, 1997 Marchena also revolutionized the public image of the flamenco singer: he was the first to sing standing on the stage (instead of sitting on a chair as had always been usual in flamenco), and often wore unusual outfits, such as riding clothes. Both his singing style and public attitudes were widely imitated at the time, to the extent that the period has often been identified as the era of marchenismo. He was the first real popular star of flamenco singing. Until he appeared in the flamenco scene, flamenco was restricted to small venues and theatres, whereas he could attract the masses to fill large theatres and even bullrings. Biography Pepe Marchena started working in menial jobs as boy, alternating them with live performances in taverns for a few coins, until he won a contest for amateurs in Fuentes de Andaluc√≠a. After that, he started to work as a professional in caf√©s and theatres in Andalusia. In 1922, one year after his successful d√©but in Madrid, he started singing in Teatro La Latina, with a 200 pesetas daily salary, a large sum at the time. Also in 1922, he made his first recording, and took part in the show M√°laga, ciudad brav√≠a at Teatro Mart√≠n, with guitarist Ram√≥n Montoya. In June, he sang for the King and Queen of Italy during their visit to Spain, together with Antonio Chac√≥n, Pastora Imperio, La Ni√±a de los Peines and Manuel Escacena. During the twenties and thirties, he toured Spain intensively, forming part of the cast of several flamenco theatre plays like La copla andaluza (1929) and later in films (Paloma de mis amores, 1935), thus becoming the first flamenco actor-singer. After the Spanish Civil War, he made two films: La Dolores and Martingala, and came back to the theatre in 1943 with La encontr√© en la serran√≠a. In 1945 he visited Buenos Aires with the show Feria de Sevilla, together with Carmen Amaya, which stayed in the Teatro Avenida for three months, and finished his Latin American tour in Montevideo and Rio de Janeiro. In 1950 he accomplished a rare achievement for flamenco singers at the time: he started a tour in Morocco and Algeria, which was followed by concerts in Paris. During the 1950s he kept touring Spain with several concerts and theatre shows. In 1961, he travelled to Karachi, Pakistan, to illustrate a lecture by Aziz Balouch, a Pakistani musicologist and Sufi philosophy student who had come to Spain to study flamenco and enjoyed temporary success as a flamenco singer. In 1965 and 1966 he toured with show As√≠ Canta Andaluc√≠a, taking it again to Morocco and France. Towards the end of the decade of the sixties he reduced the number of his performances. In 1974, he received an homage in his hometown of Marchena, where singers like Juan Valderrama and Perlita de Huelva took part. In 1976, already ill with cancer, he received the Gold Medal of Marchena and Juan Valderrama organized a festival in his benefit, with the participation of several artists. He died in December of that same year. In 1986, a monument in his honour was erected in Marchena. His work Pepe Marchena has probably been the most controversial flamenco singer in the 20th century. Although he has usually been considered as one of the prototypical non-Gypsy flamenco singers, Manuel de Falla, a lover of Gypsy singing, said of him: \\"In the Ni√±o de Marchena, with the crystal clear pureness of a mountain spring, we find the inexhaustible charm of the authentic Andalusian singing, without the obstacles that diminish it when it is locked up in futile songs.\\"Quoted in R√≠os Ruiz, Manuel: El gran libro del flamenco, Vol II: interpreters, Calambur, Madrid, 2002 And Leopold Stokowsky affirmed: \\"Ni√±o de Marchena has the emotion of the plain chant expressed by a genius interpreter. If his prodigious fioritura could be taken to the score, he would astonish the world.\\" After becoming very popular in the times of √≥pera flamenca, his singing was later disparaged by many artists and flamencologists of the √âpoca de revalorizaci√≥n (the period of revival of flamenco orthodoxy from the 1950s to the 1970s), who considered that the primitiveness of Gypsy singing was more orthodox and pure than the virtuosity and mellowness characteristic of Marchena and other singers of the √≥pera flamenca: > With so much softening and sweetening the singing, Pepe Marchena made it > superficial, mere artifice. His style had to be more convincing in minor > genres: the fandango and the fandanguillo, the airs coming form America, the > less heavy songs from M√°laga and Eastern Andalusia... He imposed the > \\"pretty\\" style of singing based on trills and warbles, falsetto and > ornaments; he took \\"personal creation\\" to the extreme, to the point of > feeding eighty per cent of the √≥pera flamenca; he introduced reciting, > another innovation with abominable sequels; he invented mixtures of styles > that have never been tried before... Marchena's heterodoxy is obvious. His > singing was almost totally frivolous, personal possession, closed shop. > Untransferable, in some way, even if an army of imitators followed him and > succeeded in the times of \\"marchenismo\\", and took his school to pure > plagiarism with no creativity, to a real cul-de-sac.√Ålvarez Caballero, > √Ångel: La discograf√≠a ideal del flamenco, Planeta, Barcelona, 1995 During the 1990s, together with a certain revival of the cantes de ida y vuelta and a reappreciation of the √≥pera flamenca period, his figure came back into favour for a significant part of the critics, artists and flamenco public. His influence was claimed by several outstanding singers, including Enrique Morente, Mayte Mart√≠n or Arc√°ngel. A clear example is √Ålvarez Caballero himself who, only two years after writing the words quoted above, directed a partial compilation of his recordings (Un monumento al cante, Quej√≠o collection, EMI, 1997), with an introductory leaflet in which he stated: > A singer of delicate ornaments, in the styles from M√°laga and Eastern > Andalusia he excelled especially with a convincing expressive quality. He > was also an extraordinary interpreter of fandangos.[...] Pepe Marchena > cannot be ranked together with his imitators. Marchena had a great > personality, an extraordinary musical talent.[...] After his death, > Marchena's popularity suffered diverse changes. His unconditional admirers > kept affirming their adoration for him but, in general, the critical > tendency gathered momentum. Later, however, marchenismo gradually gained > prestige, and nowadays we have the impression that flamencologist and > serious flamenco lovers increasingly value his work. Manuel Barrios perfectly summarized in one sentence the controversial character of Marchena's work: \\"For some, Pepe de Marchena is the first lie in flamenco singing; for others, its ultimate truth.\\" Quoted in √Ålvarez Caballero, √Ångel: Introductory leaflet to Un monumento al cante, Quej√≠o collection, EMI, 1997 Partial discography As usual with flamenco works recorded before the decade of the sixties, Marchena's original recordings are regularly republished in different compilations.

The term adnexal mass is sometimes used when the location of a uterine mass is not yet more precisely known. 63% of ectopic pregnancies present with an adnexal mass. Depending on the size of the mass, it could be a medical emergency. Term \\"Adnexectomy\\" in Gynaecology is often used for Salpingo-Oophorectomy (removal of both: fallopian tubes and ovaries).

He formerly served as a Republican member of the Michigan State Senate, representing the 38th district, which includes much of the Upper Peninsula. He previously served in the Michigan State House of Representatives, representing the 108th district. Early life Casperson was born in Escanaba, Michigan in 1959. He graduated from Escanaba High School in 1977. He has worked in his family's log trucking business, Casperson and Son Trucking, for the past 25 years. He has owned the business for the past 10 years. He is married to Diane Casperson, with whom he has four children. Political career Casperson was elected to the Michigan State House in 2002. He is the vice chair of the House Transportation Committee and is a member of the Agriculture and Resource Management; Land Use and Environment; and Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security committees. In 2013, while on a radio talk program, Casperson said he was not sure President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Casperson is also trying to pass legislation that would require transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender noted on their birth certificate. Congressional campaign On May 14, 2008, Tom Casperson filed over 1700 petitions with the Secretary of State, formally launching his bid for Congress for the First Congressional District of Michigan as a Republican against incumbent Democrat Bart Stupak. That support translates into designating Casperson as the candidate that gathered the most support among all the candidates that have filed for the First Congressional District. Following his announcement of candidacy on March 17, Casperson traveled the entire District, covering all 31 Counties, and secured petitions from each county within the District. According to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Casperson reported total campaign finance receipts of $102,059 as of July, 2008 - of which three quarters of that amount was donated by individuals, one eighth from Political Action Committees (PAC) and one eighth the candidate himself loaned to his campaign. As of July the two other Republican contenders for the 1st Congressional District seat had not filed financial reports with the FEC. (Under the Federal Election Campaign Act only candidates who have raised (or spent) over $5,000 are required to file financial reports.) Rep. Bart Stupak, (D) Menominee, reported to the FEC $730,541 in total receipts; of which the majority was contributed by PAC's. Roughly three-eighths of the congressman's contributions came from individuals. According to the FEC, Americans for Constitutional Enforcement (ACE) of Iron Mountain, the Michigan Farm Bureau PAC, the National Electrical Contractors PAC, the Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association Federal PAC, the MILEAD Fund, and several Republican candidates and groups constitute Casperson's PAC support. Stupak has 16 pages of PAC's listed in his FEC report. PAC's supporting Stupak include numerous communications giants like AT&T;, Alltel, Time Warner, Motorola, Sony, Universal, Verizon and Viacom. (Stupak chairs the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee of the U.S. House Commerce Committee - which conducts investigations and oversight of the telecommunications industry.) In the November 2008 election, Casperson was defeated by Stupak. State Senate campaign On November 2, 2010, Casperson was elected to the Michigan State Senate to represent the 38th Senate district which covers most of the Upper Peninsula except for Chippewa and Mackinac Counties in the east. Casperson is the first Republican to represent the western U.P. in the Michigan Senate since World War II.

He was a \\"pioneer\\" in the field of physical fitness, best known for creating the 5BX and XBX programmes in the late 1950s. Early life Orban was born on 21 April 1922 in Regina, Saskatchewan. His parents were immigrants from Hungary. Orban played many sports at the Jesuit high school he attended. In 1941 he was offered a hockey scholarship to attend the University of California, Berkeley, where he initially studied engineering. Orban attended the School of Physical Education at McGill University and graduated in 1949. In 1953, he went on to study a Ph.D. at the University of Illinois. Career Orban accepted a job offered by Wing Commander John Tett and returned to Canada in 1956, despite offers of employment from several American universities. He took a position at the Department of National Defence and was tasked to develop a fitness programme for Royal Canadian Air Force pilots, a third of whom were not considered fit to fly.An interview with Bill Orban, Ottawa Citizen Monday, July 15, 2002 In response to this brief he created the 5BX (5 Basic Exercises) plan for men and the XBX (10 Basic Exercise) plan for women. The plans were innovative in two respects. Firstly, they did not require access to specialised equipment. Many Air Force pilots were located in remote bases in northern Canada, with no access to these facilities, so it was important to offer a means of keeping fit without their use. Secondly, the plans only required 11 minutes (for men) or 12 minutes (for women) per day to be spent on the exercises. While studying the effect of exercise at the University of Illinois in the 1950s, Orban noticed when testing oxygen intake that long periods of exercise did not necessarily lead to significant improvement. This led him to the conclusion that the intensity of exercise was more important, than the amount of time spent on it. This aspect of the plan drew a negative reaction from others in the field but the 5BX programme proved its worth. 23 million copies of the booklets were sold, being translated into 13 languages. The popularity of the programs in many countries around the world helped to launch modern fitness culture. Orban, as a public servant, received no additional income from the success of the plan. In 1958, the University of Saskatchewan employed Orban to take the position of dean at its new Physical Education programme. While there he initiated the Saskatchewan Growth Study - a pioneering study of physical development in boys aged 7 to 17. In 1966, Orban returned to Ottawa to become a professor of the University of Ottawa's Human Kinetics department and became dean of that department in 1968, a position he occupied until 1976. He continued as a professor in Kinanthropology until his retirement in 1987.Obituary , Ottawa Citizen Sunday, 19 October 2003. After his retirement, Orban developed the Physical Energetics Systems of Equations (PESE). This would allow individuals to calculate exactly how fit they could potentially be and what level of exercise would allow them to achieve this. He hoped that it would allow training times for athletes to be cut and help people recovering from illnesses to become fitter. Personal life and death With his wife, nee Virginia Krasiun, Orban had three sons. Orban died of cancer at age 81 in Ottawa.

The first Croatian Bloc was formed on January 14, 1922 when the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, the Croatian Community, and the Croatian Party of Rights went into alliance. The \\"Representation\\" was organized for the first time on June 26, 1921. On that day 63 Croatian representatives to the National Assembly of the new Kingdom were in attendance in Zagreb: 56 elected in Croatia and Slavonia (50 from the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, 4 from the Croatian Union, and 2 from the Croatian Party of Rights) as well as 7 elected in Bosnia and Herzegovina (all from the Croatian Agricultural Party). They adopted a resolution supporting federalism and a neutral peasant republic. They also voiced their disapproval towards a centralized constitution, which the National Assembly adopted without them (as well as without the communists and others) only two days later. The alliance existed until November 1922 when the Party of Rights was ejected from it. The parties did not participate in a joint list in the 1925 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes parliamentary election. In 1925, the Croatian Peasant Republican Union and the Croatian Party of Rights formed a formal alliance. In 1927, the Croatian Federalist Peasant Party joined this coalition. In the 1927 elections, the bloc participated with its own list. It had two of its candidates elected as national representatives: Ante Trumbiƒá, the president of the Croatian Federalist Peasant Party that had won the greatest number of seats; and Ante Paveliƒá of the Croatian Party of Rights. After 1927, the Independent Democratic Party formed the Peasant-Democratic Coalition with the Peasant Party, and thereby joined the Representation as well. The Representation often met outside of the National Assembly, either in Belgrade or Zagreb and reached their own resolutions. The Representation symbolically took the place of the banned Croatian Parliament and strengthened the authority of peasant leaders Stjepan Radiƒá and Vladko Maƒçek, who became the de facto leaders of the Croatian people.

The band was primarily active during the late 1960s. History The band started in 1963 in Phoenix, Oregon (a small city outside of Medford) as the teen band The Navarros, playing surf music and R&B.; The original members were Rick Bolz, George Gleim, Dyan Hoffman, John Morrison, and Gary Campbell. After cutting a single on a local Oregon label, the band began recording in San Francisco and got caught up in the psychedelic rock movement. Morrison was drafted and replaced by Tom Ryan on drums. Later, Campbell and Gleim joined the reserve, and Ryan also decided to quit the band. These three were replaced by Ron Raschdorf on guitar and W. A. Farrens on drums, both from Oroville, California. The band had previously changed their name from the Navarros to The Neighb'rhood Childr'n. They recorded a self- titled album on the Acta label which was released in 1968. This album is now much sought-after by record collectors. They toured constantly in support of the album, opening for The Who, The Grass Roots, Deep Purple, and The Beau Brummels and going on a short tour with The Turtles. After encountering problems on tour, the band developed a religious focus and changed their name to White Horse. A second album that was recorded for Dot Records was not released because of the closure of the company. The Childr'n could not find another label to release their second album, and the group disbanded in 1970. Influences Their sound was compared to that of Jefferson Airplane, especially because of the vocal interplay between Dyan Hoffman and Rick Bolz, and The Turtles.

The occupation had two phases, divided by the Case Anton in November 1942 in which the Italian zone was significantly expanded. Italian forces retreated from France in September 1943 in the aftermath of the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy and it was occupied by German forces until the Liberation. Italian occupation The initial Italian occupation of France territory occurred in June 1940; it was then expanded in November 1942. San Marco Regiment in occupied France (1942) The German offensive against the Low Countries and France began on 10 May and by the middle of May German forces were on French soil. By the start of June, British forces were evacuating from the pocket in Northern France. On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war against the French and British. Ten days later, the Italian army invaded France. On 24 June 1940, after the Fall of France, Italy and France signed the Franco-Italian Armistice, two days after the cessation of hostilities between France and Germany, agreeing upon an Italian zone of occupation. This initial zone of occupation annexed officially to the Kingdom of Italy was and contained 28,500 inhabitants.Milit√§rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt. Germany and the Second World War ‚Äì Volume 2: Germany's Initial Conquests in Europe, pg. 311 The largest town contained within the initial Italian zone of occupation was Menton. The main city inside the \\"demilitarized zone\\" of from the former border with the Italian Alpine Wall was Nice. In November 1942, in conjunction with Case Anton, the German occupation of most of Vichy France, the Royal Italian Army (Regio Esercito) expanded its occupation zone. Italian forces took control of Toulon and all of Provence up to the river Rh√¥ne, with the island of Corsica (claimed by the Italian irredentists). Nice and Corsica were to be annexed to Italy (as had happened in 1940 with Menton), in order to fulfil the aspirations of Italian irredentists (including local groups such as the Nizzardo Italians and the Corsican Italians). But this was not completed because of the Italian surrender to the Allies in September 1943 when the Germans took over the Italian occupation zones. The area of southeast France actually occupied by the Italians has been disputed. A study of the postal history of the region has cast new light on the part of France controlled by the Italians and the Germans (Trapnell, 2014). By studying mail that had been censored by the occupying power, this study showed that the Italians occupied the eastern part up to a \\"line\\" joining Toulon - Gap - Grenoble - Chamb√©ry - Annecy - Geneva. Places occupied by the Italians west of this were few or transitory.\\"The postal history of the two-phased Italian occupation of south-east France 1940-1943\\" Monograph publ. France & Colonies Philatelic Society (GB) Characteristics The Italian Army of occupation in southern France in November 1942 was made up of four infantry divisions with 136,000 soldiers and 6,000 officers, while in Corsica there were 66,000 soldiers with 3,000 officers.Giorgio Rochat, Le guerre italiane 1935‚Äì1943. Dall'impero d'Etiopia alla disfatta p. 376 There was virtually no guerrilla war against the Italians in France until summer 1943. The Vichy regime that controlled southern France was friendly toward Italy, seeking concessions of the sort Germany would never make in its occupation zone.Karine Varley, \\"Vichy and the Complexities of Collaborating with Fascist Italy: French Policy and Perceptions between June 1940 and March 1942.\\" Modern & Contemporary France 21.3 (2013): 317-333. Refuge Many thousands of Jews moved to the Italian zone of occupation to escape Nazi persecution in Vichy France. Nearly 80% of the remaining 300,000 French Jews took refuge there after November 1942.Salvatore Orlando, La presenza ed il ruolo della IV Armata italiana in Francia meridionale prima e dopo l‚Äô8 settembre 1943, Ufficio Storico dello Stato Maggiore dell‚ÄôEsercito Italiano, Roma (in Italian) The book Robert O. Paxton's Vichy France, Old Guard, New Order describes how the Italian zone acted as a refuge for Jews fleeing persecution in Vichy France during the occupation. The Italian Jewish banker Angelo Donati had an important role in convincing the Italian civil and military authorities to protect the Jews from French persecution.From the French Shoah memorial : Angelo Donati‚Äôs report on the steps taken by the Italians to save the Jews in Italian-occupied France In January 1943 the Italians refused to cooperate with the Nazis in rounding up the Jews living in the occupied zone of France under their control and in March prevented the Nazis from deporting Jews in their zone. German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop complained to Mussolini that \\"Italian military circles... lack a proper understanding of the Jewish question.\\"Italy and the Jews ‚Äì Timeline by Elizabeth D. Malissa However, when the Italians signed the armistice with the Allies, German troops invaded the former Italian zone on 8 September 1943 and initiated brutal raids. Alois Brunner, the SS official for Jewish affairs, was placed at the head of units formed to search out Jews. Within five months, 5,000 Jews were caught and deported. Bordeaux In August 1940, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) established a submarine base at Bordeaux, outside Italian-occupied France. Operating from Bordeaux Sommergibile (\\"BETASOM\\") as it was known, thirty-two Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic. These submarines sank 109 Allied merchant ships (593,864 tons) and 18 warships (20,000 tons) up to September 1943.Ghetti, Walter. Storia della Marina Italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale p. 26 Eleven of these submarines were lost. Italian territorial claims In addition to Nice/Nizza and Corsica, the Italians projected further territorial claims for the defeated France. In 1940, The Italian Armistice Commission (Commissione Italiana d'Armistizio con la Francia, CIAF) produced two detailed plans concerning the future of the occupied French territories. Plan 'A' presented an Italian military occupation all the way to the river Rhone, in which France would maintain its territorial integrity except for Corsica and Nizza. Plan 'B' encompassed the Italian annexation of the Alpes Maritimes (including the Principality of Monaco) and parts of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Hautes Alpes and Savoie. The territory would be administrated as the new Italian region of Alpi Occidentali with the town of Brian√ßon (Italian: Brianzone) acting as the provincial capital.

The square design is known as 'Frome Square Plate'. Selwood used to be a village but is now part of the suburbs of Frome. It is a civil parish in the Mendip district of Somerset, England. The parish includes the villages of East and West Woodlands, Rodden and the hamlets of Alder Row and Blatchbridge. History Roddenbury Hillfort is a univallate Iron Age hill fort. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and on the Heritage at Risk Register. The ancient Selwood Forest stretched approximately between Gillingham in Dorset and Chippenham in Wiltshire. Between the eighth and early eleventh centuries it was an important boundary between east and west Wessex, and in 705 the bishopric of Sherborn was established for those \\"west of Selwood\\" Only a few fragments of the forest now survive. The parish was part of the hundred of Frome. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Frome Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Landmarks Manor Farmhouse in West Woodlands provides a particularly good survival of 17th century interior features in a very fine state of preservation, while St. Algars Farmhouse (named after √Ülfgar of Selwood) dates from the 14th century. In Rodden the Manor House dates from the late 16th century. Religious sites The Church of All Saints in Rodden dates from 1640, and was rebuilt in the mid 19th century. The church in East Woodlands was completed in 1714 having been paid for by the Longleat estate, then patrons of the parish. It is now dedicated to St Katharine. It was extensively restored in the 1870s by Pearson, the architect who also designed Truro Cathedral.

Distribution Flinders Ranges gudgeons are found in permanent water in an isolated set of spring-fed creeks in the southern Gammon Ranges National Park in the arid South Australian outback. These creeks are often in very steep-sided, rocky gorges. This fish's habitat is usually isolated into separate pools and then subject to floods that change the water level by several metres. These fish have also been recorded in samples taken from the Barcoo and Bulloo Rivers in Queensland away from the main population, in the very different habitat of larger, muddy- bottomed rivers. Description Flinders Ranges mogurndas are medium-sized fish, with a maximum total length around 13 cm. They are dark with a fine mottling of dark grey blotches on the upper side with semi-translucent fins. Usually their body is a paler colour underneath. These fish have a series of burnt orange-coloured stripes running backwards down their cheeks looking like warpaint. Roughly around the lateral line is a display of burnt orange- coloured spots interspersed with paler spots, with a single darker spot on the caudal peduncle. Males develop spectacular spawning colours in summer, namely a more brilliant display of orange spots along the side and to the tail. The anal and spiny and soft dorsal fins are edged with a tiny, iridescent, blue- white stripe. These stripes are somewhat subtle on most of the fins, but are prominent and eye-catching on the spiny dorsal fin. The males also develop a large amount of fat on the top of their heads, giving them a bulbous appearance. These fish have, in recent times been victims of a dramatic, piebald discolouration of unknown origin. Ecology and behaviour In the Flinders Ranges, M. clivicola is the only species of fish found in the rocky pools which they inhabit. They will bask lying on the shallow shelves of deeper rock pools, with their tails to one side. From above, in this position, they closely resemble the fallen gum leaves on the substrate. In the Barcoo River, the species usually co-exists with up to 10 other fish species in the typically mud-bottomed lowland streams of that system. Their predators consist mostly of larger birds. They are presumed to be ambush predators. Tadpoles, insects, and other macroinvertebrates probably form a large part of their diet. Breeding and spawning is a complex ritual spread over days. These fish spawn when the water temperature reaches 20 ¬∞C or higher. The males care for the eggs and guard and fan them with their pectoral fins. The males' behaviour becomes quite territorial and aggressive during breeding season. They have been known to chase the other fish around.

Oxon Creek heads at the confluence of Oxon Run and Barnaby Run, sometimes referred to as Winkle Doodle Run.Barnaby Run and Winkle Doodle Run meet just north of Galveston Street at Southern Avenue. Sometimes the combined stream south of that is referred to as Barnaby Run and at others as Winkle Doodle Run, Winkle Doodle is the older, more frequently used name, but Barnaby Run is used by USGS. Barnaby Run used to be called Barnabas Creek, getting its name from St. Barnabas Church which was founded in 1789 near the source of the stream. It starts just inside the boundary of D.C. and then runs to the south and west into Maryland to empty into the Potomac at Goose Island (a sand bar often under water) across from the city of Alexandria, Virginia. Before reaching the Potomac, the creek widens to form Oxon Cove which is partially in Maryland and partially in Washington, D.C.. The creek is almost entirely within Oxon Cove National Park, except for the first few feet in D.C. and a portion of the cove on the southside of the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant. Two bridges cross the creek. The Anacostia Freeway crosses it on a bridge where it becomes a tidal stream and the Oxon Hill Farm Trail crosses it where it is still narrow. The unusual spelling is either historical or a reference to Oxfordshire, England, though it was usually labelled as Oxen Creek on maps prior to 1898. The distinction between Oxon Creek and Oxon Run is often not recognized and so both are frequently referred to as Oxon Run. USGS first started labeling it as Oxon Creek in 1892. Variant names According to the Geographic Names Information System, Oxon Creek has been known by the following names throughout its history: *Isedores Creeke *Isidoras Creek *Oxen Creek *Saint Isedores Creeke *Saint John Creeke *Saint Johns Creeke History The area around Oxon Creek was largely undeveloped until the World War II era, when the Town of Forest Heights was built up along the south east side of the creek. Following Hurricane Connie in 1955, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began planning a flood control project along Oxon Creek that realigned the channel, dredged the creek to 100 feet wide, and constructed a 3-foot concrete drop structure just upstream from the Forest Heights Tributary. A smaller drop structure was built on the Forest Heights Tributary. Work began on the project in 1961. The first bridge across the Creek, the Anacostia Freeway bridge, was opened in 1961 and then rebuilt around 2000. The trail bridge was constructed in the 1970s. Oxon Creek is entirely contained within Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm, which is part of the National Park Service. Planning for the park began in 1969. Oxon Creek Trails Oxon Creek and the Oxon Creek Trail A set of trails run parallel to Oxon Creek and cross it on a bridge. The Oxon Creek Trail starts at the intersection of Oxon Run Drive and Audrey Lane in Forest Heights, Maryland. It crosses over the unnamed Forest Heights tributary and then follows the creek for about half a mile till it meets up with the Oxon Hill Hiker-Biker Trail just past another unnamed tributary within Oxon Cove National Park. The 2 mile long Oxon Hill Hiker- Biker Trail starts at the Oxon Hill Farm Parking lot and then goes down the hill to the southeast corner of Oxon Cove. From there it follows along the south and east side of Oxon Creek to the Oxon Creek Trail. There it crosses Oxon Creek on one of only two bridges over the creek and passes through parkland, into Washington, D.C. and ends at DC Village Lane, SW. The Oxon Cove Trails trace their origins to the 1970s when bike commuters used access roads and a causeway built for landfill operations. When the landfill closed, cyclists asked for a trail and one was built in 1978. Prior to 2010, the bridge over the Forest Heights tributary was washed out by high water, leaving only a low water crossing. In 2011, the section within the District was rebuilt as part of the project to create a new police Evidence Warehouse and, in the same year, the bridge connecting the Oxon Creek Trail and the Hiker- Biker path was constructed.

Roy Mottahedeh served as the director of Harvard's Center for Middle Eastern Studies from 1987 to 1990, and as the inaugural director of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program at Harvard Universityhttp://islamicstudies.harvard.edu from 2005 to 2011. Life Roy Parviz Mottahedeh was born in New York City on July 3, 1940 and received his primary and secondary education in Quaker schools in New York and Pennsylvania. In 1960 he graduated magna cum laude in history from Harvard College and was awarded a Shaw Traveling Fellowship which he used to explore Europe, the Middle East and Afghanistan. He then undertook a second B.A. in Persian and Arabic at Cambridge University in England where he received the E.G. Browne Prize. In 1962 he returned to Harvard for doctoral studies in history, where he studied with Sir Hamilton Gibb and Richard Frye. He was elected a Junior Fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows and received his PhD in 1970 for a dissertation on Buyid administration which he still hopes to publish. Professor Mottahedeh began his teaching career at Princeton University in 1970. A Guggenheim Fellowship allowed him to write his first book, Loyalty and Leadership in an Early Islamic Society (1980), the manuscript of which gained him tenure. As one of the first group of MacArthur fellows in 1981, Professor Mottahedeh was initially doubtful that such an award existed and called back for confirmation. The MacArthur award allowed him to write his second book, The Mantle of the Prophet (1985), which was a study of contemporary Iran as understood through two millennia of history. This book has been widely translated and remains in print. In 1986 Professor Mottahedeh returned to Harvard University as Professor of Islamic History in the History Department. He served as the Director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University from 1987 to 1990 and founded the Harvard Middle East and Islamic Review as a medium for Harvard students and teachers to publish their work. He was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Council on Foreign Relations and has served as a series editor for several academic publishers. In 1994 he was appointed Gurney Professor of History. Together with Angeliki Laiou he co- edited The Crusades from the Perspective of Byzantium and the Muslim World (2001). His book, Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence, a translation of Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr's Durus fi 'ilm al 'usul with an introduction, published in 2005, studies the philosophy of Islamic law as taught in Shi ªite seminaries. Professor Mottahedeh received an honorary degree from the University of Lund, Sweden, in 2006. He served as Director of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program at Harvard from 2006 to 2011. Roy Mottahedeh is the author of numerous articles that demonstrate his wide range of interests from the Abbasid period in the eighth century to Islamic revival movements of the present day. One of his most widely distributed articles, which has been translated into many languages, was his critique of Huntington's theory of the clash of civilizations. Professor Mottahedeh's other publications consider such diverse topics as the transmission of learning in the Muslim world, the social bonds that connected people in the early Islamic Middle East, the theme of \\"wonders\\" in The Thousand and One Nights, the concept of jihad in the early Islamic period, and perceptions of Persepolis among later Muslims.

Ecclesiastical province  The archdiocese has two suffragan sees: * the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lezh√´ * the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sap√´.  History  * The diocese of Scutari (Shkodr√´) was established circa 305. The first known bishop was Bassus (387). The bishops of Scutari were at first subject to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Salonica (Thessaloniki, Greece), Primatial see of all Illyricum, but when Byzantine emperor Justinian I transferred the primacy, they became suffragans of the Archdiocese of Justiniana Prima. In the early Middle Ages Scutari was suffragan of the Archdiocese of Dioclea (now Metropolitan of Bar, in Montenegro). From 1063 to 1886 53 bishops of Scutari are known (none to the middle of the twelfth century). * In 1571 it gained territory from the suppressed diocese of Suacium (Svaƒç, ≈†as). The ancient diocese of Ulcinium (Ulcinj, Dulcigno), in the territory of Scutari, was, in 1571, occupied by the Ottoman Turks and ceased to exist. Its bishops were suffragans of the Archbishop of Antivari. * In 1650 it gained territory from the suppressed Diocese of Drivasto. Other ancient sees in this territory were the Diocese of Dinnastrum and Diocese of Balazum. * On 1867.03.14 it was promoted as Archdiocese of Shkodr√´ (Scutari) / Scodren(sis) (Latin) when Scutari was aeque principaliter united with the Archdiocese of Antivari, and in this way Pope Pius IX made Scutari an archdiocese. The first archbishop of the united diocese, Mgr. Karl Pooten, native of Teveren near Geilenkirchen, Germany,Yearbook of the Diocese of Aachen 1998 who had been Apostolic Administrator of Antivari (1834‚Äì1855), died at Scutari on 15 January 1886. * On 23 October 1886, it was promoted as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Shkodr√´ (Scutari) / Scodren(sis) (Latin), while the Archdiocese of Scutari was again separated from that of Antivari, and remained an archdiocese with three suffragans : the diocese of Alessio, diocese of Sappa and diocese of Pulati. * On 2005.01.25 it was renamed as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Shkodr√´‚ÄìPult / Shkod√´r‚ÄìPult (English) / Shkodra‚ÄìPulati / Scutari‚ÄìPult (Curiate Italian) / Scodren(sis)‚ÄìPulaten(sis) (Latin), having gained merged-in territory from the suppressed Diocese of Pult * It enjoyed a Papal visit from Pope John Paul II in April 1993.

Historically part of Westmorland, it lies in the Eden Valley and below Great Dun Fell. It is mostly around 180m above sea level. At the 2001 census the parish had a population of 169, increasing to 204 at the 2011 Census. The centre of the village is built around a green, on the north side of which is the Stag Inn. The village green is oblong in shape and is bisected by an avenue of lime trees that crosses it diagonally. Houses in the village were built from the 17th century onwards and the village has changed little over the last 100 years.  History  Dufton village in 1968, the hills behind invisible in the mist Dufton is an ancient settlement and some of the earliest written records of the village are from the 1320s. The place-name Dufton is first attested in 1289 and means 'dove town or farmstead'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.152. The Rolls of Appointment report the \\"living\\" of the parish of Dufton in 1323. St Cuthbert's Church just outside the village mainly dates from the 19th century. Dufton was a centre for lead mining in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Quaker-owned London Lead Company developed the village through the construction of housing, a school, a library and the installation of piped water. A fountain and circular water trough built by the Company forms a centrepiece on the green. The inscription on the fountain reads (translated from the Latin): There is a clear pool, whose waters gleam like silver. It is not tainted by shepherds, or by their she-goats grazing on the mountain. Nor is it muddied by cattle, or by birds or wild animals, or by a branch fallen from a tree. Dufton today The main activities in the village nowadays are linked to tourism and farming. Dufton was badly affected by the foot and mouth disease outbreak of 2001. Local farms were in the area which became known as \\"the Penrith spur\\" where the disease proved very hard to eradicate and where the final cases of the outbreak occurred. The practice of grazing sheep on communal pastureland above the village may have contributed to this. Dufton lies on the Pennine Way and both the Stag Inn and Dufton Youth HostelYHA :Dufton Hostel are favourite stopping-off points for walkers. The Hostel was opened in 1978 following the closure of nearby Knock YHA which was located in an old RAF station. There are several B&Bs; and campsites in and around the village. Dufton Ghyll Wood is an area of semi-natural ancient woodland that contains significant outcrops of St Bees Sandstone. Other local geographic features include Dufton Pike, Knock Pike, Cross Fell and High Cup. The locality is also known for the Helm Wind and Helm Bar. The latter are wind and cloud effects induced by the topography of the area.

Using ocean sediment cores, the Science paper verified the theories of Milutin Milankoviƒá that oscillations in climate over the past few million years are correlated with Earth's orbital variations of eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession around the Sun. These changes are now called the Milankovitch cycles. He became a recipient of the Milutin Milankovic Medal with George Kukla in 2003.

Biography Sven Pipien began his musical career playing bass with Atlanta-based rock outfit Mary, My Hope. The band recorded one full-length LP in 1989 (Museum) and one EP in 1990 (Suicide Kings) and garnered enough college radio popularity to earn them opening slots on headlining tours for Love and Rockets and Jane's Addiction. Their style, which included elements which would later be heard with the emergence of grunge in the early-to-mid 1990s, was out of place with much of the mainstream music scene at the time and the band split up in 1991. A compilation, Monster Is Bigger Than The Man, appeared shortly after, featuring four previously released songs and four unissued cuts. Pipien reappeared in 1997, when he replaced original bassist Johnny Colt in multi- platinum rock act The Black Crowes. He would spend the next year performing live with the band and making contributions to their fifth studio album, By Your Side, which was finally released in January 1999 after several delays. A live EP, Souled Out...Live!, would appear later in the same year, culled from the band's support tour for By Your Side. In the Fall of 1999, The Black Crowes were tapped by Jimmy Page to be his band for a tour featuring a setlist predominantly made up of Led Zeppelin material. The short tour would prove very successful for both parties and resulted in the live release, Live at the Greek, which appeared in mid-2000. The album was an early entry into the catalog of releases exclusive to the Internet and demand for it was so high, the server of its provider, MusicMaker.com, crashed for an entire day. More dates were added to the tour with Page, keeping the band booked through the majority of 2000. Pipien was let go from the band mid-tour, however, replaced by well-known session player Greg Rzab. Pipien would reappear the next year with King Bee, a Miami-based blues rock outfit, a band he would remain with until 2002. He would make no contributions to any of the band's studio output, their first album not recorded until 2003. After departing King Bee, Pipien virtually disappeared from the music scene. When The Black Crowes ended their three-year hiatus in March 2005, they invited Pipien to rejoin the band as bassist. He accepted the invitation and remained a member of the band through their 2015 breakup, recording two studio and two live albums during his second stay. In late 2016, following the Black Crowes' 2015 breakup, he became a founding member of the Magpie Salute, a band which features his former Black Crowes bandmates Rich Robinson and Marc Ford.Rich Robinson Forms Magpie Salute With Ex-Black Crowes - Rolling Stone Discography With Mary My Hope: * Museum (1989) * Suicide Kings (EP) (1990) * Monster Is Bigger Than The Man (Compilation) (1991) With The Black Crowes: * By Your Side (1998) * Souled Out...Live!

Howard, one of his tales featuring the fictional sword and sorcery hero Conan the Cimmerian. A fragment begun in the 1930s but not finished or published in Howard's lifetime, it was completed by L. Sprague de Camp and published in the following works: *The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, February 1967 *Conan (Lancer, 1967, later reissued by Ace Books). *The Conan Chronicles (Sphere Books, 1989) It has since been published in its original form in the following collections: *The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle (Gollancz, 2000) *Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932-1933) (Del Rey, 2003). Plot summary Howard's unfinished version Nestor, a mercenary from Gunderland, is leading a calvary of Zamorian soldiers in pursuit of the thief Conan. In a mountain gorge, Nestor trips over a rawhide tripwire set in the high grass of a grove by Conan. The trap activates an avalanche which kills all of Nestor's men, but only lightly injures Nestor himself. Enraged, Nestor pursues Conan into the ruins of an ancient city and a battle between the two ensues. A hit from the barbarian's sword renders Nestor temporary senseless and Conan, thinking Nestor is dead, continues deeper into the ruins. As Nestor is recovering, Conan stumbles upon some unspecified monstrosity that he defeats by first hurling rocks upon it from an elevation and then finishing it off with his sword. Nestor eventually catches up with Conan outside a great palace in the middle of the city. Conan convinces Nestor to abandon his mission in favor of joining him in raiding the palace for treasure. Descending into the palace, the duo eventually reaches a treasure vault adorned with the bodies of slain warriors. After gathering up some loot of coins and jewels, the two throw dice for a jade serpent idol. Conan eventually wins but, as he lifts up the idol, the dead warriors awaken. The two fight their way out of the palace and are eventually followed by only a single large warrior. As the three of them emerge to the sunlight outside, the undead creature crumbles to dust. The two make for their escape, but an earthquake hits the ruins and separates Conan from Nestor. Later, Conan is inside a tavern with a young woman he rescued. Conan empties his bag of jewels onto their table, but to his amazement they too, like the undead warrior, had turned to dust. The girl lifts up the leather sack with the snake idol in it for Conan to examine, but soon drops it with a scream as she feel something moving inside it. At this very moment, a magistrate enters the tavern with a group of soldiers and has Conan driven up against a wall. It turns out that Nestor, having gotten drunk on the money of his which never turned to dust, had told of his exploits with Conan in their presence and just barely escaped arrest. The magistrate decides to confiscate Conan's leather bag. However, as he places his hand into it, he immediately retracts it with a shriek revealing a live serpent biting fast onto his finger. The resulting turmoil allows Conan and the girl to escape. L. S. de Camp's version Conan is exploring the haunted ruins of the ancient city of Larsha in the country of Zamora, led there by rumors of a hidden treasure. Behind him, in pursuit, is an army of Zamorian soldiers sent to capture Conan for crimes of theft against rich merchants and nobles. Leading them is a captain from Gunderland named Nestor. Suddenly, as Nestor turns his head to berate the men for their constant chatter, he fails to notice a rawhide tripwire left earlier by Conan. Nestor falls sprawling in the grass and sets off Conan's trap as a large pile of rocks wipe out his men, leaving him battered and bruised but alive. Enraged at the loss of his men and fearing the consequences of returning without his prisoner, Nestor decides to pursue Conan alone. He finally confronts him just outside the walls of Larsha, as the young barbarian is searching for a way inside. The two engage in fierce swordplay, until Conan strikes Nestor in the head. The sword penetrates Nestor's helmet and he collapses to the ground, unconscious. Conan then makes his way into the deserted city and begins to thread the winding streets, recalling the tales he had heard concerning a horrible fate which befell trespassers. Soon, he confronts a monster in the form of a giant slug, fifty feet long with the ability to spit a corrosive acid with deadly accuracy. The slug chases Conan throughout the city, until he climbs up the roof of a decaying temple and manages to knock over some gargoyle statuary, one after the other, crushing the monster to death. After climbing back down, while making sure the slug is dead, he hears a familiar voice and turns to see Nestor confronting him again, this time with a bandaged head wound. Conan's blow had only succeeded in injuring him. However, just as they are about to resume combat, the two decide on a mutual agreement. The two warriors will search for the treasure as allies and divide whatever they find among themselves. They enter the royal palace of Larsha, intricately carved from a single rock formation of black basalt, and where the treasure is supposed to lie hidden. They light torches to find their way through various passages and eventually come across a vault. Gaining entry, they discover inside a glittering hoard of treasure‚Äì gold, silver, and jewels in a vast pile of splendour. However, guarding this ancient wealth are the mummified corpses of seven giant warriors seated in chairs, which promptly come to life and attack the pair of adventurers as they are gathering the treasure. After a desperate fight, Conan and Nestor escape from the vault with the mummies in pursuit. As they follow them out into the sunlight, the undead creatures immediately turn to dust, the necromantic spell broken by mere contact. Suddenly, the earth beneath their feet begins to tremble in a great earthquake as walls and columns fall before them. Conan escapes the final destruction of Larsha, but Nestor is nowhere to be found. Calling his name and getting no response, Conan assumes the worst and travels into the city of Shadizar with his bag of jewels. That night in Shadizar, Conan swaggers into his favorite tavern and makes his way to a table where his sweetheart of the moment sits drinking alone and begins boasting of his adventure. He empties the contents of his treasure bag, seven priceless green jewels worth enough to buy an entire kingdom, onto the table and, like the seven undead guardians, they too crumble into worthless powder much to his chagrin. A magistrate then enters the tavern, followed by a squad of night watch, with the intent to arrest Conan on his original charges of theft and the slaying of Nestor's men. As it turned out, Nestor survived the earthquake at Larsha. He was discovered by the authorities drunk and, like Conan, boasting of his amazing feat. When they tried to apprehend Nestor, he fled into the nearby jungle. However, Nestor lost his loot to the police who made a dash to claim it for themselves. The magistrate who confronted Conan then reaches inside a leather bag on the table where Conan's last remaining prize was concealed, a statuette in the form of a jade green serpent. As the magistrate thrust his hand inside, the statuette comes to life and bites into his flesh. In the resulting panic and confusion, Conan made good his own escape. On the road outside of Shadizar, Conan and Nestor meet at a prearranged spot while sharing news of one another's misadventures. After accepting their fates with grim humor, the two amicably decide on parting ways. Adaptation The Howard fragment was adapted by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith in Marvel Comics' Conan the Barbarian #8 (\\"The Keepers of the Crypt\\", Aug 1971) and by Mike Mignola and Cary Nord in Dark Horse Comics' Conan #29-31. Plot overview (2006 Dark Horse adaptation) As the story begins, Conan is being pursued by a mercenary, Gunderman, and his calvary of Zamorian soldiers. Conan used a trap involving rocks to decimate Gunderman's unit. However, the mercenary follows him into an ancient city. Meanwhile, Conan is surrounded by red toads, which bring a stone idol to life. After being swallowed by the toad-like idol, Conan has a vision of a blind serpent and three mysterious robed figures. He slices his way out of the toad's stomach and continues his journey. Soon, Gunderman approaches Conan and offers a share in the fabled treasure with him. Conan agrees, and the two thieves enter a tomb where the petrified remains of three sorcerers are. Conan has another vision and, frightened, destroys the three corpses. Conan steals two emeralds while Gunderman fills his shack with gold. Suddenly, Conan's destruction of the petrified corpses incited the rest of the guards to rise from the dead and attack them. The two lure the corpses into the sunlight, and they turned to dust. However, the city begins to collapse and Conan barely escapes with his life. It appeared that Gunderman was lost. Unsurprised, Conan returns to the city to retrieve his love interest and settle his debt with Gunderman's former master. Conan turned over the jewelled eyes, which suddenly comes to life. Conan doesn't stay to see; he retreats with his female partner and flees into the night.

In a note to the reader, Burton claims to be the translator of the poem, to which he gives the English title \\"Lay of the Higher Law.\\" It is thus a pseudotranslation, pretending to have had an original Persian text, which never existed. The Kasidah is essentially a distillation of Sufi thought in the poetic idiom of that mystical tradition; Burton had hoped to bring Sufist ideas to the West. \\"The Translator\\" As the Translator, Burton signs himself ‚ÄúF. B.,‚Äù for Frank Baker, an English nom-de-plume from Francis (his middle name), and Baker (his mother‚Äôs maiden name). In notes following the poem, Burton claims to have received the manuscript from his friend Haji Abdu, a native of Darabghird in the Yezd Province of Persia. Describing Haji Abdu, Burton writes that he spoke an array of languages and notes that \\"his memory was well-stored; and he had every talent save that of using his talents\\" ‚Äî an apt description of the true author. Title and structure A \\"kasidah\\", or \\"qasida\\", was originally a genre of Arabic-language poem, which could be satirical, elegiac, minatory, or laudatory. Typically, it was written in monorhyme throughout its length, which might be 50 to 100 lines, or more. The genre spread to Persia with Islam, where it became extremely popular and was much elaborated upon. In the Oxford English Dictionary entry on \\"kasidah\\", the form is defined as a classical Arabic or Persian panegyric in verse, which begins with a reference to encountering a deserted campground, followed by a lament, and a prayer to one's traveling companions to halt while the memory of the departed dwellers is invoked. Content In adapting the style, techniques and ideas of the classical Sufi masters (Hafez, Omar Khayyam), Burton produced a sort of \\"spiritual autobiography\\" in The Kasidah. In exploring the limitations of Man's undeveloped reason, egoism and self-made religions, he sought a fulfillment of individual human destiny. Burton spread a wide net in his allusions and influences. One of his biographers claimed to find elements of Confucius, Longfellow, Plato, Aristotle, Pope, Das Kabir, the Palambal ‚Äî as well as Edward FitzGerald's famous 1859 translation of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam ‚Äî in the work. Interpretation The Sufi writer Idries Shah (1924‚Äì1996), in his 1964 book The Sufis, states that The Kasidah was a distillation of Sufi thought, and that \\"there seems little doubt that Burton was trying to project Sufi teaching in the West... In Sufism he finds a system of application to misguided faiths 'which will prove them all right, and all wrong; which will reconcile their differences; will unite past creeds; will account for the present and will anticipate the future with a continuous and uninterrupted development.'\\" (251-2) Shah devoted almost an entire chapter of the book to Burton's poem, calling it, \\"One of the most interesting productions of Western Sufic literature... Burton provided a bridge whereby the thinking Westerner could accept essential Sufi concepts.\\" Quote The best known couplets from The Kasidah are: Even Burton's hostile biographer Thomas Wright allowed that these four lines \\"can be pronounced imperishable\\".

Howard starring the sword and sorcery hero Conan the Cimmerian, an untitled fragment begun in the 1930s but not finished or published in Howard's lifetime. It was completed and titled by Lin Carter and in this form was published in the following collections: *Conan (Lancer, 1967, later reissued by Ace Books). *The Conan Chronicles (Sphere Books, 1989) *Beyond the Gates of Dream (Belmont Books, 1969), a collection of short stories by Lin Carter and collaborators. It has since been published in its original form in: *The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle (Gollancz, 2000) *Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932-1933) (Del Rey, 2003). Plot summary (Carter) Conan is a mercenary, serving in the empire of Turan, and fighting in a pitched battle against the forces of a rebellious satrap named Munthassem Khan. As the two sides are locked in furious combat, Conan looks up and sees a swarm of winged monsters with hellish green eyes, resembling enormous bats, descend from the sky before appearing on the battlefield. Unknown to Conan, Munthassem Khan had summoned these supernatural creatures using a magical artifact known as the Hand of Nergal. The Turanians are frightened and begin retreating from the battlefield. Soon, Conan is left to face one of the shadow bats alone. As he begins to fall victim to an unearthly cold emanating from the monster, his hand reaches for a mysterious golden talisman in his pouch that he had discovered earlier. As he touches it, a surge of warmth flows through him, banishing the shadow bats and turning them back upon their former allies, the army of Munthassem Khan. Overcome with exhaustion, Conan loses consciousness. An hour later, Conan awakens from his exhaustion while finding himself alone on the battlefield amid the dead bodies and wreckage of war. Soon, Conan discovers two survivors, the horse belonging to his former general, now dead, and a young Brythunian girl named Hildico. Hildico had been sent by her master, a wise sorcerer named Atalis, in the nearby city of Yaralet, ruled by Munthassem Khan. Convincing him to come with her to visit the sorcerer, Conan convenes with Atalis who explains that his help is needed to end both Munthassem Khan's tyrannical reign of terror over the citizens of Yaralet and his rebellion against King Yildiz of Turania. According to the tale told by Atalis, Munthassem Khan was once a kind and merciful ruler until he came into possession of the Hand of Nergal, an object of evil power in the form of an ivory sceptre with a clawed demon hand at one end grasping a crystal. Inscribed on the sceptre is a series of strange glyphs and runes. It fell to earth from the stars in ancient times and, as it changed hands through the ages, it granted whoever claimed it the promise of ultimate power as well as the curse of eventual destruction. The only way to counter the Hand's malevolent force is with a talisman known as the Heart of Tammuz, a golden amber stone shaped like a heart and warm to the touch, the same talisman which Conan had found and used in overcoming the shadow bats. Conan eventually confronts Munthassem Khan in his throne room, but finds himself losing to the power of the Hand until Hildico comes to his rescue, grabs the Heart of Tammuz, and hurls it at Munthassem Khan. Conan's amulet strikes Khan in the forehead and renders him unconscious. The forces inside both artifacts are then unleashed and wage a cosmic struggle against each other until both finally come together with a great shattering thunder as of two worlds colliding. In the aftermath, both the Heart and Hand have vanished. Soon, nothing is left of Munthassem Khan except for a pile of ashes. The curse is broken and Yaralet is free from Khan's tyranny.

The maneuver originated early in the 20th century in air racing. In some contexts, simply making a turn around a fixed point on the ground (such as a physical pylon) is called a \\"pylon turn\\". In these cases, the altitude may be incorrect for the maneuver to be a proper \\"pylon turn\\" where all three parameters (altitude, speed, bank angle) come together for the wing to point to the fixed turning center on the ground.  Racing  The pylon turn was originally used in air racing, where courses were set up with pylons to mark a location on the ground, and the planes would have to turn around at that point before returning to the airstrip. Pylons are also used in triples to set up a triangular circuit for aviation races‚Äîraces in which all competitors must stay outside of the three pylons.  Delivery  A pylon turn is part of a maneuver also known as long-line loiter1973 patent for \\"Long line loiter technique\\" which can be used to deliver messages or packages by plane without needing to land. In this maneuver it is possible to lower a bucket on a line to the ground in such a way that the bucket remains stationary on the ground, permitting transfer of material. It was used during Operation Auca and depicted in the film End of the Spear, to give gifts to the Huaorani people of Ecuador where there was no landing strip. Later some mail services have used the same technique to deliver mail where there are no available landing strips. Geometry The mechanics of the maneuver allow it to occur only at the \\"pivotal altitude\\", which is a geometric and aerodynamic construction of ground speed and altitude above the ground.  Combat use  Tracer from an AC-47D converging at the center area of a pylon turn over Saigon, 1968 The first notable combat use of the pylon turn was in the Vietnam War in 1964, with the development of the AC-47 Spooky gunship, which could fire miniguns mounted on the left side of the aircraft as the pilot circled the target. Later, the more advanced Lockheed AC-130 was used in the same way. Using this maneuver allowed gunners to fire continuously and efficiently at a stationary target for an extended period of time, without needing to make several passes. Another huge advantage of pylon turns was that the gunfire was accurate enough to be used even in close proximity to friendly troops, which had never before been possible in air power. Also, a similar method is used by attack helicopters, on which the armament shoots forward. In this case the helicopter strafes sideways in a circle around a single target. This method improves shooting accuracy, increasing hit probability.

Plot Howard's untitled synopsis begins in the walled city of Shumballa, in the land of Kush. Shumballa is inhabited by a tribe of warlike blacks called Gallahs, though the lighter-skinned aristocratic rulers are called Chagas. A Gallah commander is killed by a pig-like monster sent by the noble Tuthmes who intends to throw suspicion on Tanada, sister of the king. Part of his plan is to present the king with a white slave, Diana, who he has recently captured. When Tanada rides through the city outside the walls, known as Punt, she is attacked by an angry mob and rescued by Conan, who is made captain. Conan then puts down an uprising and gains the approval of the king. Soon, Tanada kidnaps Diana, who has attracted Conan's eye, and the witch- finder Agara discovers Tuthmes is behind the murder of his commander. Tuthmes has Agara executed, or so he believes. Diana, unable to reveal Tuthmes's plans to Tanada, is rescued by Conan and spends the night at his quarters. Meanwhile, Tuthmes has sent his monster to kill both Conan and Diana. Conan battles the creature into the streets where a sorcerer is being executed, and a still alive Agara appears to accuse Tuthmes. The crowd wildly attacks Tuthmes, his band of nobles, and the city itself as Conan and Diana escape. Adaptation The story was adapted for comics by Roy Thomas and John Buscema in Marvel Comics' Conan the Barbarian #106-107.

Many jazz musicians, including Dexter Gordon, Stan Getz, and Chet Baker, have performed there. It is sometimes called Cafe Montmartre. The Montmartre was located first in Dahlerupsgade, then from 1961 on in Store Regnegade, and since 1976 in N√∏rregade 41 before closing down in 1995. In May 2010 it was re-opened in Store Regnegade 19A by media executive and entrepreneur Rune Bech and jazz pianist Niels Lan Doky, who was later replaced as music director by saxophonist Benjamin Koppel and then jazz publisher Christian Brorsen. In 2016 Swedish jazz pianist Jan Lundgren was appointed artistic director.New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. History It was opened in 1959 by Anders Dyrup with a two-week stint by George Lewis. In the beginning the program was dominated by Dixieland (then very popular in Denmark). Shortly afterwards Stan Getz, who lived from 1958 to 1961 with his Swedish wife in Copenhagen, played regularly in the Club. He was followed by other expatriate American jazz musicians, including Dexter Gordon (who lived from 1962 to 1976 in Copenhagen) and Ben Webster (from 1964 on in Copenhagen and Amsterdam). On New Year's Eve 1961 the Club Jazzhus Montmartre reopened under the lead of Herluf Kamp-Larsen in new premises in Store Regnegade. The Montmartre developed into one of the main locations for jazz in Europe, for long years with Kenny Drew (p), Alex Riel (dr) and Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen as regular rhythm group, who accompanied guest musicians. From 1976 on it was at N√∏rregade 41 with Kay S√∏rensen (1938‚Äì1988) as owner, while Niels Christensen served as music manager, assisted from 1982 by Lars Thorborg. From 1976 to 1989 Montmartre established itself as one of the strongest jazz venues in Europe. Besides jazz stars like Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, Oscar Peterson, Nancy Wilson, Betty Carter, Elvin Jones, Art Blakey, Brecker Brothers and many more, Montmartre also presented world music artists like Milton Nascimento, Gilberto Gil, Djavan, Tania Maria, Youssou N'Dour and King Sunny Ad√©, as wells as funk/soul artists like James Brown, Tower of Power and Gil Scott-Heron. Local pop and rock artists also saw Montmartre as their homeground, as well as the very popular Natdiskotek (night disco), that attracted youth from all over greater Copenhagen every weekend, and also provided the economic foundations for the club's strong jazz profile. In 1989 Kay S√∏rensen suddenly died and Montmartre was sold to Eli Pries, who had trouble maintaining the clubs traditional mix of art and commercial success. Pop musician Anne Linnet took over the club in 1992, changing the club into a mainly techno music venue, and in 1995 Montmartre in N√∏rregade closed its doors. Instead various temporary discoth√®ques under changing names took over the historic location. From 1991, the focus for jazz in Copenhagen shifted to the Copenhagen Jazz House (Niels Hemmingsens Gade 10), but closed in 2017. [https://politiken.dk/ibyen/art6010836/Jazzhouse-lukker-i-K%C3%B8benhavn-K From 1959-1976, the club made jazz history as the European home for jazz giants Dexter Gordon, Ben Webster, Stan Getz, Kenny Drew and many other masters of the 60s and 70s. They all moved to Copenhagen because of Montmartre. The club got under their skin with its special atmosphere and extraordinary people. While living in Copenhagen, the great American jazz icons educated a whole generation of Danish jazz masters, including the famous Danish bass players Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen, Mads Vinding, Jesper Lundgaard and Bo Stief, drummer Alex Riel, trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg and many others. Among the other giants playing on and off at Montmartre were Roland Kirk, Oscar Pettiford, Joe Harris, Buddy Tate, Coleman Hawkins, Don Byas, Bud Powell, Julian \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley, Cecil Taylor, Brew Moore, Harold Goldberg, Lucky Thompson, Archie Shepp, Johnny Griffin, Art Taylor, Booker Ervin, Albert Ayler, Dollar Brand (Abdullah Ibrahim), Don Cherry, Rune Gustafsson, Albert \\"Tootie\\" Heath, Eli Thompson, Sonny Rollins, Yusef Lateef, George Russell, Teddy Wilson, Paul Bley, Bill Evans, Eddie G√≥mez, Richard Boone, Herbie Hancock, Eddie Henderson, Billy Hart, Keith Jarrett, Miroslav Vitous, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, Lee Konitz, Louis Jordan, Charles Mingus, Ken McIntyre, Nat Adderley, Donald Byrd, Tony Williams, Lou Bennett, Phil Woods, Charles McPherson and Dizzy Gillespie. Re-opening In May 2010 Jazzhus Montmartre re-opened in its original premises in Store Regnegade with a high-end international music profile. The re-opening of Jazzhus Montmartre made news around the globe, and the new Jazzhus Montmartre quickly made it back on the map as a top attraction of Copenhagen. The New York Times included Jazzhus Montmartre on its much-hyped list of must-see-places in the city under the headline \\"Rebirth Of Cool\\". \\"Rebirth of Cool\\", The New York Times - on the re-opening af Jazzhus Montmartre. The re-opening of Montmartre in May 2010 was initiated by media executive and entrepreneur Rune Bech together with jazz pianist Niels Lan Doky (who after eight months was replaced as music director by saxophonist Benjamin Koppel as of February 2011). The former proprietor of the original historic venue, Herluf Kamp-Larsen, was present at the re-opening night. When the premises became vacant after many years as a hairdressing school, Bech and Doky jumped at the opportunity and reopened Montmartre at its original location. Restoring the club became a labour of love for a dedicated group of volunteers, out of love for jazz and the history of Montmartre, which has often been called \\"The Village Vanguard of Europe\\" in homage to its legendary sister club in New York. Montmartre's co-founder, Rune Bech, is well known as a foreign correspondent for Politiken from 1989. In 1998 he co- founded the successful health portal NetDoctor.com, and in 2001 became the internet director for the leading Danish broadcaster TV 2 and a member of the executive management team. Rune Bech donated the funding capital for Jazzhus Montmartre as his con-amore passion project. Rune Bech had a vision to establish Montmartre as a non-profit organisation. As a consequence Jazzhus Montmartre is set up as a charity foundation with former CEO of the Royal Danish Theatre and former chairman for Denmark's Radio (DR) Michael Christiansen as Montmartre's chairman, and Rune Bech and lawyer Ole Borch as fellow board members. Before re-opening Jazzhus Montmartre the founders wrote eight missions for the club, The Montmartre Manifesto. In short, Montmartre should be an international landmark of great jazz and a place that discovers and presents new talent with world class potential. It is the ambition \\"to create a paradise for life lovers with a cozy and sincere ambience\\". And, most importantly, \\"Montmartre should be known for its warm, welcoming and homey atmosphere attracting good people that follow their heart in life\\".The Montmartre Manifesto The Danish jazz publisher Christian Brorsen was the Music Director of Montmartre until 2016 when Swedish pianist Jan Lundgren took over. He is backed up by an Artistic Council whose members are drummer Alex Riel, bass players Lars Danielsson and Jonathan Bremer, jazz saxophonist Benjamin Koppel, drummer Morten Lund and singer Sinne Eeg. The club is run by primarily by part-time staffs together with a team of dedicated volunteers. With a limited audience capacity of only 85 seats, Montmartre is dependent on donations and membership fees from its club, Friends of Montmartre. Some of Denmark's large foundations have supported the re-opening as well as a grant from the City of Copenhagen. With its high level of artistic ambition, Montmartre is dependent on support and donations. The old Jazzhus Montmartre was known for the plaster masks that became an icon for the club in the 1960s. They were created in 1959 by the artist Mogens Gylling and attracted attention around the world as a remarkable work of art. When Montmartre closed in 1976 the masks disappeared, but the Montmartre team convinced Gylling, who still lives outside Copenhagen, to recreate his famous wall art with a twist. The ten new masks were put back on the wall by the artist himself during Copenhagen Jazz Festival 2010, an event heavily covered by the media. Official website Official website Closure in 2020 due to the corona pandemic On September 2, 2020, Jazzhouse Montmartre wrote on their homepage that all future concerts will be canceled immediately due to bad economy, caused by the government's rules due to the covid-19 pandemic that only permit 35 guests in a club with 85 seats. Later that day, it was reported in Danish and Swedish media that the club closes as of today, September 2, 2020. Its last concert was held on August 29, 2020.

Wonder Who? recordings generally feature the falsetto singing by Valli, but with a softer falsetto than on \\"typical\\" Four Seasons recordings. Background The Four Lovers The Four Seasons evolved from The Four Lovers, which recorded under a variety of names between 1956 and 1960. Lead singer Valli had himself recorded under several pseudonyms as well, including Frankie Tyler and Frankie Valley. Songwriter/guitarist/keyboardist Bob Gaudio did the same (as Turner Disentri and as Alex Alda) after he joined the Four Lovers in 1959.Fred Bronson, The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, third edition (Billboard Books 1992) Hal Leonard, American Singing Groups: A History from 1940 to Today (2005) Aside from the first Four Lovers single, \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\" in 1956, the group's (and Valli's) records failed to chart.Joel Whitburn, Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1993 (Billboard Books 1994) In 1958, The Four Lovers obtained a three year artist contract with producer Bob Crewe, which gave the group a steady stream of session work (Valli can be heard singing in the background of \\"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\\" by Danny and the Juniors) in addition to recording for Crewe's Peri Records.Fred Bronson, The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, 3rd edition (Billboard Books, 1992) Joe Sasfy, Liner notes to Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons: 1962-1967 (Warner Special Products, 1987: Time-Life Music The Rock 'N' Era 2RNR-15) Since the beginning of The Four Lovers, the group performed in clubs and lounges in New Jersey and offered songs in a variety of styles, from country and western to pop to doo wop to rockabilly to Broadway tunes, with a sprinkling of Italian love songs thrown in.Hal Leonard, American Singing Groups: A History from 1940 to Today (2005) The Four Seasons hit factory In 1960, The Four Lovers became The 4 Seasons (named after the bowling lane). The session work (and recording under various names) continued, but now with Valli, Gaudio, and Crewe trying to sell both Gaudio compositions and Four Seasons recordings, the group finally achieved national distribution under its own name for the first time in four years.Fred Bronson, The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, 3rd edition (Billboard Books, 1992) Joe Sasfy, Liner notes to Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons: 1962-1967 (Warner Special Products, 1987: Time-Life Music The Rock 'N' Era 2RNR-15) While the first single failed to sell, the second one, \\"Sherry\\", started a string of successes for The Four Seasons. From 1962 to 1966, it has been estimated that The Four Seasons had sold about 50 million records, more than any recording act except The Beatles.Wayne Jancik, The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders, expanded first edition (Billboard Books, 1998) In the midst of a royalty dispute with Vee-Jay Records in late 1963, the Four Seasons left the label for Philips. While Vee-Jay started recycling Four Seasons product in 1964, Phillips started releasing new Four Seasons records with increasing frequency as the British invasion began. With the blessing of Philips officials, Valli rekindled his \\"solo\\" career in the latter part of 1965, releasing records that were credited to him and having the group as backing musicians. In 1966 and 1967, Four Seasons records and Frankie Valli singles were listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, with both names appearing simultaneously in the chart in several issues of the magazine. The Wonder Who? history and beyond On the heels of recording a live album of Broadway tunes (to complete the settlement of the group's lawsuit with Vee-Jay), Valli, Crewe, and Gaudio had planned on recording an album consisting entirely of songs written by Bob Dylan, but as recording progressed, the concept was modified to include songs by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Valli was not happy with his vocals on the various takes of \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" when he decided to record the song with a \\"joke\\" falsetto vocal to reduce the tension in the studio.Wayne Jancik, The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders, expanded first edition (Billboard Books, 1998) An executive of Philips Records heard a replay of the recording with a \\"joke\\" vocal and wanted it to be released as a single -- Two years earlier, Peter, Paul, and Mary had reached the #9 position on the Hot 100 with their version of the song -- but the recording by Valli and the band could not be released as either a Valli \\"solo\\" single or a Four Seasons single. Sold in a picture sleeve with a connect the dots puzzle, the record with the truncated name (\\"Don't Think Twice\\") was released as by \\"The Wonder Who?\\" in November 1965.Joel Whitburn, Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1993 (Billboard Books 1994) It reached #12 on the Hot 100, and as it was sliding down the chart in January 1966, a Frankie Valli \\"solo\\" single (\\"(You're Gonna) Hurt Yourself\\") and a Four Seasons single (\\"Working My Way Back to You\\") were also in the upper half of the chart, giving three simultaneous hit records by the group under different guises.Fred Bronson, The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, third edition (Billboard Books 1992) In the wake of \\"Don't Think Twice\\", Vee-Jay reissued a Four Seasons recording, \\"Peanuts\\" (originally a 1957 hit by Little Joe and the Thrillers), as by \\"The Wonder Who\\" (without the question mark).Tom Neely, Goldmine Price Guide to 45 RPM Records, fifth edition (KP Books 2005) As was the case with previous Four Seasons releases of the song, the \\"Wonder Who\\" single didn't sell and didn't chart. Two more \\"Wonder Who?\\" singles were released by Philips. Three of the four sides made it onto the lower reaches of the Hot 100.Joel Whitburn, Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1993 (Billboard Books 1994) \\"Don't Think Twice\\" and the other charting \\"Wonder Who?\\" recordings were included on Four Seasons albums, which, in their original releases, made no mention of the name that was created for single release. While \\"Lonesome Road\\" became the last \\"Wonder Who?\\" single, the group continued to release both Four Seasons and Frankie Valli \\"solo\\" singles until 1975, when Valli had recorded \\"Swearin' to God\\" without any participation from the group (his previous hit, \\"My Eyes Adored You\\" was recorded as a Four Seasons recording, but was released as a \\"solo\\" record). Singles by \\"The Wonder Who?\\" All \\"Wonder Who?\\" singles were produced by Bob Crewe.Tom Neely, Goldmine Price Guide to 45 RPM Records, fifth edition (KP Books 2005) Joel Whitburn, Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1993 (Billboard Books 1994) \\"Don't Think Twice\\"/\\"Sassy\\" Philips 40324, released October 1965. \\"Don't Think Twice\\" was originally recorded by composer Bob Dylan (as \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\") on his 1963 album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Peter, Paul, and Mary released the most commercially successful version of the song in September 1963. It reached #9 on the Hot 100 singles chart. The \\"Wonder Who?\\" version peaked at #12 in December 1965. \\"Sassy\\" was an original instrumental by the Four Seasons. Composing credit was given to Bob Gaudio and Bob Crewe. \\"On the Good Ship Lollipop\\"/\\"You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You\\" Philips 40380, released June 1966. Composed by Richard A. Whiting and Sidney Clare, \\"On the Good Ship Lollipop\\" made its debut in the 1934 Shirley Temple motion picture Bright Eyes and is most identified with Temple singing it, but the most successful commercial release of the song was by Rudy Vallee, reaching #4 on the Billboard chart in 1935. The Four Seasons/Wonder Who version barely made a dent on the Hot 100, reaching the #87 position. \\"You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You\\" was another chestnut, having been a hit for Russ Morgan in 1946 and recorded by numerous artists since then. It was composed by Morgan, Larry Stock, and Harry Cavanaugh. When the version credited to \\"The Wonder Who?\\" appeared on the Hot 100 at the #96 position, it marked the only time that two positions were simultaneously occupied by the fictitious group, and only \\"Wonder Who?\\" single that had both sides chart. \\"The Lonesome Road\\"/\\"Around and Around (andaroundandaroundandaroundandaround)\\" Philips 40471, released July 1967. Composed by Gene Austin and Nathaniel Shilkret, \\"Lonesome Road\\" was first recorded by Austin, accompanied by Shilkret directing the Victor Orchestra, in 1927 and has since been recorded by over two hundred famous artists. It was used in five motion pictures, including the motion picture Show Boat. The version by \\"The Wonder Who?\\" reached #89 in its brief appearance on the Hot 100. \\"Around and Around\\" was a Four Seasons original composed by Gaudio and Crewe. While it appeared on this single as a song by \\"The Wonder Who?\\", the same take later appeared on the B-side of the 1968 Four Seasons single \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\" and credited to the group. \\"Peanuts\\"/\\"My Sugar\\" (as The Wonder Who) Vee-Jay 717, released March 1966. Composed by \\"Little Joe\\" Cook, \\"Peanuts\\" was originally a #22 hit for Little Joe and the Thrillers in 1957 (their only chart recording). In January 1963, Vee-Jay Records released a Four Seasons single with \\"Peanuts\\" as the A-side and \\"Stay\\" as the B-side. After various disk jockeys started playing \\"Stay\\" on the radio, Vee-Jay superseded the release, issuing new singles with \\"Stay\\" on the A-side and \\"Goodnight My Love\\" as the B-side. Several subsequent reissues with \\"Peanuts\\" as the A-side failed to sell or chart, including the one \\"credited\\" to \\"The Wonder Who\\" (without the question mark). \\"My Sugar\\" is a Gaudio-Crewe composition that made its first appearance on the 1963 Four Seasons album Big Girls Don't Cry and Twelve Others. This marks the first release of this recording on a Four Seasons (or \\"Wonder Who\\") single.

It was the eighth of the sixty-six Republic serials, the third with a western theme (a third of Republic's serials were westerns) and the last produced in 1937. The serial was directed by William Witney & John English in their first collaboration. The serial starred John Carroll who also sang the title song as a modern descendant of the original Zorro with Carroll stunt doubled by Yakima Canutt. The plot is a fairly standard western storyline about a villain attempting to illicitly take valuable land (in this case a new railroad). The setting is a hybrid of modern (1930s) and western elements that was used occasionally in B-Westerns (such as the western feature films also produced by Republic). It was also the first in a series of five Zorro serials: Zorro's Fighting Legion (1939), Zorro's Black Whip (1944), Son of Zorro (1947) and Ghost of Zorro (1949). Plot In contemporary California, villain J. A. Marsden aims to take over the California-Yucatan Railroad with the aid of his henchman El Lobo. The rightful owners, Joyce and Phillip Andrews, naturally object. Their partner, Don Manuel Vega summons his nephew, James Vega, to help them as he is the great grandson of the original Zorro, Don Diego de la Vega. He is disappointed, however, to find that his nephew is a useless fop. Nevertheless, James Vega installs himself in the original Zorro's hideout and adopts the Zorro identity to defeat Marsden and El Lobo. This Zorro uses twin pistols and a whip as his main weapons of choice, rather than a more traditional sword. Cast *John Carroll as James Vega and his masked alter ego Zorro. Despite being the same character and actor, the secret identity of the title character is extended to the opening credits wherein \\"Zorro\\" and \\"James Vega\\" are credited as separate characters. *Helen Christian as Joyce Andrews *Reed Howes as Phillip Andrews *Duncan Renaldo as Renaldo *Noah Beery, Sr. as J.

It was filmed between 8 September and 5 October 1937. The serial's production number was 423. Zorro Rides Again was influenced by the Singing Cowboy trend of the time. Carroll's \\"best moments\\" in costume were singing (Lyrics include \\"Zorro rides again into the night...\\") It was shot in Cochilla, Mexico and featured other locales such as Bronson Canyon, Iverson Movie Ranch, Red Rock Canyon State Park, Angeles National Forest, and Chatsworth, Los Angeles. Stunts In the opinion of Cline, one of the most memorable stunt scenes in the history of film serials is shown in Zorro Rides Again. Stuntman Yakima Canutt plays Zorro as he gallops up to the cab of a moving truck and swings from the saddle to its running board. Even a small mistake during this sequence would have been lethal for Canutt. Release Theatrical Zorro Rides Again's official release date is 20 November 1937, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to film exchanges. A 68-minute feature film version, created by editing the serial footage together, was released on 22 September 1938 and re-released on 16 January 1959. The feature film had a working title of Mysterious Don Miguel before returning to the original name Zorro Rides Again. This was one of fourteen feature films Republic made from their serials. Television In the early 1950s, Zorro Rides Again was one of fourteen Republic serials edited into a television series. It was broadcast in six 26¬Ω-minute episodes.

Urartian bronzes; bull-headed cauldrons and pottery were excavated in various parts of Etruscan Italy, particularly in Tuscany.K. R. Maxwell-Hyslop, \\"Urartian Bronzes in Etruscan Tombs,\\" Iraq, XVIII (1956) The Roman Republic played a pivotal role in the re-establishment of the Kingdom of Armenia in 189 BC. Antiochus III the Great was defeated at the Battle of Magnesia by the Romans which in turn allowed the Armenian strategoi of Antiochus, Artaxias and Zariadres to take control of an independent Armenian Kingdom. The Romans perceiving themselves as the legitimate successors of the Seleucids began to play a more aggressive role in the affairs of the Hellenistic world of Asia Minor starting with the acquisition of Pergamum in 133 BC. The Third Mithridatic War (75- 65 BC ) led Roman forces for the first time directly to the Armenian border. From that point on until the demise of the Kingdom of Armenia in 428, Rome played a significant role in the affairs of Armenia and Armenians. This article explores the history of that relationship, a relationship which alternated between harmony and conflict. Relations during the Roman Republic Lucius Licinius Lucullus In 72 BC the Pontic king Mithridates VI Eupator abandoned his kingdom after his forces were defeated by the Romans in the Battle of Cabira. He fled eastward seeking protection at the court of his son-in-law Tigranes II the Great in Greater Armenia. The Roman general Lucius Licinius Lucullus sent his legate Appius Claudius to Armenia as an emissary. Tigranes received Appius in Antioch. Tigranes was given an ultimatum: surrender Mithridates or face an all out war with Rome. Tigranes denied the Romans their prize and in 69 BC Lucullus launched the first Roman invasion of Armenia. Tigranes had already faced the Romans in battle when he had attempted to annex Cappadocia and was driven back by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 92 BC, this time he gathered a stronger army backed by Greek mercenaries. The combined forces of Tigranes and Mithridates were defeated at the Battle of Tigranocerta by the Romans and both monarchs fled to Northern Armenia near the Iberian border. Lucullus systematically dissolved the Armenian Empire of Tigranes and freed the enslaved regions that Tigranes had captured from the Parthians. Tigranes attempted to secure an alliance with Phraates III of Parthia but naturally Phraates declined the offer and assumed neutrality for the time being. Parthian reluctance to interfere gave Lucullus the confidence to move ahead and attack the second capital of Tigranes in 68 BC at Artaxata. Following the Battle of Artaxata, Lucullus failed to capture either one of the monarchs yet again. Frustrated because of the rough terrain of Northern Armenia, Lucullus moved back south and plundered Nisibis which was held by the brother of Tigranes. This allowed Mithridates to regroup by raising a small army and slaughtering all the Romans in Pontus (two whole legions at Zela alone under the command of Valerius Trianus), he then awaited Median reinforcements from Tigranes at the citadel of Talaura in Lesser Armenia. Hearing news of this bloodbath, Lucullus ordered his troops to Lesser Armenia but the troops refused and instead agreed to move west and assume a defensive position in Galatia. Pontus and Armenia were now once again under the full control of Mithridates and Tigranes. The Roman Senate, greatly embarrassed by the outcome, voted to recall Lucullus.

It is the longest Saskatchewan Highway, at 809 km (503 mi). The highway is partially divided and undivided. However, only about near Moose Jaw, near Chamberlain, and near Prince Albert are divided highway. Highway 2 is a major north-south route, beginning at the Canada‚ÄìUS border at the Port of West Poplar River, and Opheim, Montana customs checkpoints. Montana Highway 24 continues south. It passes through the major cities of Moose Jaw in the south and Prince Albert in the north. Highway 2 overlaps Highway 11 between the towns of Chamberlain and Findlater. This section of road is a wrong-way concurrency. The highway ends at La Ronge, where it becomes Highway 102. The highway started as a graded road in the 1920s which followed the grid lines of the early survey system and was maintained by early homesteaders of each rural municipality. Paving projects of the 1950s created all weather roads. Technological advances have paved the way for cost-effective methods of improvements to highway surfaces to meet the wear and tear of increased tourist and commercial highway traffic. The stretch of Highway 2 from Moose Jaw to Prince Albert was designated in 2005 as Veterans Memorial Highway. The designation coincided with Veterans Week 2005. The CanAm Highway comprises Saskatchewan Highways 35, 39, 6, 3, and 2. Route description Highway 11-2 intersection Saskatchewan Highway 2 departs the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border in a northerly direction. Montana Highway 24 continues in a southerly direction in the United States. The United States border crossing is in Opheim, Montana and the Canadian is at West Poplar River. Nearby there are campgrounds available, and a point of information regarding the crossing of Poplar River. The area is rich in history, this is the Big Muddy Badlands area which featured the hideouts of outlaws and rum runners of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. This area remained above the Quaternary age ice sheets, being pushed and folded by the glacier movement resulting in glaciotectonic hills. The highway winds up, down and around these hills along the way. The Big Muddy Badlands are within the Missouri Coteau. At km 12 the highway reaches Kildeer, and the intersection with Highway 18. Access to Wood Mountain Post Provincial Historical Park is obtained by following Highway 18 north for . This section of Highway 2 begins as a Class 4 highway and is under the jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation (SHT) South West Transportation Planning Council. The highway is a secondary weight highway with a thin membrane surface type as it only has an average of 390 vehicles per day (vpd) according to the 2007 Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) count which was taken north of Rockglen. Highway 2 begins a concurrency with Highway 18 in a northeasterly direction. Alfalfa and alfalfa mixtures, hay and fodder crops and spring wheat are the main crops in Old Post rural municipality (RM). There is a point of information at km 42. This area is known as the Wood Mountain Uplands where there are mining endeavours undertaken such as coal, bentonite, kaolinitic and ceramic clays. Paleontological digs have uncovered a 63-million-year-old sea turtle which has been excavated in the Killdeer region. Rockglen is located at km 49, and Highway 2 now extends in a northerly direction again. Rockglen (Population 450 in 2001 and 360 in 2006 ) and Assiniboia ( 2,483 in 2001 and 2,305 in 2006 ) are the two largest centers between the border and the city of Moose Jaw. This geographical region of Highway 2 from Rockglen to Assiniboia has been upgraded to a Class 3 highway as it carries approximately 800 vehicles per day counted to the south of Assiniboia. Therefore, the surface type before Assiniboia is a granular road surface which is a structural pavement with a hot mix surface coating. The highway type, surface, maintenance and construction projects are looked after by the SHS South Central Traffic Planning Committee. Fife Lake is located to the north east of the highway. The St. Victor Petroglyph Historic Park is located just to the west of Highway 2 by . These unique petroglyph features carved into the sandstone are slowly disappearing. Assiniboia approach At km 103 is the town of Assiniboia where 1,260 vpd results in the highway designated as an asphalt concrete (AS) Class 2 primary weight highway all the way to Moose Jaw. Junction with Highway 13, the Red Coat Trail occurs at km 103, providing access to Lafleche. Vantage is located to the west of the highway along this stretch, with access provided at km 128. Mossbank is located at the intersection with Highway 718. Here is the southeast portion of Old Wives Lake, which is a part of the Chaplin, Old Wives Lake, Reed Lakes (Hemispheric) - Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) Site, a designated Hemispheric Shorebird Reserve Network, protecting three saline lakes, saline and freshwater marshes. Ardill is located near the northern extremity of Lake of the Rivers. Highway 36 is located at km 175, which provides access to Crestwynd, and the Jean Louis Legare Regional Park. At km 183, is the junction with Highway 716 west providing access to Briercrest. Veteran's Memorial Highway Between Moose Jaw and Chamberlain runs through the Qu'Appelle Valley across Buffalo Pound Lake. The home of the Snowbirds, the Canadian Forces 431 Air Demonstration Squadron is at CFB Moose Jaw, Bushell Park at the km 202 junction with Highway 363. Before entering the city of Moose Jaw is an divided or twinned highway section. Highway 2 becomes an urban couplet for 1km before going through the centre of the city. Moose Jaw, a city of 32,132 features large roadside attractions such as Capone's Car, Moose Family and Mac the moose. Temple Gardens Mineral Spa Resort, Tunnels of Moose Jaw, and History of Transportation Western Development Museum. are major sites of interest of this city. The Saskatchewan Highway 1 intersection with Highway 2 is north of Moose Jaw. At km 226, access to Buffalo Pound Provincial Park is provided to the east of Highway 2 by traveling another . Access to the small town of Tuxford is provided at km 230, at the Highway 42 junction. The SHS Central Area Transportation Planning Committee monitors this primary weight highway between Moose Jaw and Meacham. Between the two national highway systems of the Trans Canada Saskatchewan Highway 1 and Saskatchewan Highway 11, Highway 2 is also designated as a Class 1 AC national connector highway. There is a point of information on the south side of the Qu'Appelle Valley while second point of information is on the northern bank of the Qu'Appelle Valley. Buffalo Pound Lake, a eutrophic prairie lake was formed by glaciation 10,000 years ago. At the junction of highway 11, is the town of Chamberlain where the highway which travels north begins a southeast wrong-way concurrency at Chamberlain. Where these two national highways overlap, a divided highway segment handles the AADT which is about 4500 vpd. There is a rest area south of Chamberlain with an historical marker. To the west of the highway are afforded views of the Arm River valley. At km 275, the highway takes a sharp turn to continue north as it leaves the Highway 11 concurrency. After the concurrency, Highway 2 is a class 3 AC primary weight highway until Watrous. The junction of Highway 733 in provides access to Last Mountain Lake (Long Lake) traveling east. Holdfast is accessed at the Highway 732 junction. Penzance is east of the highway at km 305; Liberty is a small community at km 314. Located near Stalwart is the Stalwart National Wildlife Area, a wetlands region. Watertown (1903‚Äì1910) provides easy access to Etter's Beach on Long Lake. The settlers of Watertown established a post office named Harkness Post Office, Assiniboia, North West Territories. With the arrival of the rail, the village became known as Imperial. The town of Imperial is the largest center west of Last Mountain Lake with a population around 300 and an AADT of close to 650 vpd. The village of Simpson is also along the highway which runs parallel to Last Mountain Lake. There are several roadside turnouts to access Last Mountain Lake from Highway 2. The Last Mountain Lake Sanctuary was the first federal bird sanctuary. Highway 15 provides access to Nokomis to the east, and Kenaston to the west. Tuxford signage The small hamlet of Amazon is located before Watrous. Watrous is a tourist destination due to its proximity to Manitou Beach and the ehdorheic Little Manitou Lake. Watrous, in the Land of Living Waters, is a tourist destination due to its proximity to Manitou Beach, home of the world-famous Mineral Spa and Danceland dance hall (known as the \\"Home of the World Famous Dance Floor Built on Horsehair\\"). The AADT near this tourist town of 1,800 people raises to about 1,250 vpd which ranks it as a class 2 highway. Highway 2 continues in a northwest direction to circumnavigate around Little Manitou until it gets to the Young and the junction of Highway 670. Young and Zelma were two communities that were part of the alphabet railway of the Canadian National Railway (CNR). The Yellowhead Highway is at km 419. Colonsay is located to the west, and Plunkett to the east. Colonsay is the location of one of several potash mines in Saskatchewan, a major employer of the region. Potash evaporites were laid down during the geological formation of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. The SHS North Central Transportation Planning Committee tends to highway maintenance and construction decisions north of the Yellowhead highway. Highway 2 from the Yellowhead through to Prince Albert is a class 2 primary weight AC highway. Over 1,000 vehicles travel Highway 2 between Watrous and Meacham, and of these less than 100 of them are trucks. The majority of commercial trucks near the Highway 2 and 5 intersection travel Highway 5. The AADT after the intersection is under 350 vpd. Highway 5 provides access to the city of Saskatoon, the largest city in the province. There is a concurrency between Highway 5 and 2 upon which there are close to 2,000 vpd. Highway 5 east provides access to the city of Humboldt. Meacham at km 435 is located in the Aspen Parkland ecoregion. Throughout the Aspen Parkland ecoregion are trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides ) bluffs (small islands or shelter belts) within the prairie region. Deer and other large ungulates are a hazard to traffic resulting in potential animal or human deaths, especially in the autumn mating months or when deer are searching for feeding grounds in the spring. The defense mechanism of deer in the face of a threat is to freeze. There are over 3,500 deer - auto collisions per year in Saskatchewan. A number of measures have been implemented to increase awareness such as fencing, feeding programs, automobile whistles. Deer mirrors along the edges of highways were installed for reducing deer-vehicle collisions. The Wildlife Warning System is triggered by highway vehicles, setting off lights, sounds and or odours ahead of the approaching vehicle to frighten away animals. Some systems that detect vehicles, where others detect large animals and sets off a warning system to drivers of vehicles alerting them that an animal is on or near the highway ahead of time. The junction with Highway 27 occurs at km 460 providing access west to the village of Prud'homme and off to the east is Muskiki Lake. Cudworth is located at the Highway 777 intersection, bearing east on highway 777 provides access to Middle Lake. The intersection of Highway 41 is located at Wakaw, which features a golf course, campground and recreation site at Wakaw Lake. The community considered a proposal to construct a canal between the lake and the town to be developed into a marina - resort - tourism area. Traffic around this tourist town of 864 increases between 650 and 1050 vpd. Two way highway ends near Chamberlain At the junction of Highway 25 is the town of St. Louis where there is a historical paranormal phenomenon called the St. Louis Light or the St. Louis Ghost Train. Domremy, located at the junction of Highway 320 and Highway 225, constructed a park to commemorate the province's centennial celebrations. Highway 225 provides access to the Batoche National Historical Site, which was the site of the last stand of Metis rights activist Louis Riel prior to his subsequent trial and death in 1885. St. Louis was recently the site of the discoveryBridge project leads to archaeological find of a large archaeological siteThe St. Louis archeological find discussed. of aboriginal artifacts.Press release and additional details regarding the archeological find Arm River Rest Area The South Saskatchewan River is crossed at this point via the St. Louis Bridge. Traffic around St. Louis averaged about 1,500 and escalates to 6,000 after the junction with the Highway 11, the Louis Riel Trail occurs just south of Prince Albert at km 553. CanAm Highway Highway 3 joins with Highway 2 at km 559, becoming a concurrency for After crossing the North Saskatchewan River the concurrency of Highway 2 and 3 end at the interchange with Highway 55. There is an divided or twinned highway segment north of Prince Albert. Highway 2 continues northward as an AC primary weight CanAm international highway from this point northward taking over from the highway 3 segment. Prince Albert, a city of over 34,000, is a part of the boreal transition ecoregion, agricultural fields and forested areas border the highway rural areas. At km 581, Highway 2 meets with the intersection of Highway 355. To the northwest of this intersection is Little Red River Indian Reserve 106C and Montreal Lake 106B Indian Reserves. Christopher Lake is at the km 594 junction of Highway 791 east and Highway 263 west. Highway 263 provides access to the Prince Albert National Park. Junction 42 Chamberlain ahead Saskatchewan Highway 2 (north); Central Butte turn left, (West) Saskatchewan Highway 42 Road Signage. This ecoregion is a part of the mid-boreal upland. At km 634, Highway 2 meets with Highway 264 which provides access to Waskesiu Lake in the Prince Albert National Park. At km 648 there is an intersection with Highway 969, another access to the Park westerly, and eastern access to Montreal Lake 106 Indian Reserve. There are fewer roads in the southern boreal forest. Highway 2 makes the next highway connection at km 680 with Highway 916. There are over 10,000 lakes across Saskatchewan, with the main lake region being north of the tree line in the Canadian Shield. Montreal Lake is located west of Highway 2, its northern shores near Weyakwin at km 704, then at km 746 Highway 2 meets with Highway 165 which travels north to Morin Lake 217 Indian Reserve. Lac la Ronge 156 Indian Reserve is at km 798 before the ending terminus in the northern boreal forest at La Ronge and the junction with Highway 102. History From 1876, the South Saskatchewan river crossing at St. Louis was via ferry. In 1912, the railway built a rail bridge across the river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was constructed south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse scrapers and walking plows were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received an improvement in 1926 which then used an elevating grader, 16 horses and a dump wagon. The Saskatchewan Highway Act was established in 1922, in compliance with the 1919 Canadian highway act. At the initial stages of the Saskatchewan Highway Act, of highway were gravel and the rest were earth roads. The road allowances were laid out as a part of the Dominion Land survey system for homesteading. In 1929, the R.M. of Wood Creek #281 conducted roadwork with three graders, 53 slush scrapers, 15 wheel scrapers and five ploughs. Development of highways began in the 1920s and was virtually halted in the depression years of the 1930s. Early homesteaders, such as John Abrey, would do road maintenance work themselves in this era. In the 1930s seeing a car was rare, Alexander Black remembers taking 150 bushels on a grain tank with a four horse hitch. When they reached highway 2, the horses bolted through town until they snagged on the railway switch by the elevators. Travel along the Provincial Highway 5 before the 1940s would have been traveling on the square following the township road allowances, barbed wire fencing and rail lines. As the surveyed township roads were the easiest to travel, the first highway was designed on 90-degree, right-angle corners as the distance traversed the prairie along range roads and township roads. The two industrial revolutions first and second combined with advancements made during the war years resulted in the largest impetus in highway construction of all weather roads following World War II. The creation of the highway south of Chamberlain to Moose Jaw was completed in 1953. Paving projects followed within a short time period. In 1955 parts of Highway 2 were already paved; Between Vantage and Tuxford, either side of Moose Jaw; north of Watrous along the Little Manitou Lake shoreline; and north of the junction with Highway 27 to Montreal Lake, either side of Prince Albert. In 1956 a North-South International Highway proposal regarding a highway between El Paso, Texas, and LaRonge via Wakaw was discussed. The CanAm Highway northern segment into La Ronge finished construction in 1977; however, the CanAm didn't go through Wakaw, rather it comprised several different routes making the CanAm. Highway 2, which does go through Wakaw, does link to the CanAm highway at Prince Albert when Highway 2 becomes the last portion of the CanAm highway. In 1952, Highway 2 was re-routed; rather than winding its way through the town of Wakaw, the highway's new route went straight along the western limit of town. Agriculture is Saskatchewan's main industry and taking grain to elevators was first accomplished by horse and cart, to be replaced around World War I by truck travel. Long haul trucking flourished between 1950 and 1970. Since the 1970s, 17 times the number of grain trucks and 95 percent of goods transported now are hauled by truck across the Saskatchewan. In 1999, the granular pavement section of Highway 2 south of Watrous was tested with a cold in-place recycling or ‚ÄúCIR‚Äù method to rehabilitate highways. This CIR process is a cost-effective method which recycles the top surface of a road. This pulverized material is mixed with asphalt emulsion and spread and compacted back onto the highway surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume. In 2001, were resurfaced near the Cudworth access road, as well km north of the Highway 27 junction. \\"Highway 2 near Cudworth has seen an increase in truck traffic that is leading to deterioration on this highway...It's important to keep our highways in good driving condition to ensure the safety of the travelling public.\\" -Highways and Transportation Minister Maynard Sonntag. As recently as 2002, this section of Highway 2 was improved south of the Yellowhead. At km 398 is access to Zelma. 'Highway 2 has seen an increase in truck traffic, leading to wear and tear on this highway...We are paving a section of this highway as it has deteriorated over the past number of years. Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation is working hard to fix roads across the province to improve driver safety. - \\" Highways and Transportation Minister Mark Wartman Veterans Memorial Highway Veterans Memorial Highway is the official name of Highway 2 between Moose Jaw and Prince Albert.Sk Hwy 2 at Buffalo Pound Lake As a tribute to Saskatchewan veterans, Premier Lorne Calvert, Highways and Transportation Minister Eldon Lautermilch and Past Provincial President of the Royal Canadian Legion, Saskatchewan Command, John Henderson together unveiled the new highway sign on November 10, 2005. The ceremony was held during veteran's week, November 5‚Äì11th, and also commemorates The Year of the Veteran, 2005. The highway designation coincides with Veterans Week (November 5‚Äì11) and was one of several significant honours bestowed to veterans in 2005, The Year of the Veteran. The Year of the Veteran commemorates the 60th Anniversary of the end of the World War II. The Royal Canadian Legion, Saskatchewan Command and Saskatchewan Remembers Committee came together to select this particular highway of Saskatchewan because of the history of a military presence along the route. Royal Canadian Legion branches are located at Moose Jaw, Penance - Holdfast, Young - Zelma, Watrous, Simpson, and Prince Albert. A military history museum is located at the Watrous, as well military memorabilia is held at Prince Albert Royal Canadian Legion branch. Moose Jaw Royal Canadian Air Force RCAF and 15 Wing military base is located south- southwest of Moose Jaw. CanAm Highway The northern of Saskatchewan Highway 2 contribute to the CanAm Highway. The Highway 2 segment designated as the CanAm Highway is located between Prince Albert and La Ronge. Hwy 2 at Bethune Lake dam of the Qu'Appelle River The entire length of the CanAm Highway route is and extends from El Paso, TX at Mexican Border (MX 45) to La Ronge at the Saskatchewan Highway 2 - SK 102 intersection. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) super corridors connect Mexico, United States, and Canada. The CanAm highway was a concept that began in the 1920s. A stretch of highway between Amazon and Watrous is slated for maintenance between 208 and 2009, as well as the Highway 5 - Highway 2 concurrency which carries about 2,000 vpd on average through the year. Also the segment between Highways 264 and 969 is a 2008-09 maintenance project. Major intersections From south to north.

Howard featuring Conan the Cimmerian, a fragment begun in the 1930s but not finished or published in Howard's lifetime. It is a peripheral story in the canon in that while it takes place in Conan's \\"Hyborian Age\\" and during Conan's lifetime, Conan does not actually appear, but is merely mentioned. The story was completed by L. Sprague de Camp and in this form first published in the collection Conan the Usurper (1967). It has since been published in its original form in the collection The Conan Chronicles Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon (Gollancz, 2001) and Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932-1933) (Del Rey, 2003). Plot summary (From the Conan The Usurper version, ) Set during the time of Conan's conquest of Aquilonia, the foreword and story refer to ongoing battles between the armies of Conan and King Numedides. The Picts see an opportunity, however. Narrated by the son of a border ranger named Gault Hagar, his father witnesses a secret Pictish ceremony conducted by Tenayoga, a Ligurean shaman, and Lord Valerian, an Aquilonian nobleman. Gault travels to Fort Kwanyara, near the village of Schondara, where he meets an old friend, exchanges news on Conan's forces, and discover Lord Valerian's treachery. Valerian avoids his imprisonment by fleeing into the Pictish Wilderness. Gault escapes his encounter with a giant ape and follows Valerian to a nearby cabin, where he spies on Valerian's meeting with Tenayoga and his band of Gunderman guards. The leaders of four Pictish tribes plan on joining forces and consult a wizard in their swamp. Gault, Hakon, and their rangers attack the cabin, setting it alight. The two rangers track those who escaped the carnage into a swamp and are soon captured. The tribes agree on raiding Schondara first and quickly depart, leaving their captives bound to stakes. Gault escapes his bonds, slays the wizard, and the pair are just in time to sabotage the Pictish assault while being declared as heroes. The atmosphere of the story is reminiscent of the American Frontier, and that the plot could have been easily transferred to that environment, with Aquilonian settlers as early Americans and Picts as Indians. Indeed, Howard did effect such a transformation with the preceding Conan story, \\"The Treasure of Tranicos\\", which is set in the same Pictish environment: failing to find a publisher, he did transfer the story to a historical American background. Adaptation The story was first adapted by Roy Thomas and Ernie Chan in Savage Sword of Conan #59The Savage Sword of Conan #59 (in comicvine.com) and then in 2005-2006 by Timothy Truman and Tomas Giorello for Dark Horse Comics.

The point was established in Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works.[1943] 2 All ER 560 (CA) The judgment in Carltona Faced with the requisition of their factory by the war-time government, the factory owners raised a judicial review action to challenge the legality of the requisition order. The order had been made under the auspices of the Defence (General) Regulations 1939, which authorised the Commissioners of Works to requisition such land as they deemed necessary in the national interest. The Regulations specified that the Commissioner's powers were exercisable by, inter alia the Minister of Works and Planning. The factory owners sought to argue that the requisition was invalid because the order had not in fact been signed by the minister, but by an official within the Ministry of Works and Planning. In rejecting this contention, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Greene, acknowledged the realities of government in the 20th century: This statement of the way government operates has only become more true in recent decades as increased state interventionism and juridification have produced a rapid growth in the use of delegated legislation. Clearly, confronted with this reality, it would have been preposterous for the court to construe the wording of the Regulations so narrowly that only the minister, in person, could exercise the powers. Thus Lord Greene explained that, \\"Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister.\\" The essence of the Carltona doctrine therefore lies in the elision of the identity of departmental officials with the relevant minister. It is not the case that the minister has delegated his decision-making power to a subordinate and therefore the doctrine achieves consistency with the principle that Parliament's delegatees have, unless specifically provided by statute, no power to delegate (delegatus non potest delegare). Lord Greene proceeded to reconcile this with the doctrine of parliamentary accountability on the basis that: Scope of the rule Despite suggestions to the contrary by some academic commentators,De Smith, Woolf and Jowell Judicial Review of Administrative Action (5th edn.) para. 6-114 it seems that there is no restriction on the applicability of the doctrine on account of the nature of the power being wielded. In HMA v. Copeland1988 SLT 249 it was opined, by the highest criminal court in Scotland that: \\"... there is no obligation on the minister to exercise his powers personally even when those powers involve a serious invasion of the freedom or property rights of the subject.\\" However, in some instances Parliament has chosen to statutorily override this position by providing that the relevant minister must exercise the power in person.Cf. s.60(9)(a) Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (c.33) (\\"and not by a person acting under his authority\\") Modern development The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom dealt with the application of the Carltona doctrine in R v Adams, 2020 UKSC 19.[2020 UKSC 19] In 1973, Gerry Adams, a Northern Irish politician, was detained without trial by an interim custody order made under Article 4 of the Detention of Terrorists (Northern Ireland) Order 1972. It was later revealed that the Order required the Secretary of State to have considered the matter personally. Adams challenged the validity of the decision, arguing that the Secretary of State had failed to do so. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the Carltona principle operated to permit the making of such an Order by a Minister of State (para 8). Lord Kerr, delivering a unanimous judgment, held that the wording of the 1972 Order was clear to exclude the application of the Carltona doctrine (paras 31-32). Besides, in light of the seriousness of the consequences of the decision, the decision ought to be made by the Secretary of State personally (para 38). There was also no evidence that it would create an undue burden on the Secretary of State (para 39). As to whether there is a general presumption in law that Carltona doctrine shall apply, Lord Kerr suggested that: Daly has suggested that the above quotation is merely \\"obiter\\" and a misunderstanding of the law. The Carltona doctrine merely reflects the constitutional reality that ministers act through their civil servants. The case itself broke no new ground and merely applied the established principles.Daly, P., 2020. Escape from Carltona? R v Adams [2020] UKSC 19.

It lies within a right triangle bordered by Dyer Street on the east, the Patriot Freeway (U.S. Route 54) on the west, and Hondo Pass Avenue on the north. Dominated by apartment complexes and older duplexes or single-family homes with a high poverty rate among its residents, and once notorious for crime, drug trafficking and prostitution, it was known as the Devil's Triangle before being officially renamed at a meeting of its residents in the 1990s. and is still sometimes referred to as such, or as the Triangle. The neighborhood's commercial portion is along its eastern and northern edges, on Dyer and on Hondo Pass, respectively; there is almost no business development along Gateway North Boulevard at the western edge of the Angel's Triangle.  Demographics  According to the 2000 census, many residents of the area faced poverty, with 65 percent living below the poverty level. Around 1,800 children under 18 lived in Angel's Triangle in 2000.  History  Angel's Triangle was originally nicknamed the \\"Devil's Triangle\\" because of the shape of the area and the high crime rate. In the early 1990s, the area experienced high rates of drug dealing, prostitution and gang violence. In 1993, a group was formed by Mr. and Mrs. Luis Aguilera called the Angel's Triangle Association (ATA) which had been identifying community needs for the area. Also in response to crime in the area, police officers led by officer Raul Prieto, decided to implement a program to improve the safety of the neighborhood. This community policing effort was funded by grants under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. The program involved training officers and the community alike to start referring to the neighborhood as the Angel's Triangle, and involved community participation in neighborhood clean-ups. Within three years of implementing the program, there was a 35% decrease in all crimes in the area. The programs enacted in the 90s have helped the neighborhood feel safer, but it still remained a high-crime area in 2003. By 2010, residents reported feeling safe, despite the run-down look the area still had.  Education  It lies within the El Paso Independent School District and is zoned to Irvin High School and Canyon Hills Middle School; most of it is zoned to Moye Elementary School located just outside the neighborhood to the east, except for the northernmost part, from Maxwell Avenue north to Hondo Pass Avenue, which is zoned to Whitaker Elementary School. Wainwright Elementary School, opened in 1949, closed in 2005, and since used by El Paso ISD as a science center, is located in Angel's Triangle; for many years and for some time after its closure its student clinic also served neighborhood residents who did not attend the school. Part of its playground has been leased to the city of El Paso as a neighborhood park; the only other park in the neighborhood is Wellington Chew Park on Maxwell Avenue off Gateway North, which has a senior citizens' center.

From 2001 to 2016, together with Hans Melzer, he was the German Three Day Eventing National Team Trainer. Chris is the brother of Jane Bartle-Wilson, who was also an Olympian in the '84 Los Angeles Olympics. Early years Chris Bartle was educated at Ampleforth College and at the University of Bristol where he obtained a BSc (Econ) with honours in Economics. After university Chris was an amateur jockey, but being 5 ft 11, struggled to keep his weight down in order to establish himself. This prompted his first spell in three-day eventing. He was initially trained by his mother, Mrs Nicole Bartle and then later by Hans von Blixen-Finecke, Jr., who was double gold medalist at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics in Three Day Eventing. Competitor Dressage While preparing for the 1976 Burghley Horse Trials Bartle's horse, Wily Trout, picked up a tendon injury that forced the horse into retirement from eventing. However, Wily Trout showed potential in dressage. One year later Bartle was competing at the World Championships as an individual. The combination went on to become part of the British Dressage Team from 1981‚Äì1987. In this time Bartle competed at the '84 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles for the British team. The team came 8th, but Chris Bartle tied for 6th in the individual event to make history by becoming the highest placed British rider, a record he still held as of January 2011. Chris and Wily Trout's last major contribution in dressage came when they were placed 2nd at the first Dressage World Cup Final in 's-Hertogenbosch 1986. This period was capped off when Bartle was awarded the British Equestrian Federation's Medal of Honour in 1986. Three Day Eventing Bartle then took the opportunity to turn back to eventing and had a whole host of successes which included winning team Gold at the 1997 European Championships with the British Event Team, before winning the prestigious Badminton Horse Trials in 1998, on Word Perfect II, owned by Elaine and Adrian Cantwell.Murphy \\"Bartle finds right lines\\" The Independent He also travelled with Word Perfect to the Sydney Olympics in 2000, as reserve.

She is thought to be one of the first African American women to become a millionaire. In the first three decades of the 20th century, she founded and developed a large and prominent commercial and educational enterprise centered on cosmetics for African- American women.  Early life  Annie Minerva Turnbo was born in Metropolis, Illinois, the daughter of Robert and Isabella Turnbo, who may have been former slaves. When her father went off to fight for the Union with the 1st Kentucky Cavalry in the Civil War, Isabella took the couple's children and escaped from Kentucky, a neutral border state that maintained slavery. After traveling down the Ohio River, she found refuge in Metropolis, Illinois. Annie Turnbo was born on a farm near Metropolis in Massac County, Illinois.,Trout, Carlynn, \\"Annie Turnbo Malone\\", AAUW Columbia (MO) Branch. Accessed November 1, 2012. the tenth of eleven children. Orphaned at a young age, she attended a public school in Metropolis, before moving in 1896 to live with her older sister Ada Moody in Peoria. There Turnbo attended high school, taking particular interest in chemistry. However, due to frequent illness, she was forced to withdraw from classes. While out of school, Turnbo grew so fascinated with hair and hair care that she often practiced hairdressing with her sister.Quintana, Maria, \\"Remembered and Reclaimed\\", BlackPast. Accessed November 17, 2012. With expertise in both chemistry and hair care, Turnbo began to develop her own hair-care products.Carney, Jessie. Epic Lives: One Hundred Black Women Who Made a Difference, New York, New York: Visible Inc Press, 1993, p. 363. At the time, many women used goose fat, heavy oils, soap, or bacon grease to straighten their curls, which damaged both scalp and hair.  Career  By the beginning of the 1900s, Turnbo moved with her older siblings to Lovejoy, now known as Brooklyn, Illinois. While experimenting with hair and different hair- care products, she developed and manufactured her own line of non-damaging hair straighteners, special oils, and hair-stimulant products for African- American women.Houston, Helen R., \\"Annie Turnbo Malone\\", in The American Mosaic: The African American Experience, ABC-CLIO, 2010. Accessed November 29, 2012. She named her new product ‚ÄúWonderful Hair Grower‚Äù. To promote her new product, Turnbo sold the Wonderful Hair Grower in bottles door-to-door. Her products and sales began to revolutionize hair-care methods for all African Americans. In 1902, Turnbo moved to a thriving St. Louis, where she and three hired assistants sold her hair-care products door-to-door. As part of her marketing, she gave away free treatments to attract more customers. Due to the high demand for her product in St. Louis, Turnbo opened her first shop in 1902 at 2223 Market Street. She also launched a wide advertising campaign in the black press, held news conferences, toured many southern states, and recruited many women whom she trained to sell her products. One of her selling agents, Sarah Breedlove Davis, later known as Madam C. J. Walker, operated first in St. Louis and later in Denver, Colorado until a disagreement led Walker to leave the company. Walker took the original Poro formula and created her own brand of it. This development was one of the reasons which led then Turnbo to copyright her products under the name \\"Poro\\" because of what she called fraudulent imitations and to discourage counterfeit versions. Poro may have received this name from a Mende word for devotional society or it may be a combination of the married names of Annie Pope and her sister Laura Roberts. Due to the growth in her business, in 1910 Turnbo moved to a larger facility on 3100 Pine Street. In 1918, she established Poro College, a cosmetology school and center. The building included a manufacturing plant, a retail store where Poro products were sold, business offices, a 500-seat auditorium, dining and meeting rooms, a roof garden, dormitory, gymnasium, bakery, and chapel. It served the African-American community as a center for religious and social functions. The college's curriculum addressed the whole student; students were coached on personal style for work: on walking, talking, and a style of dress designed to maintain a solid persona.\\"Annie Malone\\", Living St. Louis Story, KETC-9. Poro College employed nearly 200 people in St. Louis. Through its school and franchise businesses, the college created jobs for almost 75,000 women in North and South America, Africa and the Philippines. By the 1920s, Annie Turnbo Malone had become a multi-millionaire. In 1924 she paid income tax of nearly $40,000, reportedly the highest in Missouri. While extremely wealthy, Malone lived modestly, giving thousands of dollars to the local black YMCA and the Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, DC. She also donated money to the St. Louis Colored Orphans Home, where she served as president on the board of directors from 1919 to 1943. With her help, in 1922 the Home bought a facility at 2612 Goode Avenue (which was renamed Annie Malone Drive in her honor). Annie Malone, 1921 The Orphans Home is located in the historic Ville neighborhood. Upgraded and expanded, the facility was renamed in the entrepreneur's honor as the Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center. As well as funding many programs, Turnbo Malone ensured that her employees, all African American, were paid well and given opportunities for advancement.Osbourne, E., \\"Notable Careers of Prof. And Mrs. A. E. Malone,\\" The Washington Bee, August 31, 1918, II. Her business thrived until 1927, when her husband filed for divorce. Having served as president of the company, he demanded half of the business' value, based on his claim that his contributions had been integral to its success. The divorce suit forced Poro College into a court-ordered receivership. With support from her employees and powerful figures such as Mary McLeod Bethune, she negotiated a settlement of $200,000. This affirmed her as the sole owner of Poro College, and the divorce was granted. After the divorce, Turnbo moved most of her business to Chicago's South Parkway, where she bought an entire city block. Other lawsuits followed. In 1937, during the Great Depression, a former employee filed suit, also claiming credit for Poro's success. To raise money for the settlement, Turnbo Malone sold her St. Louis property. Although much reduced in size, her business continued to thrive.  Personal life  In 1903 she married Nelson Pope; the couple had divorced by 1907.Diploma Day at Poro College, 1920 On April 28, 1914, Annie Turnbo married Aaron Eugene Malone, a former teacher and religious book salesman. Turnbo Malone, by then worth well over a million dollars, built a five-story multipurpose facility.  Death and legacy  Turnbo was named an honorary member of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority and was awarded an honorary degree from Howard University. On May 10, 1957, Annie Turnbo suffered a stroke and died at Chicago's Provident Hospital. Childless, she had bequeathed her business and remaining fortune to her nieces and nephews. At the time of her death, her estate was valued at $100,000. St. Louis has an annual Annie Malone parade in support of children's charities.  In media  A fictionalized version of Malone is portrayed by British actress Carmen Ejogo in the 2020 Netflix miniseries Self Made. In this version, the character is renamed Addie Munroe. Turnbo is featured in Bayer Mack's 2019 documentary, No Lye: An American Beauty Story, that chronicles the rise and decline of the black-owned ethnic beauty industry.

According to owner Bob Taylor, \\"If I had to pick the artist who most represented the Taylor Guitars brand and who has done the most for us, I would say Doyle Dykes. Doyle has represented Taylor Guitars to more players for more years than anyone.\\" The Doyle Dykes Signature Model Taylor guitar (‚ÄúDDSM‚Äù) features an amplification system by L.R. Baggs. On December 23, 2004, Dykes had an operation on a brain tumor in which the surgeon compressed his brain. The operation left him with a temporary loss of balance (meaning he had to learn to walk again) and suffered from extreme headaches and nausea for several years afterwards and ultimately left him deaf in his right ear.Dykes (2011), p.197-8 He and his wife, Rita, a high school sweetheart, have been married for at least 37 years and have four children, including daughters named Holly, Heidi and Hayley and a son named Caleb, also an accomplished guitarist. He has resided for many years in the Nashville area and is a close friend of Duane Eddy. Dykes is an avid collector of old Western movies, including the films of John Wayne, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and Steve McQueen.Dykes (2011), p.221 In 2011 he released a book The Lights of Marfa, a semi-autobiographical book documenting his encounters with God, with numerous Christian references to events in his own life.

Wateree was built at Chester, Pennsylvania, by Reaney, Son & Archbold; launched on 12 August 1863; and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 20 January 1864, Comdr. F. E. Murray in command. Service history Assigned to the Pacific Squadron, Wateree departed Philadelphia soon after commissioning. During the next 10 months, she made the arduous voyage around Cape Horn to the Pacific Ocean. In addition to struggling against the heavy weather for which the Cape region is noted, the warship experienced difficulty acquiring fuel. That problem necessitated her making numerous stops along the way to acquire wood for her boilers; and, as a result, Wateree did not reach San Francisco, until mid-November 1864. Upon her arrival there, the ship entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs to damage she suffered during her arduous voyage and for a hull scraping. She did not leave San Francisco until late February 1865 when she put to sea to patrol the coast of Central America. During 1866, American naval forces in the Pacific were divided into a North Pacific Squadron and a South Pacific Squadron. Wateree was assigned to the latter unit, whose patrol area extended south from Panama to Cape Horn and west to Australia. For the remaining two years of her brief naval career, Wateree patrolled the coasts of Central and South America, protecting American interests in that region. Wateree was enforcing the Monroe Doctrine following the 14 January 1866 Peruvian declaration of war against Spain, and moved south to Arica, Peru (which would later become part of Chile) to avoid a yellow fever epidemic in Callao. The 1868 Arica earthquake struck the city while Wateree was in port on 13 August 1868. Wateree observed dust from the earthquake and collapsing buildings at 17:20, but the sea remained calm as she sent a boat ashore to offer medical assistance. After the boats were ashore, a series of ten tsunamis struck. The first inward surge reached above the high tide line, and all ships anchored in the harbor went aground in the following outward flow. The following inward flow created a wave which snapped anchor chains and carried Wateree inland 3 miles (5 km) north of Arica at 19:20. The accompanying store ship USS Fredonia was destroyed, drowning all but two enlisted men and three officers who were on shore. However, on the Wateree the boatswain ashore was the only casualty. Wateree was intact and upright, and her crew provided stores and aid to the civilian population of Arica. The ship was considered too far inland to be salvaged, and was sold for $2,775 to Mr. William Parker on 21 November 1868. Her hulk was used as an emergency hospital, an inn, a hospital again, and finally a warehouse. She was eventually completely destroyed by another tsunami on 9 May 1877. Remains The remains of the Wateree's boilers on the shore north of Arica. Today all that remains are parts of her boilers, mounted on the shore north of the present town of Arica, and maintained as a National Monument of Chile.

Released in 1981 before an official version of Pac-Man was available, it was widely lauded by reviewers, and became a major seller. The story of its creation and Harris's Atari 8-bit implementation of Frogger form a portion of Steven Levy's 1984 book, Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution. Jawbreaker was ported to the Apple II in 1981 and Harris's different take on the game for the Atari 2600 was released the following year. Legal issues resulted in the 2600 port being the template for subsequent versions--for the Commodore 64 and Texas Instruments TI-99/4A--and sold confusingly as both Jawbreaker and Jawbreaker II. Failed licensing and litigation In 1982, the initial Atari 800 version of Jawbreaker was so faithful to Pac-Man that the game (carelessly leaked by Harris himself) was assumed to be from Atari, Inc. (licensee for Pac-Man's home rights) itself. When one of these early copies found its way to Atari, they reached out to On-Line's Ken Williams. Attempts at a deal fell apart due to culture clashes between Atari and On-Line, particularly Williams and Harris. Williams instructed Harris to alter the artwork for the game to have a dental theme.Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, Steven Levy Atari unsuccessfully sought an injunction against the sale of Jawbreaker and Gobbler, another On-Line computer game, which Atari claimed unduly resembled Pac-Man, and cited early leaked copies. Williams denied Atari's claim but was uncertain of the outcome, stating \\"If this opens the door to other programmers ripping off my software, what happened here was a bad thing\\". Legacy Because of technical limitations, Atari 2600 Jawbreaker is not a Pac-Man clone and is different than the Atari 8-bit game. A rough sketch of the 2600 game was used as the basis for new computer versions from programmers other than Harris. The new game was, confusingly, sold as both Jawbreaker and Jawbreaker II and was not as successful as original. Reception John Anderson reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"As for the graphics and sound, when I first saw the program, I could not bring myself to believe the game was not written by Atari. It is not only truly addictive, but also \\"paced\\"--that is, you get tougher, the enemy gets tougher, Four stars to this one.\\" Jawbreaker was well received by critics and it was given the award for \\"Best Computer Action Game\\" in 1982 at the 3rd annual Arkie Awards. Arkie Award judges described the game as \\"a must for 'Pac Man' fans lucky enough to own an Atari 400 or 800 computer,\\" and specifically praised the game's music (a chiptune version of \\"The Candy Man\\"). In 1983, Softline readers named Jawbreaker second on its Top Thirty list of Atari 8-bit programs by popularity, behind only Star Raiders. The magazine called the game \\"a very clean, fast-action game with little sophistication\\", citing its \\"clean, fast, and cheerful\\" graphics and consistent gameplay across platforms, including the Atari 2600. David H. Ahl of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games said of Jawbreaker and Snack Attack, \\"for PacMan fans, either is recommended\\".

Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts Greenfuel ceased operations on May 13, 2009 after having raised more than $70 million in investments, citing economic circumstances, and having run out of funds. History The GFT President, Chief Technology Officer and the inventor of a newly patented system for growing pollution-digesting algae inexpensively on an industrial scale is Isaac Berzin, who founded the company in April, 2001. Time Magazine included Berzin in its list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. A beta emission reduction system was installed at an MIT cogeneration facility in 2004 and after performing beyond expectations was moved to a larger power plant in fall 2005. Pilot units were tested at power plants in Arizona, Massachusetts and New York. Although the algal biomass produced by the process consists of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates which could be used to produce a variety of products, GFT seems to be focusing on biofuel products. GreenFuel's large scale algae to biofuel process at the Arizona Public Service Redhawk power facility won the 2006 Platts Emissions Energy Project of the Year Award.Platts 2006 Global Energy Awards In November 2006 Arizona Public Service Company (APS) announced that it and its partner GreenFuel Technologies will attempt to replicate their success of creating biofuels from algae grown using carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a power plant. In 2007, the company had to shut down its third-generation bioreactor facility in Arizona after the plant produced more algae than the company‚Äôs equipment could handle. At the same time, the company learned that its algae harvesting system would cost twice as much as expected. In 2007 they announced a restructuring, some 25 employees, about half the company‚Äôs staff, were laid off as a result of the plant shutdown.  Principal investors * Access Private Equity * Draper Fisher Jurvetson * Polaris Venture Partners Technology Known as Emissions-to-Biofuels, the process could use a photosynthetic bioreactor supplied with exhaust gases from a fossil fuel combustion source to grow algae. As smokestack emissions are delivered to the algae bioreactor, carbon dioxide and other pollutants are absorbed and utilized by the algae to grow at an exponential rate. Once harvested, the algae is processed to produce a variety of solids such as protein and bioplastics, gases such as methane, and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Application Sources of carbon rich exhaust include manufacturing facilities and electricity generation plants, especially those which burn coal. Once the algal biomass is harvested and processed, the resulting fuel may be sold for additional revenue or utilized on-site. Benefits The biofuel yield using the GreenFuel technique is 30 times higher per hectare compared to the yield of oil derived from conventional terrestrial crops. Emissions of carbon dioxide are reduced by 40% and emissions of oxides of nitrogen are reduced by up to 85%. Plant retrofits can be made with minimal disruption to existing facilities.  Large-scale algae farming plants  GreenFuel Technologies had launched the second phase of a major project with Spanish renewable energy firm Aurantia http://www.aurantia.es/ to build a large-scale algae farming plant adjacent to a CO2-spewing cement plant near Jerez, Spain.

For the non-zero case, what makes the change qualitative is that its direction but not its magnitude is specified.James Quirk, 1987. \\"qualitative economics,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, p. 1. Typical exercises of qualitative economics include comparative-static changes studied in microeconomics or macroeconomics and comparative equilibrium-growth states in a macroeconomic growth model. A simple example illustrating qualitative change is from macroeconomics. Let: :GDP = nominal gross domestic product, a measure of national income : M = money supply :T = total taxes. Monetary theory hypothesizes a positive relationship between GDP the dependent variable and M the independent variable. Equivalent ways to represent such a qualitative relationship between them are as a signed functional relationship and as a signed derivative: : GDP = f(\\\\overset{+}{M}) \\\\quad\\\\\\\\! or \\\\quad\\\\frac{ df(M) }{ dM} > 0. where the '+' indexes a positive relationship of GDP to M, that is, as M increases, GDP increases as a result. Another model of GDP hypothesizes that GDP has a negative relationship to T. This can be represented similarly to the above, with a theoretically appropriate sign change as indicated: : GDP = f(\\\\overset{-}{T}) \\\\quad\\\\\\\\! or \\\\quad\\\\frac{ df(T)}{ dT} < 0. That is, as T increases, GDP decreases as a result. A combined model uses both M and T as independent variables. The hypothesized relationships can be equivalently represented as signed functional relationships and signed partial derivatives (suitable for more than one independent variable): : GDP = f(\\\\overset{+}{M},\\\\overset{-}{ T}) \\\\,\\\\\\\\! \\\\quad or \\\\quad\\\\frac{\\\\partial f(M, T)}{\\\\partial M} > 0,\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial f(M, T)}{\\\\partial T} < 0. Qualitative hypotheses occur in earliest history of formal economics but only as to formal economic models from the late 1930s with Hicks's model of general equilibrium in a competitive economy.J. R. Hicks, 1939. Value and Capital. Oxford. A classic exposition of qualitative economics is Samuelson, 1947.Paul A. Samuelson, 1947. Foundations of Economic Analysis, pp. 5, 21-29.

Lieber (born April 24, 1961) is a current Mountain View City Council candidate and was a Democratic California State Assemblywoman and former Mountain View City Councilwoman and Mayor. She represented the 22nd Assembly District that includes the cities of Belmont, Millbrae, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Cupertino and portions of Santa Clara and San Jose which are all located in Santa Clara County. Lieber held the office of Speaker pro Tempore in the 2007-2008 legislative session. In the November 7, 2006 general election she was re-elected to her third and final term in the assembly, beating her Republican opponent Roger Riffenburgh by 68.8% to 31.2%. In 2008, she was term-limited out of the office. Lieber currently serves as an advisor to the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority, an agency that was created through her legislation, and recently served on Attorney General Kamala D. Harris' transition team working on women's rehabilitation and mental health. Early life and education Lieber was born in Detroit, Michigan on April 24, 1961. As a youth growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, she was interested in the antiwar and civil rights movements. In junior high school, she wore glasses over her hair so she would look like Gloria Steinem, the feminist icon and revolutionary journalist. After graduating from high school, Lieber worked restoring Victorian houses and specialized in hanging historical wallpapers. She spent 10 years at this job. As she hung wallpaper, Lieber's interest in politics grew as she listened to NPR and this encouraged Lieber to return to school. In her late 20s, she began taking night classes at San Francisco City College. In 1992, she met her husband David Phillips. The two ran into each other at Burning Man, an arts festival held every year in the Nevada desert. After they married in 1993, Lieber moved to the peninsula and transferred to Foothill College, where she started going to school full-time and became involved in student government. She worked on issues of child care for student parents, campus access for the disabled and student health care. In the mid-1990s, Lieber transferred to Stanford University with a political science major, working with Luis Fraga. Early political career The 37-year-old Lieber, still a senior at Stanford, launched her campaign for city government in 1998. Lieber won this election, as the top vote-getter of seven candidates, and served as Vice Mayor and Mayor. She also served as the City's representative on the Valley Transportation Authority's Board of Directors and as Chair of the Santa Clara Valley Water District's Water Commission. In 2001, a group of citizens launched an effort to recall her from office but that effort was abandoned when Lieber won the Democratic primary for the 22nd Assembly District, a seat almost guaranteed to the Democratic candidate, by way of an earlier redistricting of voters in the 22nd Assembly District. Lieber ran for the 22nd Assembly District seat in 2002. She ran against Santa Clara City Councilman Rod Diridon Jr., who was endorsed by most of the party heavyweights, and fellow Mountain View City Councilwoman Rosemary Stasek in the Democratic primary. She surprised some a political spectators when she won with 44 percent of the vote. Her volunteers walked to 58,000 households during the campaign. Lieber won the general election against Republican Sunnyvale Mayor Stan Kawczynski. Kawcynski accused Lieber of voter fraud because Lieber referred to herself on the ballot as a \\"councilwoman\\" instead of a \\"councilmember\\" and because she referred to her position on the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Board of Directors as a transit director. A lawsuit over the issue was dismissed. Lieber announced in December 2006 that she would be running for the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, District 5 in the 2008 election against Liz Kniss. She later withdrew from that race. Lieber was also a 2012 candidate for California's newly drawn 13th State Senate District, which includes northern Santa Clara County and much of San Mateo County, but lost to San Mateo County Supervisor Jerry Hill on November 6, 2012. State Assembly Leadership positions and committees During her first term she served as Assistant Speaker pro Tempore. During this term she was the only woman to serve as an officer of the Assembly. She took the oath of office for Speaker pro Tempore on October 24, 2006, becoming the third woman to serve in this role since 1849. She also served on the Assembly's Committee on Insurance, Committee on Judiciary, Committee on Local Government, Committee on Health and as the Chair of the Assembly's Select Committee on Mobilehomes. She previously served as the Assembly Chair of the legislature's Joint Committee on Ending Poverty in California. Legislative priorities and accomplishments Sally Lieber's main legislative priorities include: increased educational and economic opportunities for all citizens of California, protection for the environment, improvements to public health, and increased social justice. Lieber authored legislation to increase the state's minimum wage, co-authored a greenhouse gas reduction bill, and joint-author of a bill to legalize gay marriage (though that bill was later vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger). Lieber was one of only a few heterosexual legislators to joint-author Mark Leno's marriage equality bill. She has authored legislation that includes efforts increasing pupil immunizations, creating an independent sentencing commission, and improving the living conditions of inmates in California's overcrowded prisons. Lieber has authored legislation providing for a death penalty moratorium, advocating for the rights of pregnant inmates in state prison (allowing them to have prenatal vitamins, providing larger clothes as they got larger with pregnancy, anti-shackling during childbirth), fighting for victims of human trafficking and battling toxic-dumping corporations. Most recently, she advocated a mandatory vaccine against HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer. Homelessness experience In April 2006, Lieber spent several days living as if she were homeless in Santa Clara Valley, in an attempt to understand the problems the homeless face, and how the legislature can help them. She begged for money, and collected cans and bottles, in order to buy food on the streets of Mountain View and San Jose.< Lieber used the experience to encourage the Governor to keep cold weather shelters open for the homeless. Vehicle emissions testing In 2004, Lieber introduced extremely controversial legislation regarding the State vehicle Emission test cycle, which was signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The bi-ennial test previously exempted vehicles over 30 years old, while Lieber's legislation fixed the cutoff date at 1976 in perpetuity. Historical vehicles are not exempt. Car collectors, including Jay Leno, noted that this legislation imposed severe penalties for negligible benefit. Anti-spanking bill Lieber was in the press in January 2007 by announcing she was planning on introducing a bill that will make it illegal in California to spank a child three years-old or younger. She may have been inspired by the law in Canada which prohibits spanking children under the age of 2 years or over the age of 11 years, which was passed in 2004. The proposed bill has since been opposed by some on the basis of the practical aspects of enforcing it, though there are those who support it as well (early polling suggests that it is supported by 23% of Californians). Lieber was not spanked as a child. Political leanings Lieber is a staunch liberal. Lieber has been rated at 100% by the Sierra Club California, the California National Organization for Women, California League of Conservation Voters, California School Employees Association, the California Alliance for Retired Americans, and the California Labor Federation AFL-CIO. She has received low ratings from the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and the California Chamber of Commerce.

He became known for his support of socialism and for his \\"forum\\" for the expression of views on labor and living conditions. Advocates of all political and social doctrines were permitted to speak freely. This was widely criticized and finally, in 1923, following action taken by Bishop William T. Manning, the forum was greatly modified in its character. He also came in controversy with Manning on the question of divorce. He became engaged to Rita de Acosta Lydig who had been divorced. Manning refused to authorize the marriage and it did not take place. In June 1924, he resigned his rectorship.

Weird menace is the name given to a subgenre of horror fiction that was popular in the pulp magazines of the 1930s and early 1940s. The weird menace pulps, also known as shudder pulps, generally featured stories in which the hero was pitted against sadistic villains, with graphic scenes of torture and brutality. History In the early 1930s, detective pulps like Detective-Dragnet, All Detective, Dime Detective, and the short-lived Strange Detective Stories, began to favor detective stories with weird, eerie, or menacing elements. Eventually, the two distinct genre variations branched into separate magazines; the detective magazines returned to stories predominantly featuring detection or action; while the eerie mysteries found their own home in the weird menace titles.Locke, John. Introduction to Cult of the Corpses, by Maxwell Hawkins, Off-Trail Publications, 2008. . Some magazines, for instance Ten Detective Aces (the successor to Detective-Dragnet), continued to host both genre variations. Popularity and demise The first weird menace title was Dime Mystery, which started out as a straight crime fiction magazine but began to develop the new genre in 1933 under the influence of Grand Guignol theater.Gary Hoppenstand; Ray B Browne. The Defective Detective in the pulps. Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1983. pp. 4‚Äì5. Popular Publications dominated the genre with Dime Mystery, Terror Tales, and Horror Stories. After Popular issued Thrilling Mysteries, Standard Magazines, publisher of the \\"Thrilling\\" line of pulps, claimed trademark infringement. Popular withdrew Thrilling Mysteries after one issue, and Standard issued their own weird menace pulp, Thrilling Mystery. In the 1930s, the Red Circle pulps, with Mystery Tales, expanded the genre to include increasingly graphic descriptions of torture. This provoked a public outcry against such publications. For example, The American Mercury published a hostile account of the terror magazines in 1938, \\"This month, as every month, the 1,508,000 copies of terror magazines, known to the trade as the shudder group, will be sold throughout the nation... They will contain enough illustrated sex perversion to give Krafft-Ebing the unholy jitters.Bruce Henry, The American Mercury, April 1938; quoted in Jones, The Shudder Pulps, pp. 138‚Äì39.\\" A censorship backlash brought about the demise of the genre in the early 1940s.

He also played in the Quebec Junior Football League with the Verdun Maple Leafs. He attended the University of Northern ColoradoDattilio signs playing for the Bears from 1972 to 1974.Gerry Dattilio will be Wade's backup for crucial battle with Blue Bombers He led the Bears in rushing as a quarterback in 1972 and 1973 and led the team in passing yards in both 1973 (1,367 yards, 18 TDs) and 1974 (1,367 yards, 14 TDs). He ranks 10th on the Bears' all-time passing yards list with 2,953 passing yards and was an All-Great Plains Conference player in both 1973 and 1974.  Professional career  In 1975, Dattilio was the first territorial exemption of the Montreal Alouettes, but after a time on the injury list he was released in SeptemberAls ink Mul-Key, Fanuci; swap Raines and then the next month he signed with the Toronto Argonauts. He played a single game for the Argos and did not record any statistics. The next season, he was released by the Argonauts, rejoined the Alouettes, and served as the third-string quarterback behind Sonny Wade and Joe Barnes. Also as a utility player Dattilio returned punts, but seized the chance at playing more at quarterback in 1978. While he led the team in pass attempts with 142, with 78 completions, that season, he was second in passing yards with 1120. Dattilio also had 9 interceptions and 5 touchdowns. However, in 1979 Barnes was the clear cut starter and with a run heavy offence there was not many opportunities for Dattilio to play. In 1980 that all changed when a struggling Barnes was traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders after six games. That season Dattilio became an all star quarterback, throwing for 2892 yards and 19 touchdowns and winning the CFL's Most Outstanding Canadian Award and was the eastern nominee for the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award. He threw 5 TDs against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on September 21, 1980. The next season saw Dattilio demoted to back-up in making way for NFL star quarterback Vince Ferragamo. However Ferragamo struggled for most of the 1981 season and Dattilio played enough to tally 1095 aerial yards. Prior to the 1982 season he was traded to the Calgary Stampeders. That year, he threw for 2788 yards, marking the most recent time in which a Canadian quarterback threw for over 2000 in a season. Dattilio completed 194 out of 387 and had only 11 touchdowns to 22 interceptions. 1983 saw him used mostly as a back-up, this time to first year quarterback Bernard Quarles, but got in enough playing time to throw for 1213 yards. In March, 1984, Dattilio was traded back to the Alouettes where he served as a back-up or a third-string quarterback for two seasons. Among Canadian quarterbacks Dattilio is second all-time in statistics with 9952 passing yards on 697 completions from 1271 attempts with 53 touchdowns to 79 interceptions. He also had 993 rushing yards on 189 carries and added eight more touchdowns. He appeared in three Grey Cup games: 1977, 1978, and 1979, but did not throw any passes. Instead, in 1977, he was used as a receiver and caught two passes for 39 yards in the Alouettes' victory over the Edmonton Eskimos. He is a business person in Calgary, and was inducted into Northern Colorado Athletic Hall of Fame in 2004UNC Bears Hall of Fame and had the Gerry Dattilio Sportsfield named after him in Laval, Quebec, in honour of his great Chomedy High School playing days.Laval Liberty Panthers History References Category:Toronto Argonauts players Category:Montreal Alouettes players Category:Calgary Stampeders players Category:Montreal Concordes players Category:Grey Cup champions Category:Sportspeople from Laval, Quebec Category:Canadian Football League Most Outstanding Canadian Award winners Category:Canadian football quarterbacks Category:Players of Canadian football from Quebec Category:Northern Colorado Bears football players Category:1953 births Category:Living people ","title":"Gerry Dattilio"},{"id":"8118870","text":"Daniele De Vezze (born 9 January 1980) is an Italian former footballer who played as a midfielder.

Bridges was born at Bridges P.O., Gloucester County, Virginia. He was the youngest of the eleven children who grew to maturity of Thomas Francis Bridges, a farmer, merchant, and postmaster, and his wife Mary Otie Bartow (Hughes) Bridges. His paternal grandparents were John Alexander Bridges and Florida (Stubblefield) Bridges. His earliest known ancestor in Gloucester, Simon Stubblefield, had received a land grant there in 1688. After Bridges' father suffered a stroke in 1912, the family moved to the city of Norfolk, where Bridges attended elementary school and Maury High School. In 1922, after completing high school, Bridges shipped out as an apprentice seaman on a tramp ship, the S.S. Schroon, and for the first time saw the Caribbean and the Mediterranean, which he said later decided him on a career in international business. Returning to Virginia, he attended the University of Virginia for a year, worked for a year for a food brokerage concern, and then in 1924 became a salesman in Norfolk for Libby, McNeill & Libby, one of the largest American producers of canned foods. He was to spend the remainder of his life in the employ of Libby's. In 1927 Bridges was transferred to Libby's export department and assigned to the company's office in New Orleans. With New Orleans as a base, he spent the next four years selling Libby's products in the Caribbean and Central and South America. In 1932 he was assigned to Libby's corporate headquarters in Chicago. In 1938 he was named manager of the export department, and in 1943 he became corporate vice president for sales and advertising. He was made a director of the company in 1947, and in 1953 he became Libby's president and chief executive officer. Libby's expanded and modernized during his presidency, and he successfully fought off an attempt by outsiders to take over the company. By 1960 Libby's had 9,000 employees and annual revenues of $296 million, and ranked 154th in size among U.S. corporations. Bridges served as an officer of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trustee of the Nutrition Foundation, and a member of the boards of the Chicago Chamber of Commerce, the Council on Medical and Biological Research of the University of Chicago, and the Community Memorial General Hospital of La Grange, Illinois. He was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati in the State of Virginia. Bridges died at his home in Hinsdale, Illinois, on November 24, 1961. Subsequently Libby's was acquired by Nestl√©, which continued to use Libby's as a brand name for some years. Charles Scott Bridges was married in New Orleans on August 26, 1931, to Shirley Am√©lie Devlin, a native of that city, who survived him until 2003. They had three children: Peter Scott (1932- ), who married Mary Jane Lee; Shirley Bartow Ann (1936- ), who married Peter Joseph Pizzo, Jr.; and Mary Elizabeth (1947- ), who married Timothy Wiggenhorn, from whom she was subsequently divorced. As of 2006 Charles Scott and Shirley (Devlin) Bridges were also survived by eleven grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren.  References  Who's Who in America (Chicago: A.N.

The game was worth two points in the yearlong Carlyle Cup between the two schools.  History  North Carolina and Duke first met in football in 1888, and the series has been renewed annually since 1922. In the fall of 1948, UNC Head Cheerleader Norman Sper along with Loring Jones of Duke, likely inspired by other traveling trophies in college football, came up with the idea for the Victory Bell. Jones designed the frame and Sper obtained the an old railway bell from the Southern Railway. North Carolina won possession of the first ever Victory Bell game with a 20‚Äì0 shutout victory at Kenan Memorial Stadium in 1948. At one time, the series was every bit as heated as the basketball rivalry between the two schools. But in the 40 years from 1970 to 2009, Duke only managed 7 wins, including a series record streak of 13 consecutive Carolina wins from 1990 through 2002. However, this rivalry has been revived in recent years as Duke has again become competitive in the rivalry, with both teams having won five games each from 2010 through 2019. Duke victories in the 2012 and 2013 games marked the first time Duke had won consecutive games in the series since winning three straight from 1987 to 1989. After consecutive North Carolina victories in 2014 and 2015, Duke matched its longest winning streak in the last 30 years with wins in 2016, 2017 and 2018. This streak for Duke was broken on October 26, 2019 as Carolina clinched a 20-17 victory when Chazz Surratt picked off Deon Jackson‚Äôs trick-play pass at the goal line with 14 seconds left. Traditions It has been a tradition as of late for the winner to spray-paint the platform of the trophy to match their school colors--Carolina blue for North Carolina and royal blue for Duke. After losing the Victory Bell in 2003, North Carolina came back the next year and beat Duke 40‚Äì17 in Duke's Wallace Wade Stadium. After the conclusion of the game, North Carolina football players immediately spray-painted the platform Carolina blue, leaving large amounts of Carolina blue paint residue on the track of the stadium. Whenever North Carolina has been in possession of the Victory Bell, cheerleaders wheel it out while ringing the bell at the same time the live ram mascot, Rameses, is brought out onto the field. The bell is also displayed in front of the students' section. Game results While the two schools agree that North Carolina leads the series, they do not agree on the overall record. North Carolina claims an all- time lead of 60‚Äì38‚Äì4;2011 North Carolina Football Media Guide], p. 173-174 Duke claims North Carolina leads 58‚Äì39‚Äì4.2011 Duke Football Media Guide, p. 92 The dispute centers around an 1889 game where both teams stayed home because they believed they were the home team. As a result, both schools claim the game as a win by forfeit, 1-0. Most neutral recordkeepers credit the game to North Carolina. Both schools agree that North Carolina vacated its wins in 2008 and 2009. Both schools also agree that North Carolina leads the series since the introduction of the Victory Bell with a record of 43‚Äì23‚Äì1, with two vacated North Carolina wins. Note: Duke was known as Trinity College until 1924. ‚Ä† Both schools claim this game as a win by forfeit; most neutral recordkeepers credit the game to North Carolina. ‚Ä° North Carolina vacated wins from the 2008 and 2009 seasons.

He found success in the United States becoming a prominent yacht designer who had a hand in an America's Cup victory in 1937. Life and career Born in Hamburg, Hendel apprenticed for two years at Deutsche Werft shipyard in Hamburg before attending the Higher Technical Institute at Bremen where he specialized in naval architecture. Following graduation in 1925, he spent over two years in the design office of Nobiskrug shipyard in Rendsburg in Northern Germany. Hendel came to the USA in November 1928 with a visa and worked in New York City in the office of Theodore Wells, naval architect. In 1935, Hendel became chief draftsman for the legendary naval architect Starling Burgess, who at the time was living in Wiscasset, Maine, and working on various projects for the Bath Iron Works, in Bath, Maine. In 1936, Harold Stirling Vanderbilt engaged the Bath Iron Works to build the America‚Äôs Cup Defender Ranger, the greatest of all J-class yachts. Geerd Hendel worked with Starling Burgess and a young Olin Stephens on putting together the working drawings (see Olin Stephens‚Äôs book, All This and Sailing Too). From his work on Ranger‚Äôs aluminum masts, Hendel became one of the early advocates of the use of aluminum in yacht building. That summer, Hendel became a US citizen. In 1938, Hendel designed the 21-foot fin keel sloop known as the Boothbay Harbor One Design, the culmination of almost a decade‚Äôs work of designing, building, and then testing his ideas for fast racing sloops. Geerd Hendel and Starling Burgess actively raced the Hendel Racing Sloop during the years leading up to World War II.Bray, Maynard \\"The Boothbay Harbor One Design.\\" WoodenBoat Magazine's Small Boats, February, 2007 pp. 72-75. In 1939, Hendel designed Whistler, one of the first aluminum alloy vessels ever built in the United States. It was an experimental yacht for Alcoa, built at Rice Brothers in East Boothbay, Maine. The following year he worked for Sparkman & Stephens for a short time. Post World War II, Hendel established his own independent design firm in 1945 in Camden, Maine. He gained fame as a naval architect both in the United States and Europe for his many innovative designs of luxury yachts, fishing vessels, tugboats, launches, and sailboats. He spent well over 60 years behind the drawing board and the last 30 managing his own firm. His accomplishments were documented over the years in numerous trade magazines and books on boat building.

The third movement is titled \\"In War-Time\\" and is martial in character. The fourth movement, \\"Dirge,\\" is a threnody introduced by the tolling of bells. The fifth and last movement, \\"Village,\\" is based upon two Iroquois melodies, one in the plucked strings and one played by flute and piccolo accompanied by strings and woodwinds.

Life and works  Dumitrescu was born in Sibiu, Romania. He received a master's degree in composition in Bucharest; Alfred Mendelssohn was among his teachers. Later, he studied conducting and philosophy with Sergiu Celibidache; Celibidache led Dumitrescu to an engagement with the philosophy of Edmund Husserl and an effort to apply the principles of phenomenology to music. He began composing his mature works in the early 1970s. In 1976 he founded the Hyperion Ensemble, which he describes as \\"a multimedia group dedicated to experimental music\\". Several of Dumitrescu's early works for solo contrabass were recorded by the noted avant-garde bassist Fernando Grillo. Dumitrescu has composed a large body of works for acoustic instruments and ensembles as well as works combining acoustic and electronic sounds and works composed entirely using tape or computer. In its emphasis on long tones that undergo transformations of timbre, Dumitrescu's music can be loosely grouped with that of Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi and with the spectral music of fellow Romanian Hora»õiu RƒÉdulescu and the French composers of the spectral school. Dumitrescu describes his music as \\"acousmatic\\" but disclaims a relationship with the Acousmatic music of French musique concrete pioneer Pierre Schaeffer. He accepts the \\"spectralist\\" label, though he distinguishes his work from some others in the spectral school in that it is not serial. \\"I think of myself as a spectralist, but in completely different way from the French\\".dumitrescu.english.html Dumitrescu was married to fellow composer Ana- Maria Avram (1961-2017); they have more than 20 joint CD releases on their Edition Modern label.

It is native to Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. It is also a Weed of National Significance in Australia (an invasive species of significant concern in Australia,) as well as a Federal Noxious Weed in the United States. Taxonomy This tree was originally the type species of the genus Acacia, which derives its name from , ', the name given by early Greek botanist-physician Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. 40‚Äì90) to this tree as a medicinal, in his book Materia Medica. The renaming of the genus to Vachellia remains controversial. The genus name Acacia derives from the Ancient Greek word for its characteristic thorns, , ', \\"thorn\\". The species name nilotica was given by Linnaeus from this tree's best-known range along the Nile river. The plant V. nilotica then, in turn, became the type species for the Linnaean genus Acacia (not all of which have thorns, even though they are named for them). For the ongoing reclassification of this and other species historically classified under genus Acacia, see the Acacia. Description Spring blossoms at Hodal in Faridabad District of Haryana, India Vachellia nilotica is a tree 5‚Äì20 m high with a dense spheric crown, stems and branches usually dark to black coloured, fissured bark, grey-pinkish slash, exuding a reddish low quality gum. The tree has thin, straight, light, grey spines in axillary pairs, usually in 3 to 12 pairs, 5 to long in young trees, mature trees commonly without thorns. The leaves are bipinnate, with 3‚Äì6 pairs of pinnulae and 10‚Äì30 pairs of leaflets each, tomentose, rachis with a gland at the bottom of the last pair of pinnulae. Flowers in globulous heads 1.2‚Äì1.5 cm in diameter of a bright golden-yellow color, set up either axillary or whorly on peduncles 2‚Äì3 cm long located at the end of the branches. Pods are strongly constricted, hairy, white-grey, thick and softly tomentose. Its seeds number approximately 8000/kg. Distribution Vachellia nilotica is native from Egypt, across the Maghreb and Sahel, south to Mozambique and KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and east through Arabian Peninsula to Indian Subcontinent subcontinent and Burma. It has become widely naturalised outside its native range including Zanzibar and Australia. Vachellia nilotica is spread by livestock.  Uses  Seed pods Gum Arabic exuding Trunk at Hodal in Faridabad District of Haryana, India  Forage and fodder  In part of its range smallstock consume the pods and leaves, but elsewhere it is also very popular with cattle. Pods are used as a supplement to poultry rations in India. Dried pods are particularly sought out by animals on rangelands. In India branches are commonly lopped for fodder. In West Africa, the pods and leaves are considered to have anthelminthic properties on small ruminants and this has been confirmed by in vitro experiments on nematodes.  Tooth brushing The tender twig of this plant is used as a toothbrush in south-east Africa, Indian subcontinent. Gum arabic The exudate gum of this tree is known as gum arabic and has been collected from the pharaonic times for the manufacture of medicines, dyes and paints. In the present commercial market, gum arabic is defined as the dried exudate from the trunks and branches of Senegalia (Acacia) senegal or Vachellia (Acacia) seyal in the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae). The gum of A. nilotica is also referred to in India as Amaravati gum.  Lumber  The tree's wood is \\"very durable if water-seasoned\\" and its uses include tool handles and lumber for boats. The wood has a density of about 1170 kg/m3. Food and medicine In India it's used as a ingredient in various dishes. The Maasai people eat both the inner bark (phloem) and the fruit pulp boiled in water. They also use this plant medicinally to treat sore throat, cough, chest pains etc. Propagation There are 5000‚Äì16000 seeds/kg.

Starting with a single three seat Stinson airplane, the company grew and the fleet of aircraft expanded to seven Stinsons. Although McGee was an excellent manager, there were two major competitors in Anchorage: Star Air Service and Woodley Airways. There was not enough business to support the three companies, and they were all struggling financially. In 1937 McGee sold the company to Star Air Service. When Mac McGee sold the company, he began working several mining claims, but was called back to manage Star Air Service on several occasions while they continued to struggle financially. He left the airline business for the last time in 1937 when he arranged to sell Star Air Service to a new group of investors who hoped to make the company a major player in the Alaska airline business. McGee Airways was the original Alaska air service that, through a long series of mergers and acquisitions ultimately became Alaska Airlines in 1944. History McGee came to Alaska as a stowaway in 1929. He worked as a miner, truck driver, dishwasher and fur trader. In 1931 he partnered with Harvey W. Barnhill to form Barnhill & McGee Airways with a three-seat Stinson SM8A which they had purchased from Varney Airlines in San Francisco. In 1932 McGee bought Barnhill‚Äôs interest and dissolved the company. McGee obtained a bank loan and purchased a second Stinson airplane and hired half-brother Estol Call to bring it to Anchorage, where he founded McGee Airways. Operations Railroad crane will lower plane into Ship Creek in Anchorage at high tide where it can taxi into Cook Inlet for take-off. Although McGee learned to fly he did not like flying. He preferred to hire pilots and personally manage the company. He paid his pilots on commission based on the income they generated. Originally the operation was completely un-scheduled. They flew trappers, hunters, tourists, salesmen, sport fishermen and commercial fishermen to destinations throughout the Alaska Territory, going from place to place delivering and picking up cargo and passengers until returning to home base in Anchorage. The pilots collected cash for the flights and settled with McGee each time they returned to Anchorage. The Interior Department paid to have indigenous natives, who were wards of the government, flown to hospitals for medical care. The airplanes had no radios or navigational instruments. Only a very few of the large cities had landing fields. In summer the planes were equipped with pontoons for landing on lakes and rivers. Lake Spenard was the Anchorage pontoon base. In winter the planes were converted to skis, landing on ice and snow covered waterways or clearings. Winter home base was Merrill Field in Anchorage. McGee Airways Stinson being transported by pickup truck to Alaska Railroad Bridge. In the fall of 1934 McGee Airways obtained the first airmail contract to deliver mail to the Bristol Bay area of southwest Alaska. He hired Roy Dickson to fly the new mail route. Dickson had brought a B-1 Ryan airplane to Alaska in March, 1934, and flew the summer mining season for Alaska Exploration & Mining Company out of Cantwell. McGee approached him in the Parsons Hotel in Anchorage with a proposition. \\"It's a new project, never been tried before, do you want to try it?\\" Dickson was anxious to get on McGee's payroll so he could bring his family to Alaska from the states. His Ryan was in need of an overhaul, and he had been paid mostly in company stock rather than cash for his summer's work. He accepted McGee's offer, sold the Ryan to Bowman Airways, and sent for his family. Dickson flew the mail route until late 1935, when he founded his own company Bering Sea Airways. The new air mail delivery flight took a minimum of three days with deliveries to Iliamna Lake, Naknek, Egegik and Ugashik, the southernmost village on the run, then returning with deliveries to Nushagak, Dillingham, another stop at Iliamna Lake and back to Anchorage. This new connection to the \\"outside world\\" allowed remote villagers to obtain products previously unavailable. The pilots always had a shopping list when they returned to Anchorage. Previously mail had been delivered by steamships in the summer and dog teams in winter. In winter months from October 1 until May 1 only letters, cards, packages of seeds weighing less than a pound, and newspapers going to libraries or newspaper publishers were carried. Packages were held in Seattle until the summer months when they could be taken in by boat. McGee was a workaholic, working seven days a week. He was also known as an honest businessman, and shrewd manager. He pioneered the concept of having a fleet of identical aircraft so that parts would be interchangeable. In order to make a profit, he loaded his planes with all they could carry, causing the Department of Commerce aircraft inspector to frequently cite the company for overloading aircraft. McGee Airways had two significant competitors in Anchorage, Woodley Airways and Star Air Service. Woodley Airways was founded by \\"Art\\" Woodley in 1932, and in April 1932, three young Seattle pilots Charlie Ruttan, Steve Mills and Jack Waterworth founded Star Air Service, planning to offer flight instruction and charter service. Dissolution By the winter of 1934, it was apparent that there was not enough business to support three air services in Anchorage with the surplus of airplanes and an economy suffering from the Great Depression. McGee was also anxious to work some mining claims he had staked. Star Air Service acquired McGee Airways in 1934 for $50,000. McGee stipulated that if not paid on time, he would return and manage the operation until receiving his money. The acquisition made Star Air Service the largest airline operation in Alaska. By 1936 it had a fleet of 22 planes and a gross annual income of $190,000. But Star's pilot owner/managers were a restless bunch and changes in the front office were common. McGee returned to manage the company twice, and in 1937, he bought his way back into the airline and finally sold the company to a new group of investors, ending his involvement in the airline business. After working his mining operations for a number of years, McGee retired to the \\"lower 48\\" and died in Reno, Nevada, in 1988 at age 91. Aircraft McGee Airways only operated Stinson airplanes. *3 Stinson S Junior *Stinson SM-1E *Stinson SM-1F *Stinson SM-7A *Stinson SM-8A *Stinson SR-5 Pilots The bush pilots who flew in the 1930s were a most important element in the development of air services in Alaska, and indeed in the development of Alaska itself. They flew single engine aircraft all over the Territory, with no weather reports, no navigation aides, no radios in aircraft, not even good maps, and there were very few landing fields.

He was the chief economist at the Economics and Statistics Department at the OECD during 1984-1992. Before that he worked as an academic economist in Britain, first at Oxford (Fellow of Lincoln College) and later at University College London (Professor of Economics, 1975-1983); as a British civil servant (first as an Economic Advisor in HM Treasury, and later as Chief Economist in the Ministry of Aviation); and as a staff member of the World Bank (1969-1975). In 1985 he gave the BBC Reith Lectures, which were published in the book Innocence and Design: The Influence of Economic Ideas on Policy (Blackwell, 1986). After leaving the OECD, Henderson was an independent author and consultant, and acted as Visiting Fellow or Professor at the OECD Development Centre (Paris), the Centre for European Policy Studies (Brussels), Monash University, the Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques, the University of Melbourne, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the New Zealand Business Roundtable, the Melbourne Business School, and Westminster Business School. Subsequently he was a Fellow of the Institute of Economic Affairs. In 1992, Henderson was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Companion (CMG). Henderson has published books that strongly criticize \\"corporate social responsibility\\" (see ¬ßBooks, below). Henderson and Nigel Lawson appealed to then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to investigate the economic implications of the potential implementation of policies put forth by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) findings. Henderson and Ian Castles, a former head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics argued that the IPCC's projections of future emissions of greenhouse gases was flawed. The IPCC's forecasts of global output were based on national GDP converted to dollars using market exchange rates. Henderson and Ian Castles were critical of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that was published in 2000.Letters to the IPCC, archived from the original on 2008-07-19Castles and Henderson (2003), Energy & Environment, 14:415‚Äì435 The core of their critique was the use of market exchange rates (MER) for international comparison, in lieu of the theoretically favoured PPP exchange rate which corrects for differences in purchasing power.Nordhaus (2007), Energy Economics, 29:349-372 The IPCC rebutted this criticism.Gruebler et al. (2004), Energy & Environment, 15:11-24Holtsmark and Alfsen (2005), Climatic Change, 68:11-19Manne et al. (2005), Climatic Change, 71:1-8 Castles and Henderson later acknowledged that they were mistaken that future greenhouse gas emissions had been significantly overestimated. Henderson has suggested about climate change that the science is not settled, and he specifically criticized the Stern Review regarding the economics of global warming. Relatedly, in 2008, Nigel Lawson published the book An Appeal to Reason: A Cool Look at Global Warming; the dedication for the book says \\"To David Henderson, who first aroused my interest in all this\\". (The following year, Lawson went on to found the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate change denialist think-tank, whose Academic Advisory Council Henderson went on to chair). He was educated at Ellesmere College, Shropshire. He died on 30 September 2018 at the age of 91.David Henderson 1927-2018, OECD. Books (selected) *Henderson, David (2001).

Generalizations Latin America is the area south of the Rio Grande, excluding Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname and other English speaking countries There are several definitions of Latin America, but all of them define a huge expanse of geography with an incalculable amount of different customs. However, some generalizations can be made: *Compared to much of the English-speaking world, people from areas of Latin America may demonstrate more relaxed and casual behaviour and be more comfortable with loud talk, exaggerated gestures and physical contact. It is common to greet known people by kissing him/her in the cheek.Erin Richards Cultural Etiquette September 19, 2006 *In addition, many Latin American people have a smaller sense of personal space than people from English-speaking cultures. It may be rude to step away from someone when they are stepping closer. *At some finer restaurants, it may be considered rude for the staff to bring a customer the check without the customer first requesting it.ACIS Travel Talk August 2006 *It is considered impolite to \\"toss\\" objects to people instead of directly handing it to them.U.S. Institute of Languages Spanish Culture and nonverbal communication *The American \\"come here\\" gesture of palm upwards with the fingers curled back can be considered a romantic solicitation. Specific regions The following points of etiquette apply most specifically to a certain region: Brazil *Brazilians speak Portuguese (and usually do not refer to it as \\"Brazilian Portuguese\\", even though some expressions and spelling can be very different of European Portuguese; there is even a joke about other Brazilians over the people of Rio de Janeiro that they \\"do not really speak Portuguese\\", with many phonological differences given how their accent was influenced by Portugal's variant), not Spanish. Addressing someone who speaks Portuguese in Spanish, although most Brazilians understand Spanish to a reasonable degree, may be considered very offensive. *In Brazil, a form of the American \\"okay\\" gesture is obscene when directed at someone with the symbol upside down (back of hands down, circle forward to someone, rest of fingers to your self pointing any side), implying something like \\"go f... yourself!\\". However, the standard \\"okay\\" gesture is also used, as is the \\"thumbs up\\" gesture.https://web.archive.org/web/20090428024325/http://www.af.mil/news/airman/0406/top10.shtml *The gesture of \\"flipping someone off\\" by hitting the wrist against the inside of the elbow (sometimes called \\"a banana\\" in Brazil) is considered playful and not very offensive (in some other parts of the world, this is more akin to \\"the finger\\"). *Giving someone of the opposite gender a gift may be easily misinterpreted as a romantic overture, except for birthdays.Terri Morrison The Business of Gifts *In some parts of the country, most notably in rural or suburban areas in which homes may not have doorbells, the appropriate action is to stand in the yard and clap one's hands. If no one comes to the door, then the visitor may approach the door, knock, and then step back away from the door and await a response. This is especially applicable in regards to small, thin-walled cottages that offer less privacy than homes in North America. Haiti * Although tied more closely to France than to Spain or Portugal, the etiquette regarding Haiti is similar to other Latin American countries. * Haitians take proper behavior seriously and this includes good manners, clean appearances at all times, a moderate tone in one's speech and avoidance of any profanity or public \\"scenes\\", as these are all important indicators of one's social class. * Entering a household and not greeting the elders or owners of the household is regarded as highly offensive. Say bonjou (good morning) or bonswa (good afternoon) when entering a room or passing by someone on the street. * Eating is considered a social event and so withdrawing from the center of activities during meals is considered slightly offensive. * At restaurants, the one who extended the invitation pays the bill. Unless another woman is present, a woman should not buy dinner for a man. Making arrangements for payment before the meal is considered especially polite. When summoning a server, make eye contact; waving or calling their names is very impolite. * At the dining table, the European etiquette applies; ladies sit first, fork on the left, elbows off the table, etc. When utensils are not being used, a person's hands are expected to be visible above the table resting the wrists on top of the table and not at one's lap. Diners are expected to stay at the table for the entire meal; no bathroom breaks. * While dining, for making a toast, the most common toast is sante (to your health). When beginning to eat wait until after the host says \\"bon appetit!\\" (\\"enjoy your meal!\\"). * Relationships are important to Haitians, so business discussions should be saved until the end of the meal, or for later. * Avoid discussing politics, corruptions within the government, and Dominican life, without having a good understanding of the issues as well as the people with whom one is discussing it, and until one has established a relationship with the listener. These are touchy subjects to speak about, especially if one does not know what one is talking about. * The infamous Haitian Creole phrase Langy√®t Maman'w is highly offensive, insulting one's mother. Uttering this to someone will almost certainly provoke conflict. * It is rude to point at someone. * Haitians expect to barter when making a purchase. * Men shake hands on meeting and departing. Men and women kiss on the cheek when greeting. Women kiss each other on the cheek. Friends, family and close acquaintances usually share a light kiss on the cheek. * When attending church (whether it be Roman Catholic or Protestant), one's best formal shoes and clothes are to be worn. * Punctuality in an informal setting is not highly valued and being late is usually not considered rude. * People holding hands is an ordinary display of friendship though women and men, but seldom show public affection toward the opposite sex but are affectionate in private. It is also common for people of the same sexes to hold hands, and is often mistakenly viewed as homosexuality to outsiders. * Children are to be seen and not heard; not to draw attention to one's self. It is especially disrespectful for children to whistle, point, suck their teeth, stare, or to roll their eyes at adults. Children should also avoid sitting with their legs crossed and acting like an adult. * Flatulence, when company is present, is very rude and should be done in another unoccupied place. It is polite to say \\"excusez-moi\\" (), which means \\"excuse me\\".

The term is now mainly used in Bollywood songs in the context of a newly married daughter leaving her father's home. In India, the conclusion of a daughter's marriage, marked by the bidaai (farewell) ceremony, is a profoundly sad occasion, because after this she leaves her father's house and permanently relocates to her husband's family. The moment thus marks the end of her past life and the beginning of a new one. The expression of this sentiment varies, but is usually in the formed of hushed sobs, while maintaining sober calmness and composure. This sentiment is often reflected in Bollywood and regional films.

Chicago, Illinois: Marquis-Who's Who, 1968, p.1401Leaders in American Science, Hattiesburg, MS, 1968-69 he initially specialized in amino acid metabolism, including the utilization of D-amino acids and non specific forms of nitrogen. He then studied the relationship between protein and vitamin A which led to the finding that the amount, as well as biological value, of dietary protein are important in the process of converting carotene to vitamin A. Other studies dealt with metabolic changes during cachexia of tumor-bearing animals. One of the most striking affects of tumor on the host was the depression of enzyme catalase in the livers and in the kidneys which some investigators thought was due to a hypothetical substance, referred to as toxohormone. This was disproved by finding significant levels of the enzyme in liver tumors. A number of his studies dealt with the question of enzyme turnover in vivo. Using specific metabolic inhibitors, he evaluated relative rates of synthesis and degradation of the enzyme catalase under a variety of physiological, pathological and pharmacological conditions. These studies led to the conclusion that the rate of synthesis rather than the rate of destruction may be the preferential way of the mammalian organism to control its enzyme levels. His finding of greatly different levels of catalase activity in certain substrains of mice, which were under genetic control, provided an excellent model for pursuing fundamental research in biochemical genetics in the mammalian system. The analyses of the first, the second the backcross generations between high-enzyme and low-enzyme mouse substrains showed that the difference was due to a single autosomal gene pair with low dominant to high. Using specific metabolic inhibitors, it was subsequently found that the genetic difference between the two substrains lies primarily in the markedly increased rate of the enzyme destruction in the liver of one of the substrains. This was a unique finding since in all normal rats and mice studied previously the rates of enzyme destruction seemed to be almost constant. Although transient alteration in the rate of enzyme degradation has been observed under certain physiological conditions with other enzyme systems, the observation on catalase iwas believed to be the first demonstration of such regulatory mechanism under genetic control. Other studies dealt with the morphology, biochemistry and physiology of microbodies, on which he collaborated with Prof. Z..

The park covers on the coast of Northern California, with of hiking trails and over of a rough rocky coast line including Salt Point which protrudes into the Pacific Ocean. The park also features the first underwater preserves in California. The constant impact of the waves forms the rocks into many different shapes. These rocks continue underwater providing a wide variety of habitats for marine organisms. The activities at Salt Point include hiking, camping, fishing, scuba diving and many others. The weather is cool with fog and cold winds, even during the summer. The rocks of Salt Point are sedimentary sandstone. Due to the large amounts of sandstone, small cave-like features called tafoni can be found along the shore of Salt Point.  Cultural and natural history  This park is named for the formation of salt crystals in the cracks and crevices of the rocky coastline. The native Kashaya Pomo collected salt from this area for many years. They used abalone chisels to scrape the salt off the rocks. In 1853, Samuel Duncan and Joshua Hendy built a sawmill on a ridge located above Salt Point. A couple of years later, they leased the land to a San Francisco company, which quarried the sandstone. They used the sandstone to create the streets and buildings in San Francisco along with the naval facility at Mare Island. It is also possible to see drill holes in the sandstone at Gerstle Cove and at the marine terrace just north of it. In 1870, Duncan sold his property to Frederick Funcke and Lewis Gerstle. They shipped 5,000 cords of wood yearly and used most of the land to graze their cattle.  Gerstle Cove  The eyebolts used to anchor ships down are still visible at Gerstle cove. This is where sandstone and wood were loaded onto cargo ships. At first, they used wire cables anchored to the cliff side to load wood and stone onto the ships. Two chutes were eventually made; the Miller chute and the Funcke & Co. chute. There was a horse-drawn railroad that lead from the Miller sawmills to where the boats were loaded. The sawmill had a daily capacity of .  Wildlife   Land  Bishop pine at Salt Point Brush and grasslands cover the ground on the marine terraces; at higher elevations (approximately in elevation) Douglas fir forest dominates. At slightly higher staircase levels (about ), a mixed fir forest of bishop pine and Douglas-fir is present intermixed with second growth coast redwood, madrones and tanoak. At there is a large open prairie where animals such as elk previously grazed. In addition, at an elevation of about within Salt Point State Park is a pygmy forest including the Mendocino cypress, bishop pine and Arctostaphylos. The reason these trees do not attain their normal height is due to the highly acidic soils with minimal nutrients and a hardpan layer close to the surface. The native animals that roam the land include the black- tailed deer, raccoon, coyote, bobcat, gray fox, badger, striped skunk, and dozens of varieties of rodents such as squirrels, chipmunks, and the field mouse. Bears and cougars occasionally range the area, although visitors rarely see them. The forest, grassland, and ocean shore area host a huge variety of birds, including pelicans, ospreys, woodpeckers (including the pileated woodpecker), and oystercatchers. Steller's jay and ravens are common in unattended campsites in search of food.  Marine  Tide poolsDuring April, kelp is not visible but it has already started to grow. By August, the water is full of dark green seaweed that will provide a habitat for a variety of rockfish and other marine organisms. The coast of Sonoma County is known for its slow-growing red abalone. It takes this abalone 10 years to reach a diameter of . Between the months of December and April, it is possible to see gray whales migrating south to Baja California for breeding. Stewarts Point State Marine Reserve & Stewarts Point State Marine Conservation Area, Salt Point State Marine Conservation Area and Gerstle Cove State Marine Reserve adjoin Salt Point State Park. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.  Geology  The coast in this park is lined with jagged rocks and steep ocean cliffs. The rocks are shaped and formed by the continuous crashing of the waves. These rocks provide an array of tide pools while the tide is out.  Rocks  Sandstone with tafoniThe rocks of Salt Point are sedimentary, mainly sandstone. All of these rocks are tilted, exposing older rocks. The rocks at the north end of the park's coast are younger than the rocks at the southern end. Salt Point is named for the tafoni where the ocean water crystallizes in the honeycomb like crevices. This tafoni is caused when the salt crystals interact with the sandstone making parts of the sandstone harden while other parts soften.  Deep-sea fans  The layers of sedimentary rock show evidence of a deep-sea fan. A deep-sea fan is caused when there is dense, turbulent sediment filled water flowing down a submarine canyon. This highly dense water is called a turbidity current. Something that may cause a turbidity current are earthquakes or storms that create a submarine slide. When this sediment filled water leaves the end of the canyon it spreads out in a fan like shape. The sediment is thinner and thinner the farther away the sediment is from the submarine canyon. All of these layers of sedimentary rock are created thousands of feet below the ocean's surface but now the layers are visible above the surface of the water. This is because the Pacific plate and the North American plate are moving against each other; since the oceanic plate is lower, it is being forced below the continental plate in a process called subduction. While the oceanic plate is being subducted, the continental plate is scraping off the top layers of the oceanic plate slowly bringing them to the surface.  Activities  The activities at Salt Point include hiking, camping, fishing, tide pooling, picnicking and scuba diving. There are over of hiking trails and over sixty camp sites. The hiking trails are throughout the park, and many of them lead to the beach. There are only a few sandy beaches at Salt Point, some with picnic areas with benches and barbecues. Salt Point has one of the first underwater parks in California: Gerstle Cove. Gerstle Cove is protected with no fishing allowed. Only small boats and scuba divers are allowed in Gerstle Cove. Much of the marine life can be viewed while the tide is out. The tide pools provide many different organisms including sea anemones and starfish.

She was later named USS Repose. Construction and design Relief was built for the Maine Steamship Company in 1895‚Äì96 by the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works of Chester, Pennsylvania as the passenger ship John Englis. A sister ship, Horatio Hall, was also constructed for the company at about the same time. The two vessels were powered by triple expansion steam engines operating at 180 lbs of steam pressure, and were capable of making 16 knots in favorable conditions. Their passenger accommodations, which included dining saloons on the upper deck, were said to be \\"very fine\\".Bradlee, pp. 77‚Äì78. Service history Relief off Cuba in 1898, serving as a United States Army hospital ship during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Small boats such as those pictured carried wounded and sick men from shore to Relief.X-rayed aboard Relief off Siboney, Cuba, in 1898 while Relief was in U.S. Army service during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. John Englis was completed in December 1896 and was placed on the New York‚ÄìMaine route, in which she is said to have been well patronized. In 1898 however, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out, and John Englis was purchased by the United States Army for use as a hospital ship. Renamed Relief the ship was found to have insufficient coal capacity for safe trans Pacific navigation and was confined to Philippine waters based in Manila where as of 1 January 1900 she was reported to be a \\"floating hospital\\" with 107 sick and wounded after a trip to outlying areas. The ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy 13 November 1902. Relief remained inactive into 1908 at Mare Island Navy Yard while factions within the navy debated whether she should be commanded by a line officer or a medical officer. President Theodore Roosevelt's desire that a hospital ship accompany the Great White Fleet on its round-the-world voyage led to his endorsement of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery viewpoint. Accordingly, Relief was commissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard 6 February 1908, Surgeon Charles F. Stokes, USN, in command. Departing San Francisco Bay 22 March 1908, Relief met the fleet in Magdalena Bay, Mexico, embarking patients for return to San Francisco. Relief rejoined the fleet at San Diego and remained with it while crossing the Pacific Ocean. Reliefs staff provided expert medical care, treatment, and consultations for the more than 14,000 officers and men of the Great White Fleet until detached in November 1908 at Olongapo, Philippines. Ordered to return to the U.S. west coast, Relief departed Cavite 14 November 1908 but suffered serious damage in a typhoon on the night of 18 and 19 November. Returning to Cavite, the hospital ship was subsequently found to be unseaworthy by an official survey and became a stationary, floating hospital and dispensary. Relief continued in service as a floating hospital at Olongapo, Philippines, through World War I, although decommissioned 10 June 1910. Her name was changed 11 April 1918 to Repose to allow that of Relief to be assigned to , a new hospital ship under construction at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Repose was sold 15 May 1919 at Olongapo and entered mercantile service under the same name after repairs. She subsequently served under foreign flags as Hai Ning and Mindanao until transferred to Philippine registry during 1937 and named Lanao.

He transformed the festival from a summer program for semi-professional actors into one of the top regional theaters in the country by leading the Ashland, Oregon-based company beyond its Shakespearean repertoire. He produced plays by Bertold Brecht, Henrik Ibsen, George Bernard Shaw, and August Strindberg and added the Angus Bowmer Theatre in 1970 and the Black Swan in 1977 to the festival's original theater, the Elizabethan Stage. Biography Jerry Turner was born in Loveland, Colorado during 1927. Turner earned a BA and MA at the University of Colorado and a PhD in theatre from the University of Illinois. He began his career at OSF as an actor in 1957 and as a director in 1959. From 1957 to 1964 he also was associate professor of drama and department chairman at Humboldt State College and from 1964 to 1970 he was professor and chairman of the department of drama at the University of California, Riverside. In 1970 he received a UC Humanities Institute Fellowship to study theatre in Sweden. He learned Swedish, and later learned Norwegian, and returned to the U.S. to become Oregon Shakespeare Festival‚Äôs second producing director, then its artistic director (a title change only), retiring in 1991. Turner died of heart failure on September 2, 2004. Oregon Shakespeare Festival Turner directed more than 40 productions at OSF, including The Iceman Cometh, Julius Caesar, King Lear, Long Day's Journey into Night, Major Barbara, Macbeth, Mother Courage and Her Children, Pericles Prince of Tyre, The Tempest, and The White Devil. He directed a number of his own translations of Swedish and Norwegian plays including The Dance of Death, An Enemy of the People, The Father, Ghosts, Peer Gynt, Rosmersholm, and The Wild Duck. Turner loved both classical texts and new work, and always sought to find in both ways to surprise and stimulate audiences. He was considered both a risk-taker and a traditionalist. ‚ÄúExpanding an audience‚Äôs horizons doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean doing new work,‚Äù he said in a 1987 interview for the festival‚Äôs program notes. The danger isn't so much not doing new work as in ignoring the old work. Besides, just because a play was written a long time ago doesn't make it old.‚Äù Awards and recognition Under Turner's leadership, OSF received the Antoinette Perry Award (Tony Award) in 1983. Turner also received an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters at Pacific University in 1985, the George Norlin Alumni Award from the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1989, the Oregon Governor's Award for the Arts in 1991, and the St. Olav's Medal from King Harald V of Norway in 1996.

Samuel succeeded his father as minister in 1758, a position which he held until his death. Samuel Stennett received a Doctorate of Divinity from King's College, Aberdeen in 1763. Although friend and supporter to the reigning monarch, George III, Stennett refused political opportunities to devote himself to ministry. He attained prominence amongst the Dissenting ministry and used his influence with political figures in behalf of Dissenters prevented from fully participating in society, especially as teachers, under the Clarendon Code. Stennett authored some 39 hymns, five of which appeared in Rippon's Selection, which was published in 1787. His grandfather, Joseph Stennett, had also been a prominent Dissenting hymn writer. Samuel continued this tradition, although with less passionate language than had marked his grandfather's Puritan- influenced notions of Christian experience.

It was released on October 8 and distributed by Universal- International. Plot Chester Wooley (Lou Costello) and Duke Egan (Bud Abbott) are traveling salesmen who make a stopover in Wagon Gap, Montana while en route to California. During the stopover, a notorious criminal, Fred Hawkins, is murdered, and the two are charged with the crime. They are quickly tried, convicted, and sentenced to die by hanging. The head of the local citizen's committee, Jim Simpson (William Ching), recalls a law whereby the survivor of a gun duel must take responsibility for the deceased's debts and family. The law spares the two from execution, but Chester is now responsible for the widow Hawkins (Marjorie Main) and her seven children. They go to her farm, where Chester is worked by Mrs. Hawkins from dawn to dusk. To make matters worse, Chester must work at the saloon at night to repay Hawkin's debt to its owner, Jake Frame (Gordon Jones). Her plan is to wear Chester down until he agrees to marry her. Chester quickly learns that no one will harm him, for fear that they will have to support Mrs. Hawkins and her family. Simpson makes Chester the sheriff in hopes that the fear of him will help clean up the lawless town. For protection, Chester carries around a photograph of Mrs. Hawkins and her kids. The approach works for a while, and Chester is heralded as a hero. Meanwhile, Duke still plans to go to California and tries to get Judge Benbow (George Cleveland) to marry Mrs. Hawkins, in order to free him and Chester from their obligations. He starts a rumor that Mrs. Hawkins is about to become rich once the railroad buys her land to lay tracks. The rumor takes on a life of its own, with everyone trying to kill Chester in hopes of marrying Mrs. Hawkins (and becoming wealthy in the process). Frame eventually confesses to Hawkins' murder; Duke and Chester are cleared and allowed to leave town, but not before they admit that the railroad rumor was fabricated by them. Benbow still wants to marry Mrs. Hawkins, and she agrees. She then announces that the railroad actually did offer her substantial money, and she is now wealthy.

On 29 April 1534 Cardinal de Coligny's nomination to the metropolitan see of Toulouse by King Francis I was approved in Consistory by Pope Clement VII,Gulik and Eubel, p. 315. despite his never having been ordained a priest.Christol, p. 3: N'ayant jamais re√ßu la pr√©trise, il resta diacre tout sa vie. \\"Never having been ordained a priest, he remained a deacon his entire life.\\" The Cardinal required a dispensation for the archbishopric, since he was only sixteen, far below the minimum canonical age. The dispensation was granted by Pope Clement on 28 August 1534. On 6 September 1534, Odet de Coligny was ordained Subdeacon, and on 13 September he was ordained Deacon.Delettre, pp. 200. Archbishop of Toulouse, Bishop of Beauvais Ch√¢tillon held the post of Administrator of the diocese of Toulouse, never having been consecrated a bishop, until his resignation from that role on 20 October 1550. At the age of seventeen, he participated in the papal conclave of 11‚Äì12 October 1534, in which Cardinal Alessandro Farnese was elected Pope Paul III. A year later, on 20 October 1535, his nomination to the See of Beauvais was approved in Consistory by Pope Paul III. He held the Administratorship of Beauvais until he was deprived of all his offices and benefices by Pope Pius IV in 1563.Gulik and Eubel, p. 131. The spiritual functions of the Bishop of Beauvais were carried out from 1535-1538 by Philibert de Beaujeu, titular Bishop of Bethlehem; from 1538 to 1546 the bishop was Antoine le Tonnelier, titular Bishop of Damascus; the Bishop of Hippo from 1546 to 1555; the Bishop of Hebron served from 1555 to 1556; the Bishop of Sebaste from 1556-1563; and from 1563 to 1569, Bishop Philippe le Musnier.Delettre, pp. 202. The Cardinal was named Abbot of Saint-Lucien de Beauvais by the King in 1537. He was still holding the benefice in 1553, though it is not known whether he continued to hold it until his deposition on 31 March 1563.Gallia christiana 9 (Paris 1751), p. 786. Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon took part in the Ninth Session of the Ecumenical Council of Trent, which opened on 13 December 1545.Delettre, pp. 213. King Francis I died on 31 March 1547, and it was reported a week later by Sir Edward Wotton, the English Ambassador, that Cardinal Odet and his brother Fran√ßois were among the chief favorites of Henri II.Atkinson, p. 174. As a Peer of France, Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon attended the funeral of Francis I in Saint Denis, and the Coronation of Henri II at Rheims on 26 July.Delettre, pp. 213. Henri II Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon participated in the papal conclave of 29 November 1549 ‚Äì 7 February 1550. He arrived late, however, on 12 December, along with Cardinals de Guise, du Bellay, Vendome, and Tournon.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante of 1549-1550. Retrieved: 2016-04-30. A letter that he wrote to the Constable de Montmorency on 31 January 1550, during the Conclave, provides an intimate view of the politics of the conclave, and provides an account of the sudden death of one of the leading candidates, Cardinal Niccol√≤ Ridolfi, a nephew of Pope Leo X. Ridolfi had been greatly favored by King Henri II of France. He opted for the deaconry of S. Adriano on 25 February 1549. Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon obtained from Pope Julius III the necessary bulls for his confirmation as Abbot of Fontainejean, in the diocese of Sens, shortly after the new Pope's election. The monastery was burned and the monks slaughtered in 1562.Gallia christiana 12 (Paris: Typographia regia 1770), p. 230. The Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon, who had apostasized in favor of Calvinism, was deprived of all of his benefices by Pope Pius IV on 31 March 1563. The Cardinal did not stay long in Italy after the papal Coronation. He was back in France by 4 March, when he was at Orl√©ans; on 11 March 1550, he wrote a letter from Ch√¢tillon; and on 29 May he was following the Court again and was in Boulogne, which King Henri had entered in triumph on 15 May after the city's capture from the English.Marlet (ed.), Correspondance d'Odet de Coligny, p. 8, note 2 and p. 11. On 20 October 1550 Cardinal Odet de Ch√¢tillon was appointed Abbot Commendatory of Saint Jean de Sens.L. Marlet (ed.), Correspondance d'Odet de Coligny, p. 12 n. 2. Cf. Gallia christiana 12, p. 199. He also became the seventy-seventh Abbot, the fifth Abbot Commendatory, of the royal Abbey of Fleury, also known as the Abbey of St. Beno√Æt-sur-Loire. puts the acquisition in 1551. L. Marlet (ed.), Correspondance d'Odet de Coligny, p. 10, note 2, places the date of the grant on 20 October 1550. He held this benefice until he was deposed in 1563, though the abbey was sacked by the Huguenot army of the Prince de Cond√© in 1562. Protector of Ronsard and Rabelais As a member of the King's Council, Ch√¢tillon was placed in charge of the library of France's Royal Privy Council and, using this and his other offices, he protected his friends Ronsard and Rabelais.Christol, pp. 7-12. In this he was working with Cardinal Jean du Bellay, who had been Rabelais' original protector. In 1552, after the Cardinal had obtained for the latter a ten-year monopoly on book-printing, Rabelais dedicated his Quart Livre of Pantagruel to Odet in gratitude. The Dedicatory Epistle is dated 28 January 1552. The first edition, without the Cardinal's letter, was printed anonymously in 1548. In 1553 he succeeded Cardinal Claude de Longuy de Givry as Abbot Commendatory of Saint B√©nigne de Dijon, and held the benefice until he was deposed in 1563.Gallia christiana 4, pp. 693-694. In 1554 the Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon ordered published the Synodial Constitutions of the Diocese of Beauvais, containing some twenty-one chapters on the duties and conduct of the clergy, including the requirement that they keep their beards shaved (la barbe rase) and their hair cut short.Delettre, pp. 216-217. The Cardinal, according to his portraits, wore a full beard, which was becoming the fashion, and had very well trimmed hair. The statutes, in fact, were a reworking of those promulgated twenty-five years earlier. In 1556 he became Abbot Commendatory of the Abbey of Ferri√®res on the appointment of King Henry II, with the confirmation of Pope Pius IV. Four years later, Pius named him grand inquisitor of France, though the French Parliament's opposition to the Inquisition prevented him from taking up the post. Sometime after 1560 Cardinal Odet also became abbot of Grandchamps, of the Cistercian abbey of N√¥tre Dame de Quincy in the diocese of Langres,Gallia christiana 4, p. 833. and (from 1555, at least) of V√©zelay. Finally, then, he was from 1554 to 1559 Prior (and from 14 August 1559 the Provost) of St-Pierre de M√¢con. Colloquy of Poissy Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon participated in the famous Colloquy of Poissy in the summer of 1561. When the reformer Theodore de Beze arrived in Poissy on 23 August he was met with great ceremony and obvious pleasure by the King of Navarre, the Prince de Cond√© and the Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon, almost with more honor (wrote Claude Haton) than the Pope of Rome would have received had he come. Protestant career Odet de Coligny as a Protestant general On 22 May 1558 Giovanni Michiel, the Venetian Ambassador to the French Court, which was at Monceau at the time, wrote that Fran√ßois d'Andelot, General of the Infantry and Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon's brother, had been arrested at Court on a charge of having participated in a meeting and procession of Protestants in the meadows beyond the Faubourg St. Germain, which was repeated day after day during the week. The Cardinal of Sens, Jean Bertrand, had been sent to investigate, and had ordered some one hundred persons in Paris arrested. When questioned Fran√ßois d'Andelot did not deny his affiliation with the Protestants, and he was sent under guard to Meaux, where he was confined. His wife was allowed to join him, but the King, who was very angry, also sent along several of his gentlemen to talk to him, as well as several professors from the Sorbonne, but he remained obstinate in his admitted affiliation. His brother, Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon, was also under suspicion of holding the same opinions, \\"and should they choose to go investigating matters farther,\\" wrote the Ambassador, \\"I understand that many others of much higher grade will be discovered.\\"Atkinson, p. 175. In fact, under his family's influence, the Cardinal eventually went over to the Protestant camp himself, becoming a Calvinist Huguenot in April 1561.. He was not the only French prelate to convert to Calvinism in this period ‚Äì one other example is Jean de Monluc, bishop of Valence. On Easter Monday (7 April 1561‚Äîactually 1562)Delettre, p. 228, places the event in 1562. The discrepancy is probably calendrical, with Delettre more likely correct. The calendar, according to the old style, changed on Easter from 1561 to 1562. the Cardinal celebrated the Eucharist in the Episcopal Palace at Beauvais.Atkinson, p. 175. This was doubly offensive, first of all because he had never been ordained a priest and had no right to celebrate the Mass, and secondly because he celebrated the Eucharist in a rite similar to the Calvinist ritual used in Geneva. The result in Beauvais was rioting, which embarrassed and alarmed the Cardinal, who sent for the Governor of the √éle-de-France, Fran√ßois de Montmorency, to put down the disorders, but the mayor of Beauvais had already taken care to inform Montmorency what was going on, and Montmorency countermanded the Cardinal's demand. He came to Beauvais alone, and discovered that the peace had already been restored. The people threw themselves on the mercy of the King, and the Queen-mother granted their supplication.Delettre, pp. 231-232. Catherine de' Medici was eager to retain the services of the Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon as a bridge between Catholics and Protestants, hoping to use him to keep the peace between the two and thus preserve the monarchy for her children. On several occasions, even after his apostasy, she wrote him friendly letters requesting his help. At the same time, Philippe de Lenoncourt, the Bishop of Auxerre and brother of Cardinal de Lenoncourt, was writing to the Pope, urging him to strip Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon of his red hat. On 21 May 1562, however, the Cardinal was cited to appear before the Roman Inquisition, and, having failed to appear, the sentence against him was published in Beauvais on 29 September 1562.Atkinson, p. 175. When the Constable de Montmorency himself wrote to the Pope in favor of the Cardinal, a second summons was issued, on 17 November, which was published in Beauvais on 10 January 1563. The Royal Council then attempted to intervene, on the grounds that the summons was a violation of the royal prerogative. But the apostasy of a cardinal could not be overlooked by the Papacy. This intervention failed and brought about the Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon's excommunication and deposition on 31 March 1563.Atkinson, p. 176. The sentence was not carried out in France, however, where it was claimed that the law required that a bishop be judged by his fellow bishops.Delettre, p. 237. Gathering a faction around himself, he greatly helped those of the Huguenot party. He participated with his brother in the religious wars and acted as a mediator between the Protestants and Queen Catherine de' Medici. In 1562, he escaped the Inquisition to Lyon, relinquished his title of cardinal and called himself the count of Beauvais (comte de Beauvais), after his old bishopric. In the secret consistory of 31 March 1563, Pope Pius IV and the French parliament excommunicated him as a heretic and deprived him of all his offices. Marriage In December 1564, probably on 1 December, the Cardinal married his mistress Ysabel de Hauteville (Isabeau or Isabelle de Hauteville, also known as Elizabeth de Kanteville or Mme. la Cardinale) at Montataire, in a ceremony conducted by a Huguenot minister, Pierre Melet. The Cardinal appeared with his wife, wearing his cardinal's robes, at the Coming of Age ceremony of King Charles IX.Atkinson, p. 179. He fought at the Battle of Saint-Denis and in 1568 fled to England. On 5 September 1568 the Cardinal wrote a letter to King Charles IX from the village of S√©narpont,Correspondence d'Odet de Coligny, pp. 89-90. A similar letter was sent to Queen Catherine de' Medici, pp. 90-92. informing him that he had discovered a plan of his enemies to seize him in his house, and therefore he was fleeing from his house and from the kingdom. On 8 September he wrote to Queen Elizabeth, seeking asylum in England.Crosby (1871), p. 541, no. 2500; and p. 544, no. 2512. Atkinson, p. 182 On 14 September the Cardinal wrote to King Charles again, and also to Catherine de' Medici, this time from London, begging the King to continue to hold him in his favor, and stating that he was not in England for any purpose, and that he had only decided to go to England some three hours before he left his house.Crosby (1871), p. 547, no. 2526. In London, he requested monetary support for the French Protestants from Queen Elizabeth, who favoured him and his wife. He took up residence at Shene, from which he frequently wrote letters to Sir William Cecil, the Secretary of State, on behalf of Protestants, whether soldiers, merchants or refugees from the Civil War which was going on in France. In November 1568, Ch√¢tillon obtained permission to return to France, intending to sail to Rochelle, which was in Protestant hands and where he was expected, but bad winds at Portsmouth prevented his crossing.Crosby (1874), p. 368, no. 1389. On 10 January 1569, Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon was commissioned by the Queen of Navarre, the Princes of Navarre, the Prince of Cond√©, and the other Protestant leaders, to seek aid from the Queen of England in the Third War of Religion.Crosby (1874), p. 10, no. 37. In February 1569, the Cardinal was in Canterbury.Crosby (1874), p. 400, no. 1539-1540. In 1568, his former abbacy of Ferri√®res was besieged by the troops of Louis de Cond√©, friend of the Coligny family and fellow Protestant. The abbey was pillaged and profaned and, although no monks were killed, the reliquaires and treasures of the abbey were dispersed, the tombs of Louis III, Carloman and Louis de Blanchefort heavily damaged and the monks' stalls removed. Cardinal Odet, though abroad by then, intervened to stop this. On 19 and 23 May 1569, the Parliament of Paris deprived the Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon of all of his honors, offices, and estates, his dignity as Peer of the Realm, and the income of all of his benefices.Atkinson, p. 222. The Cardinal's brother Fran√ßois also died, on 27 May 1569. Death On 9 October 1570, having taken leave of Queen Elizabeth and his other friends at Court, Ch√¢tillon set off for Southampton, intending to cross to France. He was preparing to go from England to La Rochelle to join his brother. Bad weather, however, prevented him from embarking, and in the meantime, on 29 October, he was granted the Freedom of Southampton by the burgesses.Atkinson, p. 245. On November 10 he was still prevented from crossing, a fire having broken out in the ship he was to use, and he decided therefore to change his plans and to go to Picardy instead of La Rochelle, though at that point he was impeded by the very bad health of his wife. He returned to London, where he joined the French Ambassador de la Mothe F√©nelon in discussions on the subject of the proposed marriage of the 19 year old Francis, Duke of Anjou and Alen√ßon, to the thirty-seven year old Elizabeth. On 6 December the Cardinal left London for Canterbury, though in mid-January 1571 he was back at the English Court and discussions on the Anjou marriage continued. On 25 January he left London again, and not in good health. He grew worse, and at the end of February he was suffering from 'fits'.Atkinson, p. 247-248, 250. On 2 March, Henry Killibrew wrote to his employer Cecil that he had just tried to see the Cardinal, who at first could not receive him, but later in the day he was sent for and found the Cardinal 'weak and faint'. On 13 March Lord Cobham in London wrote to Dover Castle that the Cardinal was attempting to arrange a stay in an execution there, until he could plead at Court, which, the Cardinal said, would be very soon. But on the evening of 21 March 1571, the Cardinal lost the ability to speak, and shortly thereafter died. He died at the former pilgrims' lodge at Canterbury under mysterious circumstances (possibly poisoned by his servant, perhaps on the orders of the French government). His tomb at Canterbury CathedralQueen Elizabeth ordered a Commission of Inquiry into the cause of his death. The Cardinal's wife gave testimony that she believed that he had been given slow poison, and that the proof was in his perforated stomach, discovered at the autopsy. This, however, was most definitely not the opinion of the Cardinal's physicians. The doctors pointed out that when the body was opened, the lungs and liver were also damaged; the stomach, however, was 'raw'. But the Commission could find no evidence of a poisoner, and would not have considered poisoning, had it not been for the insistence of Lady Ch√¢tillon.Atkinson, p. 252-254. Atkinson, who is strongly in favor of the poisoning theory, and frames his judgment in despite of the facts he enumerates, chooses to blame the Guises and Catherine de' Medici. Marlet (p. 209) blames a valet of the Cardinal, one Vuillin. The Cardinal was therefore buried in a temporary and very plain tomb covered in hessian and plaster in the Trinity Chapel in the east end of Canterbury Cathedral. It was meant to have been a temporary solution pending his body's return to France, but the transfer never occurred, and he still rests there.

Opened in the fall of 1970, it was for a long time the sole high school operating in Richland School District Two, replacing Dentsville High School. History The school had an unusual design. The main building was divided into octagonal 'pods', each containing eight chevron-shaped classrooms. This design was borne out of the open classroom concept that was popular during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the school's early days, classrooms within each pod had no walls, allowing students to participate in any one of several classes occurring at one time. This did not prove successful, and walls were later added to separate the classroom pods by the early 1980s. In 2008, a new three story building replaced the pods as the new school building, integrating the original gymnasium and fine arts buildings as the only remaining pieces of the original campus. On October 26, 2015, a Richland County sheriff's deputy who was serving as Spring Valley's school resource officer was called to a classroom to remove a female student from her classroom. The female student was arrested on a charge called \\"disturbing schools\\" for refusing to give up her cell phone and leave the room. She was then pulled from the desk by the officer, thrown to the floor and handcuffed. Another female student in the classroom was also charged with disturbing schools after she allegedly yelled and cursed at the officer. The officer was fired after an internal review found that his actions ran counter to sheriff's department policy. The FBI and the US Department of Justice are investigating to determine if the deputy violated the student's civil rights. In response to the incident, South Carolina lawmakers, led by Rep. Mia McLeod, have proposed limitations to the state statute that defines when students can be arrested for disrupting schools. School district administrators also promised to conduct additional staff training about when to involve school resource officers in future incidents. Magnet programs The discovery magnet program is designed for talented students and focuses on science and math, first founded in 1995. These courses are honors level and required for all members of the Discovery program. All discovery members are required to complete two college-level research projects during their sophomore and junior year. The completion of at least four AP courses (one math, one science, two others) is required for graduation from the discovery program. The explorations program is the sister program to discovery. The program focuses on math and science, and is a college-preparatory program, as opposed to an honors program.

It was previously named Chinaman's Peak but the name was changed to be less offensive. It was the subject of a 2018 CBC Documentary titled 'Ha Ling Peak' that follows the controversy and renaming of the mountain . Origin of the name The name of the mountain has been subject to much controversy. Originally, the mountain was referred to locally as The Beehive. In 1896 Ha Ling, a Chinese cook for the Canadian Pacific Railway (some say the Okaloosa Hotel in Canmore) was bet 50 dollars that he could not climb the peak and plant a flag on the summit in less than 10 hours. According to the Medicine Hat News of October 22, 1896, he started the ascent at 7:00 am the previous Saturday morning and was back in time for lunch. As nobody believed his story, he led a party of doubters to the summit where he planted a much larger flag beside the original, this one visible to the naked eye from Canmore. The townsfolk referred to the mountain as Chinaman's Peak in his honour. The name Chinaman's Peak did not become official until 1980. Later, in 1997 it was renamed Ha Ling Peak as the term Chinaman was viewed as derogatory. Climbing routes There is a hiking route up the south side. On the north side there are several technical climbing routes up the face and a difficult scrambling route up Canmore Couloir, located between Mount Lawrence Grassi and Miner's Col.

Slight Side lies at the south western edge of the Scafell Massif, a four kilometre long crescent of high ground which includes the highest ground in England. The fells names derives from the Old Norse language and means \\"The mountain shieling with the level pastures\\", it is a combination of the Norse words \\"sletta\\" and \\"saetr\\". With a shieling meaning a shepherds hut or a mountain pasture used in the summer. Topography When viewed from the valley of Eskdale the fell is seen as a distinct peak but in reality it is just the terminal point on Scafell‚Äôs southern ridge before it descends steeply to Eskdale. It only has 14 metres of topographic prominence between itself and Scafell (the col is at 748 metres) and therefore narrowly fails to qualify as a Nuttall hill or a Hewitt and it is left to Alfred Wainwright to give Slight Side the status of a separate fell in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. Slight Side is steep and craggy on all sides except to the north where the ridge runs to Scafell. The eastern flank falls to the valley of the infant River Esk while the slopes to the west descend across Eskdale Fell towards Burnmoor Tarn. Horn Crag stands to the south of the summit overlooking Eskdale. Just under a kilometre to the north past the 748m col is Long Green which is the summit of Cam Spout crags. When viewed from a distance (see picture) or even when walking, Long Green can be mistaken for the summit of Slight Side. Cam Spout Crag is a rock climbing location, although not a particularly busy one, with 12 climbs including Cam Spout Buttress and Eskdale Grooves. Ascents The Ascent of Slight Side is started from Eskdale and is usually done in conjunction with the ascent of Scafell and possibly Scafell Pike as well. The ascent starts from the hamlet of Boot and takes the path which passes Eel Tarn and Stony Tarn before crossing bouldery ground to climb the broad ridge to the summit. Scafell stands two kilometres to the north and is reached by a vertical ascent of 230 metres. The fell can be bagged with little effort while descending to Eskdale from Scafell by the southern ridge. Summit The summit of Slight Side is a fine rocky peak and is listed by Alfred Wainwright as one of the six best summits in the Lake District, calling it ‚Äúrocky, shapely and well defined and can be attained only by a rough final scramble‚Äù. The highlight of the view from the summit is the vista westward towards the sea.

By Richard Wilson, circa 1749.Francis Ayscough, National Portrait Gallery, London, Accessed June 2009 Ainscough is an Old Norse, Scandinavian surname,. also spelled Ayscough, Aiskew, Askew, Ascough and Aynscough. Origins and variants It is thought that the name is derived from the Norse words \\"ask skog\\", although other sources suggest that Aiskew is a corruption of the words \\"Eiki Skogr\\" translating to Oak Wood. An alternative Swedish translation for the name \\"enskog\\" is \\"juniper forest\\". The \\"en\\" part of the word meaning juniper, \\"skog\\" meaning wood or forest. Today the name is pronounced .Wells, John C. (2008), Longman Pronunciation Dictionary (3rd ed.). Other suggestions indicate that the name Ainscough is of French origin. When William the Conqueror invaded England, he brought his army of knights. These knights from Normandy were given land for their effort during the invasion and were placed as his head of government in each Shire. Wikipedia has information about a plaque placed in Normandy Cathedral before leaving for England. This plaque has a list of knights. There are 2 knights listed as \\"Ansgot\\" which would have been the French spelling for Ainscough. However, further evidence is required to support this translation of the name.

Lancashire Ainscoughs Recent research'Townships: Scarisbrick', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3 (1907), pp. 265-276. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41332&strquery;=Aykescough Date accessed: 11 June 2009 shows that there are references to Ainscoughs in the Ormskirk area as early as the 13thC - William of Ainscough was a beneficiary to the church in Ormskirk; and there is a reference in 'The Cartulary of Burscough Priory' (1199-c1230) to a piece of land in the Scarisbrick estate called Aykescogh (Oak Wood) in the 12thC. In the same document the spelling of the name changes, in 1199 this is referred to as a place called 'Ayscogh', but then changes just 50 years later to 'Aykescogh' (1245-c1260). Some genealogical sources give the English-Scottish borders as the origin of the family, others claim Cumberland as the source. Given the various theories on the derivation of the name, it is possible that there were other, independent lineages with the same surname. Ralph Ainscough (b. 1899 in Horwich) recorded his grandfather Ralph (b. 1841 in Aspull) telling him that older generations of the Ainscoughs - e.g. William (b. 1816 in Blackrod) had pronounced the name as \\"Ainsker\\". There is some documentary evidence for this as William's younger brother Charles (b. 1818 in Blackrod) gave his name as \\"Insker\\" on moving to Staffordshire in the 1840s. Some Yorkshire names acquired an internal \\"n\\" when crossing the Pennines into Lancashire. \\"Ainsker\\" may well have originated as \\"Aisker\\" - which is not far removed from the Anglo-Saxon \\"Aiks keogh\\" or oak wood. Given the common nature of places as surname origins, it is possible that there was more than one distinct line with the same surname. Evidence of origin from the International Genealogical Index (IGI) is mixed and inconclusive. The IGI itself is a valuable but flawed resource. The current online database - which I shall term \\"IGI 2\\" - contains records contributed by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), many of which are questionable. The original pass through Britain's parish records by LDS members was free of personal contributions and was available on microfiches in such centres as the library of the Society of Genealogists. I shall term this database \\"IGI 1\\". This original database excluded many Catholic records, owing to the reluctance of Catholic priests to allow their records being transcribed by the LDS. It also failed to record some nonconformist register entries. Given these caveats, an examination of the 1,623 records of Ainscoughs in Lancashire in the original IGI 1 shows that the earliest recorded event was the christening of Thomas Ainscough - son of John - on 27 April 1549 in Chorley. The next was the marriage of Kateryn Aynscow to John Brindill (Katherine Ainscough & John Brindle) on 17 January 1550 in the parish of Chorley. In the same year, on 20 January and in the same parish, Richard Aynscow married \\"Jone Leeds\\". John, Katherine and Richard may have been siblings and quite possibly were born in the 1520s. The records in IGI 1 are drawn almost exclusively from Anglican records, but these three Ainscoughs may well have come from the Lincolnshire connection.

Lincolnshire Ayscoughs (also known as Askews) The following theory was put forward by researchers in the 1970s but seems unlikely, since earlier evidence has been found showing Ainscoughs existed in Lancashire prior to a possible migration from Lincolnshire. The Lincolnshire Ayscough family originated from Bedale and owned estates around Stallingborough, Ashby, South Kelsey, Basford, Nuthall and Spalding. Ayscoughfee Hall, now a preserved manor house in Spalding, was originally built by the rich wool merchant, Richard Alwyn in 1420 and then it was owned by the Lincolnshire Ayscough family in the early part of the 16th Century. The grant of land at Spalding was made to Sir William Ayscough (b.1490-d.1541) by Henry VIII. E.H. Gooch writes about \\"Ayscoughfee Hall\\" in his book \\"The History of Spalding\\", 1940. In the 15th Century the Ayscoughs had supported the Lancastrian side during the Wars of the Roses and later held posts at the Courts of Henry VII and Henry VIII. Sir William Askew of Stallingborough was knighted in 1513 during the reign of Henry VIII, his eldest son Sir Francis Ayscough was knighted \\"at the wining of Boulogne\\" and was Sheriff of Lincoln in 1545, 1549 and 1554. He died in 1564 and is buried at St Mary's Church, South Kelsey, Lincolnshire. Sir William's youngest son Edward Ayscough (d.1558) was cup-bearer to Henry VIII from 1539‚Äì1547. Anne Askew (Ayscough) Kyme (1521‚Äì1546), the English Protestant and persecuted heretic was also the daughter of Sir William. Unfortunately for Anne her zealousness led to her execution and she was burned at the stake for heresy in 1546. Reluctantly, the Ayscough family got caught up in the Lincolnshire Rising in 1536, a Catholic uprising against Henry VIII of England, against the dissolution of the monasteries. Sir William had ridden to Louth to keep the peace and uphold the law but instead found himself taken 'prisoner' by the rebels and was expected to represent their cause. Following this the Ayscough family fell out of favour with Henry VIII. However, Sir Francis continued to prosper by his own volition taking every opportunity to acquire land and so add to his estates. He died a convinced Protestant, clearly shown by the wording of his will. It is claimed (evidence required) that over the period which followed many of the Lincolnshire Ayscough family lost their estates, they migrated west to Lancashire, where they settled in the area around Mawdesley, near Croston, bleak wastes in the 16thC, as Farmers and Millers. However it does not seem possible to find specific evidence for this link, and without evidence the Lincolnshire origin seems increasingly tenuous. Researchers are requested to continue to investigate. Sir Isaac Newton is also from an Ayscough family line, Hannah Ayscough his mother and possibly James Ascough born 1585, Ormskirk, Lancashire, his grandfather. Gloucestershire and Middlesex Askews Askew Road, Shepherd's Bush Another Askew family, from Gloucestershire, also owned land in Hammersmith, near Shepherd's Bush, historically part of Middlesex. Once the area was built up in the 19th century, a formerly rural road west of Shepherd's Bush, previously called Starch Green, was named Askew Road, while another nearby road was named Askew Crescent, both after the family. There was also once a pub at the north end of Askew Road called The Askew Arms, which is now an Irish pub. Expansion, employment and trade Derelict flour mill - H&R; Millers, Burscough. Image: Barbara Ainscough 2007. Early records come from the Churches of Croston, Ormskirk and Standish in Lancashire. Many Lancashire Ainscough families were Yeoman farmers and some of the family continued farming until the period of industrialisation. The Milling company of H & R Ainscough (Hugh and Richard of Parbold) established a successful business at Burscough and Southport. Branches of the family developed around Blackrod, and by the 19thC, across the whole of Lancashire. As industrialisation came to Lancashire, the women took work in cotton mills and the men on the railways, particularly the L&YR; and the LMS. In the early 19th century, most male - and some female - Ainscoughs in the villages of Blackrod, Haigh, Aspull were coal miners. They started as drawers, pulling coal carts, at the age of ten (until this was stopped by legislation), graduating to miners at around the age of sixteen. The area was rich in cannel coal, a high-grade, rich but volatile coal, and many mines were on the estate of the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres who lived at Haigh Hall. All but one of the five sons of Ralph (b.1782 in Blackrod) were miners - and nearly all male descendants of these Ainscoughs were also miners, as censuses from 1841 to 1901 attest. In the 1850s and 1860s, some of the Ainscough miners moved further afield to Westhoughton, Pemberton, Hindley and Ince, with some members of their families going into the silk and cotton weaving industries. In 2006 several Ainscoughs featured in the Sunday Times Rich List. Catholic tradition Many branches of the family maintained the Catholic tradition after the Reformation, for 300 years till religious tolerance eased in the 19th century, members of the family being charged with recusancy, as recorded in \\"Return of the Papists\\". Many became priests, most prominently Anthony Ainscough, Prior of Ampleforth Abbey. Business men H&R; Ainscough Hugh and Richard Ainscough were the benefactors of the RC Church, Our Lady & All Saints, Parbold founded 1884 and also the local Catholic primary school. The Catholicism or otherwise of the Lancashire Ainscoughs in general is also open to speculation. Prior to the Reformation, of course, all English people were Catholic by default. Evidence suggests that the Lincolnshire-based line Ayscough families turned away from Catholicism and towards Lutheran beliefs through the turbulent Reformation and Tudor religious periods. Many other Lancashire Ainscoughs were baptised in the Anglican churches of St. Katherine in Blackrod, and St. Peter in Bolton-le-Moors (now modern Bolton). Wesleyan Methodism also appealed to many working-class people in the mid-19th century, who saw the Anglican church as a bastion of the upper, ruling class, and there were Wesleyan chapels in many towns - such as Chorley - in Lancashire - where Ainscoughs were married. Notable Australian Ainscough *Roy Ainscough (b. 1943), who emigrated to Adelaide, South Australia to play semi-professional football for U.S.C.Lion in 1969, died on 9 October 2007 aged 64. Since his arrival in South Australia Roy had been involved will football (soccer) at all levels, mostly as a coach. Roy also represented South Australia on several occasions including a game against an English FA representative side. Mr Ainscough was brought up in Rawmarsh and Parkgate and went on to become a hard tackling defender and midfielder for several top local sides. He died in the lakeside town of Barmera, South Australia, where he emigrated to in 1969 after leaving his job at the Parkgate Iron and Steel Company. His wife Carleen telephoned former Denaby United secretary Barrie Dalby with the sad news at the weekend. Beginning his footballing career at Wath Wanderers, Mr Ainscough moved to Rawmarsh Welfare in the Yorkshire League under the tutelage of former Rotherham United goalkeeper George Warnes. He then jumped into the Midland League with Denaby United under another former Football League shot stopper, ex-Barnsley keeper Harry Hough. Mr Ainscough was thrilled to be handed the opportunity to line up beside one of his idols, Millers legend Jack Grainger, who was playing on the wing for Denaby at the time. He also played for Mexborough Town who were an emerging force in the Yorkshire League but returned to Denaby's Tickhill Square ground which he always considered his true football home. The demise of the club greatly saddened Mr Ainscough and he was said to have never understood the reasons given by those responsible for what he saw as depriving the area of part of its heritage. On the day of the club's final match - 4 May 2002 - he made a poignant telephone call which was greatly appreciated by the team and officials. Despite being on the other side of the world he continued his keen interest in the fortunes of Rotherham United and was always proud of his South Yorkshire roots. He and his wife last visited the county in the autumn of 2000 and he stopped in at Tickhill Square to watch his old club and was delighted to meet up with former playing colleague Trevor Whittaker to reminisce about their time in the red and black. Mr and Mrs Ainscough had planned on coming over again earlier this year but unfortunately he was diagnosed with his illness. One of his regrets in his final months was the realisation that he would be unable to visit England again. *Jamie Ainscough (b. 1972 Sydney), an Australian rugby league player for the Western Suburbs Magpies, Newcastle Knights, St George Illawarra Dragons, New South Wales and for the Australian national rugby league team. Ainscough played for Super League club Wigan Warriors. *David Ainscough (b. 1958) Was an Australian business manager having completed his master's degree in business administration with the University of Adelaide in 1999. David also held a Graduate Diploma in Occupational Health and Safety Management from the University of South Australia. Mr Ainscough was born at the Glenelg Community Hospital and continued to reside in the City of Holdfast Bay region until his death on 13 June 2018, aged 59. At the height of his career he was employed as the Senior Manager Human Resources (Asia/Pacific Region) for global mining giant, Newmont Mining Corporation.

The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Street North ward, electing two councillors to Mendip District Council, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wells Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also part of the Mendip West ward, which elects one county councillor to Somerset County Council which is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.  Sharpham Park estate  Sharpham Park is a historic park dates back to the Bronze Age. The first known reference is a grant by King Edwy to the then Aethelwold in 957. In 1191 Sharpham Park was conferred by the soon-to-be King John I to the Abbots of Glastonbury, who remained in possession of the park and house until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. From 1539 to 1707 the park was owned by the Duke of Somerset, Sir Edward Seymour, brother of Queen Jane; the Thynne family of Longleat, and the family of Sir Henry Gould. Edward Dyer was born here in 1543. The house is now a private residence and Grade II* listed building. It was the birthplace of Sir Edward Dyer (died 1607) an Elizabethan poet and courtier, the writer Henry Fielding (1707‚Äì54), and the cleric William Gould. Also home to the Laver family, one of the largest cattle dealers in the west country in the nineteenth century. The Sharpham Park estate is now owned by Roger Saul, founder of the Mulberry fashion company, and produces organic foods specialising in spelt (an ancient cereal grain). A restoration project is underway, partly funded by the \\"Countryside Stewardship\\" scheme from DEFRA. It involves restoring, preserving and maintaining archaeological and historic features including a Bronze Age trackway and a duck decoy pond that is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. This will allow the reintroduction of red deer (Cervus elaphus) along with other rare breeds of sheep and cattle.  Sharpham Moor Plot  Nearby is the Sharpham Moor Plot Site of Special Scientific Interest, where detailed plant records exist from as far back as 1915, and continue up to the present day.  Peat extraction  Peat extraction is still active around the village. This has been a significant industry for many years in the surrounding villages of Meare, Shapwick, Ashcott, and Walton on Westhay Moor, and is remembered at the Peat Moors Centre at Westhay.

He is known for being the last amban in Tibet, appointed in March, 1908. Lien Yu, a Manchu, was appointed as the other amban. Formerly Director-General of the Sichuan - Hubei Railway and acting viceroy of Sichuan province, Zhao was the much-maligned Chinese general of the late imperial era who led military campaigns throughout Kham (eastern Tibet) and eventually reaching Lhasa in 1910, thus earning himself the nickname \\"Zhao the Butcher\\" ().ËµµÂ∞î‰∏∞ÂèäÂÖ∂Â∑¥Â°òÁªèËê•  Amban of Tibet  Zhao Erfeng crushed the Tibetan Lamas and their monasteries in the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion in Yunnan and Sichuan, he then crushed the rebels at the siege of Chantreng (now Xiangcheng County, Sichuan) which lasted from 1905 to 1906. The Tibetan Lamas had revolted against Qing rule, killing Chinese government officials, western Catholic Christian missionaries and native Christian converts, since the Tibetan Buddhist Gelug Yellow Hat sect was suspicious of the Christian missionary success. Zhao Erfeng extended Chinese rule into Kham, and was appointed Amban in 1908. Initially he worked with the 13th Dalai Lama, who had returned after fleeing from the British invasion of 1903‚Äì1904. But in 1909, they disagreed with each other strongly and Zhao Erfeng drove the Dalai Lama into exile. The Dalai Lama was installed at the palace and monastery of Potala amid popular demonstrations. The ruler, who was again given civil power at the head of their hierarchy, pardoned all the Tibetans who had given the oath to Colonel Younghusband. Things went well for a month until the lama protested to the Chinese in charge of military affairs because of the excesses of the Chinese troops on the Sichuan frontier, where they were sacking the monasteries and killing the monks. This protest served to stir up the whole question of the status of Tibet. The Amban declared that it was a Chinese province, and said he would deal with the rebels as it pleased him to do. Other questions of authority arose, and finally the Amban sent orders to 500 Chinese troops who were encamped on the outskirts of the capital, Lhasa. A few companies composed of the Dalai Lama's followers were hastily enrolled under the name of 'golden soldiers'. They tried to resist the Chinese soldiers, but, being poorly armed, were quickly overwhelmed. Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama, with three of his ministers and sixty retainers, fled through a gate at the rear of the palace enclosure, and were fired upon as they escaped through the city.From The Galveston Daily News, February 7th 1910, part of a newspaper archive. > In January 1908 the final instalment of the Tibetan indemnity was paid to > Great Britain, and the Chumbi valley was evacuated. The Dalai Lama was now > summoned to Peking, where he obtained the imperial authority to resume his > administration in place of the provisional governors appointed as a result > of the British mission.

A former Tibetan Khampa soldier named Aten recounted Tibetan memories of Zhao, calling him \\"Butcher Feng\\", claiming that he: razed Batang monastery, ordered holy texts to be used by troops as shoeliners, and mass murdered Tibetans.  Capture and death  In 1911, Zhao Erfeng, then viceroy of Sichuan, faced rebellion in Sichuan. According to Han Suyin, the main issue was control of a planned railway that would have linked Sichuan to the rest of China. He summoned troops from Wuchang, leading rebels there to see it as an opportunity to rebel. This was the background to the Wuchang Uprising, the official start of the Chinese Revolution of 1911. After battling the rebels on 22 December 1911 he was captured and beheaded by Chinese Republican Revolutionary forces who were intent on overthrowing the Qing dynasty.In The Crippled Tree by Han Suyin, the Wade-Giles spelling of his name, Chao Erfeng, was used. Before his death, Zhao attempted to convene frontier Qing troops on the Sichuan-Tibetan border to Chengdu. He himself, on the other hand, made compromises to the republican forces as if he would concede his power without violence. When the Qing reinforcement from Ya'an approached Chengdu, the head of the republican forces Yin Changheng ordered Zhao's execution. Zhao Erfeng was the younger brother of Zhao Erxun, who was also an important figure in the final years of the Qing Empire.  Controversies  Zhao's ruthless rule was criticized by later generations. He played an antagonistic role during the Railway Protection Movement and the Miao rebellion in Yongning. Like in Tibet, he massacred unarmed civilians. Both Republic of China and People's Republic of China had fairly negative official comments about Zhao Erfeng, naming him a butcher and homicidal maniac.„ÄäÂ•¥ÊâçÂ∞èÂè≤„ÄãÔºöÁàæË±êÊÄíÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊàë‰∏çÊòØË∂ôÁàæË±êÔºåÂçªÊòØÂºµÁçªÂø†ÔºåËã•‰∏çÈñãÂ∏ÇÔºåËàáÊàëÂâøÂÖ©Ê¢ùË°óÔºåÂâáËá™ÁÑ∂ÁöÜÈñãÂ∏Ç„ÄÇ„ÄçÊ≠§Ë∂ôÂ±†‰πãË´°ÊâÄÁî±‰æÜ‰πü„ÄÇ Zhao's personal conviction was to transform the region of Kham into a province directly administrated by central government. He planned to unify Sichuan, Kham and √ú-Tsang into a single administrative district in order to counter the British influence in the region as well as Dalai Lama. The bureaucratization of native officers, a policy carried out by Later Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty which deprives the political power of native officers in south western China, was the method Zhao applied to the region of Kham. Consequently, an elimination of Tibetan native rulers in Batang and Litang was implemented. By the end of his Tibetan campaign, China was able to seize the region of Kham. However, the control established by Zhao was only temporary. After the fall of Qing dynasty, Tibetans regained the control of most of the lands conquered by Zhao Erfeng. In 1912, after Zhao's death, Chinese troops withdrew from Tibet following the request of the 13th Dalai Lama. Some historians consider Zhao's Tibetan years as the first Chinese attempt to assimilate Tibet into a regular Chinese province. This means a removal of the Tibetan clergy class from their powerful status and a Han Chinese colonization of Tibet. The aftermath of Zhao's Tibetan expedition caused the region of Kham to become a centre of Tibetan nationalism. In the following years, Lhasa's attempt of unifying Amdo, Kham and √ú-Tsang into the greater Tibet stagnated due to Kham's demand for more power in the Tibetan regime. The Incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China in 1951 eventually ruled out the possibilities of an independent Tibetan nation.

With a design capacity of 3489, Santa Rita is one of the largest prisons in the United States and larger than many California state prisons. The jail is adjacent to Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin, on the Camp Parks Reserve Forces Training Area. Santa Rita has one of the highest rates of in-custody deaths for county jails in California, and has been the recipient of numerous lawsuits and class-action lawsuits regarding jail conditions and medical care. As with most jails, the majority of people incarcerated in Santa Rita are in pre-trial detention and have not been convicted of a crime. Alt URL History and facilities Administrative entrance to Santa Rita jail. The original Santa Rita Jail opened in 1947 as a replacement for Alameda's County Prison Farm. It was built on 1000 acres of Camp Schumacher, a World War II military base near the current site. By 1983, overcrowding had become an issue, and plans were established for the construction of the current $172 million facility, which opened in 1989. Funding for the jail's construction was obtained through state bonds as well as local county matching funds. The current facility is laid out in a modern decentralized \\"campus\\" design, similar to many modern prisons, one-half mile long by one-quarter mile wide. The facility has 18 separate, self-contained housing units, a \\"core\\" building containing central booking, release and administration, and a service building containing the laundry, commissary, kitchen and warehouses. Santa Rita is rated to house up to 3,489 people, making it as large or larger than many California state prisons. It is the third largest jail in California and the fifth largest in the United States, and is considered a \\"mega-jail\\". An automatic robotic cart system moves all meals, laundry, commissary items, supplies and garbage through the jail, allowing maximal restriction of prisoner movement throughout the facility. A 1.2 megawatt peak-power solar array was installed in Spring 2002 on the roofs of the housing units, supplying nearly one half of the jail's power demand during daylight hours. In May 2006, the Chevron Energy Solutions deployed a 1-megawatt fuel cell system that generates 8,000,000 kWh of electricity and of waste heat (50% and 18% of Jail's needs, respectively) from natural gas. Bomb range The Alameda County Sheriff's Office bomb range is located behind the Santa Rita Jail.Paul Thissen, \\"Errant 'MythBusters' cannonball hits home in Dublin\\", Contra Costa Times, December 2011 It has come into the public eye by being featured in many episodes of MythBusters, and named as their #1 favorite location in their Top 12 Favorite Locations special. The MythBusters will often use this bomb range to safely and legally test myths regarding explosions, projectiles, and many other myths that cannot be tested otherwise without endangering civilians, made possible by the large, open landmass that gave them plenty of room to set their tests up while giving a large distance to stand away from the blasts. In the special episode, Adam Savage praised the flexibility of the bomb range by rhetorically asking \\"What can't you do there?!\\" On December 6, 2011, while conducting an experiment on the effectiveness of various projectiles when fired out of a cannon, a MythBusters television crew sent a cannonball through the side of a house and into a minivan in a nearby Dublin neighborhood. The projectile had missed its intended target and instead soared , striking a house and leaving a hole, before striking the roof of another house and smashing through a window of a parked minivan.

He is best remembered today for his interest in the music of African-Americans around the turn of the 20th century. Gilbert was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, and attended the New England Conservatory; among his teachers were Edward MacDowell, for composition, and Emil Mollenhauer, for violin. Upon graduation, Gilbert embarked upon a career in business. In 1900 he attended a performance of Gustave Charpentier's Louise which sent him back to music, and he soon became interested in American folk and popular music in particular. His Negro Episode‚Äîadapted from pieces he had heard on field trips‚Äîwas performed in New York in 1896, and in 1905 he completed Americanesque, an orchestral suite based on three tunes from minstrel shows. Gilbert's interest in folk music had led him to the music of American blacks, and it was through using black folk tunes that he gained his first major success with 1910's Comedy Overture on Negro Themes for orchestra. This was followed by the Negro Rhapsody, also for orchestra. Other subsequent pieces were based upon the music of American Indians and Creoles. Among his less popular works are Three American Dances, Two Episodes, and Riders to the Sea. Gilbert provided music for the 1922 film Down to the Sea in Ships. Though he'd originally intended to compose an entirely new score, his friend Joseph Carl Breil convinced him that's he'd be better off writing very little original music and then compiling the rest from existing works. His greatest success was The Dance in Place Congo, a programmatic work based upon Creole themes. Originally completed in 1908, it was rejected by Karl Muck for public performance in Boston as \\"niggah music\\" and remained unperformed until recast as a ballet by the Metropolitan Opera Company in 1918. It was given to acclaim at the International Festival of Contemporary Music in Frankfurt-am-Main on July 1, 1927, with the composer in attendance, though by this time Gilbert was an invalid, and died less than a year later, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He had a congenital heart condition known as Tetralogy of Fallot, and his case was published by White and Sprague in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Although Gilbert's music was generally well-regarded during his lifetime, his reputation has declined since his death; today, his music is little played.

It is based on the 1970 novel of the same name by Ramona Stewart. The plot follows a wealthy New York City woman whose brother becomes possessed by a serial killer. Due to its release during the early 1970s and its theme of possession, many reviewers compare it, some favorably, to The Exorcist, which would come one year later. The film was entered into the 22nd Berlin International Film Festival. The Possession of Joel Delaney was the first film for Perry King and the last horror film Shirley MacLaine made. Plot Norah Benson and her younger brother Joel Delaney attend a party being given by Dr. Erika Lorenz. Joel's girlfriend Sherry appears. Norah is extremely protective of her brother, and it is subtly implied that theirs is not an ordinary siblings' relationship. The siblings have sensibly different, albeit somehow complementary mindsets; in contrast to Norah's upscale, self-compliant snobbishness, Joel is more of an adventurous, bohemian type and frequently goes on trips to exotic locations. Two days after the party, Joel fails to attend a scheduled dinner at Norah's house. When she calls him, all she hears is somebody breathing and making odd sounds into the phone. She tells her children Carrie and Peter to go ahead and eat, and heads over to her brother's seedy Spanish Harlem apartment to find out about his delay. Norah sees Joel dragged out by the police. She then learns that he tried to kill the building superintendent, Mr. P√©rez (Aukie Herger), and is being taken to Bellevue Hospital. She learns that Joel has been taken to the psychiatric ward for observation. At Joel's apartment, she finds the whole place in disarray and an eerie sign painted in the wall of both the super's and his brother's flats. She also finds an unusually large switchblade knife. Sherry arrives and dismisses the possibility of Joel being homicidal, although she admits to him having a \\"dark side\\". At the hospital, Joel claims not to remember the assault on the super. He insists that he did not take drugs but agrees to confess he did in exchange for leaving Bellevue and attending daily appointments with Dr. Lorenz. In one session, Erika asks why someone from such an affluent background would want to live in the East Village. Joel tells her he formed a strong bond with a young Puerto Rican named Tonio P√©rez (the super's son, as it is later revealed). At home, Joel behaves oddly. He asks Norah inappropriate questions about her sex life. He sneaks from his room and goes to a nearby nightclub where he finds Sherry intoxicated and flirting with other men. At her luxury high-rise apartment, Joel gets rough during their lovemaking. The next day is Joel's birthday and he invites Sherry to Norah's for a small party, attended by Norah's kids plus Sherry and Veronica, the maid. Joel starts acting childishly, pretending he has found Sherry's lost earring. He then nearly burns Sherry's hair in the candles on the cake and spouts insults in fluent Spanish. Norah goes to Sherry's apartment to return her other earring. To her horror she finds Sherry's decapitated body on the bed and her head hanging from a huge plant. Detective Brady arrives to question her, asking whether Joel has any Puerto Rican friends. It turns out the murder is similar to three others from the summer before in which the victims were found decapitated this way. The grisly deaths got little attention because the girls were Hispanic. The belief is that Tonio P√©rez committed the crimes, but he has been missing ever since. The investigation stalled when P√©rez's neighbors in Spanish Harlem refused to cooperate. The detective insists on seeing Joel, who is taken away by the officer. Norah goes to the library to look at articles about the P√©rez murders. She calls home to speak to Veronica but finds out that the maid quit. Norah takes a taxi up to Spanish Harlem and implores Veronica to help her learn what is going on with her brother. Norah is given the name and address of Don Pedro, owner of a store that sells paraphernalia for Santer√≠a rituals. He asks her to bring one of Joel's belongings to his flat. Norah brings a scarf belonging to Joel and finds Tonio's mother, who claims that Tonio is dead and his spirit has entered Joel's body. Mrs. P√©rez admits that her son killed the other three girls and tells Norah that Tonio's father killed him when he found out. Others arrive and the ceremony begins. All seem possessed by the spirit they are attempting to channel. But the ritual proves to be a failure; according to Don Pedro, Tonio's spirit does not want to come out because Norah is not a believer. She must return with Joel. At home, she finds Joel screaming (again, in perfectly fluent Spanish) and barricaded inside. She takes the kids to Erika's apartment. Erika promises to deal with Joel. Norah rents a car and goes to her beach house. Erika's husband leaves for a business trip, unaware that Joel is standing outside of their apartment building. Norah comes back from the beach with her children and finds Erika's severed head on a cabinet above the refrigerator. Joel is standing nearby with a knife. Now uniformly possessed by his Spanish-speaking persona, he keeps them captive and subjects them to both physical and psychological torment. He taunts them by graphically cutting open a fish the kids caught. Joel puts on music and orders them all to dance. Joel orders the boy to strip. In the kitchen, he tries to force Carrie to eat dog food before slashing her neck slightly. Benson and the police arrive and Norah yells at them not to shoot. They can only watch what is happening through the glass doors. Norah lunges at Joel to stop him, but he gives his sister a passionate kiss. Norah tells the kids to run out of the house. Joel goes after them and is shot by one of the officers. His sister runs to his side‚Äîbut she is too late. Norah picks up the knife and holds it up toward the cop, now seemingly possessed herself. Cast Production The film was partly financed by Lew Grade for whom Shirley MacLaine had just made a TV series. Controversy One of the more controversial elements of the film is its ending. Thirteen-year-old actor David Elliott is shown fully naked during a sequence in which his character is humiliated by the possessed Joel Delaney. Noted film critic Roger Ebert wrote: > [The] final scenes in the beach house are in nauseatingly bad taste. > Filmmakers should have enough imagination and enterprise to scare us without > resulting to cheap tricks. Hitchcock can, and does. But Warris Hussein, who > directed this film, is so bankrupt of imagination that he actually descends > to a scene where the little boy is forced to disrobe and eat dog food. This > is all because of the evil spirit in Joel's body, of course, but I don't > care. > > Scenes of this nature are rotten and bankrupt, and you feel unclean just > watching them. In the March 5, 2004 issue of Entertainment Weekly, Stephen King wrote about the film and that particular scene, claiming that today it would earn the film an NC-17 rating. Earlier here, it was said that the VHS had the scene uncut, while the DVD was altered. What this is instead, perhaps, is a difference in processing. The VHS transfer is \\"open matte\\", showing top and bottom picture information that would usually be cropped in theatrical showings. In this case, it made the scenes with the boy more revealing. In contrast, the DVD is matted widescreen, reflecting the theatrical intent of being more restrained about the boy's nudity.

In its first incarnation, WENK-AM 1240 went on the air with 250 watts day and night from the upstairs of a furniture store on October 26, 1946. WTPR-AM 710 went on the air with 250 watts daytime from the second floor of a building on the square in downtown Paris in 1947. Both were owned by the Dixie Network of Jackson, Tennessee. and had at the time a variety format. WENK featured the talents of people like Hank Huggins and Lou Wrather during the early days. WTPR was home to future Nashville star Ralph Emery and future WPSD-TV newsman Dan Steele. WENK caught the Rock and Roll bug in 1956 and for the most part remained a popular music or Top 40 station until WWKF took that format in 1982. John Dixon Williams, a future WPSD-TV newsman and general manager was an early star. WTPR continued to play a variety of music over the years. WENK increased its power to 1000 Watts in the early 1960s and WTPR was able to increase its power to 1000 watts daytime as well. During this period personalities like J. R. Moore and Ed Taylor were heard on WENK, along with Jolly George and John True. WTPR featured Bill McCutcheon. The late Gary Powley who worked at WTPR in the 1990s and until his death in 2005 actually got his start at WENK in 1968. Present day President and General Manager Terry Hailey followed Gary Powley at WENK in 1968 and has been with the station ever since. Cindy Snyder was one of the driving forces behind WTPR in the 1980s and 1990s. Joe Van Dyke was long time general manager at WTPR for the Dixie Network. Station information WENK purchased WTPR in 1989. WTPR then adopted WENK's Oldies format which continues today. WTWL, Dover/McKinnon, was added in 1994 with call letters changed to WTPR-FM. The station was at 101.5, but changed to 101.7 in June 2005. WENK, WTPR and WTPR-FM are now a three way simulcast of ‚ÄòThe Greatest Hits of All Time‚Äô and are on AM1240, AM710 and FM101.7. The stations can be heard in southeast Missouri, northeast Arkansas...and all across northwest Tennessee and southwest Kentucky from Reelfoot Lake to Kentucky Lake to Clarksville. Their sister stations WWGY and WRQR-FM (KF99/KQ105) play Contemporary Hit music or Top 40, the format they took from WENK in 1982.

History The project began with an online question posted on Life's website in 2003 and The Digital Journalist: Can photographs create the same historical effect as literature? The question remained on the website for visitors to openly answer to for several weeks. Most responses were in favor of the idea with the exception of a rebuttal from documentary photographer Joshua Haruni who said, \\"photographs can definitely inspire us, but the written word has the ability to spark the imagination to greater depths than any photograph, whose content is limited to what exists in the frame.\\" Life determined that \\"a collection of pictures that 'changed the world' is a thing worth contemplating, if only to arrive at some resolution about the influential nature of photography and whether it is limited, vast or in between.\\" Pictures nominated by the public were reviewed by editors who then compiled 100 photographs that they felt portrayed technological photographic achievements, documented historic events and accomplishments or have achieved iconic cultural and, symbolic status. The book was edited by Robert Sullivan and picture editor Barbara Baker Burrows, and published by Time, Inc. Home Entertainment. An updated edition of the book was published August 9, 2011. Sections The work is divided into four major chapters and three accompanying subsections. The major quarters are: *The Arts (concentrating on photography's evolution throughout the 19th century and its later application to cultural exploitation); *Society (documenting images that captured moments that shifted public acquaintance with political, social, cultural and environmental issues); *War (pivotal moments of conflict and associated violence); and *Science and Nature (capturing technological triumphs, defeats and horrors). The three subsections are: *Photographic Art (early works of artists whose primary medium was photography); *Trick Photography (infamous scams perpetrated through photographs); and *Stop Action (photos that are in fact captures taken from film). Photographs Some of the included photos are identified with larger events, such as H.S. Wong's 1937 photograph of a lone child crying at a demolished train station on \\"Bloody Saturday\\" as representative of the entire bombing of Shanghai. Other photographs are excerpts from larger historic collections, such as Roger Fenton's and Alexander Gardner's respective groundbreaking documentations of the Crimean War and American Civil War. Margin notes document the circumstantial background of many photographs, as well as instances where the images have been accused of being staged. Gallery Some of the photos are depicted below.

The serial was re-released in 1951 under the title Perils of the Darkest Jungle and, in 1966, it was edited into the 100-minute Century-66 film Jungle Gold. Linda Stirling is a jungle girl lost in the South American rainforest and ruling a native tribe. The serial's plot is a variant on the common serial and B-Western \\"land grab\\" plot - in this case, the villains attempt to run the natives off the land so that they can claim its valuable oil reserves. Premise Evil oil speculators in South America attempt to drive away a native tribe and their leader, the Tiger Woman. The Tiger Woman, a white woman, might be the lost heiress to a vast fortune, and later plotlines in the serial are built around determining her true identity. Cast *Linda Stirling as Tiger Woman/Rita Arnold. Stirling was immediately popular in The Tiger Woman.

Lewis as Morgan *LeRoy Mason as Fletcher Walton *Crane Whitley as Tom Dagget *Robert Frazer as Ramgah, High Priest *Rico De Montez as Tegula *Stanley Price as Mack, Dagget's Clerk Production The Tiger Woman was budgeted at $180,292 although the final negative cost was $206,191 (a $25,899, or 14.4%, overspend). It was the most expensive Republic serial of 1944. This serial had the third biggest budget of the sixty-six Republic serials (exceeded only by Captain America (1944) at $182,623 and The Lone Ranger Rides Again (1939) at $193,878) although it is only the fifth most expensive in terms of the actual production cost. The other four, however, were all 15-chapters long, compared to Tiger Woman's 12-chapters, so this is, per chapter, the most expensive of all Republic serials. It was filmed at Lake Sherwood, California locations p.21-22 Schneider, Jerry L. Edgar Rice Burroughs and the Silver Screen:Vol. IV: The Locations Lulu.com between 20 January and 25 February 1944 under the working title Tiger Woman of the Amazon. The serial's production number was 1298. The Tiger Woman was Republic's attempt to create a new Pearl White with their recent discovery of Linda Stirling. Stedman notes several errors in the production: The Tiger Woman costume is made from Leopard fur. When outside, the natives are dressed as Navaho but, when inside, they are dressed as Aztecs. The chorus girl line, and their \\"harem-girl\\" costume, during an execution is frowned on. The men in the serial do not remove their hats whether inside or out. However, in South America \\"Tiger\\" refers to any big cat. Stunts *Babe DeFreest as Tiger Woman/Rita Arnold (doubling Linda Stirling) *Tom Steele as Allen Saunders/Tunnel Thug/Road Block Thug/Ambusher (doubling Allan Lane) *Ken Terrell as Jos√© Delgado/Morgan/Mack/Fletcher Walton/Bolton/Depot Thug/Oil Truck Driver (doubling Duncan Renaldo, George J.

Release Theatrical The Tiger Woman's official release date is 27 May 1944, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to film exchanges. The serial was re-released on 17 January 1951, under the new title Perils of the Darkest Jungle, between the first runs of Flying Disc Man from Mars and Don Daredevil Rides Again. Television The Tiger Woman was one of twenty-six Republic serials re-released as a Century-66 film on television in 1966. The title of the film was changed to Jungle Gold. This version was cut down to 100-minutes in length. Critical reception Stedman believes that, when compared to the earlier Witney-English serials, The Tiger Woman is a poor serial.

History Since the 14th century the village has also been known as Stoke Lane, although the origin of the alternative name is unclear, but may be connected to John de Lison who gave lands in the village to Glastonbury Abbey in 1253. The parish of Stoke Lane was part of the Whitstone Hundred. The village became a centre for cloth manufacture with fulling mills being established on the River Frome to the north of the village. Henry Fussell established paper mills in 1803, and his family, who came from the village, including James Fussell established their iron works and edge-tool business in Mells. The Knatchbull Arms was built in the late 17th century, and is named after the Knatchbulls of Babington who held the manor in the late 18th century. The manor house on Tower Hill, which was previously known as the old vicarage, was built around 1700. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography Several significant caves of the Mendip Hills are close to the village including Stoke Lane Slocker, many falling within the St. Dunstan's Well Catchment and those at the disused Fairy Cave Quarry. Moon's Hill Quarry is a basalt quarry. Cook's Wood Quarry is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest and Geological Conservation Review Site. The main exposures are cut in very steeply-dipping Carboniferous Limestone. This was the original locality for the type section of the proposed ‚ÄòCookswoodian Stage‚Äô. 9 species of Bat, Dormice and 4 species of Newts including the rare Great Crested Newt reside in Cooks Wood Quarry.English Nature citation sheet for the site . Retrieved 7 August 2006. Edford Woods and Meadows is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, which is important for the occurrence of a wide range of types of semi-natural ancient woodland and for unimproved meadows and pastures of a type which is now uncommon in Britain. Religious sites The Church of St Michael has a western tower of c. 1400, the remainder being built in 1838 by Jesse Gane. It is a Grade II* listed building. The church was a chapelry of Doulting.

It was released on their 1970 LP Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One, which included the Top 10 hit song \\"Lola\\". \\"Got to Be Free\\" plays a key role in the concept album, as the album borrows its first verse as an introduction, and closes with the full song. The song was also used in the first of the BBC's Play for Today series The Long Distance Piano Player (1970), which featured the song's own writer, Ray Davies, in the lead role. Overview Overall, the lyrics express a feeling of longing for a better world, or one devoid of all the troubles and restrictions of this one (\\"We've got to get out of this world somehow\\"). The lyrics also act as a commentary on the music business, a recurring theme in Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One). \\"Got to Be Free\\" opens as a kind of lullaby (\\"Hush little baby/Don't you cry\\"), the same lyrics and tune as the album's introduction on side A, but soon changes to a more standard rock song structure, with a rousing chorus of \\"Got to be free to say what I want/Make what I want and play what I want\\" (with minor changes as the song progresses, such as \\"laugh when I want\\" and \\"do what I want\\"). Instrumentation The song begins with some gentle strumming on Ray Davies' signature National Steel resonator guitar. Soon, a banjo joins in played by regular lead guitarist and brother to Ray, Dave Davies. As the song progresses, the drums and other electric instruments kick in. The song continues, and fades away at three minutes in length. The song differs slightly from many of the other songs on its LP, with slight country and bluegrass accents at the beginning. It eventually evolves into a more powerful rock song feel, but these influences remain apparent throughout its length. The Kinks would go on to experiment with these genres heavily on their next LP, Muswell Hillbillies.

Wilson Co., New York, p 357 Early career While studying in Paris, Tania met and fell in love with an American, Merwin Mallory Gray, and after their marriage in Paris in 1932, they moved to New York City, where their son, Robert Merwin Gray, was born the following year. Circa 1935, Tania became an American citizen, and during the following year, she launched her journalistic career when she began working as a reporter for the Newark Ledger. Berlin In September 1938, as the crisis leading to Munich developed, I began to worry about my parents‚Äô safety. I had a premonition I would be needed in Berlin. I got a leave of absence from The Ledger and left by ship for Bremen with the intention of continuing to Berlin. During the crossing, Prime Minister Chamberlain began his visits to Hitler and the situation looked very grim. When the ship landed first at Southampton, I received a telegram from my father telling me to get off the ship and go to my godfather's in London, where my father would meet me. My mother had been left in Bruges, Belgium, with some other British subjects who had left Berlin for fear of being caught after an outbreak of war. When I met my father I realized he was not well and had a bad case of bronchitis. After picking up my mother in Bruges the family returned to Berlin. My father's health grew worse, and after about ten days, when he had developed pneumonia (there were no antibiotics then), he died.\\"Long of Longfield Correspondence (LLC), Oct 1997 letter from Tania Long Daniell Tania decided to stay in Berlin and look for a job. She was fortunate in getting one with the New York Herald Tribune. According to her biography: Miss Long obtained a position with the New York Herald Tribune bureau in that city, largely because of her previous long residence in the German capital ... a consequent wide circle of friends and contacts ... combined with her linguistic abilities and thorough knowledge of many other European countries. Her first duties consisted of reading approximately forty daily German newspapers, selecting significant articles from them, and rewriting these for the Tribune. Her skill in writing both quickly and well soon led her to becoming assistant chief correspondent. Current Biography, 1946, p 357 I brought my son over from New York to join me and my mother and we remained there for close to a year. In August 1939, however, Hitler, who had recently gobbled up Czechoslovakia and earlier, Austria, was close to invading Poland. War became fairly certain, so I decided to send my mother and son to France to join my grandmother and aunt in Brittany. I told my bosses at The Herald Tribune that if war came, I would have to leave Berlin, to be on the right side of the wartime border. This was acceptable and I was merely asked to wait in Berlin until my replacement arrived. During that period, Berlin was an eerie city. The people were very quiet and clearly unhappy. There were air raid simulations, with the beams of searchlights playing in the skies and every now and then catching a plane that was trying to evade them. One night bags of flour fell onto the roof of Hermann G√∂ring‚Äôs Air Ministry, in a simulated bombing. LLC, Oct 1997 letter from Tania Long Daniell The sound of goose-step marching was pervasive and almost surreal, and she noticed that people were disappearing suddenly from her apartment building. After about ten days, she left for Denmark. Tania spent two weeks in Copenhagen taking down by hand the news copy from the Polish front sent by Joseph Barnes, Herald-Tribune correspondent, who had no other way of getting his copy to New York. Then she was ordered to Paris where she was told she would be permanently assigned. Leaving my heavy trunks and suitcases with American Express, I flew to Brussels, flying low so as to be recognized as a neutral plane by the Germans and then began a nightmare journey. I learned that all travellers to France required a special visa. I went to the French consulate (in Brussels) only to find thousands of Frenchmen and others lining up to get into the building. It looked hopeless. I then went to the US consulate, talked to a young consul, showed my credentials, explained my case, and he wrote me a note to his French colleague at the French consulate asking him to give me priority, etc. He told me to approach the French building from the rear and to tell the man at the door that I had a letter from the American consul and hoped he‚Äôd let me in. He did and before long I left the consulate with my new visa. Then to the railway station. Complete chaos. Nobody knew anything about trains to Paris. People rushing hither and yon trying to get news of train movements. I finally sat down somewhere to rest and overheard a couple saying something about a train to Paris in an hour on Track 5. I made my way to Track 5 and found a conductor who confirmed the news and in about half an hour a train pulled in and was announced over the loudspeaker. Suddenly, it seemed like thousands were rushing for the train, which filled up in no time. I had gotten a seat next to a pleasant looking woman. I was starving hungry by then and asked her to guard my seat while I went in search of a sandwich. She asked me to bring her one. The station was still like an ant heap that had been disturbed, with people rushing hither and yon, but I eventually found a stall that was selling waffles. I bought four and went back to the train. The train left, then the trip became nerve-racking, as it would stop every now and then. Whistles would blow, shouts would be heard, and then off we‚Äôd go for another while. We arrived in Paris after nearly four hours, and I went straight to the Tribune and thence to a hotel across the street. London However, Tania was soon transferred to London (in late September 1939) where a shortage of staff had developed due to the illness of the bureau chief, Ralph Barnes. This was supposed to be a temporary position but became permanent. By early 1940, it became evident that Hitler would invade the Low Countries and France, and Tania got her family out of France and [over] to Ireland, safe from possible bombing attacks. At that time all American civilians were ordered out of the European war zone by the United States government which then sent three ships to Ireland to pick them up, taking Tania's son and mother to the United States. In September 1940, Tania was busy covering the bombing of London among other things. Among Miss Long's best stories [on the bombing of London]: the bombing of the Savoy Hotel while she was living there. Of the bombing of her hotel she wrote in a dispatch to the Tribune: ‚ÄòI was sitting in my third-floor room ready to get into bed when I heard the bombs coming. The second or third of the sticks landed in the street right outside my window. Only a split second later the next bomb hit the cornice of the hotel and went off, and almost immediately after that the other one hit the rear of the building. When one hears bombs coming that close there is no time to do anything. One hasn‚Äôt time to be afraid, that comes later.‚Äô In February 1941, an article appeared in the New York Herald-Tribune: The 19th annual Front Page Ball of the New York Newspaper Women's Club was held last night [at] ... the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, wife of the President, was the special guest of honor. The highlight of the evening was the presentation of two awards ... by Mrs. Roosevelt for outstanding work by New York City newspaper women during 1940. The prize winners in the contest sponsored by the club were Miss Tania Long, war correspondent of the New York Herald-Tribune, and Miss Kay Thomas ... of The New York Sun.New York Herald-Tribune, Feb 15, 1941 Soon after arriving in London in late 1939, Tania, by then divorced, met her future husband, Raymond Daniell, London correspondent for The New York Times. Before meeting Tania, Ray had considered newspaper work in London, a man's job; but, he wrote later, she provided us with as much competition as any man in London.Current Biography, 1944, H. W. Wilson Co., New York, p 136 One of the two American newspaperwomen in London, she looked after us all with a sort of motherly care. Her calm and courage during the frightful early days of the blitzkrieg helped us all to keep our nerves steady.Civilians Must Fight, F. Raymond Daniell, 1941 In November 1941, Ray Daniell published his book, Civilians Must Fight. Already one of the most respected American journalists of his time, he provided his fellow countrymen with some serious food for thought. \\"Before Pearl Harbor, his calm dispassionate book ... pointed out to Americans that their only choice lay between fighting Nazism and accepting the terms of \\"a Hitler astride three-quarters of the world.\\" On November 22, 1941, Tatiana Long and Raymond Daniell were married in London. Having united in marriage with a member of the competition, Tania appropriately left the Herald-Tribune and joined forces with the New York Times in February 1942. Remaining based in London for the duration of World War II, Ray and Tania, despite the dangers of crossing the Atlantic, nevertheless managed to return twice to their home in Westport, Connecticut, where they could savour two months vacation in the States. Here Tania was reunited with her son and her mother. Europe In 1944, Tania was asked to do a job for the OSS (the Office of Strategic Services, forerunner of the CIA) and was assigned to the headquarters of the First Army in Spa, Belgium, just over the border with the bit of Germany that was already occupied by US forces. Because of my fluent German, I was supposed to uncover any attacks on the US troops, by such as the ‚ÄòWerewolves,‚Äô a group of German youth who strung thin metal wires across the roads at night to cut the throats of GIs travelling by jeep, for instance, or dug trenches that would trap US transport. The scheme never worked properly because of a change in First Army plans. It had been intended to have the army occupy a wide area of Germany around Aachen permanently, until the end of the war. This would have given me time to develop contacts, etc. But the First Army was suddenly ordered to move eastward and I kept being left behind, not knowing where the new army headquarters was. The whole thing became a farce and I resigned and returned to London. As war correspondents for The New York Times, Tania Long and Ray Daniell followed the Allied forces into Berlin in 1945. Ray Daniell arrived there the day the Allies entered Berlin, and Tania followed the day after. During World Wars I and II, Tania's and her parents‚Äô possessions, including the Long Family papers and photos, had been stored in a downtown Berlin warehouse, and although the warehouse had been bombed, by some miracle, everything they owned survived intact. With the termination of the war, Tania remained in Germany and assisted her husband in the New York Times coverage of the Nuremberg Trials. Then Miss Long turned her attention to conditions in conquered Germany. Her articles in the New York Times Magazine, and her news stories, attracted considerable comment for the picture she presented of the dangerous effect of fraternization by American troops in Germany on the American occupation policy.Current Biography, 1946, p 358 Post-war Britain During 1946, rumours began to circulate that a royal wedding was in the offing. Despite denials from the palace, the New York Times went front page on December 16: Raymond Daniell reported from London that ‚Äòonly politics, which has blighted so many royal romances, is delaying the announcement of the engagement of Princess Elizabeth, heiress to the British throne, and Prince Philip of Greece.‚ÄôElizabeth And Philip, Charles Higham & Roy Moseley, Doubleday, New York, 1991, pg 137 Tania, as London correspondent of The New York Times, attended the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten on November 20, 1947, and on June 2, 1953, Tania Long and Ray Daniell carried out their final assignment as London correspondents of The New York Times, with Ray writing the main story of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II while Tania covered the coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey. Canada That same year, Ray and Tania were transferred to the Times‚Äô Canadian bureau in Ottawa. Three years later, Tania reported the following: Life in Ottawa is a peculiar mixture of the easy and the informal, and the very formal indeed. At the other extreme in our social life is the extremely formal ‚Äì and darn good, too ‚Äì dinner party at Government House [in Ottawa]. The Governor-General, Vincent Massey, a charming and completely simple man himself, nevertheless runs his establishment as a sort of court which, of course, it is. As he is the Queen's representative in Canada, I must curtsy to him, while Ray bows from the waist. Ray and I, I believe, have been singularily honored by the Governor-General, for he has also invited us to his very small Sunday night suppers... At one of these, Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester B. Pearson (Prime Minister of Canada, 1963‚Äì1968) and Mrs. Pearson and Ray and I were the only guests.The New York Times, \\"Times Talk\\", March 1956 New York When Ray was assigned to the United Nations in 1964, the Daniells moved to New York City, thus enabling Tania to pay frequent visits to her mother in Westport, Connecticut. In 1967, Tania and Ray returned to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Ottawa became his home by chance. Assigned here by the mighty New York Times in the early 1950s, he stayed on for 12 years before accepting an appointment to the paper's United Nations staff.The Ottawa Citizen, April 14, 1969, p 6, \\"Obituary of Raymond Daniell\\" And when it came time to retire, Ray and Tania returned to a city where they had many friends and where they had spent many good and interesting years. Comfortably settled into their new home, Ray and Tania were to enjoy only two years of retirement together when Ray fell ill and died on April 12, 1969, at the age of sixty-seven. Comforted by the presence of her mother who had come to live with them in Ottawa, Tania found the strength to carry on. Ottawa In late 1969, Tania began her second career (which lasted for ten years), as the publicist for the Music Department of the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. I began as a volunteer, as a member of the usual women's committee formed to assist a new artistic undertaking, and soon became a member of the staff. The job was stimulating and demanding ‚Äì I don't think I ever worked as hard at it as I did then, really doing the job of two persons, working long days and often nights and just about every weekend. My main work was to publicize the newly created National Arts Centre Orchestra, a fully government subsidized ensemble and the only such a one in North America. The orchestra's debut concert in New York in 1971 was a tremendous success and received glowing reviews ‚Äì of great importance to a new orchestra's future. The ensemble then went on its first European tour later in 1971, playing in Poland, the then Soviet Union, France and Italy. It was warmly welcomed wherever it played, but nowhere as in Warsaw where the audience at the end of the second concert rushed to the stage to embrace the players. It was an emotional moment few of the forty-eight musicians will forget. The orchestra had its second tour of Europe, after more New York concerts and a tour of the US, in 1978, this time in Sicily and Germany. I went along on both European tours. This was my first visit to Russia and I was of course fascinated with both Leningrad and Moscow. Tania's mother, Tatiana Mouravieva Long had come a long way from Tamboff, Russia. She had come to Canada via Berlin, Brittany and Connecticut, and now, just a few days short of her 94th birthday, she fell ill with pneumonia and departed this life on March 29, 1978. Tania suffered personal tragedy again in 1981, when her son Robert Gray died at the age of forty-six. Although he had been married, he had no children. Eventually Tania's inner resolve once again gave her the strength to carry on since she has never been one to suffer life's adversities lying down. With the help of time, and the support of good friends, her zest for life ultimately returned. For several years she has made annual visits to New York and Paris, home of her Aunt Vera and cousin Tatiana. And having visited Wisconsin in the late 1980s, she has had occasion to meet several of her Long cousins, one (Theron D. Long) of whom she said resembled her father. Tania died on 4 September 1998. Personal life A long-time resident of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Tania Long was an activist who believed strongly in participatory democracy. At the grassroots level, Tania was known to organize petitions designed to improve the quality of life in her neighborhood. Brought up in the classical tradition of Europe, Tatiana enjoyed attending the opera, ballet, and symphony concerts; her hobbies included reading, swimming and gardening. Almost aristocratic in demeanour, Tania nevertheless exuded a down-to-earth friendly American quality. Without a doubt, Tatiana Long embodied many of the finest traits one could hope for from a 20th-century descendant of Richard and Charity Long of Longfield.

History The Progress and Work party was an Israeli Arab organisation formed to fight the 1951 elections. Like most other Israeli Arab parties at the time, it was associated with David Ben-Gurion's Mapai party, as Ben Gurion was keen to include Israeli Arabs in the functioning of the state in order to prove Jews and Arabs could co-exist peacefully and productively. In the elections, the party won only one seat, taken by its leader, Salah-Hassan Hanifes. Because of its association with Mapai, the party joined the governing coalition in all four governments of the second Knesset. In the 1955 elections, the party won two seats. Saleh Suleiman took the second seat, and the party was again part of the coalition. In 1959, a falling-out between Hanifes and Mapai led to Hanifes setting up a new party, the Independent Faction for Israeli Arabs, to fight the 1959 elections. Both parties failed to cross the electoral threshold, with Progress and Work receiving 0.5% of the votes, and the Independent Faction 0.4%. In the 1961 elections, the party won 0.4% of the vote. After its second failure to cross the threshold, the party disappeared.

Several documentaries have been produced based in part on the 1976 and 1980 Reagan campaign and December 1941, for the 75th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. Rendezvous with Destiny was cited in a Wall Street Journal column by Michael Medved as one of the five best campaign books, ever. John Heubusch, Director of the Reagan Library has called Shirley the ‚Äúunofficial, official biographer of Ronald Reagan.‚Äù Born and raised in Syracuse, New York, Shirley earned a degree in History and Political Science from Springfield College. Shirley was named by the London Telegraph, \\"the best of the Reagan biographers\\" Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard called him \\"a prominent biographer of Ronald Reagan,\\" Mark Levin called him \\"one of the best of the Reagan biographers,\\" and the Washington Examiner‚Äôs Paul Bedard, said Shirley is a \\"noted Ronald Reagan biographer.\\" Laura Ingraham has often noted Shirley's authority as a Reagan scholar, and author Romesh Ratnesar noted in a review in The New York Times that he \\"is a sure-footed and entertaining observer of the hurly-burly of national politics.\\" Reagan's former speechwriter Aram Bakshian refers to him as \\"the best source for understanding Ronald Reagan.\\" Shirley's third book on Reagan‚Äôs final years, the topic which had never been covered before, Last Act, was also highly praised for its rich writing and intricate detail and research. With regard to his fourth book, Reagan Rising, and Reagan speechwriter Clark Judge called Shirley \\"the most prolific and‚Ä¶.most influential\\" of the Reagan biographers. He compared Shirley‚Äôs writings to the Greek general Thucydides, who wrote a history of the Peloponnesian War, after fighting in it. \\"Reading Craig Shirley has become essential for any Ronald Reagan student,\\" said Judge. Shirley has also written numerous articles and given dozens of lectures about the life and times and lessons of Ronald Reagan. Life and career Youth and education Shirley is the second son of Edward Bruce Shirley and Barbara Cone Shirley. He is of English and Scottish descent. His parents were charter members of the New York State Conservative Party and his father was the first registered conservative voter in the Empire State. In 1964 he went door to door for presidential candidate Barry Goldwater at age 8. In high school, Shirley was a standout athlete, winning six varsity letters, winning the league pole vaulting championship and was named \\"Most Improved Athlete\\" his senior year. He was also the editor of his high school newspaper. In 1978 Shirley graduated from Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts, where he majored history and political science. He was also a member of the school‚Äôs lacrosse team and track team. Career Craig Shirley was professionally involved in American politics and government for over three decades.

He joined the staff of the Republican National Committee in 1982. As a Communications Advisor, Shirley traveled across the country advising dozens of campaigns and state committees on public relations, political advertising, and campaign strategy to co-ordinate with the message of the Reagan White House. In 1984, during the U.S. presidential campaign, Shirley was the Director of Communications for the National Conservative Political Action Committee, America‚Äôs largest independent political committee, which spent over $14 million on behalf of President Ronald Reagan‚Äôs re-election on another independent expenditure campaign.

Alker Tripp, was a senior English police official who served as an Assistant Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police from 1932 to 1947. Tripp was born in London, the son of George Henry Tripp, a civil servant who later became Receiver for the Metropolitan Police District. Tripp's ambition was to become an artist, but family disapproval led to him joining the civil staff at Scotland Yard as a clerk in the Commissioner's Office on 22 December 1902. He held a number of posts before being appointed chairman of the Police Recruiting Board in 1920. In this post he conceived of the idea of a police college, which was later established by Lord Trenchard. By 1928, Tripp was assistant secretary in the Metropolitan Police Office.H. Alker Tripp, \\"Police and Public: A New Test of Police Quality\\", Police Journal, 1:4, 1928 On 15 January 1932, Tripp was appointed Assistant Commissioner \\"B\\", in charge of traffic. He was the first member of Scotland Yard's civilian staff to be appointed to this rank (at this time the Assistant Commissioners were not police officers, although they wore police uniform on formal occasions). He devoted the next fifteen years to the study of London's traffic problems, and also traffic problems of other cities throughout Europe and North America, becoming a recognised authority on the traffic control. In 1933, he was appointed to the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Board. In 1938 he published Road Traffic and Its Control, which remained the only full-length study of the subject until after his death. The outbreak of the Second World War brought its own problems for traffic, such as road safety during the blackout, the clearance of roads after bombing raids during the Blitz, and the necessity of giving priority to military and other essential traffic. In September 1942, Tripp published a second book, Town Planning and Road Traffic, which looked ahead to postwar reconstruction. In this book he pioneered the idea of motorways in Britain. In 1942, the Royal Academy invited him to become a member of its Planning Committee established to set up a scheme for London's architectural reconstruction after the war. Tripp retired from the Metropolitan Police and the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee on 1 May 1947,\\"Assistant Commissioner of Police\\", The Times, 23 October 1946 but remained a member of the Royal Academy Planning Committee until 1949. He was also a member of the Ministry of Transport Committee on Road Safety from 1943 until 1947. He supported the registration of bicycles, a policy which was not eventually endorsed by the committee.\\"Road Rules for Pedestrians\\", The Times, 7 October 1947 Tripp was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1935 New Year Honours and was knighted in the 1945 New Year Honours for his services during the war. Tripp never lost his interest in art, and many of his paintings were shown in the Royal Academy. More than twenty of his works were turned into posters.One of Tripp's posters He was also an enthusiastic yachtsman, both cruising and racing. He had a large number of articles published in the yachting press in both Britain and the United States, and also wrote four books on the subject: Shoalwater and Fairway (1924), Suffolk Sea Borders (1926), Solent and the Southern Waters (1928), and Under the Cabin Lamp (1950).
