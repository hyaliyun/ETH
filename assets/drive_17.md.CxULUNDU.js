He was the first doctor in Europe to use insulin in the treatment of diabetes. He came to later fame in the University of Sydney. Short of stature he was affectionately known as Wee Mon by his students. Life He was born on 24 July 1891 in Port of Spain in Trinidad the only son of Sophia Agnes Theresa Stollmeyer and her husband, Lt Col George Lambie, commanding officer of the Trinidad Light Infantry Volunteers. As a child he was a gifted musician and gave piano concerts at the age of 8. He was sent to boarding school in Scotland and was educated at Ayr Academy and Stanley House School in Stirlingshire. He went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MB ChB in 1914. He was President of the Royal Medical Society in 1914-15, one of its youngest presidents. He won the Murchison Memorial Scholarship in 1915. His career was immediately disrupted by World War I during which he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1915, and saw action in Mesopotamia but was invalided out for a year to India where he served as a pathologist in Poona. In 1917 he returned to active service on the Somme, rising to the rank of Captain and winning a Military Cross for bravery in 1918. After the war he joined Professor Arthur Robertson Cushny in Edinburgh as a Research Assistant. In 1921 he went to the University of Toronto in Canada to work with professors Frederick Banting and Charles Herbert Best, the creators of insulin. In 1922 he returned to Edinburgh and became the first person in Europe to use insulin in the treatment of diabetes. He was then Assistant Physician at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on Lauriston Place, and had also begun lecturing at the University of Edinburgh. He was the Beit Memorial Fellow 1923 to 1926. In 1927 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposers being Alexander Gray McKendrick, George Barger, William Ogilvy Kermack, and William Glen Liston. He received his doctorate (MD) in the same year with his thesis The locus of insulin action, and was also awarded a Lister Fellowship. In 1929 he declined a chair at the University of Aberdeen and instead travelled to Australia to take up the G.H. Bosch chair as Professor of Surgery at the University of Sydney. Here he worked with his predecessor Professor Harold R. Dew to completely reformulate the academic curriculum in the Medical Faculty. In 1940 he became seriously ill with diabetes and was also diagnosed with a heart condition. He retired from the University in 1957 and took up a committee role in the New South Wales branch of the British Medical Association, then under the chairmanship of Sir William Morrow. He died of coronary vascular disease on 28 August 1961 at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney. His body was cremated. Hobbies Over and above his medical skills, Lambie was a skilled musician, studying composition under Edgar Bainton. Artistic recognition His portrait by Nora Heysen is held by the University of Sydney. Family In 1925 he married Eliza Anne Walton (1892-1965). They had two daughters.

This happens when the disc is spun fast enough and seen through the four radial slits of a counter- rotating black disc. It was invented in 1829 by Joseph Plateau before further studies on the same principle led to his invention of animation through the phénakisticope in 1832. Anorthoscopes with a black background have a translucent picture and need a luminous slit revolving behind the image disc. To make them translucent, the discs were impregnated with oil on the back and varnished on both sides. History The anamorphic disc image (A) and the perceived image when spun (B) as illustrated in Correspondance Mathématique et Physique - Tome VI (1830) As a university student, Plateau noticed in some early experiments that when looking from a small distance at two concentric cogwheels, which turned fast in opposite directions, an optical illusion of a motionless wheel appeared. He later read Peter Mark Roget's 1824 article Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures that addressed a similar illusion. Plateau decided to investigate the phenomenon further and later published his findings in Correspondance Mathématique et Physique in 1828 On 9 June 1829, Plateau presented his yet nameless anorthoscope as \\"une espèce toute nouvelle d'anamorphoses\\" (a totally new sort of anamorphoses) in his doctoral thesis Sur quelques propriétés des impressions produites par la lumière sur l'organe de la vue, at the University of Liège. It was later translated and published in the German scientific magazine Annalen der Physik und Chemie. A letter to Correspondance Mathématique et Physique dated 5 December 1829 included pictures of a disc and the resulting image as an illustration of these \\"new species of anamorphoses\\". Plateau revisited this concept several times in the Correspondance Mathématique et Physique and by January 1836 he finally decided to have the device itself published. He sent a box with the instrument to Michael Faraday on 8 January 1836 since they both studied these kind of phenomena. Faraday had previously inspired Plateau to use a mirror with revolving discs, which helped Plateau to develop his Fantascope a.k.a. Phénakisticope. Faraday thought the anorthoscope was a beautiful machine with an exceedingly curious and good effect, and mentioned: \\"It has wonderfully surprised many to whom I have showed it and they all refuse to believe their own eyes and cannot admit that the forms seen are the things looked at\\". The device was marketed starting in 1836 by publishers like Newton & Co in London, Susse in Paris (12 different discs) and J. Duboscq in Paris (at least 18 different discs). Plateau apparently first used the name \\"anorthoscope\\" in a letter to his mentor / publisher / friend Quetelet. He decided to send an example of the device to Miss Quetelet as a gift. Soon after, he presented it to the Royal Academy in Brussels in 1836. Joseph Plateau created a combination of his Fantascope (or phénakisticope) and the Anorthoscope sometime between 1844 and 1849 resulting in a back-lit transparent disc with a sequence of figures that are animated when it is rotated behind a counter-rotating black disc with four illuminated slits, spinning four times as fast. Unlike the phénakisticope, several people could view the animation at the same time. This system has not been commercialized; the only known two handmade discs are in the Joseph Plateau Collection of the Ghent University. Belgian painter Jean Baptiste Madou created the first images on these discs and Plateau painted the successive parts. 21st century A scientific paper on the effects of the anorthoscope was published in 2007. A rare completed 1836 anorthoscope set by Susse with twelve discs was auctioned for in 2013. The other two known extant sets of this edition are in the Werner Nekes collection and in the Joseph Plateau Collection in the Science Museum of the Ghent University.http://users.telenet.be/thomasweynants/anorthoscope.html References External links * Optical illusions Optical toys Precursors of film 1820s toys Audiovisual introductions in 1829 ","title":"Anorthoscope"},{"id":"53400698","text":"Rajgriha Express is a daily Mail/Express express train of Indian Railways, running between Rajgir, near Nalanda, Bihar, and Danapur, near Patna, Bihar via Nalanda,Bihar Sharif and Bakhtiyarpur Junction.

The organisation was set up with strategic development funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England, which was matched by phased subscriptions from members. It is currently self-sustained, receiving funding from member organisations.  Activities  GuildHE Research is particularly focussed on providing support and training to researchers at smaller organisations who might otherwise have less access to training and networks. This builds upon the concept of there being \\"islands of research excellence\\", an idea that arose from the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise. The organisation organises symposia, organises training, and curates and disseminates information on research policy such as the Research Excellence Framework. CREST was a signatory of concordats such as the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers, the Concordat to Support Research Integrity, and the Concordat for Engaging the Public with Research.  Open access and open data  GuildHE Research have investigated how smaller institutions can make research available via open access and open data. In 2014, Jisc provided the organisation with funding to develop a research data management system to support smaller and specialist institutions.

He received his doctorate on May 19, 1941 with a thesis Theory of Electrophoresis, the Relaxation Effect (Theorie der electrophorese: het relaxatie-effect). All the characteristic features of the later work of Overbeek were present already in his thesis: formation of a simple model with the available data, set up the corresponding equations and then rigorous mathematical elaboration. Overbeek's dissertation explored the role of the deformation of the electrical double layer surrounding a charged colloidal particle which was set in motion by an external electric field. After graduation Overbeek joined Philips, where Evert Verwey, was his immediate boss. In addition to work on luminescent screens they worked together on the interaction between colloidal particles. Attraction, based on the summation of the London - van der Waals interactions between the atoms was established in 1937 by HamakerH. C. Hamaker, Physica, 4(10), 1058-1072 (1937) who also worked at Philips. However, the details on the repulsion produced by the electric double layer around colloidal particles were not so clear. By using thermodynamic considerations, the relevant free energies were calculated and interaction potential were derived. This research resulted in a seminal work Theory of the Stability of Lyophobic Colloids. The work had a great influence, and is still used by considerations about the stability of colloids, but also in various other fields where charged surfaces interact with each other. The whole of that theory is now known as DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek) theory. In 1946, Overbeek became a professor of physical chemistry at the Utrecht University. He picked up a wide range of problems which, despite their different forms, always had the same distinctive approach. For Overbeek method was simple, theoretical model, selected experiments, rigorous calculations and testing the model with experimental sets. Overbeek also remained active after his retirement in 1981. His passion at that time was the understanding of the phenomenon of micro-emulsions, which were more stable in comparison to the conventional macro-emulsions. For his pioneering work Overbeek received several prestigious awards. He received honorary degrees from Clarkson University and University of Bristol. In 1989 he received the Wolfgang Ostwald Prize. He received honorary memberships of the Royal Netherlands Chemical Society. He was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953. Every year European Colloid and Interface Society awards Overbeek Gold Medal, which is a prize named after Theodoor Overbeek. \\"The Overbeek Gold Medal honours leadership and scientific excellence in the field of colloid and interface science over an entire career.\\" The first prize in 2005 was handed over to Overbeek himself.

Her practice also included animated film, woodcut, monotypes and drawing which often expressed surrealist themes. Edell believed an artist’s work should be an expression of their own personal experience. Her work was rooted in feminism and drew inspiration from her dreams, religion and politics. Her work is recognized for its dream like qualities, art historical references, sensuality, unabashed sexuality, narrative and subversive wit.  Life and education  Nancy Edell was born in Omaha, Nebraska on November 12, 1942. Edell obtained her Bachelor of Fine Arts in printmaking and contemporary dance from the University of Omaha in 1964. By the time Edell was in her 20s, she had lived in Los Angeles, California, Victoria, British Columbia, and then Bristol, England where she continued her cinematic works and studies. From 1968-1969, Edell studied film and animation at the University of Bristol. After Edell's brief time in England, she moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba where she worked in animation and lithography until 1980. In 1980, Edell moved from Manitoba to the small village of Bayswater, Nova Scotia, and discovered the traditional domestic craft of rug-hooking which changed her art practice dramatically. Edell became a Canadian citizen in 1981. In 1982, Edell began teaching part-time at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, and continued working there until 2002. She was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma in the fall of 1999 and died on June 9, 2005. Edell was married to Peter Walker, and she also has a son, Gabriel Edell, a daughter-in-law, Sarah Maley Edell, and two grandchildren, Hyacinth Edell and Levon Edell.  Works  = Film = In the early 1970s Nancy Edell was acclaimed as one of Canada's foremost animators, though she preferred to be considered an artist. Edell says that most of her early film work was a form of self-therapy, a response to growing up in the 1950s in Nebraska, the “rigid sex-roles” that defined her life and the violence she associated with sex. “Dirty jokes were my basic childhood reference to sex. Sex is dirty, that kind of stuff. Men grabbing at women and leering. I was just working this out.” Edell’s animation works were screened in numerous places throughout the world including Edinburgh, Oberhausen, Chicago, Amsterdam, Toronto, and Montreal. Edell has won awards for her film work from festivals in Paris, France (1972), and Edinburgh, Scotland (1969) as well as the First Festival of Women's Films, New York City (1972), and the Canada Council. Edell had amination commissions from the BBC, CBC, and also Sesame Street. Her first two film aminations, Black Pudding and Charley Company, were created using cut-out drawings and lithographic prints. The characters in these films were made from detailed drawings with moving parts that were filmed moving to create the animation. Edell moved away from work in film animation after the 1980s. However, residues of her animations can be seen in her still work through the “sequencing and fractured narrative structure” and the way she reused and repeated background images, as one would in cell animation.  Black Pudding (1969)  Black Pudding (1969) was Edells’ first film which she directed, wrote, and animated. The video is 7 minutes long in colour film. It was created during her studies at Bristol University, in England. During this time, many adult-orientated animations were being produced in Europe which spoke to questions of sexuality and social norms. Black Pudding features \\"a giant vagina belch[ing] out strange, surrealistic, creatures in an endless stream.” It is described as an “experimental...dark surrealist fantasy, full of bizarre often erotic imagery and feminist themes.” Edell herself explains the creating of Black Pudding as a “really gut things and I just spewed out everything I wanted to say”. The name “Black Pudding” became overtime, a reference to a woman’s insides and sexual organs. When Edell looked back on Black Pudding in an interview with Brian Clancey for Cinema Canada in 1976, she said she finds the film embarrassing. “Now, when I look at it, it's embarrassing, because it's so crude. It's really raw stuff.”  Charley Company (1972)  Charley Company was Edell’s second film and was created in 1972. It is a 9 min, colour animation. It was inspired by anti-war sentiment. The film featured a civilian army of sexual-sadistic civilian soldiers “walking up Uncle Sam’s ass”. Jana Vosikovska, in the program for the film series Canadian Women Filmmakers, describes these characters as “[a] procession of fantastic creatures from the worlds of H. Bosch, R. Crumb and T. Dine.” The film also features hermaphrodite like characters, which Edell attributes to her interest in “dual aspects” and siamese twins: when two things are joined together in impossible ways.  Lunch (1973)  Edell’s third film Lunch, made in 1973, is a 4-minute colour animation. She received a grant from the BBC. Lunch is a film about a waiter, a chef, and the customers. The idea for the film was initially submitted by a BBC producer, and was about the contrast between the atmosphere of the dining hall and kitchen in a restaurant. = Rug Hooking = When Edell arrived in Nova Scotia in 1980, rug hooking was a deep part of Nova Scotian folk-culture since the 1850s, but it had not yet found a place within fine art. Her move to Nova Scotia signaled a pivotal turn in her work; she started to incorporate the medium of rug hooking into her work, creating a unique visual style. Edell’s work with this medium mixes the traditional practices of rug hooking with controversial themes such as feminism, sexuality, and death. She used the narrative possibilities of this medium to express a dream like quality with art historical references, sensuality, journeys and wit. “Using found wool rag (used clothing) and a traditional method of shrinking, she began to construct images that spoke of enclosed interior (indoor) spaces as related to the gender issue. She explores a socially-constructed gender that is developed through the use of myth (often Assyrian) and stereotype”. Rug hooking and other domestic and often textile-based crafts, like quilting, knitting, sewing, and embroidery are often associated with the ‘feminine arts’. Because of this association with femininity and the domestic, they were devalued within the male-dominated hierarchy of art. Edell, along with artists like Joyce Wieland, Kate Walker, Eva Hesse,Jackie Winsor, Miriam Schapiro pushed the boundaries between craft and art in the 1960-80s. They argued the distinction between craft and art was a gendered one. \\"Mat hooking aligned Edell with feminist artists of the time who were incorporating folk and craft elements into their fine art practices. It was a choice that established a gender position from which she developed the feminist utopia depicted in her Art Nuns rug-hooking series. With its scenes of a community of celibate women artists devoted to the creation and exploration of art, Art Nuns illustrates Edell’s shift to a woman-centered vision. In the 1990s her hooked-rug works grew beyond the familiar format of the enclosed border which was typical of her earlier work. Edell’s final body of work has been described as cataclysmic and urgent, depicting pathological processes, micro-organisms and systems of medicine and biology — a response to the terminal cancer that would eventually take her life.\\"  Exhibitions + Awards  = Solo = 1989, Nancy Edell, Galerie d’Art, Université de Moncton, Moncton, New Brunswick. 1989, Fragile Structures, Anna Leonowens Gallery, Halifax, Nova Scotia. 1988, Nancy Edell, Omaha Art Gallery, Omaha, Nebraska. 1986, Home Entertainment, Plug In Gallery, Winnipeg, Manitoba. 1885, Nancy Edell, Southern Alberta Art Gallery, Lethbridge, Alberta. 1984, Boudoir / Home Entertainment, Great George Street Gallery, Charlottetown, PEI. 1981, Nancy Edell, Art Gallery, Mount Saint Vincent University, Halifax, Nova Scotia. = Group = 1990, 4th International Biennial Print Exhibition, Taipei, Taiwan. 1990, Pictoral Space: New Images in Textiles, The Museum for Textiles, Toronto, Ontario. 1989, No Place Like Home, SAW Gallery, Ottawa, Ontario. 1988, Eighty / Twenty: 100 Years of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia. 1987, Nancy Edell / Vivienne Pearson, Articulate Gallery, Montreal, Quebec, and Latitude 53, Edmonton, Alberta. 1986, 8th International Exhibition of Graphic Art, Frechen, West Germany. 1985, innovascotia, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia. 1983, Atlantic Print Exhibition, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia. 1982, Mirrorings, Art Gallery, Mount Saint Vincent University, Halifax, Nova Scotia. = Collections = Acadia University Art Gallery, Wolfville, Nova Scotia Art Gallery of Brant, Brantford, Ontario Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada Council Art Bank, Ottawa, Ontario Dalhousie Art Gallery, Halifax, Nova Scotia Art Gallery, Mount Saint Vincent University, Halifax, Nova Scotia Memorial University Art University.

Approximately 45,000 people attend one of the conferences each year. It was founded in 1991 as a small cryptography conference. RSA conferences take place in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the United Arab Emirates each year. The conference also hosts educational, professional networking, and awards programs. History =Early history= The name RSA refers to the public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, Inc., which was founded in 1982. The abbreviation stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, the inventors of the technique. The idea for the first RSA conference was conceived in 1991 in a phone call between then RSA Security CEO Jim Bidzos and the Executive Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The first conference had just one panel, called \\"DES and DSS: Standards of Choice.\\" It focused on why attendees should not adopt DSS, a standard that was expected to challenge RSA Security's status as the de facto standard for digital signatures. A poster from the 1998 RSA condemning Clipper The event steadily grew and in 1993 it attracted more than 200 attendees. Known for many years as the RSA Data Security Conference, it eventually became just the RSA Conference. Over time the conference grew more business-oriented with an older demographic and more vendors, which led to competitive issues for a time in the 1990s; European competitors to RSA Security sometimes could not get a booth, so they hired people to pass out flyers at the RSA conference encouraging attendees to visit them at hotels nearby. In 1995 the conference criticized the Clipper Chip. If implemented, the chip would have given the U.S. government direct access to evidence on telecommunications devices with the chip installed. The conference put up posters with \\"Sink Clipper\\" in big letters. By 1997 the conference had grown to 2,500 attendees. The first European RSA Conference took place in 2000 and started with just 5 tracks. According to Network World the conference's focus expanded from cryptography into a broader IT security conference with larger attendance in 2005, when Microsoft CEO Bill Gates did the keynote presentation. According to Bidzos, the purpose of the conference became \\"for all kinds of things: drive standards, organize some opposition to government policies, promote the RSA name, [and] give all of our customers an opportunity\\". By 2008 the conference had 17,000 attendees and 375 participating IT security vendors. It had 18 tracks and 230 sessions. =Recent history= At the 2010 RSA conference, the Obama administration publicly revealed the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), which was created in 2008 and formerly kept a secret. In 2011, a California-based IT security company, HBGary, withdrew from speaking and exhibiting at the RSA conference, citing safety concerns. The company announced plans to reveal the identities of some members of the hacktivist group Anonymous and received retaliatory threats and hacks. In 2014, 8 speakers boycotted the RSA conference after its sponsor, RSA Security, was accused of adding a backdoor to its products, so the National Security Agency could monitor users of RSA Security technology. The boycott began with then F-Secure Chief Technology Officer Mikko Hyppönen. He wanted RSA Security to apologize, whereas the company's statement was that the allegations were not true. Some noted that the RSA conference and RSA Security company are only loosely connected. Discussion at that year's conference was focused heavily on leaks by Edward Snowden and NSA involvement with American technology companies. The first RSA Conference in the Asia-Pacific was introduced in 2013. This was followed by the inaugural United Arab Emirates conference two years later. In 2015 the conference added a clause to exhibitor contracts effectively prohibiting \\"booth babes\\" by requiring professional attire on the exhibitor floor. The policy was implemented in response to feedback that booth babes made the conference feel unprofessional. Fortune Magazine called the widespread practice of having booth babes at professional conferences \\"outdated\\" and unwelcoming to female attendees. The following year, the RSA conference was focused on the FBI–Apple encryption dispute, regarding attempts by the government to gain access to iPhones containing evidence in criminal investigations. As of 2017, the conference has an estimated 40,000–43,000 attendees in the United States. Content The RSA Conference is an international conference series on IT security that takes place in the United States, Europe, Asia/Japan, and the United Arab Emirates. It also provides internet safety education for consumers and children, a security scholar program for IT security students, and operates award programs typically bestowed at conferences. For example, one award is the Innovation Sandbox contest, which involves ten startups that present their technology to a panel of judges. The 2017 conference in the U.S. had 15 keynotes, 700 speakers, 500 sessions, and 550 exhibitors. An analysis of session keywords at the conference suggest that early conferences were focused on cryptography and commerce, but the topical focus of conferences transitioned to cloud and cybersecurity in the early 2000s. Each conference has a theme, a practice that began in 1995. Additionally, there are typically one or two IT security topics that the conference organizers pick to focus on each year. Speaking positions at the RSA conference are highly competitive, with thousands of submissions for a few hundred speaking positions.

On 19 March, Al-Qaeda issued a statement approving the new group and accepting their oath of allegiance. Two leaders sanctioned by the US Treasury's office were named as Ali Maychou and Bah Ag Moussa. Moussa was a former Malian army colonel who led an operation in March 2019 against the Malian Armed Forces base in Dioura that killed at least 21 Malian soldiers.

He founded the Seva Sadan along with Behramji Malabari. He published numerous books including Sata saheliyun (Seven girl-friends, 1906) and Chabak mana lai ain rihan (Lashes for the mind, 1923–29). Works in English include The History of a Humble Soul (a biography of Sadhu Hiranand), Something about Sindh (1882) and a biography of Malabari with an introduction by Florence Nightingale. He wrote on religion and spiritualism under the pen-names of Zero, Bijal and Sigma. Dayaram married to young Yashoda and had two sons and three daughters. His second marriage was at the age of 56 to a young girl Urmila aged 26 in his Ashram in 1913. He withdrew himself from society after this but it was apparently to protect the girl who had become pregnant after a relationship with another boy in the ashram.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1998. The site covers an area of about 30 hectares. Overview During the early to middle Jōmon period (approximately 3500 to 2000 BC), sea levels were five to six meters higher than at present, and the ambient temperature was also 2 deg C higher. During this period, the Tōhoku region was inhabited by the Jōmon people, many of whom lived in coastal settlements. The middens associated with such settlements contain bone, botanical material, mollusc shells, sherds, lithics, and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with the now-vanished inhabitants, and these features, provide a useful source into the diets and habits of Jōmon society. The Futatsumori Site is one of the largest found in the Tōhoku region, and is located on a 30 meter high plateau on the west bank of Lake Ogawara, which was a salt-water inlet of the Pacific Ocean at that time. It consists of several shell middens divided into two areas on the northern and southern slopes of the plateau. The western section consists of seven smaller shell middens forming a rough shell ring. The eastern area consists of five much larger shell middens, also forming a rough shell ring, and enclosing the remains of the settlement. The 27 varieties of shells excavated indicate that the nearby Ogasawa inlet was salt water in the early Jōmon period, but had become brackish by the middle Jōmon period. In addition to shells (with a high percentage of ’'Yamato shijimi and hamaguri, the middens also contained many fish bones, bones from swans, ducks, deer, boars and other animals, indicating the varied diet of the local inhabitants. Shards of various types of Jōmon pottery were also discovered, as were artifacts made of jade and obsidian, which were not produced in the area, and which thus indicates trade with other areas. Canine remains were also discovered, indicating that the Jōmon period inhabitants kept dogs. The numerous foundations of pit dwellings and storage pits indicates that this was a large settlement. Four of the artifacts discovered at the site (intricately carved ornaments from bone) have been designated as Aomori Prefectural Important Cultural Properties. The site has been submitted for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List as one of the Jōmon Archaeological Sites in Hokkaidō, Northern Tōhoku, and other regions The site has two restored pit dwellings and an explanatory plaque. Some of the recovered artifacts are on display at the Shichinohe Town Cultural Center. The site is approximately 20 minutes by car from Kamikitachō Station on the Aoimori Railway.

It is mostly second growth temperate deciduous forest, interspersed with wetlands and beaver ponds, as well as sedge-dominated rock-ridges. A central ridge has more than twenty hectares of hemlock forest. There are also old fields that remain from pastures created in the previous century. Parts of this property, as well as adjoining lands, are designated as the Scotch Corners Provincially Significant Wetland. The property is one of several protected by the Mississippi Madawaska Land Trust. This seepage valley has a deciduous forest canopy, with an understory of ostrich fern, and supports several with calcium- demanding plants including Clinton’s fern and narrow-leaved spleenwort. This valley is a headwater for a stream that eventually feeds into Mississippi Lake. Geology The bed rock is gneiss, and rounded gneiss ridges alternate with valleys filled with glacial till.Geological Survey of Canada. 1973. Map 1362A Geology, Carleton Place, 1: 50,000. Although the soils are therefore acidic, and shallow, the presence of certain plants that require calcium, such as yellow lady slipper and bulblet bladder fern, indicate that some of the glacial till may contain marble from landscapes further north in the county. The east side of the property lay beneath the Champlain Sea, and so has clay deposits rather than till; some of these clay plains are covered in thick organic deposits. This produces a flat, poorly drained landscape. The shoreline of the Champlain sea can still be recognized as it meanders from north east to south west across the property. Forests The original forests were predominantly sugar maple, beech, white pine and hemlock, which is typical for land on the Canadian shield in eastern Ontario.Keddy, Cathy J. 1994. Forest History of Eastern Ontario. Eastern Ontario Model Forest, Information Report Number 1, 41 p + appendices. Eastern Ontario Model Forest, Kemptville, Ontario. These forests were heavily logged in the 1800s and then often cleared for pastures and fields. White pine was removed for ship building, hemlock was removed for tanning leather, and most other species of trees were burned to produce potash which was exported to Europe. Thus, the current forests have altered species composition, with smaller trees, and reduced soil fertility. Human history The Keddy Nature Sanctuary lies on the extreme east side of a tract that was surveyed and subdivided as part of the Perth Military Settlement in 1816.Perth and District Historical Society.

Irish and Scottish Identities in a Canadian Community. Beckwith Township, 633 p. Most of KNS was settled somewhat later in history, as lands nearer Perth and on better soils were cleared and farmed first. The settlement history of the property is evidenced by remains of four former farm houses, many stone wells, several wells, and even a small mica mine, as well as non- indigenous plants such as lilacs. The property was donated to the Mississippi Madawaska Land Trust by the Keddy family in 2014.Spears, Tom. 2014. Couple preserves a square mile of Lanark County for 999 years. The Ottawa Citizen, 11 May 2014. Wetlands The property has more than ten ponds, and these in turn are interconnected by seepage areas and vernal pools left by melting snow in the spring. There are healthy populations of at least eight species of frogs: wood frogs, leopard frogs, spring peepers, American toads, gray treefrogs, mink frogs, green frogs and bull frogs.Mississippi Madawaska Land Trust Conservancy. 2014. Baseline Documentation Report. 14 p. The earliest to call each year are usually wood frogs and spring peepers, often when ponds still have areas of ice. Wood frogs are rapid breeders in small temporary ponds, also known as vernal ponds; mating and egg laying are completed in just a few days. Gray Tree frogs, on the other hand, have a much longer calling period. They call from the trees before moving to water, they call from the water while mating, and then they call while leaving the pond for the forest. Bullfrogs are the last to call, usually during the hot evenings of July and August. Other amphibians include spotted, blue spotted and red-backed salamanders. There are also populations of snapping turtles and painted turtles, with recorded sightings of Blanding’s turtles; several south-facing slopes are actively used by nesting turtles. As noted above, there are frequent sightings of wetland mammals including otters, muskrat, beavers and ermine. There is a rich wetland flora typical of ponds on the Canadian shield, such as yellow water lilies and water shield. There are also less-common species including green arrow arum Toner, Maureen, Nicholas Stow and Cathy J. Keddy. 1995. Arrow arum, Peltandra virginica: a nationally rare plant in the Ottawa Valley region of Ontario. The Canadian Field-Naturalist 109 (4): 441-2. and purple-fringed orchid. There is one known species of a carnivorous plant, horned bladderwort. There are also large clones of semi-aquatic sedges that support populations of two rare butterflies, the broad winged skipper and the Appalachian brown. Terrestrial animals The dominant herbivores at KNS are deer, beavers and porcupines. The forests have clearly been shaped, and continue to be shaped, by all three.Mississippi Madawaska Land Trust Conservancy. 2014. Baseline Documentation Report. 14 p. Deer browse and graze heavily, and have depleted native populations of understory species such as yew, as well as preventing regeneration of preferred foods such as hemlock and yellow birch. Beavers have removed hardwood trees in the vicinity of most ponds, allowing dense conifer stands to form. One of the most common trees is now ironwood, a species which is not commonly eaten by deer or beavers. Many rock ridges are dominated by ironwood with a sedge understorey. Porcupines feed mostly on sugar maple and red oak trees, but seasonally feed in hemlock trees. It is likely that all three of these species are at higher than normal populations owing to the comparative absence of natural predators. Wolves and bobcats have been extirpated. Coyotes do hunt in the forest, however, and remove some deer, while fishers have been observed, and presumably take some porcupines. The birds reflect the landscape. Many birds use the deciduous forest to nest in the spring. These include rose-breasted grosbeaks, black- throated green warblers, ovenbirds, and great crested flycatchers. The wetlands provide migratory resting areas for large numbers of ducks, particularly wood ducks, hooded mergansers and ring-necked ducks. Wood ducks and hooded mergansers often nest. There are recorded nests of both heron and osprey, and for about a decade in the 1970s there was a heronry of more than thirty nests. There are also records of nesting turkey vultures.Brunton, Daniel F. 2004. Turkey vulture nest sites in southeastern Ontario. Ontario Birds 22 (1): 36-38. Owing in part to the quality of the forest, there are at least four species of woodpeckers: downy, hairy, yellow-bellied sapsucker, and pileated. Barred owls are regularly heard and seen. Highlights Some of the biological highlights of the property include: * a large stand of native hemlock, including trees in excess of a century in age * populations of red oak and bur oak with trees in excess of a century in age * a seepage valley with calcium-demanding plants including Clintons fern and narrow-leaved spleenwort. * more than a kilometer of Champlain Sea shoreline, with associated springs and seepage areas * wetlands that are part of a provincially significant wetland * headwaters for several creeks draining into Mississippi Lake * a large population of green arrow arum in the largest beaver pond * a large population of an uncommon orchid, downy rattlesnake plantain, on clay from the Champlain seaWhite, David J. 2016.

Language Dhanggati or Djangadi belongs to the Yuin–Kuric language family and is usually grouped with the Anēwan language. The Ngabu Bingayi Aboriginal Corporation promotes the revival study of their language learning as an ongoing activity in the Macleay Valley. Linguist Amanda Lissarrague has been active in assisting their efforts. The language is currently being taught at Kempsey TAFE. Part of the language was recorded and analysed by Nils Holmer and his wife. Country Norman Tindale estimated Djangadi traditional lands to have encompassed some . They took in the area from Point Lookout southwards as far as the headwaters of the Macleay River and the vicinity of the Mount Royal Range. To the east, their territory ran as far as the crests of the coastal ranges, while their inland extension to the west ran up to the Great Dividing Range and Walcha. The people to their north were the Gumbaynggirr. On their western flank were the Anēwan. The southern linguistic border is with Biripi. People The tribes in the Macleay/Manning area before white contact were estimated to number some 4,000. Their coastal neighbours viewed them with diffidence, calling them jang (bad folk). By some accounts they comprised between 6 and 8 different dialect groups, among which two dwelt in the upper catchment of the Macleay River system. These two were * Nulla Nulla * Conderang. Praying Mantis Totems, according to some elderly informants, could be social or personal. The praying mantis (gurginj gurginj) is listed among the former as a river totem and described as covering the river stretch from Bellbrook downwards as far as the area around Georges Creek. Animals such as the echidna were personal totems, with which particular persons were identified. The term for the localized patrilineal horde was dawun. Sacred sites The Djangadi creation myth contains a legend about the Rainbow Serpent, who was believed to have created the gorge at Apsley Falls in the Dreamtime. Once underground, it was said to have reemerged at the mill hole near Walcha on the Apsley River, =Burrel Bulai= Burrel Bulai (Mount Anderson) is considered to be one of the most powerful sacred sites in Thunghutti/Dunghutti Country and was registered was recorded as a place of significance by Ray Kelly, an Aboriginal Research Officer with the NSW Sites of Significance Survey team. =Long Gully= Two high ridges overlook the site, which was used, as late as 1932, for the fin al stages of initiation. =Carrai waterholes= Young Djangadi men went through initiation rites at Carrai Waterholes. History An Aboriginal presence in the Djangadi lands has been attested archaeologically to go back at least 4,000 years, according to the analysis of the materials excavated at the Clybucca midden, a site which the modern-day descendants of the Djangadi and Gumbaynggirr claim territory. In the Clybucca area are ancient camp sites with shell beds in the form of mounds which are up to high. Middens are attested in the Macleay Valley, together with remnants of a fish trap in the Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve and, just slightly north of Crescent Head, at Richardsons Crossing, there is a bora ring. White intrusion on the Djangadi lands first took off as mostly ex-convict cedar cutters, based at a camp at Euroka Creek established by Captain A. C. Innes in 1827, began exploring the rich resources of the area in the late 1820s. The first European settler in the Kempsey district was named Enoch William Rudder, in 1835, who had purchased a land grant of from its first owner, Samuel Onions. Within a decade the timber cutters had virtually harvested every stand of this highly prized red gold timber in clearances that made the land increasingly attractive to pastoralists, who by 1847, after the Crown Lands Occupation Act of 1836 permitted squatting, had established 31 stations along the Macleay river from Kempsey inland to Kunderang Brook. This coincided with one of the most violent and sustained examples of warfare in the Macleay gorges, during which it is estimated that around 15 massacres took place in the region targeting Aboriginal people of the area. The Djangadi and other tribes affected adopted guerilla tactics to fight the usurpation of their land, by attacking shepherds, hit-and-run raids on homesteads and duffing sheep and cattle livestock before retreating into the gorges where pursuit was difficult. Some 2 to 3 dozen people were killed for rustling sheep at a massacre which took place at Kunderang Brook in 1840. The war ended with the establishment of a force of native police at Nulla Nulla in 1851. However, by that time, attrition had devastated tribal numbers. Of the 4,000 Aboriginal people in the area before the settlements, one third are thought to have been killed in a little over two decades. A description of the Djangadi and other Aboriginal groups in the Macleay area was given by Captain John Macdonald Henderson in 1851. Some Djangadi settled the Shark, Pelican Island and the two Fattorini Islands in the Macleay River, gazette as Aboriginal reserves in 1885, and grew corn there. In 1924 the Fattorini island residents were relocated to Pelican Island, and its status as a reservation was cancelled. Eventually the Djangadi moved to Kinchela Creek Station though an unofficial camp remained at Green Hills, resisting attempts to have them relocated, until they were placed under the administration of a white manager at Burnt Bridge Reserve. Discrimination barriers were finally broken in part when the first Aboriginal children were permitted in 1947 to attend Green Hill Public School, though the white community reacted by shifting their children to West Kempsey. Native title The first successful mainland claim for native title was made by the Djangadi, whose rights were recognized by the New South Wales Government in the Crescent Head Agreement. They were awarded in the same year $738,000 in compensation, with an attached agreement to be paid another sum a decade later. A sum of $6.1 million was paid as a compensation payout which the state government has made 14 years later, based on recognition that 12.4 hectares at Crescent Head, which had been given residential development approval, lay under their native title rights. Djangadi culture The Wigay Aboriginal Cultural Park near Kempsey contains over 150 different native Indigenous plants to the Macleay Valley. The site is diversified by plantations of species according to rainforest, dry forest, tropical forest, heathland and wetland niches.

Early life and education Cecil Burke Day, Jr was born in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Cecil B. Day and Marian (Deen) Uldine Smith Day. One of four sons born to the couple. His father was a real estate developer, and founder of the Days Inn motel chain. Young Day went to Mercer University in Atlanta, Georgia. He later moved to Tybee Island, Georgia, site of his father's first Days Inn, where he worked in real estate and investments. Political career Day was first elected to public office as a member of the Tybee Island City Council. He served on the Council from 1991 to 1994. In 1994 he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as a Republican representing District 153. He took office in January 1995 at a time when his brother, Clinton M. Day, served as a member of the Georgia State Senate. Burke Day continued to serve in the Georgia House for 8 consecutive terms (16 years), until January 2011. Day served on the Appropriations, Defense & Veterans Affiars, and Public Safety & Homeland Security committees. He was chairman of Georgia’s Homeland Security and Public Safety. He was perhaps best known for the Stephens-Day legislation, which froze the taxable value of residential property at the time the property was purchased, protecting homeowners from being taxed out of their homes when property values went up. Later years Day wrote a book about his father, who died at age 44. It tells the story of Cecil B. Day, Sr., and how he built the Days Inn motel chain. Day by Day: The Story of Cecil B. Day and his Simple Formula for Success was published in 2000. Burke Day died at his home in Tybee Island, Georgia on March 5, 2017, from complications of a stroke.

Established in 1741, it has served in that role since, and now reflects a typical 19th-century small town center. It extends along Main Street, between its junctions with Library Street and Under Mountain Road. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The town of Salisbury, located in Connecticut's northwest corner, was incorporated in 1741, and thrived economically on the exploitation of iron ore which had been found in its hills. This resource was overtaken by technological advances by the American Civil War, and the town experienced no significant further economic growth. The town center developed in the mid-1740s, with the Bushnell Tavern established in 1746, and the cemetery in 1750. A portion of the original tavern survives in altered form at 6 Factory Street. and The historic district is bounded on the north by the triangular town green, formed by the junction of Main Street and Under Mountain Road, and the White Hart Tavern, a rambling building dating to about 1800. The southern end of the district is anchored by the civic buildings of the town hall and the Scoville Library, both set on large landscaped lots. The town hall is a modern construction from 1988, but retains traditional features such as clapboard siding and pilasters, while the library is an 1894 Romanesque stone building donated by a local benefactor. The commercial district is a roughly three- block area set between these, with modestly scaled two-story buildings, many of which are former residences converted to commercial use.

She is remembered for her poetry collection Soupirs poétiques (1833) and for her Histoire de l'abbaye de Saint-Denis (History of Saint-Denis Abbey, 1861). Biography Born in 1801 in Paris, d'Ayzac was a gifted and hard-working child. When she was 16, she joined the Legion of Honour School in Saint-Denis, soon becoming a dame professeur (lady teacher). She remained there for 35 years, first taking an interest in literature and poetry and later turning to the history of art, especially archaeology. After receiving recognition for her poetry in 1823 and 1824, her Soupirs received an award from the Académie française in 1843. Her work on art and architecture was particularly impressive. In 1849 her description of statues in Chartres Cathedral (Statues de l'un des porches de la cathédrale de Chartres) was welcomed by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. In 1861, the same institution awarded her a prize for her Histoire de l'abbaye de Saint-Denis. These early works contributed to her reputation as one of the first female art historians in France. Other contributions on architecture include Histoire et emblèmes bibliques sculptés au pourtour extérieur du choeur de Notre-Dame de Paris published in Revue archéologique in 1845, and Symbolique des pierres précieuses ou tropologie des gemmes in 1846, both published in Revue archéologique. The same year, in the Annales archéologiques de Didron, she published Des quatre animaux apocalyptiques et de leurs représentations sur les églises au moyen-âge. On her retirement, she moved to Castelnoubel Castle near Agen where she continued to write poetry and published further articles on biblical emblems, especially animals. Félicie d'Ayzac died at Castelnoubel, Bon-Encontre, on 26 March 1881.

Web. Accessed Feb 15 2017. Retrieved from http://dana.njit.edu/items/show/419 It housed a co-ed college/vocational preparatory school which provided students with \\"a happier and more healthful environment than their own homes\\". The building was constructed under the supervision of the Newark School Board's Head of Construction Department, Ernest F. Gilbert. It housed Central High School until its purchase in 2010 by NJIT. Built in the Collegiate Gothic style, the facility, which was renovated under a New Jersey state grant, re-opened as a university building and STEM counseling center on April 13, 2017. History Plans for construction of the proposed Central Commercial and Manual Training School House were publicly announced on March 14, 1909. A competition of architects had been conducted by the board of the Newark Public Schools three years preceding the announcement in order to determine the most elegant design. However, the plans drawn up by the winner, a Mr. Myers, had called for the costly excavation into a ledge of rock, estimated to cost $40,000. Although the Board had already set aside a total budget of approximately $650,000 for the construction of the school building, the board was not in favor of the expenditure. Luckily, the School Board's supervising Architect, Ernest F. Gilbert, worked out a solution to the problem which rendered the excavation unnecessary and continued to maintain the level of elegance desired by the School Board. Throughout construction Gilbert remained in charge of planning and supervising, assisted by George W. Knight, the school engineer in charge of heating, lighting, ventilating and other engineering details. An additional floor was called for the week following the announcement in 1909, and Gilbert was able to accommodate the change without damaging the architectural structure. Although the school was founded in 1911, the building itself was not dedicated until January 31, 1912, upon which the city of Newark was congratulated, and by 1913 evening classes had begun. Mr. Gilbert's solution had included the design of a dramatic staircase which sat at the front of the school and took advantage of the slope upon which the school was built. However, around the year 1970 Ernest F. Gilbert's staircase was demolished in favor of the construction of an indoor swimming pool in its place. After the 1967 Newark riots, the school's area fell into decline. This promoted the expansion of the four bordering universities which include the Rutgers University–Newark campus, NJIT, Essex County College, the University of Medicine And Dentistry of New Jersey (now the New Jersey Medical School of Rutgers). Having been engulfed by its campus, NJIT officially purchased it in 2010. After this purchase NJIT began using the building for adult courses, although some high school classes continued on certain floors until the complete migration of the high school's student populace to their new school building. Structure The Central King Building was originally built in a Jacobean style, although the towers on each corner are Tudor Gothic. Its initial shape was a large square-like building consisting of a combination of terracotta and brick, three stories high, with each corner tower an extra story higher. This building's initial accommodation was 1,200 students. The Central King Building was initially created with the goal to accommodate all STEM students. The first floor contained a machine shop, reference library, administrative offices, pattern shop, a metalworking shop, three classrooms, and spaces for wood-turning, masonry, and wood- finishing. The second floor contained five standard classrooms, three for business and typewriting, two for chemical labs, separated by a lecture room, two sewing rooms, two millinery rooms, and a room for dressmaking and a large study hall. The third floor contains EIGHT standard classrooms, a music room, a biological lab, a laundry room, two kitchens, a great-machine drawing room, a free-hand drawing room, two physics labs and a lecture room. The fourth room was left unfinished, leaving room to accommodate more students. The basement includes spaces for lockers, foundry and forge rooms, stock rooms and space for heating and ventilation. Outside of the building, there is a portion of land that contains a boiler and engine rooms, as well as a mechanical testing plant.Ernst F.

The church is a grade II listed building. It is located in the Parish of All Saints with St. John Clifton in the Diocese of Bristol. History In 1862, a committee was set up to provide a large church for the Clifton area of Bristol. It would be in the Anglo-Catholic tradition, and would be a free church with no rented pews. The original church was built between 1868 and 1872 by George Edmund Street. The chancel was consecrated on 8 June 1868. A narthex was added in 1909 by George Frederick Bodley, and a sacristy was added in 1928 by Frederick Charles Eden. On 2 December 1940, an incendiary bomb set fire to the building, destroying the chancel and nave of the church. Only the tower, narthex, and sacristy remained standing. W. H. Randoll Blacking was the architect chosen to reconstruct the church, but, after much delay, he died before work could begin. In the 1960s, it was once more decided that the rebuilding of the church should go ahead and Robert Potter was selected as the architect. He reorientated the church so that the altar now faces East. The altar itself is free standing and is set under a ciborium, a four-columned indoor roof. Behind the font is a series of stained glass windows made from fibre glass and designed by John Piper. The new nave and altar were consecrated on 1 July 1967. On 8 January 1959, the church was designated a grade II listed building. =Present day= In 1978, the parish of All Saints Clifton was joined with that of St John's Clifton to form the Parish of All Saints with St. John Clifton. St John's Church was declared redundant in 1980. In March 2013, the parochial church council voted to rescind Resolutions A and B, and to rescind the petition for alternative episcopal oversight. With these actions, the parish signalled that it accepts the ordination of women. It remains within the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England. Archives Parish records for the Church of All Saints, Clifton are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. P.St ASC) (online catalogue) including baptism and marriage registers and plans of the remodelling from 1963. The archive also includes records of the incumbent, churchwardens, parochial church council, charities and choir school.

After completing his secondary education Witzel studied at a musical conservatory in Wiesbaden having studied piano, cello and classical guitar since childhood. From 1975 onward Witzel published poems in alternative literary magazines including Das Nachtcafé, TJA and Machwerk. His first volume of poetry, Stille Tage in Cliché was published by Nautilus in 1978. His breakthrough novel Bluemoon Baby (2001), the follow-up, Revolution und Heimarbeit (2003) and later works, include elements of conspiracy theory, espionage genre and politics in a heady mix of popular culture and literary theory that has led to his work being likened to that of Thomas Pynchon. For his projected novel Die Erfindung der Roten Armee Fraktion durch einen manisch-depressiven Teenager im Sommer 1969, Witzel received the 2012 Robert Gernhardt Prize. This was followed by the award of the German Book Prize in 2015 for the completed 800-page novel.

It consists of a rectangular, single-nave church hall consisting of three bays of which the easternmost is the choir. There is a sacristy to the north and a church porch to the south. The oldest of the church fittings are the triumphal cross from the 13th century, which has been described as one of the finest of its kind and Sweden and which resembles contemporary triumphal crosses from Denmark, and the baptismal font, also from the 13th century.

Founded in 2016, ICOM is located at the Meridian campus of Idaho State University (ISU). At ICOM, students can earn a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree. ICOM's mission is to train osteopathic physicians in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and more. ICOM matriculated its second class of students in August 2019. This Class of 2023 is composed of graduates from 104 U.S. colleges and universities. These students originate from 38 states with approximately one-third coming from Idaho and the ICOM target five-state region, including Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. History Before ICOM was established, Idaho was the most populous state without a medical school of its own. ICOM was formed to help address the current and growing shortage of physicians in its five- state region outlined in its mission, with an emphasis on rural, underserved areas. Although Idaho is among the most rapidly growing areas of the country, the state ranks 49th in physicians per capita. In December 2017 COCA granted ICOM pre-accreditation status and authorized the recruitment of 162 students. Campus Located in Meridian, Idaho, the three-story, 94,000-square-foot facility cost $34 million, and took Engineered Structures, Inc. (ESI) just thirteen months to build. Dekker/Perich/Sabatini, a New Mexico-based architecture firm, did the design. ICOM's campus includes more than 12,000 feet of classroom space, including: two lecture halls, each with 250 seats; a clinical simulation center; a 3,5000-square-foot medical library; and a 3,479-square-foot osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) Lab. Additionally, 12 Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) rooms are located on the second floor. ICOM has a 40-year agreement with Idaho State University- Meridian for use of its Treasure Valley Anatomy and Physiology Laboratory (TVAPL). There, ICOM's first-year medical students perform whole-body dissections on donated bodies, also known as cadavers. Academics As a free-standing medical school, ICOM only offers graduate-level training. ICOM awards the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (DO). This is a four-year degree with years 1 and 2 consisting of on-campus didactic lectures, small group assignments laboratory and clinical experiences. Years 3 and 4 are completed at selected clinical sites. In November 2019, ICOM announced that it had been recognized as an Apple Distinguished School for 2019-2022 for its unique implementation of Apple technology in creating a culture of engagement amongst the students, faculty and staff at Idaho's first medical school. Apple Distinguished Schools are centers of innovation, leadership, and educational excellence that use Apple technology to inspire creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking. They showcase innovative uses of technology in learning, teaching, and the school environment and have documented results of academic accomplishment. Student Life Students participate in several organizations and interest committees on campus. There are more than 30 student organizations represented on campus, ranging from national, professional and general interest.

Early life and education Born in Canada in 1972, Robson grew up in Hawaii and now resides in New York. Robson attended Columbia University where she graduated with a B.A. in visual arts and art history. Work Robson's primary focus is creating works made with plastic collected by intercepting the waste stream, repurposing plastic into art before it is sent to recycling. While her initial work was with common household plastics like water bottles and caps, she is currently focused on large scale sculptures made with industrial plastic. She also paints and creates 3-dimensional collages made with junk mail and excess packaging. In 2008, Robson founded Project Vortex, a not-for-profit organization consisting of artists, designers and architects from around the world that also work with plastic. The organization strives to bring awareness to plastic pollution and encourage cleanups of waterways. In 2013, she gave a Ted talk at TedxPeachtree entitled \\"Trash+Love\\" introducing \\"Sculpture+Intercepting the Waste Stream,\\" an open source course she designed to foster creative stewardship at academic institutions. The course was first taught by Robson at Mary Baldwin University in 2012. Her goal for the course is to inspire others to look at junk differently and rather than discard it, to create art.

This subject matter is quite common, with images appearing as early as the 14th century. Viewers are often exposed to a private, personal moments through these works. Reading Woman (c.1660) by Pieter Janssans Elinga portrays reading as an intimate and introspective activity. Beyond the exchange of ideas between author and reader, scholar James Conlon, describes reading as an intimate and erotic subject, through the captivating book that touches and holds the reader's attention, and offers tactile pleasure in weight. As a result, the image of a woman reading becomes one of sexual subversion, and a source of fear for the male viewer or artist. In Western, patriarchal societies, Conlon argues, the act of reading takes a woman out of subservient role and into a context where personal pleasure, knowledge, and enjoyment is literally in her hands.  Depictions of woman readers  Antoine Wiertz, The Reader of Novels, c. 1853 During the 19th century, amidst a golden age for reading, concerns emerged about women's reading as jeopardizing marital and familial structures. Drawings and illustrations of the time reflected this fear that women would be seduced by books and neglect their domestic duties. Other images implied the danger in tempting women with books as explicitly linked to their sexuality, like in Antoine Wiert'sThe Reader of Novels (c.1853), where the figure of the devil literally supplies the female subject with pleasurable reading material. Claude Monet, Springtime, c. 1872 In Dutch Golden Age painting, female readers were depicted as part of the genre of the everyday, usually engaged with letters. Johannes Vermeer, for example, created numerous works around this subject, including A Woman in Blue Reading a Letter and Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window. Despite this apparent acceptance of woman readers, scholars have determined that the letters including in Dutch painting were almost exclusively love letters. As Conlon argues, the self- relective act of reading becomes conflated in these depictions with distraction and longing for someone - presumably a male lover - ultimately undermining the subjectivity of the woman reader. Male artists have also depicted women readers within pastoral settings, like in Claude Monet's Springtime, perhaps in an attempt to tame or domesticate the otherwise wild act of reading. Woman in Blue Reading a Letter, ca. 1662-1663, Johannes Vermeer  Female artists and the subject of reading  Female artists have also been drawn to the subject of women readers. These artists depictions of reading greatly differ from their male counterparts, demonstrating the complexity of the topic. Mary Cassatt's Family Group Reading is a powerful representation of women readers who demonstrate subjectivity and serious literary engagement. All three are fixated on the text, and Cassat may be emphasizing that reading comes just as naturally to women as motherhood, by painting the young girl encircled by the woman's arms and drawn literally into the book.

After the brothers reconciled in 1799, Manuchar was appanaged with Salipartiano, which he lost to his nephew Levan, a new Prince of Mingrelia, in the wake of Grigol's death in 1804.  Power struggle  Manuchar was a son of Katsia II Dadiani by his third wife Anna Tsulukidze. In 1791, King Solomon II of Imereti, who sought to unite all of western Georgia under his authority, deposed Grigol and replaced him by a more amenable Manuchar. In 1792, Grigol's attempt at comeback were dashed as his newfound ally David II, claimant to the Imeretian crown, was defeated by Solomon and Manuchar near Kutaisi and Grigol's Abkhaz reinforcements deserted. Grigol later found support in the district of Lechkhumi and successfully resisted Solomon and Manuchar in his stronghold at Nogi. Manuchar was eventually ousted from Mingrelia and fled to Abkhazia in 1794, but Grigol was able to buy the Abkhaz ruler Kelesh Bey's loyalty by granting him the fort of Anaklia. There was another claimant in Mingrelia during these years: Tariel, younger brother of Grigol and Manuchar.  Lord of Salipartiano  The Dadiani brothers reconciled in 1799. Grigol was recognized as Prince of Mingrelia, while Manuchar received the fief of Salipartiano. In a renewed conflict between Imereti and Mingrelia in 1802, Solomon again attempted to enlist Manuchar, but the latter eventually stood by his brother's side. Grigol died in October 1804, a few months after he placed his principality under Russian suzerainty. His young son and successor Levan was placed under regency of the princess dowager Nino. Manuchar saw this as an opportunity to advance his claims to the Mingrelian throne and petitioned the Russian authorities to confirm him as the next ruler of Mingrelia or, at least, to leave Salipartiano in his possession. The Russians turned down Manuchar's request as well as his mother's intercession; in 1805, Salipartiano became a Mingrelian crown land and Manuchar was relegated to his reduced estates. Princess-regent Nino failed to fulfill her promise to compensate her brother-in-law for his losses and an attempt by the Russian governor-general Alexander Tormasov to help defuse tensions among the Dadiani failed. Manuchar and his brother Tariel rose in open rebellion against the Mingrelian regency in January 1810. Manuchar fled to the Imeretian king Solomon, who, at that time, was on the verge of war with the Russians. After Solomon's defeat by the Russian army, Manuchar stayed in Mingrelia and did not overtly join the king in a renewed uprising against the Russian encroachment in June 1810, but he was suspected of harboring anti- Russian sentiments. After Nino was sidelined from the government of Mingrelia in 1811, Manuchar played no active role in politics.  Family  Manuchar was married to Darejan, daughter of the Abkhaz nobleman Zurab Shervashidze. He had seven children, whose descendants are still extant: * Katsia (born 1795), * Zurab, * Levan (born 1807), * Ekaterine (born 1814), * Giorgi (died c. 1864), * Aleksandre (died 1856), * Dutu (born 1820).

After the attack and the U.S. entry into the war, he attended flight school and became a Naval Aviator. = Rescue of USS Indianapolis survivors = After delivering components for the atomic bombs that were eventually used against Japan, to the island of Tinian the heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis was steaming, unescorted, to Leyte for training of new crew members in advance of the planned attack on the Japanese home islands, when it was hit by two torpedoes shortly after midnight on 30 July, 1945. The ship listed, took on water and capsized within twelve minutes, with a third of the crew going down with the ship. As a result of error, no distress signal had been broadcast, and the ship was not noticed as missing for days after the sinking. Some 900 survivors, many in only life jackets and without other flotation, faced fatigue, dehydration under the daylight sun and hypothermia at night, salt-water poisoning, and shark attacks. Of the approximately 900 who abandoned ship, a total of 316 survived, with 56 of them being saved by Marks. On Aug 2, A land-based patrol plane spotted the heads of survivors bobbing on the water but was unable to identify them. Marks and his flight crew were dispatched to the scene to investigate in his amphibious PBY-5A Catalina patrol plane. He spotted the survivors and dropped life rafts. One life raft was destroyed by the drop while others were too far away from the exhausted crew. Against standing orders not to land in open ocean, Marks took a vote of his crew and decided to land the aircraft in twelve-foot swells. He was able to maneuver his craft to pick up survivors. Space in the craft was limited so Marks had survivors lashed to the wing with parachute cord. It damaged the wings, rendering the aircraft unflyable. Marks rescued 56 men. After nightfall, the destroyer escort (DE 368), the first of seven rescue ships, used its search light as a beacon and instilled hope in those still in the water. The Doyle and others picked up the remaining survivors and after everyone was off Marks' PBY, the Doyle sank her. Marks was awarded the Air Medal for his actions, and it was pinned on him by Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, CINCPAC.  Later life  Following the war, Marks returned to Frankfort, Indiana and practiced real-estate law. He died on March 7, 1998 at 81 years of age and was survived by his wife, five children and ten grandchildren.

During the onslaught of the AIDS epidemic in the late 1980s, she used her salary as a real estate agent to care for AIDS patients whose families and communities had abandoned them. Because of the prejudices, fears, and stigma surrounding the disease at the time, she was often the patients' only caregiver until they eventually died. She is recognized for burying them in her own family cemetery in Hot Springs, Arkansas. She currently lives in Rogers, Arkansas.  Early life  Named Frances Ruth Coker Burks after her grandmother, Burks was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and was friends with Bill Clinton growing up. During her childhood, her mother was hospitalized with tuberculosis for a prolonged period, during which Burks' father was her primary caretaker until his death when she was 5, after which her mother struggled with being Burks' parent. She cites these experiences as formative for her notable empathy. Burks's family members have been buried in Files Cemetery since the late 19th century. When Burks was a young girl, her mother got into a row with Burks's uncle. To ensure he and his branch of Burks would be never buried in the same place as the rest of the family, her mother bought every grave space in the cemetery. Those were 262 plots of land in Files Cemetery in Hot Springs. Later Burks' mother left that land to her. As an adult, Burks worked as a real estate broker.  AIDS advocacy  Burks' first interaction with an AIDS patient occurred in 1984, when she was visiting a friend in the hospital. Burks' friend had cancer, so Burks spent a lot of time in the hospital. During one visit, she noticed that nurses were afraid to go into one room covered by a red bag and found out that the patient had what was then known as Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (GRID). Burks' cousin was gay, and she had an interest in learning about the disease and was curious about the patient behind the door. She met the patient, a young man who wanted to see his mother before he died. To force his mother to hear his wishes, Burks had to threaten the mother with the publication of the man's obituary in their hometown newspaper; even then, the mother called him a \\"sinner\\" and said that she would not see him or claim the body when he died. Burks then took over his palliative care and comforted him until his death 13 hours later. After finding a funeral home that would take his body for cremation, she buried his ashes in her family cemetery. After that first encounter, Burks began to receive phone calls from others who needed her help, caring for over 1,000 people over the 30 or so years she worked with them. With assistance from her daughter, Burks has buried more than 40 people in her family cemetery in Hot Springs. While her charges were still alive, she helped take them to appointments, obtain medications, apply for assistance, and more. She also kept supplies of AIDS medications on hand, as some pharmacies would not carry these medications. Because of her work with people with AIDS, as she told KLRT-TV, she and her daughter were \\"outcasts\\" and crosses were burned in her yard twice. Burks received financial assistance from gay bars in Arkansas, including the Discovery Club in Little Rock: \\"They would twirl up a drag show on Saturday night and here'd come the money. [...] That's how we'd buy medicine, that's how we'd pay rent. If it hadn't been for the drag queens, I don't know what we would have done.\\" In 1988, Norman Jones, owner of the Discovery Club, created Helping People with AIDS, where Burks worked for several years. During Bill Clinton's presidency, Burks was a White House consultant for AIDS education. Burks' patients lived longer past the national average life expectancy, catching the interest of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health which sent researchers to investigate.  Post-AIDS crisis  After medical care and social attitudes towards AIDS improved, she lived and worked in Florida as a fishing guide and funeral director. In 2012, Burks suffered a stroke and had to relearn many skills, including how to talk, read, feed herself and write; she attributes the stress of caring for victims of the AIDS crisis as a plausible influencing factor. The stroke also led to memory loss. That year, she moved back to Rogers, Arkansas, both in order to be closer to her family and because health insurance would no longer cover her after her stroke. In 2013, Burks advocated for three foster children who were removed from school due to rumors that one might be HIV-positive. After she appeared on TV as an HIV advocate for the children, the community blackballed her, the funeral home she had previously worked at rescinded her standing job offer, and other businesses refused to hire her, with the local Walmart allegedly removing a chair she sat in after finding out she did work with HIV advocacy.  Appreciation and public speaking  In August 2016, she was honored at New York City's Pride Week by not-for-profit group Broadway Sings for Pride. Burks and others are working to create a memorial for victims of AIDS in Hot Springs, which would turn the Files Cemetery into a garden that fits its current status as a sort of pilgrimage site for those affected by the crisis. She has spoken at Washington State University and Gonzaga University on her experiences,. In 2017, Rose McGowan wrote and directed an unauthorized short film, Ruth, inspired by Burks' work.  Film and book projects  Burks is currently writing a memoir based on her life story. It is called \\"All the Young Men,\\" co-authored with Kevin Carr O'Leary; expected publication date is December 1, 2020, by Grove Press. Burks is also working with producers Christina Won and Jessica Sittig on a film project based on her life and book.

He served in both houses of the Vermont legislature and commanded the 14th Vermont Infantry during the American Civil War. After the war, he became a founder of the Illinois village of Maywood, now a suburb of Chicago. Biography William T. Nichols was born in Clarendon, Vermont, the son of James Tilson Nichols and Minerva D. (Briggs) Nichols. Trained as a lawyer, he served as an assistant clerk in Vermont’s House of Representatives and then as the state's attorney in 1858–59. In 1855, he traveled to Kansas Territory and became involved in the dispute over whether the territory would enter the United States as a slave-owning or free state. At one point, he volunteered for the risky task of delivering dispatches from the journalist William A. Phillips to Charles L. Robinson, a Free-Stater who was acting as territorial governor and who would later become the first governor of the state of Kansas. For this service, Nichols was appointed to Robinson's staff with the rank of colonel. He returned to Vermont the following year. Nichols served in two volunteer Vermont regiments during the Civil War. In 1861, he enlisted as a private in the short-lived 1st Vermont Infantry, remaining until the unit was mustered out of service three months later. In 1862, he was commissioned colonel to command the 14th Vermont Infantry. He led his regiment in repulsing Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg. Shortly after Gettysburg, the 14th Vermont Infantry was mustered out of service. Nichols's service in the state legislature overlapped the war years. In September 1861, just after the 1st Vermont Infantry was disbanded, he was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives. In 1863, after the disbanding of the 14th Vermont Infantry, he was elected to the Vermont Senate, becoming the youngest man (at age 34) ever to serve as a Vermont state senator. Colonel William Thomas Nichols' signature from the Franklin House Hotel Guest Register, Sept. 1854 - April 1855. From the private collection of H. Blair Howell. After the war, having lost money in various investments, Nichols determined to go south to invest in real estate. In October 1865, Nichols took passage on the SS Republic steamship, bound for New Orleans. It ran into a hurricane off the coast of Georgia and sank. Nichols—who afterwards wrote a detailed account of the sinking to his wife in a letter that has survived—managed to get into lifeboat number 2, which two days later was rescued by the sailing ship Horace Beals. Once arrived in the south, Nichols bought two cotton plantations and invested in a tannery. Nichols did not stay in the south, however, and eventually ended up in the area of Chicago, Illinois. On April 6, 1869, with six other men, he founded the Maywood Company, a consortium that led to the incorporation of the village of Maywood, Illinois, in 1881. Maywood, now a suburb of Chicago, was named in honor of Nichols's daughter May. Nichols served as the president of the company until his death. Nichols was also the president and treasurer of a subsidiary venture that manufactured farm tools, the Chicago Scraper and Ditcher Company. In 1878, he patented a new version of the screw harrow for soil cultivation. Nichols died of pneumonia in Maywood in 1882 and is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Rutland, Vermont. Personal life Nichols married Thyrza Stevens Crampton (b. 1832), and they had two daughters, May (b. 1857) and Lucy (b. 1860). Thyrza and May both died of typhoid fever in 1865. May died before Nichols left on his ill-fated voyage on the SS Republic, and Thyrza died shortly after she learned that Nichols had survived the shipwreck. Nichols remarried, with his second wife being Thyrza's sister Helen. Nichols's great-great-granddaughter is the writer Thyrza Nichols Goodeve. She accompanied a 2004 expedition to the site of the SS Republic wreck, which had been located the year before.

Emilio was a popular, conservative radio host in the Miami area. On his show, \\"El Pueblo Habla,\\" Emilio often spoke out against the violence in Miami during the anti-Castro movement. One day in April 1976, Emilio left the radio station where he hosted his show. When he turned the ignition of his car, a bomb that had been planted under the engine exploded. He lost both legs in the attack but did not lose his life. This attack had a great impact on young Alberto Milian. Though he says he is not \\"a teary-eyed, worshipful son,\\" Milian credits his father and those of his generation with waging a principled, non-violent battle against Fidel Castro. After Emilio's death in 2001, Milian began his own investigation into the attack, though no one was ever brought to trial for the crime. Milian said he became a lawyer partly because of his father's tragedy. Where Emilio used the airwaves to get his message out, Alberto uses the law and politics. = Reputation for professional aggressiveness = Milian was referred to as a \\"pitbull\\" in a piece by the St. Petersburg Times because of his courtroom outbursts and behavior. In 1999, after prosecuting a domestic violence case for the Broward County State Attorney's Office, Milian made controversial comments in public regarding not only the defense counsel in the case, but also the jurors. He called defense attorneys \\"maggots\\" and jurors \\"lobotomized zombies.\\" Milian later said that he made those comments because the victim in the case was \\"maligned\\" by the defense during the trial. Milian left the Broward County State Attorney's Office the following year (2000) and entered solo practice. On another occasion, Milian punched a defense attorney in the lobby of a courthouse. Milian says he was provoked by the other attorney and that he acted in self-defense. This altercation led to Milian being suspended from the practice of law for a short period of time.

Ary Scheffer, 1854. In religion, ethics, philosophy, and psychology \\"good and evil\\" is a very common dichotomy. In cultures with Manichaean and Abrahamic religious influence, evil is usually perceived as the dualistic antagonistic opposite of good, in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated.Paul O. Ingram, Frederick John Streng. Buddhist-Christian Dialogue: Mutual Renewal and Transformation. University of Hawaii Press, 1986. pp. 148–149. In cultures with Buddhist spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving Śūnyatā meaning emptiness in the sense of recognition of good and evil being two opposing principles but not a reality, emptying the duality of them, and achieving a oneness. A monism of goodness would guarantee prosperity since only good can exist, whereas a monism of evil would lead to our extinction. Evil, in a general context, is the absence or opposite of that which is described as being good. It is driven by fear and manifests through violence and division. The Judeo-Christian belief does not give a human form to Satan as they do God, to reinforce the belief that it shouldn’t manifest itself in humans. Those faithful to God in the Judeo-Christian belief reconcile with the existence of evil by acknowledging that God gave us free will, and since Satan exists, some will be tempted by the Snake with the apple from Adam & Eve. The snake represents a moral code driven by evil, where greatness and prosperity are guaranteed but not the motive, and their actions are a means to some other end that is self-interested. Often, evil is used to denote profound immorality. In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a supernatural force. Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives.Ervin Staub. Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 32. However, elements that are commonly associated with evil involve unbalanced behavior involving expediency, selfishness, ignorance, or neglect.Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews. Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus. Inner Traditions / Bear & Co, 2004. p. 173. The modern philosophical questions regarding good and evil are subsumed into three major areas of study: meta-ethics concerning the nature of good and evil, normative ethics concerning how we ought to behave, and applied ethics concerning particular moral issues.Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy \\"Ethics\\" One of the five paintings of Extermination of Evil portrays Sendan Kendatsuba, one of the eight guardians of Buddhist law, banishing evil. History and etymology Every language has a word expressing good in the sense of \\"having the right or desirable quality\\" (ἀρετή) and bad in the sense \\"undesirable\\". A sense of moral judgment and a distinction \\"right and wrong, good and bad\\" are cultural universals.Donald Brown (1991) Human Universals. Philadelphia, Temple University Press (online summary ). =Ancient world= In the eastern part of ancient Persia almost three thousand years ago a religious philosopher called Zoroaster simplified the pantheon of early Iranian gods. into two opposing forces: Ahura Mazda (Illuminating Wisdom) and Angra Mainyu (Destructive Spirit) which were in conflict. This idea developed into a religion which spawned many sects, some of which embraced an extreme dualistic belief that the material world should be shunned and the spiritual world should be embraced. Gnostic ideas influenced many ancient religions which teach that gnosis (variously interpreted as enlightenment, salvation, emancipation or 'oneness with God') may be reached by practising philanthropy to the point of personal poverty, sexual abstinence (as far as possible for hearers, total for initiates) and diligently searching for wisdom by helping others. Similarly, in ancient Egypt, there were the concepts of Ma'at, the principle of justice, order, and cohesion, and Isfet, the principle of chaos, disorder, and decay, with the former being the power and principles which society sought to embody where the latter was such that undermined society. This correspondence can also be seen reflected in ancient Mesopotamian religion as well in the conflict between Marduk and Tiamat. =Classical world= In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of κακός and ἀγαθός are \\"bad, cowardly\\" and \\"good, brave, capable\\", and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with pre-Socratic philosophy, in particular Democritus.Charles H. Kahn, Democritus and the Origins of Moral Psychology, The American Journal of Philology (1985) Morality in this absolute sense solidifies in the dialogues of Plato, together with the emergence of monotheistic thought (notably in Euthyphro, which ponders the concept of piety (τὸ ὅσιον) as a moral absolute). The idea is further developed in Late Antiquity by Neoplatonists, Gnostics, and Church Fathers. This development from the relative or habitual to the absolute is also evident in the terms ethics and morality both being derived from terms for \\"regional custom\\", Greek ήθος and Latin mores, respectively (see also siðr). =Medieval period= Medieval theology was largely shaped by St. Augustine of Hippo and St. Thomas Aquinas. According to the classical definition of St. Augustine of Hippo, sin is \\"a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God.\\" Many medieval Christian theologians both broadened and narrowed the basic concept of Good and evil until it came to have several, sometimes complex definitions such as: * a personal preference or subjective judgment regarding any issue which might be earn praise or punishment from the religious authorities * religious obligation arising from Divine law leading to sainthood or damnation * a generally accepted cultural standard of behaviour which might enhance group survival or wealth * natural law or behaviour which induces strong emotional reaction * statute law imposing a legal duty =Modern ideas= Today the basic dichotomy often breaks down along these lines: * Good is a broad concept often associated with life, charity, continuity, happiness, love, or justice. * Evil is often associated with conscious and deliberate wrongdoing, discrimination designed to harm others, humiliation of people designed to diminish their psychological needs and dignity, destructiveness, and acts of unnecessary or indiscriminate violence. The modern English word evil (Old English ) and its cognates such as the German and Dutch are widely considered to come from a Proto-Germanic reconstructed form of *ubilaz, comparable to the Hittite huwapp- ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European form and suffixed zero-grade form . Other later Germanic forms include Middle English , , , Old Frisian (adjective and noun), Old Saxon , Old High German , and Gothic . The nature of being good has been given many treatments; one is that the good is based on the natural love, bonding, and affection that begins at the earliest stages of personal development; another is that goodness is a product of knowing truth. Differing views also exist as to why evil might arise. Many religious and philosophical traditions claim that evil behavior is an aberration that results from the imperfect human condition (e.g. \\"The Fall of Man\\"). Sometimes, evil is attributed to the existence of free will and human agency. Some argue that evil itself is ultimately based in an ignorance of truth (i.e., human value, sanctity, divinity). A variety of Enlightenment thinkers have alleged the opposite, by suggesting that evil is learned as a consequence of tyrannical social structures. Theories of moral goodness =Chinese moral philosophy= In Confucianism and Taoism, there is no direct analogue to the way good and evil are opposed, although references to demonic influence is common in Chinese folk religion. Confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. Evil would thus correspond to wrong behavior. Still less does it map into Taoism, in spite of the centrality of dualism in that system, but the opposite of the basic virtues of Taoism (compassion, moderation, and humility) can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.Good and Evil in Chinese Philosophy C.W. ChanHistory of Chinese Philosophy Feng Youlan, Volume II The Period of Classical Learning (from the Second Century B.C. to the Twentieth Century A.D). Trans. Derk Bodde. Ch. XIV Liu Chiu-Yuan, Wang Shou-jen, and Ming Idealism. part 6 § 6 Origin of Evil. Uses strikingly similar language to that in the etymology section of this article, in the context of Chinese Idealism. =Western philosophy= Pyrrhonism Pyrrhonism holds that good and evil do not exist by nature, meaning that good and evil do not exist within the things themselves. All judgments of good and evil are relative to the one doing the judging. Spinoza Benedict de Spinoza states: Spinoza assumes a quasi-mathematical style and states these further propositions which he purports to prove or demonstrate from the above definitions in part IV of his Ethics : * Proposition 8 \\"Knowledge of good or evil is nothing but affect of joy or sorrow in so far as we are conscious of it.\\" * Proposition 30 \\"Nothing can be evil through that which it possesses in common with our nature, but in so far as a thing is evil to us it is contrary to us.\\" * Proposition 64 \\"The knowledge of evil is inadequate knowledge.\\" ** Corollary \\"Hence it follows that if the human mind had none but adequate ideas, it would form no notion of evil.\\" * Proposition 65 \\"According to the guidance of reason, of two things which are good, we shall follow the greater good, and of two evils, follow the less.\\" * Proposition 68 \\"If men were born free, they would form no conception of good and evil so long as they were free.\\" Nietzsche Friedrich Nietzsche, in a rejection of the Judeo-Christian morality, addresses this in two works, Beyond Good and Evil and On the Genealogy of Morals, where he essentially says that the natural functional non-good has been socially transformed into the religious concept of evil by the slave mentality of the weak and oppressed masses who resent their masters (the strong). He also makes a critique of morality by saying that many who consider themselves to be moral are simply acting from cowardice (wanting to do evil but scared of the repercussions). = Psychology = Carl Jung Carl Jung, in his book Answer to Job and elsewhere, depicted evil as the dark side of the Devil. People tend to believe evil is something external to them, because they project their shadow onto others. Jung interpreted the story of Jesus as an account of God facing his own shadow.Stephen Palmquist, Dreams of Wholeness : A course of introductory lectures on religion, psychology and personal growth (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1997/2008), see especially Chapter XI.  Philip Zimbardo  In 2007, Philip Zimbardo suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a collective identity. This hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the Stanford prison experiment, was published in the book The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil.Book website = Religion = Abrahamic religions =Bahá'í Faith= The Bahá'í Faith asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept for the lacking of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. All of these are states of lacking and have no real existence. Thus, evil does not exist, and is relative to man. \`Abdu'l-Bahá, son of the founder of the religion, in Some Answered Questions states: \\"Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind—that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves.\\" Thus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. Since God is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is Good (Genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality. =Christianity= Evil according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought or attitude that is contrary to the character or will of God. This is shown through the law given in both the Old and New Testament. Therefore, evil in a Christian world view is contrasted by and in conflict with God's character or God's will. This evil shows itself through deviation from the character or will of God. Similarly, good according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought or attitude that is consistent with the character or the will of God, for God is good, the ultimate goodness. Christian theology draws its concept of evil from the Old and New Testaments. The Christian Bible exercises “the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world.”David Ray Griffin, God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31. In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the fallen angels SatanHans Schwarz, Evil: A Historical and Theological Perspective (Lima, Ohio: Academic Renewal Press, 2001): 42–43. In the New Testament the Greek word poneros is used to indicate unsuitability, while kakos is used to refer to opposition to God in the human realm.Schwarz, Evil, 75. Officially, the Catholic Church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the Dominican theologian, Thomas Aquinas, who in Summa Theologica defines evil as the absence or privation of good.Thomas Aquinas, SUMMA THEOLOGICA, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1947) Volume 3, q. 72, a. 1, p. 902. French-American theologian Henri Blocher describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an \\"unjustifiable reality. In common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in experience that ought not to be.\\"Henri Blocher, Evil and the Cross (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1994): 10. In Mormonism, mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the Plan of Salvation. See Agency (LDS Church). Evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of God. It is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to God. Christian Science believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most evil person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby. =Islam= There is no concept of absolute evil in Islam, as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a dualistic sense. Within Islam, it is considered essential to believe that all comes from Allah, whether it is perceived as good or bad by individuals; and things that are perceived as evil or bad are either natural events (natural disasters or illnesses) or caused by humanity's free will to disobey Allah's orders. According to the Ahmadiyya understanding of Islam, evil does not have a positive existence in itself and is merely the lack of good, just as darkness is the result of lack of light. =Judaism= In Judaism, no individual can be defined as categorically, absolutely \\"good\\" or \\"evil.\\" Judaism recognizes human beings' psychological complexity. God gave the Children of Israel the Torah as a guide to overcome evil. A common theme of medieval Jewish philosophy is that people who do good deeds will be rewarded in olam haba.\\"Good & Evil.\\" Jewish Virtual Library. 2008. 19 October 2016. Judaism has two conflicting attitudes toward the existence of evil. In one interpretation, evil is not real, it is per se not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions. In the other interpretation, evil was created by God since God created everything and to suggest otherwise would be to engage in dualism, and is therefore antithetical to the core Jewish belief in monotheism. Indian religions =Buddhism= Extermination of Evil. Late Heian period (12th century Japan) The primal duality in Buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. One may infer however from the general teachings of the Buddha that the catalogued causes of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil'.Philosophy of Religion Charles Taliaferro, Paul J. Griffiths, eds. Ch. 35, Buddhism and Evil Martin Southwold p 424Lay Outreach and the Meaning of 'Evil Person' Taitetsu Unno Practically this can refer to 1) the three selfish emotions—desire, hate and delusion; and 2) to their expression in physical and verbal actions. Specifically, evil means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a Buddha (samyaksambodhi). =Hinduism= In Hinduism the concept of dharma or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect dharma, this war is called Dharmayuddha. This division of good and evil is of major importance in both the Hindu epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. However, the main emphasis in Hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. The Hindu holy text, the Bhagavad Gita, speaks of the balance of good and evil. When this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.Bhagavad Gita 4.07–08 =Sikhism= In adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the Sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. At the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. However, once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. In his writings Guru Arjan explains that, because God is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from God. And because God is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from God. Nevertheless, Sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of \\"vices\\" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. These are known as the Five Thieves, called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action. These are: * Moh, or Attachment * Lobh, or Greed * Karodh, or Wrath * Kaam, or Lust * Ahankar, or Egotism One who gives in to the temptations of the Five Thieves is known as \\"Manmukh\\", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue. Inversely, the \\"Gurmukh, who thrive in their reverence toward divine knowledge, rise above vice via the practice of the high virtues of Sikhism. These are: * Sewa, or selfless service to others. * Nam Simran, or meditation upon the divine name. Zoroastrianism In the originally Persian religion of Zoroastrianism, the world is a battle ground between the god Ahura Mazda (also called Ormazd) and the malignant spirit Angra Mainyu (also called Ahriman). The final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a day of Judgement, in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. In Afghan belief, angels and saints are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness. Descriptive, meta- ethical, and normative fields It is possible to treat the essential theories of value by the use of a philosophical and academic approach. In properly analyzing theories of value, everyday beliefs are not only carefully catalogued and described, but also rigorously analyzed and judged. There are at least two basic ways of presenting a theory of value, based on two different kinds of questions: * What do people find good, and what do they despise? * What really is good, and what really is bad? The two questions are subtly different. One may answer the first question by researching the world by use of social science, and examining the preferences that people assert. However, one may answer the second question by use of reasoning, introspection, prescription, and generalization. The former kind of method of analysis is called \\"descriptive\\", because it attempts to describe what people actually view as good or evil; while the latter is called \\"normative\\", because it tries to actively prohibit evils and cherish goods. These descriptive and normative approaches can be complementary. For example, tracking the decline of the popularity of slavery across cultures is the work of descriptive ethics, while advising that slavery be avoided is normative. Meta-ethics is the study of the fundamental questions concerning the nature and origins of the good and the evil, including inquiry into the nature of good and evil, as well as the meaning of evaluative language. In this respect, meta-ethics is not necessarily tied to investigations into how others see the good, or of asserting what is good. Theories of the intrinsically good A satisfying formulation of goodness is valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration, or prioritization. One could answer the ancient question, \\"How should we then live?\\" among many other important related questions. It has long been thought that this question can best be answered by examining what it is that necessarily makes a thing valuable, or in what the source of value consists. =Platonic idealism= One attempt to define goodness describes it as a property of the world with Platonic idealism. According to this claim, to talk about the good is to talk about something real that exists in the object itself, independent of the perception of it. Plato advocated this view, in his expression that there is such a thing as an eternal realm of forms or ideas, and that the greatest of the ideas and the essence of being was goodness, or The good. The good was defined by many ancient Greeks and other ancient philosophers as a perfect and eternal idea, or blueprint. The good is the right relation between all that exists, and this exists in the mind of the Divine, or some heavenly realm. The good is the harmony of a just political community, love, friendship, the ordered human soul of virtues, and the right relation to the Divine and to Nature. The characters in Plato's dialogues mention the many virtues of a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom. A theist is a person who believes that the Supreme Being exists or gods exist (monotheism or polytheism). A theist may, therefore, claim that the universe has a purpose and value according to the will of such creator(s) that lies partially beyond human understanding. For instance, Thomas Aquinas—a proponent of this view—believed he had proven the existence of God, and the right relations that humans ought to have to the divine first cause. Monotheists might also hope for infinite universal love. Such hope is often translated as \\"faith\\", and wisdom itself is largely defined within some religious doctrines as a knowledge and understanding of innate goodness. The concepts of innocence, spiritual purity, and salvation are likewise related to a concept of being in, or returning to, a state of goodness—one that, according to various teachings of \\"enlightenment\\", approaches a state of holiness (or Godliness). =Perfectionism= Aristotle believed that virtues consisted of realization of potentials unique to humanity, such as the use of reason. This type of view, called perfectionism, has been recently defended in modern form by Thomas Hurka. An entirely different form of perfectionism has arisen in response to rapid technological change. Some techno-optimists, especially transhumanists, avow a form of perfectionism in which the capacity to determine good and trade off fundamental values, is expressed not by humans but by software, genetic engineering of humans, artificial intelligence. Skeptics assert that rather than perfect goodness, it would be only the appearance of perfect goodness, reinforced by persuasion technology and probably brute force of violent technological escalation, which would cause people to accept such rulers or rules authored by them. =Welfarist theories= Welfarist theories of value say things that are good are such because of their positive effects on human well-being. Subjective theories of well-being It is difficult to figure out where an immaterial trait such as \\"goodness\\" could reside in the world. A counterproposal is to locate values inside people. Some philosophers go so far as to say that if some state of affairs does not tend to arouse a desirable subjective state in self-aware beings, then it cannot be good. Most philosophers that think goods have to create desirable mental states also say that goods are experiences of self- aware beings. These philosophers often distinguish the experience, which they call an intrinsic good, from the things that seem to cause the experience, which they call \\"inherent\\" goods. Some theories describe no higher collective value than that of maximizing pleasure for individual(s). Some even define goodness and intrinsic value as the experience of pleasure, and bad as the experience of pain. This view is called hedonism, a monistic theory of value. It has two main varieties: simple, and Epicurean. Simple hedonism is the view that physical pleasure is the ultimate good. However, the ancient philosopher Epicurus used the word 'pleasure' in a more general sense that encompassed a range of states from bliss to contentment to relief. Contrary to popular caricature, he valued pleasures of the mind to bodily pleasures, and advocated moderation as the surest path to happiness. Jeremy Bentham's book The Principles of Morals and Legislation prioritized goods by considering pleasure, pain and consequences. This theory had a wide effect on public affairs, up to and including the present day. A similar system was later named Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill. More broadly, utilitarian theories are examples of Consequentialism. All utilitarian theories are based upon the maxim of utility, which states that good is whatever provides the greatest happiness for the greatest number. It follows from this principle that what brings happiness to the greatest number of people, is good. A benefit of tracing good to pleasure and pain is that both are easily understandable, both in oneself and to an extent in others. For the hedonist, the explanation for helping behaviour may come in the form of empathy—the ability of a being to \\"feel\\" another's pain. People tend to value the lives of gorillas more than those of mosquitoes because the gorilla lives and feels, making it easier to empathize with them. This idea is carried forward in the ethical relationship view and has given rise to the animal rights movement and parts of the peace movement. The impact of sympathy on human behaviour is compatible with Enlightenment views, including David Hume's stances that the idea of a self with unique identity is illusory, and that morality ultimately comes down to sympathy and fellow feeling for others, or the exercise of approval underlying moral judgments. A view adopted by James Griffin attempts to find a subjective alternative to hedonism as an intrinsic value. He argues that the satisfaction of one's informed desires constitutes well-being, whether or not these desires actually bring the agent happiness. Moreover, these preferences must be life- relevant, that is, contribute to the success of a person's life overall. Desire satisfaction may occur without the agent's awareness of the satisfaction of the desire. For example, if a man wishes for his legal will to be enacted after his death, and it is, then his desire has been satisfied even though he will never experience or know of it. Meher Baba proposed that it is not the satisfaction of desires that motivates the agent but rather \\"a desire to be free from the limitation of all desires. Those experiences and actions which increase the fetters of desire are bad, and those experiences and actions which tend to emancipate the mind from limiting desires are good.\\"Baba, Meher. Discourses. 1. 1967. Sufism Reoriented. p. 93. . It is through good actions, then, that the agent becomes free from selfish desires and achieves a state of well-being: \\"The good is the main link between selfishness thriving and dying. Selfishness, which in the beginning is the father of evil tendencies, becomes through good deeds the hero of its own defeat. When the evil tendencies are completely replaced by good tendencies, selfishness is transformed into selflessness, i.e., individual selfishness loses itself in universal interest.\\"Baba, Meher. Discourses. 1. 1967. Sufism Reoriented. p. 31. . Objective theories of well-being The idea that the ultimate good exists and is not orderable but is globally measurable is reflected in various ways in economic (classical economics, green economics, welfare economics, gross national happiness) and scientific (positive psychology, the science of morality) well-being measuring theories, all of which focus on various ways of assessing progress towards that goal, a so- called genuine progress indicator. Modern economics thus reflects very ancient philosophy, but a calculation or quantitative or other process based on cardinality and statistics replaces the simple ordering of values. For example, in both economics and in folk wisdom, the value of something seems to rise so long as it is relatively scarce. However, if it becomes too scarce, it leads often to a conflict, and can reduce collective value. In the classical political economy of Adam Smith and David Ricardo, and in its critique by Karl Marx, human labour is seen as the ultimate source of all new economic value. This is an objective theory of value (see value theory), which attributes value to real production-costs, and ultimately expenditures of human labour- time (see also law of value). It contrasts with marginal utility theory, which argues that the value of labour depends on subjective preferences by consumers, which may however also be objectively studied. The economic value of labour may be assessed technically in terms of its use-value or utility or commercially in terms of its exchange-value, price or production cost (see also labour power. But its value may also be socially assessed in terms of its contribution to the wealth and well-being of a society. In non-market societies, labour may be valued primarily in terms of skill, time, and output, as well as moral or social criteria and legal obligations. In market societies, labour is valued economically primarily through the labour market. The price of labour may then be set by supply and demand, by strike action or legislation, or by legal or professional entry-requirements into occupations. Mid-range theories Conceptual metaphor theories argue against both subjective and objective conceptions of value and meaning, and focus on the relationships between body and other essential elements of human life. In effect, conceptual metaphor theories treat ethics as an ontology problem and the issue of how to work-out values as a negotiation of these metaphors, not the application of some abstraction or a strict standoff between parties who have no way to understand each other's views. Philosophical questions = Universality = Adolf Hitler is sometimes used as a modern definition of evil. Hitler's policies and orders resulted in the deaths of about 50 million people.Del Testa, David W; Lemoine, Florence; Strickland, John (2003). Government Leaders, Military Rulers, and Political Activists. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 83. . A fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. C. S. Lewis, in The Abolition of Man, maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as rape and murder. However, the numerous instances in which rape or murder is morally affected by social context call this into question. Up until the mid-19th century, many countries practiced forms of slavery. As is often the case, those transgressing moral boundaries stood to profit from that exercise. Arguably, slavery has always been the same and objectively evil, but individuals with a motivation to transgress will justify that action. The Nazis, during World War II, considered genocide to be acceptable,Gaymon Bennett, Ted Peters, Martinez J. Hewlett, Robert John Russell (2008). The evolution of evil. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht. p. 318. as did the Hutu Interahamwe in the Rwandan genocide. One might point out, though, that the actual perpetrators of those atrocities probably avoided calling their actions genocide, since the objective meaning of any act accurately described by that word is to wrongfully kill a selected group of people, which is an action that at least their victims will understand to be evil. Universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. Views on the nature of evil tend to fall into one of four opposed camps: * Moral absolutism holds that good and evil are fixed concepts established by a deity or deities, nature, morality, common sense, or some other source. * Amoralism claims that good and evil are meaningless, that there is no moral ingredient in nature. * Moral relativism holds that standards of good and evil are only products of local culture, custom, or prejudice. * Moral universalism is the attempt to find a compromise between the absolutist sense of morality, and the relativist view; universalism claims that morality is only flexible to a degree, and that what is truly good or evil can be determined by examining what is commonly considered to be evil amongst all humans. Plato wrote that there are relatively few ways to do good, but there are countless ways to do evil, which can therefore have a much greater impact on our lives, and the lives of other beings capable of suffering. =Usefulness as a term= Psychologist Albert Ellis, in his school of psychology called Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, says the root of anger and the desire to harm someone is almost always related to variations of implicit or explicit philosophical beliefs about other human beings. He further claims that without holding variants of those covert or overt belief and assumptions, the tendency to resort to violence in most cases is less likely. American psychiatrist M. Scott Peck on the other hand, describes evil as militant ignorance.Peck, M. Scott. (1983; 1988). People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil. Century Hutchinson. The original Judeo-Christian concept of sin is as a process that leads one to miss the mark and not achieve perfection. Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck describes evil as a malignant type of self- righteousness which results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children or other people in relatively powerless positions). Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in sociopaths. According to Peck, an evil person:Peck, M. Scott. (1978;1992), The Road Less Travelled. Arrow. * Is consistently self-deceiving, with the intent of avoiding guilt and maintaining a self-image of perfection * Deceives others as a consequence of their own self-deception * Psychologically projects his or her evils and sins onto very specific targets, scapegoating those targets while treating everyone else normally (\\"their insensitivity toward him was selective\\")Peck, 1983/1988, p105 * Commonly hates with the pretense of love, for the purposes of self-deception as much as the deception of others * Abuses political or emotional power (\\"the imposition of one's will upon others by overt or covert coercion\\")Peck, 1978/1992, p298 * Maintains a high level of respectability and lies incessantly in order to do so * Is consistent in his or her sins. Evil people are defined not so much by the magnitude of their sins, but by their consistency (of destructiveness) * Is unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim * Has a covert intolerance to criticism and other forms of narcissistic injury He also considers certain institutions may be evil, as his discussion of the My Lai Massacre and its attempted coverup illustrate. By this definition, acts of criminal and state terrorism would also be considered evil. =Necessary evil= Martin Luther believed that occasional minor evil could have a positive effect Martin Luther argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. He wrote, \\"Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for the Devil, so as not to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings... .\\"Martin Luther, Werke, XX, p58 The necessary evil approach to politics was put forth by Niccolò Machiavelli, a 16th-century Florentine writer who advised tyrants that \\"it is far safer to be feared than loved.\\"Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince, Dante University of America Press, 2003, Treachery, deceit, eliminating political rivals, and the usage of fear are offered as methods of stabilizing the prince's security and power.Strauss, Leo, Thoughts on Machiavelli The international relations theories of realism and neorealism, sometimes called realpolitik advise politicians to explicitly ban absolute moral and ethical considerations from international politics, and to focus on self-interest, political survival, and power politics, which they hold to be more accurate in explaining a world they view as explicitly amoral and dangerous. Political realists usually justify their perspectives by laying claim to a higher moral duty specific to political leaders, under which the greatest evil is seen to be the failure of the state to protect itself and its citizens. Machiavelli wrote: \\"...there will be traits considered good that, if followed, will lead to ruin, while other traits, considered vices which if practiced achieve security and well being for the Prince.\\" Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, was a materialist and claimed that evil is actually good. He was responding to the common practice of describing sexuality or disbelief as evil, and his claim was that when the word evil is used to describe the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women, or the skepticism of an inquiring mind, the things called evil are really good.Anton LaVey, The Satanic Bible, Avon, 1969, Goodness and agency =Goodwill= John Rawls' book A Theory of Justice prioritized social arrangements and goods based on their contribution to justice. Rawls defined justice as fairness, especially in distributing social goods, defined fairness in terms of procedures, and attempted to prove that just institutions and lives are good, if rational individuals' goods are considered fairly. Rawls's crucial invention was the original position, a procedure in which one tries to make objective moral decisions by refusing to let personal facts about oneself enter one's moral calculations. Immanuel Kant, a great influence for Rawls, similarly applies a lot of procedural practice within the practical application of The Categorical Imperative, however, this is indeed not based solely on 'fairness'. =Society, life and ecology= Many views value unity as a good: to go beyond eudaimonia by saying that an individual person's flourishing is valuable only as a means to the flourishing of society as a whole. In other words, a single person's life is, ultimately, not important or worthwhile in itself, but is good only as a means to the success of society as a whole. Some elements of Confucianism are an example of this, encouraging the view that people ought to conform as individuals to demands of a peaceful and ordered society. According to the naturalistic view, the flourishing of society is not, or not the only, intrinsically good thing. Defenses of this notion are often formulated by reference to biology, and observations that living things compete more with their own kind than with other kinds. Rather, what is of intrinsic good is the flourishing of all sentient life, extending to those animals that have some level of similar sentience, such as Great Ape personhood. Others go farther, declaring that life itself is of intrinsic value. By another approach, one achieves peace and agreement by focusing, not on one's peers (who may be rivals or competitors), but on the common environment. The reasoning: As living beings it is clearly and objectively good that we are surrounded by an ecosystem that supports life. Indeed, if we weren't, we could neither discuss that good nor even recognize it. The anthropic principle in cosmology recognizes this view. Under materialism or even embodiment values, or in any system that recognizes the validity of ecology as a scientific study of limits and potentials, an ecosystem is a fundamental good. To all who investigate, it seems that goodness, or value, exists within an ecosystem, Earth. Creatures within that ecosystem and wholly dependent on it, evaluate good relative to what else could be achieved there. In other words, good is situated in a particular place and one does not dismiss everything that is not available there (such as very low gravity or absolutely abundant sugar candy) as \\"not good enough\\", one works within its constraints. Transcending them and learning to be satisfied with them, is thus another sort of value, perhaps called satisfaction. Values and the people that hold them seem necessarily subordinate to the ecosystem. If this is so, then what kind of being could validly apply the word \\"good\\" to an ecosystem as a whole? Who would have the power to assess and judge an ecosystem as good or bad? By what criteria? And by what criteria would ecosystems be modified, especially larger ones such as the atmosphere (climate change) or oceans (extinction) or forests (deforestation)?For discussion, see debates on monoculture and permaculture. \\"Remaining on Earth\\" as the most basic value. While green ethicists have been most forthright about it, and have developed theories of Gaia philosophy, biophilia, bioregionalism that reflect it, the questions are now universally recognized as central in determining value, e.g. the economic \\"value of Earth\\" to humans as a whole, or the \\"value of life\\" that is neither whole-Earth nor human. Many have come to the conclusion that without assuming ecosystem continuation as a universal good, with attendant virtues like biodiversity and ecological wisdom it is impossible to justify such operational requirements as sustainability of human activity on Earth. One response is that humans are not necessarily confined to Earth, and could use it and move on. A counter-argument is that only a tiny fraction of humans could do this—and they would be self-selected by ability to do technological escalation on others (for instance, the ability to create large spacecraft to flee the planet in, and simultaneously fend off others who seek to prevent them). Another counter-argument is that extraterrestrial life would encounter the fleeing humans and destroy them as a locust species. A third is that if there are no other worlds fit to support life (and no extraterrestrials who compete with humans to occupy them) it is both futile to flee, and foolish to imagine that it would take less energy and skill to protect the Earth as a habitat than it would take to construct some new habitat. Accordingly, remaining on Earth, as a living being surrounded by a working ecosystem, is a fair statement of the most basic values and goodness to any being we are able to communicate with. A moral system without this axiom seems simply not actionable. However, most religious systems acknowledge an afterlife and improving this is seen as an even more basic good. In many other moral systems, also, remaining on Earth in a state that lacks honor or power over self is less desirable—consider seppuku in bushido, kamikazes or the role of suicide attacks in Jihadi rhetoric. In all these systems, remaining on Earth is perhaps no higher than a third-place value. Radical values environmentalism can be seen as either a very old or a very new view: that the only intrinsically good thing is a flourishing ecosystem; individuals and societies are merely instrumentally valuable, good only as means to having a flourishing ecosystem. The Gaia philosophy is the most detailed expression of this overall thought but it strongly influenced deep ecology and the modern Green Parties. It is often claimed that aboriginal peoples never lost this sort of view. Anthropological linguistics studies links between their languages and the ecosystems they lived in, which gave rise to their knowledge distinctions. Very often, environmental cognition and moral cognition were not distinguished in these languages. Offenses to nature were like those to other people, and Animism reinforced this by giving nature \\"personality\\" via myth. Anthropological theories of value explore these questions. Most people in the world reject older situated ethics and localized religious views. However small-community-based and ecology-centric views have gained some popularity in recent years. In part, this has been attributed to the desire for ethical certainties. Such a deeply rooted definition of goodness would be valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration or prioritisation. Ones that relied only on local referents one could verify for oneself, creating more certainty and therefore less investment in protection, hedging and insuring against consequences of loss of the value. =History and novelty= An event is often seen as being of value simply because of its novelty in fashion and art. By contrast, cultural history and other antiques are sometimes seen as of value in and of themselves due to their age. Philosopher-historians Will and Ariel Durant spoke as much with the quote, \\"As the sanity of the individual lies in the continuity of his memories, so the sanity of the group lies in the continuity of its traditions; in either case a break in the chain invites a neurotic reaction\\" (The Lessons of History, 72). Assessment of the value of old or historical artifacts takes into consideration, especially but not exclusively: the value placed on having a detailed knowledge of the past, the desire to have tangible ties to ancestral history, or the increased market value scarce items traditionally hold. Creativity and innovation and invention are sometimes upheld as fundamentally good especially in Western industrial society—all imply newness, and even opportunity to profit from novelty. Bertrand Russell was notably pessimistic about creativity and thought that knowledge expanding faster than wisdom necessarily was fatal. Goodness and morality in biology The issue of good and evil in the human visuality, often associated with morality, is regarded by some biologists (notably Edward O. Wilson, Jeremy Griffith, David Sloan Wilson and Frans de Waal) as an important question to be addressed by the field of biology.

He combined these skills to create new and different ways to conduct surveys, use and build aircraft, and teach those skills when aviation was in its infancy.  Early life  John William Miller, nicknamed 'Will', was born February 22, 1880, on a farm in Dawson, Illinois, third of four children. At age two the family moved, by covered wagon, near Adrian, Missouri and established a farm under a Civil War land grant. In 1888 when crops were destroyed by a hail storm, Miller, age 8, was allowed to work as a water boy on a Kansas City Southern Railway grading gang, peaking his interest in rail travel. The family moved again in 1891 to homestead in Friend, Nebraska. On the farm Miller learned the mechanics of farm machinery leading to a job at age 15 solving mechanical problems for McCormick Harvesting Machine Company. Miller, in 1895 at age 15, was following the efforts of aviation pioneers at the time through books and magazines available in the small town. One such person was Samuel Pierpont Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who was experimenting with the development of an aircraft which he called an aerodrome. It was a steam powered unmanned glider launched with a catapult. In 1903 he made two unsuccessful attempts at manned flight. Miller was aware of Langley’s efforts and wrote him to ask for instructions on building a glider. Langley responded with a full set of plans. He realized that Langley’s plans were too complicated and costly to build. He was also studying the book, “Progress in Flying Machines”, by Octave Chanute. Using only the pictures in this book he proceeded to build and fly two gliders, making more than 200 flights before he was 19 years old. Miller graduated from high school in 1900 and went on to the University of Nebraska Engineering College majoring in civil engineering, graduating in 1905. Career = Railroad surveyor = After graduation, Miller immediately went to work for Burlington railroad. Following the Civil War the railroads began a period of rapid expansion, especially westward. Burlington, controlled by Charles Elliott Perkins, is an acquisition target of both Great Northern, controlled by James Hill and Union Pacific Railroad, controlled by E. H. Harriman. Crucial to the expansion is finding a route suitable to a train at a reasonable cost to build, especially through the Rocky mountains. Miller lead a survey team to scout such a route west. The work of the survey teams was to identify and map a right of way along the route, then file a right of way claim. It was not unusual for the competing survey crews to spy on each other and claim the right of way surveyed ahead of the other team. Miller learned that a route his team was working on had been so claimed. = First powered flight = Miller decided he had to find a better way to conduct the right-of-way surveys. He had an old three wheeled biplane he had been using for glider experiments on which he rigged with a 20 hp engine. After a few trial flights, he was satisfied it would fly and he could control it. He strapped a camera to the framework and successfully make aerial photographs of the rail route. He claimed this to be the first powered flight west of the Mississippi and first use of powered fixed-wing aerial photography. =University of Washington= On September 1, 1909, Miller married Florence Lovetinsky in Rapid City South Dakota. His application to teach Civil Engineering at the University of Washington was accepted for the Fall of 1909, and he and Florence moved to Seattle. In 1913, 1915, 1917 his first three children were born: Mercedes, Vivian and Charles. A fourth daughter, Josephine, was born in 1923. About the same time William Boeing had a keen interest in aviation and started a company together with George Conrad Westervelt to produce his own airplanes. Their first design was the B&W; (Boeing & Westervelt). Boeing realized that for his airplane company to be successful, he would need a source of trained aeronautical engineers. He approached the University of Washington engineering department with an offer. He would build a wind tunnel for the university if they would start a school of aeronautical engineering. At this time Miller was instructing civil engineering and was involved in several civil engineering projects around Seattle, including building the ship canal connecting Lake Washington to Puget Sound through the Ship Canal and Ballard locks, and surveying the Camp Lewis cantonment site. When the wind tunnel project proposed by Boeing began, Miller was responsible for design and construction. For their participation in the program the University offered an airplane structures class, taught by Miller, for the spring of 1917. Miller's involvement in working with Boeing on the wind tunnel lead to Boeing offering him the position of chief engineer at the newly renamed Boeing Airplane Company. Consequently, the airplane structures class was canceled, until a new instructor could be found. Thus Frank McKone was hired for the 1917-1918 academic year, Frank taught the class for just one year by which time WW1 had ended, Boeing was out of work and so Miller left to return to the University to teach the aeronautics class. Miller would initially be an Assistant Professor with the expectation he would be promoted to Associate Professor. This promise was never fulfilled and Miller left in October 1919 after only two quarters, to accept a position as Chief Engineer for the American Aircraft Corporation. Next he became President and General Manager of Western Automotive Co., later changed the name to J.W. Miller Aircraft Corp which he moved to Green Lake. In 1929 the University began discussions with Harry Guggenheim and the Guggenhiem fund for the advancement of aeronautics. This led to a grant of $290,000 to build a new building to house the new school of aeronautics. Miller, who had been serving as secretary of the Guggenheim Fund Board of Trustees, had returned to the University. For the first time the aeronautics faculty consisted of more than one instructor. = Boeing = When Boeing Airplane Company was formed in 1917, the chief engineer position was filled by Boeing's partner, George Conrad Westervelt. He was replaced by James Foley, who was with the company two years, Foley was replaced by Wong Tsu, who left after a little over a year to return to China. A plaque at the museum of flight recognizes Wong Tsu as the first Boeing chief engineer (This article preceded the recognition of Wong Tsu as Boeing's first chief engineer.) On the departure of Tsu, Miller was offered the position of chief engineer by William Boeing, because \\"he came with more practical aviation experience than all his predecessors combined\\". He accepted and was instrumental in organizing the engineering, inspection and production departments. Under his supervision the plant built five Boeing Model C aircraft per week for a Navy rush order. At the end of the war, a memo was issued announcing that the position of Chief Engineer was abolished, this was later rescinded. In the first 30 months of business Boeing had had four chief engineers. Miller returned to the University of Washington. = Civic promoter of aviation = Realizing that airplanes would need airports, In a speech before the Transportation Club in 1918 Miller advocated a search for an appropriate site. Out of that meeting, the committee would purchase the Sand Point, Seattle site. Miller served as a member of the Mayor’s Air Board in charge of the work. = Private enterprise = Miller returned to the University in January 1919 but resigned in October that year to accept a position as chief engineer for the American Aircraft Corporation of Port Angeles (no information of this company has been found). The following year he became president and general manager of the Western Automotive Services Company at 2330 Third Ave., Seattle. The company’s name later was changed to the J. W. Miller Corporation and the operations were moved to the Green Lake area. During the five years from 1920 to 1925 Miller and his associates built or rebuilt fifty-two planes. In addition, they designed and built gliders, propellers, pontoons, and other aircraft parts and conducted a ground school for flying students. Another “first” in his career came during this period when, in 1920, he designed and built the first commercial enclosed cabin plane, equipped with brakes. \\"Flyers thought it was a crazy idea,\\" Miller said, \\"to put brakes on the wheels. You weren’t going to catch them nosing a plane over by slamming on the brakes. But the idea proved sound, as everyone knows today.\\" In the same year he also built a practical monoplane with folding wings and with power applied to the wheels so it could maneuver on the ground as an automobile. Miller drove it on roads for more than 100 miles at speeds from 5 to 25 miles an hour. = World War II = In 1942, Miller applied for and was offered a position with Vega Aircraft Corporation, a part of Lockheed, in Burbank California. This engagement lasted through the end of the war.

Premiering on February 23, 2020, Forensic Files II's first season consisted of 16 episodes and was broadcast on HLN, with voiceover narration by Bill Camp. The original Forensic Files broadcast over 400 episodes during its original run. On May 12, 2020, the series was renewed for a second and third season. The second season will premiere in 2021. Development and overview The last episode of the original Forensic Files series (\\"Expert Witness\\") originally aired on June 17, 2011. After the 2016 death of Forensic Files narrator Peter Thomas, the show's executive producer Paul Dowling ruled out the possibility of reviving the series, as he considered Thomas to be \\"irreplaceable\\". In October 2019, it was announced that the show would be revived with new episodes to air first-run on HLN in early 2020, with Bill Camp later announced as the new narrator. The revival was clarified as being the first season of a new show, rather than the 15th season of Forensic Files, explained by series producer Nancy Duffy as having been done to \\"differentiate the new episodes from those that came before\\". Duffy explained: \\"When we talked about bringing back Forensic Files, a lot of people thought we just meant that we were gonna be [airing] old shows that we didn't previously air on HLN and there seemed to be a confusion about that, so [we changed the title so] there could be no confusion.\\" Series creator Paul Dowling confirmed on Twitter that Forensic Files II was a new, separate show from the original Forensic Files. =Event reenactments= Unlike in the original Forensic Files program, actors were not hired to participate in reenactments of the cases dramatized in Forensic Files II. Instead, various employees of CNN and HLN were utilized to portray victims, suspects, and other individuals for dramatic recreations of real-life events. Series producer Nancy Duffy explained that the reenactments are filmed in a more \\"impressionistic\\" way than in the original series, so that the individuals used in the recreations \\"don't have to look identical\\" to the people they are portraying. As a result, faces are not shown in the recreations, only bodies from the neck down. Duffy elaborated that employees would approach her and ask to participate in the reenactments, saying that many were \\"excited\\" at the prospect of portraying individuals involved in killing, hiding, kidnapping, or the use of physical restraint. Episodes =Season 1 (2020)= The series premiere began with two back-to-back new episodes on February 23, beginning at 10:00 p.m. Eastern time. Two new episodes aired back-to-back each Sunday, with the final episode of the first season airing on April 12, Easter Sunday. {  style=\\"margin:auto;width:100%;\\" -  style=\\"background- color:#189FDD;\\"  No. in series  style=\\"background-color:#189FDD;\\"  No. in season  style=\\"background-color:#189FDD;\\"  Title  style=\\"background-color:#189FDD;\\"  Original air date } =Future seasons= In May 2020, the show was renewed for an additional two seasons of 16 episodes each, set to begin airing in 2021.

The renewed playground was built to engage a wider age range of children and to bring historical significance to the on-site Hastings Mill Museum which showcases Vancouver's logging history.300x300px  History  The historic site of Hasting Mills Museum, is what draws significance to the park. The land where the museum resides was originally owned by the Provincial Government. The building that hosts the museum was originally the Hastings Mill Store, the first general store erected in Vancouver in 1865 by British Captain Edward Stamp’s British Columbia and Vancouver Island Spar, Lumber and Sawmill Company. This building was one of the few buildings to survive the Great Fire of 1886 and was moved from the burrard inlet by barge to its current location at the foot of Alma Street by the Native Daughters of British Columbia. The museum was officially dedicated as a museum of B.C. historical relics in memory of the pioneers in 1932 and currently shows a wide range of First Nations artifacts as well as photographs from the Vancouver Pioneer Association. The Museum is open Tuesday-Sunday 1-4 pm and is closed during the months of December and January.  Construction  The Vancouver Park board collaborated with the architects at PWL Partnership in order to build a new playground which would be more child friendly and suitable for a wider range of ages. A public open house was conducted in the summer of 2015 in order to gain feedback from the community into the new design. The renovated playground opened in the fall of 2016 and now consists of two tall swings, two toddler swings, two standard swings, adventure log playground and a new playhouse with a sand area. The new playground is made entirely out of wood logs and timber to recall the history of the city's logging pioneer community.  Surrounding facilities  The Royal Vancouver Yacht Club, Jericho Tennis Club, Jericho Park and Beach are all located within walking distance from the park. Located at Jericho Park and Beach are public bathrooms, pay parking, a concession stand, and various sports fields such as a basketball court and soccer fields. A bike path connects to the Hastings Mill park. This path connects to most of Vancouver's bike paths and can take you towards Pacific Spirit Regional Park or into Downtown Vancouver and is comfortable for all ages and abilities.

It is the continuation of the Ophidian Universe, created by Ophidian Games in 2003. Ophidian 2360 is produced by Hack and Slash Games. It uses a play structure called Momentum rather than the normal turn-based system typically used in competitive card games.  Ophidian lore  Ophidian 2360 takes place in the year 2360, where a strange reptilian race known as Ophidians run gladitorial arenas for humans, aliens and demons alike. Combat consists of one Gladiator team pitted against others, for the entertainment of the masses. The true motives of the Ophidians is unknown, but many suspect a nefarious ulterior motive.  Gameplay  Each player's team is made up of up to four gladiators, made up of any VP (Victory Point) combination that adds up to exactly 10. A player can win either by defeating an opponent's Gladiators, by defeating Gladiators worth a greater number of victory points after four Waves (rounds) or by amassing 15 points worth of Cheer from the audience. Each side of the table is divided up into an Action Field, where powerful Gladiators can Attack and protect others from Attacks, and a Support Field, where less powerful Gladiators and supporting Minions usually reside. Between Waves, cards can move between the two Fields as needed. Some of the game mechanics are recognizable from previous games such as Magic: The Gathering - cards are \\"Set\\" when activated, being rotated ninety degrees to show that they have been used, which is identical to \\"tapping\\" in Magic. However, the turns of previous CCGs are not present in Ophidian, instead replaced by Momentum.

It was manufactured by Kinkisharyo and is used on all of Metro's light rail lines. The trains feature automatic train control, air conditioning, emergency intercoms, wheelchair spaces and emergency braking. History of the contract AnsaldoBreda delivered 50 P2550 LRVs to Metro between 2006 and 2011 for use on the newly expanded Gold Line. Delivery of the vehicles was approximately three years behind schedule, and Metro claimed they were overweight; thus, the agency chose not to exercise their option to purchase more beyond this initially contracted order. However, with multiple light rail lines under construction or in planning and the P865s approaching their end of life, Metro anticipated a substantial need for LRVs and thus requested bids for a new contract, for vehicles which were dubbed the P3010 series. The base P3010 contract order was for 78 cars: 63 cars for the Expo and Blue lines, and 15 cars for the Gold Line Foothill Extension. (Phase 1 of the Expo Line used P865 cars from the existing fleet.) Metro completed a contract on April 30, 2012, with delivery of the first LRV projected for 30 months later, in 2014. The contract included options for an additional 157 cars. Metro awarded the contract for the first 78 cars to Kinki Sharyo for $299 million. The remaining cars are split into four options with 28, 39, 21 and 69, respectively. If all the options are exercised, the number of LRVs would total 235, valued at a total $890 million. On July 25, 2013, Metro exercised two options (69 + 28) totaling 97 additional cars for $396.7 million. This brought the total of ordered cars to 175. As part of the option, Kinkisharyo, the El Segundo-based U.S. arm of Kinki Sharyo Co. Ltd. of Osaka, announced in December 2014 that they would retrofit an existing space in Palmdale to build the vehicles.Nelson, Laura J.

The cars began entering service in early 2016, though many were still in the testing stage when the Expo Line and Gold Line extensions opened that year, resulting in longer-than-expected headways and some crush loads. By October 2016, four LRVs were being delivered per month. In June 2017, P3010s began to be rolled out on the Blue Line, allowing Metro to begin phasing out the P865s. At the end of 2017, some of the P3010s from the Blue Line were routed for Green Line service using the Willowbrook spur and pocket track to transfer between the two lines.

He was also employed at various times as a sharecropper and as a deacon and was a civil rights activist. McMullan's first major recorded work was released in February 2017, over 30 years after his death, and was drawn from recordings he made in 1967 and 1968 in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi. Biography McMullan was born in either New Hope or Murphreesboro, Tallahatchie County, Mississippi. His musical talents were unearthed following a chance encounter in 1967 between McMullan and the American roots scholar, music collector and documentarian Gayle Dean Wardlow. Wardlow, striking up a conversation with him, discovered that McMullan had known Wardlow's idol, Charley Patton, and had played alongside him in the 1920s. This was at a time when McMullan had drifted from his Mississippi Delta homeland to perform the blues in juke joints across the Deep South. Wardlow also learned that McMullan had stopped playing the blues when he joined a church in the 1930s. Explaining why he had given up the opportunity to record with Patton, McMullan stated, \\"They only offered me $5 a song, and you know they could make thousands off just one song.\\" Wardlow's unlikely friendship with McMullan led him to visit McMullan's sharecropper shack in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, on a number of occasions in the late 1960s, and he recorded McMullan both on tape recorder and in writing. Wardlow wrote at the time that \\"Hayes was playing like no one I had ever heard.\\" McMullan died in May 1986, aged 84. Wardlow subsequently wrote, \\"The few old snapshots I took, the handful of tunes we recorded, and his brilliant performance of 'Hurry Sundown' captured on film are all that's left of the musical legacy of Hayes McMullan, sharecropper, deacon, and—unbeknownst to so many for so long—reluctant bluesman.\\" Wardlow also transcribed the songs and wrote the sleeve notes for the 2017 release of McMullan's album Everyday Seem Like Murder Here. Another song on the album, \\"Smoke Like Lightning\\", later became \\"Smokestack Lightnin'\\" as recorded by Howlin' Wolf.

In 2000, she was honored by the Council of Canadians with Disabilities and in 2014, she drove a successful initiative to gain support for the victims of thalidomide. Her efforts resulted in life-time compensation for Canadian \\"thalidomiders\\", as well as a special fund for specific medical treatments or modifications to homes and vehicles to accommodate their disabilities. Early life Mercédes Benegbi was born in 1962 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to her Québécoise mother, Colette, and Moroccan father Marcos Benegbi. Her mother had been prescribed the drug thalidomide during her pregnancy, resulting in Benegbi being born with phocomelia. Her parents strongly advocated for her acceptance among other children and enrolled her in École Ernest Crepeau. She was also enrolled in the Montreal Rehabilitation Institute’s 20-year plan to assist victims and their families in meeting the everyday challenges their children would face. Her father invented a visor for Benegbi to use as a child to prevent her harming her face when she fell, as she had no arms to break her fall. As she was their only child, Benegbi's parents were supportive and at the same time, challenged her to excel and be as independent as she was able to be. Career Benegbi has worked as a disability advocate for over twenty years, serving on the board of the Confederation of Organizations of Persons with Disabilities of Quebec (), for which she was honored in 2000 by the Council of Canadians with Disabilities. Since 2002, she has been the executive director of the Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada and has become one of the leading advocates for Canadian thalidomide victims. In 2014, Benegbi led a successful initiative to gain compensation from the Canadian government for the children whose lives were impacted by the approval of thalidomide for use in the country, after years of the government refusing to take responsibility for their failure to protect the victims. On-going health issues and lack of ability to work, caused by their permanent disabilities drove Benegbi to press for a compensation package similar to those victims of the drug in Europe had received. In 2015, the compensation plan was announced, which provides a tax- free, life-time pension for the \\"thalidomiters\\". It also provided a one-time lump sum payment as well as a special medical fund to enable victims to obtain surgeries specific to their conditions or adapting a home or vehicle for special needs. Benegbi has spoken throughout the world on the devastating effects to fetal development caused by thalidomide. In 2016, she was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Windsor.

The free factor complex was originally introduced in a 1998 paper of Hatcher and Vogtmann. Like the curve complex, the free factor complex is known to be Gromov-hyperbolic. The free factor complex plays a significant role in the study of large-scale geometry of operatorname{Out}(F_n). Formal definition For a free group G a proper free factor of G is a subgroup Ale G such that A e {1}, A e G and that there exists a subgroup Ble G such that G=Aast B. Let nge 3 be an integer and let F_n be the free group of rank n. The free factor complex mathcal F_n for F_n is a simplicial complex where: (1) The 0-cells are the conjugacy classes in F_n of proper free factors of F_n, that is :mathcal F_n^{(0)}={[A]  Ale F_n text{ is a proper free factor of } F_n }. (2) For kge 1, a k-simplex in mathcal F_n is a collection of k+1 distinct 0-cells {v_0, v_1, dots, v_k}subset mathcal F_n^{(0)} such that there exist free factors A_0,A_1,dots, A_k of F_n such that v_i=A_i for i=0,1,dots, k, and that A_0le A_1le dots le A_k. [The assumption that these 0-cells are distinct implies that A_i e A_{i+1} for i=0,1,dots, k-1]. In particular, a 1-cell is a collection {[A], [B]} of two distinct 0-cells where A,Ble F_n are proper free factors of F_n such that Alneq B. For n=2 the above definition produces a complex with no k-cells of dimension kge 1. Therefore, mathcal F_2 is defined slightly differently. One still defines mathcal F_2^{(0)} to be the set of conjugacy classes of proper free factors of F_2; (such free factors are necessarily infinite cyclic). Two distinct 0-simplices {v_0,v_1}subset mathcal F_2^{(0)} determine a 1-simplex in mathcal F_2 if and only if there exists a free basis a,b of F_2 such that v_0=[langle arangle], v_1=[langle brangle]. The complex mathcal F_2 has no k-cells of dimension kge 2. For nge 2 the 1-skeleton mathcal F_n^{(1)} is called the free factor graph for F_n. Main properties * For every integer nge 3 the complex mathcal F_n is connected, locally infinite, and has dimension n-2. The complex mathcal F_2 is connected, locally infinite, and has dimension 1. * For n=2, the graph mathcal F_2 is isomorphic to the Farey graph. * There is a natural action of operatorname{Out}(F_n) on mathcal F_n by simplicial automorphisms. For a k-simplex Delta={[A_0],dots, [A_k]} and varphiin operatorname{Out}(F_n) one has varphi Delta:={[varphi(A_0)],dots, [varphi(A_k)]}. *For nge 3 the complex mathcal F_n has the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres of dimension n-2.Allen Hatcher, and Karen Vogtmann, The complex of free factors of a free group.

It was released on May 5, 2017, by The Orchard.  Plot  Entrepreneur Ray Moody runs a business in which clients pay him for the experience of a simulated kidnapping. An interview for a loan goes poorly when Ray attempts to explain his business model to an incredulous banker. Although Ray has a strained relationship with his sister Natalie, he turns to her husband Tom for the money. Stuart, an overeater, has contracted Ray to stage an aggressive intervention over eight hours. Ray tells Stuart he cheats on his diet, and then forces Stuart to consume a dozen of his favourite hamburgers. After the eight-hour session ends, Stuart thanks Ray and asserts that he has lost his appetite for hamburgers. Ray is elated when a new client, Anna, contacts him, seeking an extended session that will last the entire weekend. His joy turns to scepticism when Anna requests that he hit her. Although he initially refuses the job, Ray calls her back and accepts. After conducting their business over the phone, Ray performs surveillance on her, and she leaves him a message telling him to be more discreet. Ray simulates a carjacking and takes her hostage that weekend, never breaking character. Impressed with her own ability to stay in character, Ray is forced to take a break to reassure himself that he has the confidence and skill to pull off the scenario. Ray aggressively interrogates Anna about a made-up client, demanding access to non-existent files. Although initially scared and obedient, Anna soon adopts a more mocking tone with him, accusing him of being a pervert who has abducted her under flimsy premises. Enraged, he almost strikes her, and she again mocks him for his reluctance. After hitting her, Ray leaves to pay Tom back. Natalie discovers the envelope filled with money and surmises its purpose, angry that her husband would finance Ray's bizarre business. Natalie confronts Ray and realizes that he is using their parents' house for his scenarios; Ray becomes frustrated when she interrupts his session. After she leaves, Ray hears on the news the police are investigating Anna's disappearance. Rattled, Ray attempts to talk to Anna, who stabs him in the back with an improvised weapon. The police show up at Ray's house. Panicking, he binds Anna in the basement as he deflects the police officers' questions. After bandaging himself, he attempts to clear up the situation with Anna, who claims to have no knowledge of his business. Ray shows her the contract she digitally signed and plays back her earlier phone message, both of which she dismisses as fabrications. Confused and fearing he has kidnapped an unwilling person, Ray agrees to let her go. However, at the last moment, he swallows her car keys, saying that he can not let her go until they figure out an alibi that allows him – and Natalie – to escape jail time. After Anna shoots him several times with his pellet gun, Ray attempts to regurgitate the keys, only for Anna to slip and fall unconscious. When Anna wakes, Ray has taken her to a vacation home. There, they discuss their pasts, both revealing that they are divorced. Ray says his ex-wife, who co-founded the business, accused him of criminal wrongdoing. She agrees not to go to the police, but asks him to explain more details about what she accused him of doing. Anna suggests he gets off on violence and power, and he chokes her in response. She knocks him unconscious with a fire poker. Armed with Tom's rifle, Anna takes Ray hostage, threatening to shoot him unless he submits to riding in her car's trunk, a punishment he had subjected her to several times. At the end of the ride back to the city, Anna happily thanks him for the experience and offers to invest in his business, revealing to the audience and Ray that she was indeed a willing participant the whole time. Stunned, Ray can only mumble a response before he stumbles back home to see Stuart in a restaurant. As Stuart waves at him, Ray cries, then laughs when he sees Stuart is eating a salad.

History The castle was probably built in between 1250 and 1300, though the earliest reference to it is from 1337. At that time the castle was known as nüwer Sünnes. It was probably built by the powerful Vaz family to expand the territory controlled by nearby Alt-Süns Castle. Traditionally it was believed that the alternative name Canova was the original name and referred to a local noble family. However the first mention of the turri de Canofa (Canova is Romansh for new house) appears in 1390. When the Vaz family died out in 1338, their estates in the area were inherited by the Counts of Werdenberg-Sargans. In 1392 Anna von Rhäzüns received the castle from her husband Count Johann von Werdenberg-Sargans. In 1437 the two castles were specifically mentioned in a treaty between Heinrich von Werdenberg- Sargans and the Cantons of Schwyz and Glarus. The southern wall of the tower was intentionally collapsed by the victorious attackers in 1451 during a war between the residents of the Schams valley against Werdenberg-Sargans. As part of the peace treaty, the Counts could rebuild the castle if the League of God's House gave their approval. As they were never able to secure permission, the castle was allowed to fall into ruin. During the 16th century, the ruins were mentioned as a landmark as was the nearby farm. In 1574 Andreas von Salis zu Reitberg inherited the farm and the ruined castle. Today the property is owned by the Planta family. Castle site The castle had an uncommon round donjon that was five stories tall. The southern side of the tower was destroyed during the 1451 war, but the northern side remains intact and still reaches its original height. The tower walls are up to thick. Fireplaces, two garderobes and sitting places by the windows show that the third and fourth stories were permanently inhabited. The top of the tower was crowned with crenellations and a sloping wooden roof that was protected by the stone battlements. The tower was surrounded by a stone ring wall that was about larger than the tower. The rectangular outer bailey was to the south-west of the round tower. It was defended by steep slopes and a ditch. Very little of the ring wall or outer bailey still remain.

It was originally described in 1840 by the English zoologist and philatelist John Edward Gray. Description Aquilonastra burtoni is a small species of sea star with up to 8 rays, frequently 7, they frequently demonstrate an asymmetrical form after fissiparous division while the form of larger specimens is often symmetrical with 5 equal rays; there is an inconspicuous madreporite in most interradii. The rays narrow basally, tapering to a narrow rounded distal part which is finger-like. Each of the plates on the oral surface has a grouping of 3 crowded mobile tapering spines in their centres, while those of the dorsal surface have a dense group of short tubercles. It is a greenish gray colour on the dorsal sid with a large, irregular, purplish brown blotch in the centre which is surrounded by red spots at the bases of the arms. The arms are normally a darker greenish near their distal portions where there is also a pale median line. Distribution The native range of Aquilonastra burtoni is the north western Indian Ocean including the Gulf of Suez, Gulf of Aqaba, the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Sea of Oman and the coasts of eastern Africa south to Zanzibar. It has been reported from a wider range east to Hawaii and south to Madagascar but these records appear to refer to other similar Aquilonastra species. It was first recorded within the Suez Canal in 1926 and then in the eastern Mediterranean in 1966, and by 2010 it had been recorded from Cyprus. Biology Aquilonastra burtoni is a benthic species which occurs in shallow waters between 0 and 10m in depth where is common in the lower the lower shore below the low tide line under rock slabs and boulders. It is uncommon in the gravel tails and gravelly hydraulic banks, its preferred food is seems to be the rich shade-loving animals that live underneath blacks and slabs, including sponges such as Spirastrella spp and Timea spp. or Ascidiacea, for example Trididemnum or Eudistoma. In sexual reproduction the eggs and sperm are broadcast and the larvae are planktonic lecithotrophs, i.e. they rely on a yolk for their initial nutrition. In the fissiparous population off the Mediterranean coast of Israel histological examination showed spermatogenesis in all the mature individuals and the peak of sperm production was coincident with the peak of fissiparous reproduction. This has been taken to indicate that the origin of the Mediterranean colonisers was from a fissiparous population in the Red Sea. Taxonomy Aquilonastra burtoni was originally named Asterina burtoni by John Edward Gray from specimens collected by a Mr John Burton in the Red Sea. A second species was named Asterina wega and this name was used to describe a separate multi armed form which reproduced by fissipary while A. burtoni was used for the five armed sexually reproducing form. Further studies have suggested that this is a complex of species with the three fissiparous Mediterranean populations named as Aquilonastra yairi sp. nov. and the specimens taken in the Gulf of Aqaba as A. burtonii sensu stricto while the non-fissiparous specimens from Eilat were described as Aquilonastra marshae sp. nov., with the caveat tha populations elsewhere still have to be properly studied to determine their status.

He took various odd jobs but his father specifically forbid him from becoming a musician. Nevertheless, Al was drawn toward music and taught himself the piano in secret. Eventually he became good enough to join the Musicians' Union. Samuel learned of his son's vocation when one day the Union sent teenaged Sherman to play piano in Sherman's orchestra. Al would continue in the music business, against Samuel's direct orders eventually becoming a successful Tin Pan Alley songwriter from the 1920s-1950s.

It is designed to be a practical approach that addresses the tactical issues that prevent finance departments from being more strategic. Continuous accounting embraces three main principles:http://blog.ventanaresearch.com/2015/10/30/continuous-accounting- enables-a-strategic-finance-department *The first is the need to automate mechanical, repetitive accounting processes in a continuous, end-to-end fashion. Managing processes in a controlled, end-to-end fashion improves efficiency and it ensures data integrity. Ensuring data integrity is crucial because the absence of data integrity is the root cause of a lot of time- consuming work that departments perform that adds little value to the rest of the company. *The second is optimizing the accounting calendar by distributing workloads continuously and evenly over the accounting period (the month, quarter or year) to eliminate bottlenecks and optimize when and in which order accounting tasks are performed. *The third is establishing a culture of continuous improvement in managing the accounting cycle. A continuous improvement culture sets increasingly rigorous objectives, reviews performance to those objectives frequently and makes addressing performance shortcomings a departmental priority. Continuous accounting requires the effective use of information (data) and technology (software) to automate accounting and finance processes in an end-to-end fashion. This does not mean that every step is entirely hands-off, but processes are designed to automate the execution of as many steps as is practical. It also involves automating all the hand-offs that take place between people in performing the process as well as any managing all administrative and approval steps that must take place. End-to- end automation has two objectives. One is to cut down on the time employees spend doing work that computers can do faster and more consistently. The second is to improve the quality of the data in a company's financial records to ensure greater accuracy, consistency and control of financial data. In this respect, continuous accounting supports the COSO Framework. Automation improves data quality because eliminating human intervention in the handling of data substantially reduces the potential for errors in a well-controlled IT environment. Consequently, by design, end-to-end financial process automation strengthens financial controls and facilitates auditing. Spreadsheets and manual calculations create the need for time-consuming reconciliations and checks to spot errors and identify their source. An important design objective for end-to-end automation is to ensure that there is a single authoritative source for the data that is used in accounting processes. Technology exists to ensures that even with multiple accounting and financial management systems and data stores, there is no duplication of data that requires checks and reconciliations. To second component of continuous accounting focuses on optimizing workloads. Increasingly, financial software gives companies greater flexibility. The classic accounting calendar with its monthly, quarterly and annual cycles developed over centuries as a practical approach to dealing with the limitations of the paper based systems and manual calculations. Their frequency represents a trade-off aimed at balancing efficiency and control: waiting until there are enough entries to justify performing the work, but not waiting too long to identify fraud, procedural issues and accounting errors. The monthly accounting close developed for many accounting tasks because a weekly cadence proved to be too short a period to be efficient while quarterly was too long to wait. Other accounting processes are typically handled on a quarterly or semi-annual basis because this longer frequency reflects a more appropriate trade-off of efficiency and control. Even when computers were first used to automate bookkeeping and accounting, the old accounting calendars persisted. The limitations of early business computing technology forced system designers to use batch processing. From an accounting process standpoint, batch systems do not offer much of an improvement over paper-based ones in changing the timing of finance and accounting processes. They impose the same need to balance efficiency and control in taking computing systems off-line to handle computations and summarizations in a way that does not interfere with transactions processing. Only within the past decade has information technology reached a performance threshold that eliminates the need for such batch processing. Corporations that use batch-less accounting systems have greater freedom to schedule their accounting cycle. The third principle of continuous accounting is continuous (or continual) improvement. Decades ago, continuous improvement revolutionized manufacturing worldwide and culture of manufacturing departments. Continuous improvement can be used as a management approach to overcome organizational inertia. This is particularly difficult in accounting departments because accounting is a discipline that requires consistency, which is necessary for the faithful presentation of a company's financial performance and health. But performing accounting processes the same way may not be the best way. Continuous improvement requires ongoing assessments to identify issues and how to address them, as well as a mindset that accepts that these sorts of changes will be made.

Structure = Markers = Islet resident macrophages are uniquely found within the endocrine tissue (islet), while nearby in the nearby acinar tissue, macrophages express a different repertoire of CD (cluster of differentiation) markers and come from a different developmental origin. In terms of expression markers, islet macrophages are positive for; F4/80, CD11b, CD11c, MHC-II, CD64, CD68, LyzM (lysozyme), Cx3cr1 and are negative for; CD206 (mannose receptor), CD301, CD103. =Development= The mesoderm gives rise to myeloid progenitor cells, which further differentiate into macrophage populations. As opposed to macrophages in the islet stroma (tissue), whose developmental origin is from the yolk sac (primitive hematopoiesis), islet resident progenitors come from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the definitive hematopoiesis. These cells are seen in fetal liver during mid-gestation E10-E11, and are thought to colonize the bone marrow during late gestation E15. As a unique population in terms of developmental origin, these resident macrophages have a unique phenotype in which they are long lived, self-renew locally, and stay confined within the islet parenchyma.  Function  Islet resident macrophages depend on the expression of colony stimulating factor (CSF1). Knockout mice for the CSF-1 gene cause islets to be devoid of resident macrophages. These mice show a reduced beta cell mass as well as developmental defects. This as well as other observations, showing that islet resident macrophages promote beta cell proliferation suggest that islet macrophages are likely important contributors to the function of the pancreatic islet. In contrast to the possible supportive role within the islet, these specialized macrophages are also required for the initiation of the adaptive immune response during type 1 diabetes (T1D) in mice. They do this by presenting beta cell derived peptides using MHC II receptors to T-cells in the islet. Once activated, T-cells stimulate the adaptive immune system, which leads to the destruction of pancreatic islets due to an autoimmune response.  History  The islet resident macrophage was first identified in 1979 as an antigen-presenting cell (APC), which expresses major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). Later in 1984 this APC was further classified by using a macrophage specific marker F4/80. In 1988 it was discovered that macrophages play an essential role in the progression of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (T1D), in an animal model for non-obese diabetes (NOD mice). The role of pancreatic macrophages were later shown to play an important role in type 2 diabetes as well, by contributing to islet inflammation. The origin and turnover in the normal state was characterized by Emil Unanue in 2015.

She was the first woman admitted to practise as a professional lawyer in the UK when, in 1920, she qualified as a solicitor in Scotland.  Life  Anderson was born on 24 April 1896 in Glasgow to Anne Catherine Chisholm (1864–1947), daughter of an Inverness bookseller, and Robert Easton Anderson (1865-1932), a surgical instrument maker. From 1904 to 1913 she attended Hutcheson's Grammar School, going on to study at the University of Glasgow. She graduated with an MA in 1916, a BL in 1919 and an LLB in 1920. She was the first woman to graduate from the University with a degree in law. She was not however the first female law graduate in Scotland: Eveline MacLaren and Josephine Gordon Stuart graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Edinburgh some years earlier, but at that time women were prohibited from practising as lawyers. On 12 May 1917 she began working as an apprentice law agent at the practice of Maclay Murray & Spens. In 1920, Anderson was the first woman to be admitted to the legal profession in the United Kingdom following the passing of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, when she was admitted as a law agent in Scotland (the Scottish Law Agents Society was formed in 1884; the Law Society of Scotland was not created until 1949). Her application for admission as a law agent was initially refused, because the necessary three years of training began before the passing of the Act, and her indenture of training was not properly registered — registration was refused in 1917 because she was a woman. She appealed to the Court of Session, and her petition was reported to the Inner House, First Division, and heard in December 1920, by the Lord President, Lord Mackenzie, Lord Skerrington and Lord Cullen. The opinion of the Lord Ordinary Lord Ashmore criticised the English terminology used in the Act, but concluded that she was entitled to have her petition granted, and the court upheld her appeal.[1921] SLT 48 In 1922 Anderson was working at the Glasgow law firm John Steuart and Gillies, where she stayed for five years before establishing her own practice in Giffnock in Glasgow. She was articled in London, with legal partners Edith Annie Berthen and Beatrice Honour Davy. They had established the first legal firm run by women in 1931. In 1937 she became the first woman qualified to practice as a solicitor in both England and Scotland, after passing the English Law Society final exam. She then joined Berthen and Davy as a partner in the expanded law firm. In 1949 she purchased a house near Dunkeld in Perthshire which she ran as a private hotel for some years, before moving first to a cottage near Crieff and then to Bankfoot. However, the details of her later life remain obscure. Anderson died at the Royal Infirmary, Perth, on 9 August 1982. She is honoured with a blue plaque at the Stair Building, University of Glasgow’s School of Law.

Service history Illustration of Lüft-ü Celil exploding, after having been hit by Russian artillery fire Lüft-ü Celil, meaning \\"Divine Grace\\", was ordered from the Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde shipyard in Bordeaux in 1867 and was laid down the following year. The ship had originally been ordered by the Khedivate of Egypt, an autonomous tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, but Egyptian efforts to assert their independence angered Sultan Abdülaziz, who, on 5 June 1867, demanded Egypt surrender all of the ironclads ordered from foreign shipyards. After lengthy negotiations, the vessel was formally transferred to the Ottoman Empire on 29 August 1868. She was launched in 1869 and completed for sea trials in 1870. The ship was commissioned into the Ottoman fleet in March that year. Upon completion, Lüft-ü Celil and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in the aftermath of the Cretan Revolt of 1866-1869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals. Lüft-ü Celil was assigned to the II Squadron of the Asiatic Fleet, along with her sister ship and the ironclads and . Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. In 1875, the ship received a single gun manufactured by Krupp. The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 to begin to prepare for a conflict with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. The Russo-Turkish War began on 24 April 1877 with a Russian declaration of war. At the start of the war, Lüft-ü Celil and Hifz-ur Rahman were assigned to the Danube Squadron, where they were tasked with preventing Russian forces from crossing the river. On 11 May, while cruising in the Danube off Izmail, the ship was attacked by Russian artillery consisting of mortars and 25-pounder rifled guns. One of the shells struck the vessel, probably in the boiler room, where it caused a large explosion that destroyed the ship. The river monitor picked up twenty men, but most of her crew, some 160 officers and men, were killed in the explosion.

It follows a writer's attempt to describe a metamorphosis he went through two decades earlier, when he stopped being confrontative and instead became a passive observer. The task proves to be difficult and most of the book is instead concerned with the lives of the narrator, his family and the people in the Paris suburb where he lives. The book is 1066 pages long in its original German. It was published in English in 1998, translated by Krishna Winston. Reception Volker Hage of Der Spiegel compared the book to works by Botho Strauß, as both Strauß and Handke use literature to reflect on the activity of writing. Hage wrote that My Year in the No-Man's-Bay may be described as \\"postmodern literati-literature\\", something critics have anticipated with horror, but continued: \\"What does such a label matter, when the prose is as intense as relaxed, as surprising as obvious, as beautiful as original\\". When the English translation was published in 1998, Publishers Weekly's critic wrote: \\"Despite attaining moments of stylistic lucidity worthy of Montaigne, the narrator more often comes across as gloomy and hostile. Nonetheless, numerous trenchant moments of insight make this work intriguing and provocative.\\" Lee Siegel reviewed the book for The New York Times. He described it as \\"one carefully observed image after another expanding into a cinematically eternal present tense\\", which according to Siegel means that \\"in a sense, then, Handke's novel is an argument for the superiority of film to the novel\\". The critic continued: \\"Though at times intellectually bracing, this can make for pretty arid reading. And Handke's attempts at elevating his epic of self-regarding banality often make matters worse. Rejecting character, plot and psychology as mere fictions, he relies on an ostentatious thematic framework that winds up being more implausible than any old-fashioned novelistic trick.\\" Publishers Weekly called the English translation \\"impeccable\\", while Siegel called it \\"clumsy and overliteral\\".

Formation Formed in 2006 in Co Tyrone Northern Ireland by Phil Conalane and Kie McMurray. Conalane, Andrew Mackle and McMurray were musicians, playing in various cover bands in Northern Ireland before deciding to collaborate on writing of original material drawing from their shared musical interests. The results were soon recorded and formed the basis of Million Dollar Reload's first EP, 'Needle, Blackout, Fly'. Drummer Davy Cassa was then recruited for purposes of the recording sessions before eventually being invited to join as a full-time member of Million Dollar Reload. Brian Mallon was recruited by McMurray as a second guitarist for live performances of the band's new, original material; he would become a full-time member. Before starting the recording of their debut album, Million Dollar Reload were recruited (minus drummer Cassa) by Steven Adler of Guns N' Roses as his backing band in his post Guns N' Roses career playing under Adler's Appetite. The band performed with Adler in Ireland after he had fired his own band during the European leg of their 2006 tour. This proved to be the catalyst for Million Dollar Reload to enter the studio speedily and begin the recording process for their debut album. Anthems Of A Degeneration Anthems of a Degeneration was recorded at Manor Park Studios in Northern Ireland, and produced by Neal Calderwood. Anthems of a Degeneration was initially a self- released record, only available in physical format, online via the Million Dollar Reload website. After two years of continued sales, the record was picked up by Powerage Records in the UK and re-released in 2010. This point proved to be a major turning point for the band who were quickly offered a release in Japan on Hydrant/Universal Records. In the summer of 2011 drummer Cassa was fired after five years playing in the band. Cassa was replaced by Sean McKernan. Several high-profile support slots followed, most notably for Alice Cooper and later for The Darkness in the Ulster Hall, Belfast. The promotion of Anthems of a Degeneration continued with a UK club tour, followed by a 10 date US tour. On returning to the UK, Million Dollar Reload spent the summer of 2012 playing a number of festivals, most notably Download Festival and Bloodstock. At this point, Million Dollar Reload were being managed by ex- Sanctuary Management manager Dave Thorne who previously worked with Helloween, Arch Enemy and Bruce Dickinson. Thorne has been credited by Jon Bon Jovi for substantially helping Bon Jovi achieve international success while Thorne was marketing manager on Slippery When Wet. Thorne continued to manage Million Dollar Reload for the remainder of their career and change of name. A Sinner's Saint A Sinner's Saint was recorded in 2011, again at Manor Park Studios under producer Neal Calderwood. by which time Finn O'Hagain had replaced McKernan on drums following his departure from the band. Frontiers Records signed Million Dollar Reload in 2012 and subsequently released A Sinner's Saint worldwide in July of the same year. UK tours and several European festival and club shows followed, including support to Koritni & Black Rain at The Bataclan, Paris. For a period Conalane was touted in the media as the new singer for US rockers Velvet Revolver after the departure of Scott Weiland. Conalane always denied that an approach by Velvet Revolver had been made. As Real As It Gets Million Dollar Reload were dropped by Frontiers Records in 2014 after a refusal by the label to release their newly recorded live album As Real As It Gets, recorded at a club show in Northern Ireland. Million Dollar Reload self-released the album on their own label, Bulletproof 20/20 Records, in 2014. A pivotal European tour followed as support to Atlanta based southern rockers Blackberry Smoke on their 'Fire in the Hole' tour. Andrew Mackle unexpectedly quit midway through the tour. Million Dollar Reload finished the tour as a four piece before returning to Northern Ireland to reassess their future as Million Dollar Reload. The band continued for a short time with Conalane taking up second guitar duties while a suitable replacement was found. A short time thereafter, Piano/Hammond organ player Kevy Brennan was recruited to Million Dollar Reload as the band transitioned from hard rock band to a more laid back rock-n-roll style throughout 2015. Change of name A decision was made that given their change in members and musical style, Million Dollar Reload would benefit from a name change to move the project forward. Million Dollar Reload became Blackwater Conspiracy, with a surprise announcement during a gig at the Belfast Empire in August 2015, when the band announced to the fans from the stage that the time had come to reveal the future of the band. A new backdrop and logo design was unveiled and a new chapter started with a selection of new material being performed. Blackwater Conspiracy went to Rockfield Studios, Wales in 2016 to record the band's first album as Blackwater Conspiracy. This album, Shootin' The Breeze, was released in June 2017.

In the ensuing engagement, Hifz-ur Rahman was hit once by a shell that struck one of her boilers, forcing her to withdraw. The ship was laid up in Constantinople in 1878; she did not see further activity for the next twenty years. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Hifz-ur Rahman was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. During a period of tension with Greece in 1886, the fleet was brought to full crews and the ships were prepared to go to sea, but none actually left the Golden Horn, and they were quickly laid up again. By that time, most of the ships were capable of little more than . Hifz-ur Rahman was modernized at the Imperial Arsenal between 1891 and 1894. Her armament was significantly revised; her two original 229 mm guns were removed. In their place, she received Krupp guns, and four Hotchkiss guns and two Nordenfelt guns were also added. At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Hifz-ur Rahman was assigned to the II Squadron. The Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Hifz-ur Rahman, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Many of the ships had rotted hulls and their crews are poorly trained. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. During these operations, Hifz-ur Rahman were stationed at Morto Bay at the mouth of the Dardanelles, while the rest of the ironclads remained safely inside the straits. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, which proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. Hifz- ur Rahman was not included in the program, and instead she was decommissioned in 1909 and placed on the disposal list on 31 July. She was sold for scrap on 11 November that year and subsequently broken up.

History It was founded by Petronilla of Lorraine, regent of Holland, in 1133 and was thereafter under the protection of the countesses of Holland. The abbey only accepted female members of the nobility as members. It became the most prestigious women's religious house in Holland and grew very wealthy on donations during the centuries.

An old Benedictine monastery, Pope Paul VI elevated it in 1973 to the rank of Minor Basilica. The first true knowledge about the foundation of the abbey dates back to a document from the late 11th century, probably from the scriptorium of the monastery of Gladbach. This richly illuminated document reports that a nobleman long before the founding of the abbey would have erected a church on the top of the hill, a church destroyed by the Magyars in 954. In 1120, at the latest, the monastery was affected by the Benedictine reform Siegburg. It was between 1228 and 1239 the nave of the abbey took its definitive form. Between 1256 and 1277, while reconstruction was developing, the idea of building a new choir appeared, but on a different plane (the typical elongated choir of the Gothic style). In order to carry out this plan, Master Gerhard, the first architect of Cologne Cathedral brought to his experience. Albert the Great consecrated the abbey on April 28, 1275.

She was a distinguished professor of sociology at Queens College and also worked as a senior researcher at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at the University of California, Berkeley. Rubin was a feminist.  Biography  Rubin was born in Philadelphia, and her parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father died when she was five. Rubin and her brother moved to New York after her father died where Rubin's mother worked in the garment industry. The family grew up poor, and her mother was abusive, and often told Rubin that \\"Girls shouldn't be born.\\" Rubin graduated high school at age fifteen and was hired as a secretary, a job her family saw as \\"a high achievement.\\" Another reason she started working was so that she could help contribute money for her brother to go to college. Her mother had emphasized that girls \\"marry up,\\" while boys should go to college. Rubin got married when she was nineteen, and had a daughter, Marci. Her first marriage was to an accountant, Seymour Katz. She and her new family moved to Los Angeles in 1952 where she worked as a manager for progressive congressional campaigns. Rubin managed Norman Martell's and Jerry Pacht's congressional campaigns. She and her husband divorced in 1959. She married Hank Rubin in 1962 and together they moved to the Bay Area. In 1963, Rubin went back to school. Rubin and her daughter attended University of California, Berkeley at roughly the same time, with Rubin earning her bachelor's degree in 1967 and then her masters in 1968. She earned a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in sociology in 1971. After earning her degrees, she practiced as a private therapist and continued her sociology research. Rubin would spend the rest of her career between both of these fields, \\"never completely fitting into either.\\" Her work marked her as one of the first feminists to use intersectionality. In 1973, she was a distinguished professor of sociology at Queens College. Rubin worked as a senior research associate at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at UC Berkeley in 1977. In 1992, she was given an honorary doctorate of humane letters by the State University of New York. Rubin's husband, Hank, died in 2011 after living with dementia for a decade. Rubin died in her bed of natural causes in 2014.  Work  Rubin wrote several non-fiction books and was a contributor to Salon. She had several best sellers, including Just Friends (1985), Intimate Strangers (1983) and Women of a Certain Age (1979). She also appeared on television to discuss her work and books, such as appearing on the Donahue show. Rubin's 1976 book, Worlds of Pain: Life in the Working Class Family describes the daily drudgery in the life of \\"the average worker.\\" These workers were defined as \\"intact families with neither spouse having more than a high school education,\\" with the husband working manual labor and having at least one child under 12 living at home. Rubin's study was based on her experience with 50 working class couples in the Bay Area. She conducted over 100 interviews with the husbands and wives separately. Rubin also highlights how many working mothers not only had their jobs to contend with, but also the sexist attitude that housework was women's work. The book was considered by the Library Journal to be of interest to both general readers and students of sociology. Worlds of Pain also served as a reminder to middle-class, white feminists that working-class women had been largely forgotten in second-wave feminism. Women of a Certain Age (1979), looks at middle age from a woman's perspective and relies interviews from 160 different women for the narrative. Rubin found that many women who had lived the first half of their lives as dependents on their husband's income often had difficulty transitioning and becoming more independent. The book helps dispel some stereotypes about middle age, like the idea that middle-aged people have less interest in sex, and that women experience an \\"empty nest syndrome\\" when their children leave home. Rubin addressed couples in Intimate Strangers: What Goes Wrong in Relationships Today - And Why (1983) which found that men often considered their wives their best friends and needed them for emotional support. Rubin felt that it was important to examine not just the emotions and problems of women, but also to get into what men are thinking. She said, \\"I'm trying to do what hasn't been done before. I want to explain men, not as male chauvinist pigs or power-hungry people, but as comprehensible individuals.\\" Rubin continued to write about women in Just Friends (1985), which primarily examines female friendship. Rubin described many different types of friendships and how these could change over time as women's roles changed. She interviewed 300 men and women which she used to create the book. Her assessment of men's friendship is that it is more akin to bonding, but not as intimate as what women experience. Rubin wrote Quiet Rage: Bernie Goetz in a Time of Madness (1986) after the 1984 New York City Subway shooting. The book rejects vigilantism and is critical of Goetz's actions. While promoting the book, she found that she had \\"tapped into a huge reservoir of anger and hostility when she suggested on radio talk shows that the gunman had not, after all, done a good thing,\\" according to The Washington Post. Rubin found that people continued to support incorrect facts about the case even after having the truth brought forward. In the book, she used letters written to newspapers to show the public's attitude towards the black teenagers who were involved in the incident. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"an important book on an American dilemma--the urban fear of crime and its devastating impact on race relations.\\" Her book, Erotic Wars (1991), explores through interviews with 375 adults, sexuality and sexual behavior in America. Rubin found that many sexual problems between heterosexual partners occurred because Americans still felt that sex was a very taboo subject. She also found that many Americans had unrealistic expectations about their sexual partners. Another finding that was she discovered that most Americans did not curtail sexual activity in response to the AIDS crisis, but rather used it as an excuse to slow down their sexual activity. Families on the Fault Line (1994) is a work that describes the way that race and class are \\"so intimately intertwined in U.S. society that one often serves as a proxy for the other. Rubin again turns to the working-class in this book and the economic insecurity that many people are facing. She conducted around 400 interviews with working-class people from different racial and ethnic groups to create the book. Her 2003 book, The Man With the Beautiful Voice, describes some of her experiences as a psychotherapist. In the book, she talks about how psychotherapy is practiced and how it can be reformed. She describes several of her own cases, both the success stories and her own failures. Rubin's book about aging, 60 On Up (2007), uses her own experiences and the interviews with other senior citizens to describe the challenges aging brings to people today.

During the 16th-century, the abbey played an important political role under its abbess Amalberga Vos: it was a center of religion and charity, and was in 1544 given status as a refuge for religious dissidents, housing many important people during a time of religious persecution.Kees Kuiken, Vos, Amalberga, in: Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland.

In 1572, the abbess relocated the nuns to Gent, and the abbey was de facto no longer active in Axel: there were plans to return in the 1570s, but nothing came of it.

Here, the term \\"tail\\" means those terms in the sequence that are not among the N largest terms, for an arbitrary natural number N. Stechkin's lemma is often useful when analysing best-N-term approximations to functions in a given basis of a function space. The result was originally proved by Stechkin in the case q = 2. Statement of the lemma Let 0 < p < q < infty and let I be a countable index set. Let (a_{i})_{i in I} be any sequence indexed by I, and for N in mathbb{N} let I_{N} subset I be the indices of the N largest terms of the sequence (a_{i})_{i in I} in absolute value. Then :left( sum_{i in I setminus I_{N}}  a_{i} ^{q} right)^{1/q} leq left( sum_{i in I}  a_{i} ^{p} right)^{1/p} frac{1}{N^{r}} where :r = frac{1}{p} - frac{1}{q} > 0. Thus, Stechkin's lemma controls the ℓq norm of the tail of the sequence (a_{i})_{i in I} (and hence the ℓq norm of the difference between the sequence and its approximation using its N largest terms) in terms of the ℓp norm of the full sequence and an rate of decay.

Pritzker, $225M was appropriated to begin this service. History Until 1979, the Rock Island Railroad's Quad Cities Rocket, served the Quad Cities. However, due to poor on-time performance and deteriorating track conditions, ridership declined substantially, causing the state of Illinois to pull the subsidy keeping the train running, leaving the Quad Cities without passenger rail service. In 2008, efforts to restore passenger rail service to the Quad Cities were set in motion. In 2010, the City of Moline got a federal TIGER grant for construction of the station. However, in early 2015, Governor Bruce Rauner put all major spending projects under review, including the Chicago-Quad Cities Amtrak line, on hold. Despite this, construction on the station started in 2015, and continued throughout the period the line's future was in question. By June 2016, under threat of losing the federal funding for the line, the state released the matching funds needed to move the project forward.

The church consists of a room of worship with a single apse, which had to be very richly adorned, as evidenced by the ornamental reliefs that remained in the present northern aisle of the temples. The remains (not visible) of the mural paintings of the Carolingian period show that the walls of the church originally had a great artistic wealth. However, after two fires the backbone of the temple collapsed around 1080 and in the ancient foundations, maintaining the original measurements, a basilica was built without a transept.

Biography Cottrell was born Mary Ellen Bryan in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the daughter of Richard and Maria Bryan (née Tester). She became a school teacher and eventually headmistress. In 1896, she married Frank Cottrell at Ecclesall Bierlow, Yorkshire. They set up home in Birmingham, where three sons were born: Frank in 1897, Wilfred in 1902, and Norman Bryan in 1907. She was active in the local co-operative movement, serving as secretary of the local Women's Guild, and was elected to the board of the Ten Acres and Stirchley Co- operative Society (TASCOS) in 1909 as the first woman to serve in that role. She was also the first woman to represent the Midlands on the Co-operative Union's Central Board in 1917. She is credited with getting wartime rations of milk increased for infants and nursing and expectant mothers while serving on the Milk Advisory Board in 1918. On 6 February 1917, she was elected unopposed to Birmingham City Council at a by-election for Selly Oak caused by George Shann's elevation to alderman. Her selection as the Labour Party candidate was controversial at the time; as at least two local trade union officers had hoped to be selected. She was the first female Labour councillor to serve on the City Council. She was introduced to her first Council meeting by Cllr Thomas Hackett as having rendered great service to the Labour movement in Selly Oak and as having had considerable experience in public work. Her election pre-dated the launch of the Co-operative Party by some months, but from 1920 she stood as a Labour/Co-op candidate. Cottrell stood for re- election in 1920, but was defeated by the Conservative candidate. She returned to the Council in December 1921 at a by-election and served until 1923. In 1922, she became the first woman elected to the Board of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, where she was to be the only woman director for 37 years. She stepped down from the Council to concentrate on her co-operative work. In the 1939 Register, Cottrell is shown as living in the same house in Oak Tree Lane, Selly Oak as when she was elected. She is described as widowed, and as \\"Director CWS (Retired)\\". She died in Birmingham at the age of 101.

It was laid out in the late 18th century and was named after the Powis brothers, who developed most of the land in this part of the town.Bedford (2014), p. 44. The street has been rebuilt several times but has retained some notable examples of late- Victorian and Art Deco architecture.  Location  Powis Street is situated in central Woolwich, to the south of, and more or less parallel to the main thoroughfare, the A206 dual carriageway, locally known as Woolwich High Street and Beresford Street. The western end of the street meets the South Circular Road (A205) at Parson's Hill. At its eastern end are the town's two main squares, Beresford Square and General Gordon Square. This is also where Woolwich Arsenal railway and DLR stations are situated and where the future Crossrail station is being built. Since the pedestrianisation of the street, busses are only allowed to pass through a small section of the street but there are many busstops in the vicinity, mostly around the stations. A large multi-storey carpark exists in Monk Street / Calderwood Street. Other car parks are available at the west end of Powis Street and in Macbean Street.  History  = 18th century = Up to the late 18th century, the military and naval town of Woolwich was largely situated along the High Street, and to the north of that street along the banks of the river Thames, crammed in between Woolwich Dockyard and The Warren (later the Royal Arsenal). Most shops in Old Woolwich would have been along the High Street, with a market at Market Hill (near Bell Water Gate). After numerous redevelopments, very little of historic value remains here. Powis Street as a dirt road, from the east. Paul Sandby, 1783 The same dirt track from the west, with the octagonal building The area that presently forms the commercial heart of Woolwich - south of Old Woolwich, around Powis Street, Beresford Square and General Gordon Square - was still largely rural, with a small cluster of cottages around Green's End and the so- called New Road (Woolwich New Road). To the north and east of the future Powis Street were the Royal Ropeyard and some gardens; to the south and west lay virgin land. As the town was growing rapidly - from 6,500 in 1720 to almost 17,000 in 1811 - the need arose for a new town centre and the obvious location was the area south of the ropeyard, more or less between the old town and the main entrance of the Arsenal.Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 190. In 1782, the Powis brothers, Greenwich brewers, took a lease of 43 acres of these fields which were then part of the Bowater Estate.The Powis brothers, William, Thomas and Richard, were Greenwich beer brewers who also in 1782 took over the Dog Yard brewery and a number of public houses around Woolwich. William moved to Woolwich and became a member of the Vestry in 1784. Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 191. Shortly afterwards a road was laid out here. It connected Green's End and the parish church of St Mary Magdalene, providing an alternative to the busy High Street. The artist Paul Sandby, who lived in Woolwich, painted the road in its earliest appearance. A watercolour of 1783 shows the road from Green's End as no more than a dirt track. Another watercolour by Sandby shows the same area from the west with the ropeyard clearly visible to the north of the road. An octagonal house stood at its west end (where the Art Deco co-op building stands now), perhaps an outbuilding of the Dog Yard brewery on the High Street, or a lavoir. A laundress lived there in 1841. In 1853 it was demolished. As the lease that the Powis brothers took out was only for 22 years, the land was not profitable for development and, apart from the road, very little happened until 1799, when a 99-year development lease was signed. Plans were made to fill in the entire area of 43 acres with streets and houses. In fact, work had already started in 1798. In less than 30 years the project would be completed, presenting Woolwich with a municipal precinct, the area now known as Bathway Quarter, and a new shopping precinct, the Powis and Hare Street area.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 190-191. = 19th century = The Powis estate in 1825 The development of the Powis estate went smoothly during the Napoleonic Wars, because in Woolwich wartime brought prosperity. In 1810 there were already 141 houses in Powis Street. The long period of peace after the Battle of Waterloo brought hardship and population decline. Powis Street (along with Hare Street, then Richard Street) was in 1821 the first street to be finished, with a total of 158 houses built. Most houses were two storeys high, occasionally three. The narrowest frontages measured 4.3 m. Some were put up by shipwrights from Woolwich Dockyard, and then sub-leased. From the beginning there were shops in Powis Street. After rebuilding Kent House in the 1830s, Garrett's, a draper's, was the largest shop. There were also several chapels, a Freemasons' hall, a theater and a number of public houses, two of which, the Shakespeare and the Star & Garter, were owned by the Powis brothers. In the late 1840s around 1,000 people lived in Powis Street. Most shops were at the east end of the street, close to Woolwich market and the railway station, which opened in 1849. At this time Woolwich was already considered \\"the emporium for all the surrounding towns and villages\\". Compared to the High Street, Powis Street shops were smart and fashionable.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 191-198. In 1827 Henry Hudson Church was born in Powis Street. Church became a prominent architect and surveyor in Woolwich. In the early 1860s he laid out new streets in the area between Powis Street and the Bathway Quarter, where the railway had cut through. The streets were all named after members of the Powis family: Monk Street, Clara Place and Eleanor Road (now Barnard Close). In the 1890s Church was responsible for the rebuilding of most of the commercial buildings in Powis Street. His style has been characterized as \\"conservative but eclectic, clumsy but lively\\". The redevelopment of Powis street was stimulated, strangely enough, by the impending end of the Powis lease in 1898. The owner of the freehold, Maj. Robert Alexander Ogilby, encouraged rebuilding by granting favourable new leases to those who did. Around 1890, 75% of the buildings in Powis Street were commercial, although rarely exclusively so. There were 39 drapers' and milliners' shops in central Woolwich, most of them in Powis Street. The west end of the street had remained largely residential but that changed when the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society (RACS, established in 1868) started its formidable expansion here at the beginning of the new century. From the early 1880s until 1908 trams ran along Powis Street.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 195-198.

Church. Most buildings were now three or more storeys high with shops on the ground floor and tenants living above. There were still 830 people living in the street in 1901. Some new buildings had offices over the shops. The Woolwich Equitable Building Society had built itself a grand new head office on the corner of Eleanor Road. Further west, the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society moved into an imposing new building with shops and offices in 1902. Marks & Spencer arrived around 1912 but was relatively small until they rebuilt in the early 1930s and late 1950s. Burton opened its first shop in Powis Street in 1922, followed by two more. Together with Cuffs and Garretts,Garretts was based in Kent House, on the northeast corner with Macbean Street. The sales rooms occupied three floors with workrooms above for hat and dress makers, and a large dining room and dormitories for employees. It gradually evolved from a draper's to a department store in the 1920s and was promoted as \\"south east London's quality store\\" in the 1960s until it closed in 1972. Cuffs, on the other corner of Macbean Street, was its big rival. After modernising in the mid-1950s, it briefly overtook Garrets. It survived a decade longer, until 1983. Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 211-212. RACS was the biggest retailer throughout the first half of the century. It became even bigger in 1940, when it opened an ultra modern department store across the road from its existing Central Stores. This part of the street had always lagged behind a bit, but became a lot busier after two huge cinemas were built at its western extremity, but not before the road had been widened (1933–34).Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 196, 198-199. The freehold of the Powis estate, since 1812 in the hands of the Ogilby family, passed on to Chesterfield Properties Ltd. in 1964. Many of the leases given out in 1898 had been for sixty years and so another round of redevelopment took place in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Cuffs was in 1956 the first to rebuild in a modernist style. Others followed and more and more ornate Victorian shops were replaced by unadorned modern blocks with cantilevered canopies and glass curtain walls. Some smaller shops were not able to pay the higher rents and were replaced by chain stores. In 1957, Christmas lights were introduced, just three years after Regent Street, two years before Oxford Street. The introduction of parking meters on 11 May 1961 (also the opening day of the notorious Auto Stacker) was among the first in London. Various plans for pedestrianisation and covered walkways from the 1960s never materialised.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 196, 198-200. The closure of the Royal Ordnance Factory in 1967 and the Siemens factory in 1968 proved to be a turning-point for Woolwich and decline set in. In Powis Street the effects became notable in the 1970s and 80s. Garrets closed in 1972; Cuffs in 1983; the RACS stores in 1985. Their buildings remained empty or were occupied by discount retailers and charity shops. Amidst the decline, the United Kingdom's first branch of McDonald's opened in Powis Street in 1974. Partial pedestrianisation came in the early 1980s, but by then the street had lost its appeal to shoppers who preferred modern shopping malls in Lewisham, Bexleyheath and Bromley. During the 2011 riots, several shops were looted and one was destroyed by arson. With the regeneration of the Royal Arsenal and other parts of the town, the street has seen some improvement in the new millennium, with the arrival of multiples like Starbucks (2008), Nando's (2010), Travelodge (2012), T.K. Maxx (2013), Dunkin' Donuts (2014), Granier (2015), Clockjack (2016) and Antic (exptected to open in 2017).Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 17-18, 199-200. Marks & Spencer however, left Powis Street in 2014 (after more than a century) in order to open an M&S; food hall at the Royal Arsenal two years later. The west end of the street is still struggling, although both co-op buildings have successfully been restored and been given a new purpose. The longest established retailer is H. Samuel, jewellers since 1904 at 40 Powis Street. The freehold of most of the shops and apartments was held by Powis Street Estates Ltd. until 2014, then part of the portfolio was sold to Mansford LLP, and sold again to British Land in 2018.

It went through various rebuilding campaigns. About half of the shops here have Victorian or Edwardian façades, although storefronts are almost exclusively modern. The corner of Green's End with the south side of Powis Street (nrs 1-7) was redeveloped in 1958-60, after a design by British-American architect Hector Hamilton. It features glass curtain walls with artificial-stone mullions, a pavement canopy and a set-back corner with diamond-patterned ornament. The next two buildings on the south side (nrs 9-21) are of the same proportions and from the same period but were both refronted in the first decade of the 21st century. This is followed by what was originally a uniform row of seven shops by H.H. Church, built in 1899-1900, of which three have survived (nrs 23-27). Further west are a three- bay shop from 1925 (nrs 33-35), some unassuming brick buildings of 1956-58 (nrs 37-45), another brick building of 2013-14 that replaced a shop by H.H. Church destroyed in the 2011 London riots (nrs 47-49), and two shops by local builder W. Harris of 1866-68 (nrs 51-53). The Marks & Spencer building on the corner of Calderwood Street (nrs 55-69) was started in the 1930s and extended in a similar style in the 1960s. Its façade is clad with artificial-stone tiles, which was the company's uniform style at the time.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 200-202. The building on the opposite corner of Calderwood Street (nrs 71-77) was part of an ambitious plan of 1958 for a shopping mall and an office tower block on the south side of Powis Street, extending over the railway. The original plan was redesigned in 1966, but only partly realised in the early 1970s. To the west of this development are pairs of shops of 1867 (nrs 79-81) and the late 1890s (nrs 83-95). The last pair is the sole survivor of a larger block that was demolished to create the entrance for the intended shopping mall. In 2016 plans were submitted to build apartments above the one- storey shop units on this site (nrs 97-101). Further west are two more pairs of shops from the 1890s (nrs 103-109). The last block (nrs 111-113, on the corner of Barnard Close) was the head office of the Woolwich Equitable Building Society from 1896 until 1935, when they moved to Equitable House in General Gordon Square.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 203-205.

On the corner with Beresford Square (nrs 2-10) is a modern development of 1959-60, featuring stone-clad concrete frames and a pavement canopy, similar to the one on the opposite corner. The former Shakespeare public house (nr 12) was established in 1807 and probably took its name from the adjacent theatre. It was rebuilt by H.H. Church in 1890-91 and survived little altered. It is topped by a pediment with a bust of Shakespeare and an imp atop. The site of the former theatre (nrs 14-16) is now occupied by a building from 1958-60. Next door are twin shops (nrs 18-20) built in a revivalist style reminiscent of Church in 1923. The two rows of red-brick shops that follow (nrs 22-28 and 32-42) were built by Church in 1894-99. They are separated by a narrow street, Murray's Yard. The corners feature pointed and stepped Flemish gables (the stepped gable is repeated on the Murray Yard side). The row originally continued further west, but some of it (nrs 44-48) was replaced by Woolwich Borough Council's Electric House in 1935-36. This is a classically proportioned building which has kept its cream- coloured faience façade and bronze window frames on the upper storeys, as well as some of the interior decorations. Adjacent are two almost identical modernist buildings of 1959-60 (nrs 50-60) and three smaller shops (nrs 62-66).Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 205-211. More or less half-way in Powis Street, the two great rivals Garretts and Cuffs occupied imposing buildings on either side of Macbean Street. On the north east corner is Kent House (nrs 68-86), named after an earlier development on this site. It was rebuilt by Garretts in the 1890s. The architect was, again, H.H. Church, who this time used yellow brick and a more classical style. Although nowadays divided into smaller shop units, with unharmonious storefronts, Kent House is still considered Church's best surviving work in Powis Street. On the other corner of Macbean Street stood Cuffs (nrs 88-104), moderner but equally grand. After its closure in 1983, it was demolished and replaced by a fortress-like block occupied by a supermarket and some smaller shops. Its neighbour further west (nrs 106-112), built in 1959-61, has the same proportions but has a more lively façade through the use of Ancaster stone panels set against a Portland stone background, as well as having apartments above the shops.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 211-212.

Big buildings dominate this part of the street. On the south west corner with Barnard Close (nrs 115-123, opposite Hare Street) five late-Victorian shops were replaced by a building designed by Rodney Gordon (of Owen Luder Partnership) in 1964-65. Its style has been characterized as \\"blowsy forcefulness\\".Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 205. Clock tower RACS buildings Its neighbour is the late- or rather Neo-Victorian Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society Central Stores (nrs 125-153). With its 82 m long façade it is the largest building in the street. It was designed by the Society's architect, Frank Bethell, and built in three phases, replacing a number of existing RACS shops and adjacent buildings. The easternmost part, including the central tower, was built in 1902-03. The second range was finished in 1912 and the last section in 1926. Above its main entrance is a large statue by Alfred Drury of the RACS' founder, Alexander McLeod (1832–1902). Its 32 m high copper-domed clock tower made it look grander than any other shop in Woolwich. With its red brick and moulded terracotta façade, the architectural critic Ian Nairn thought it would look more at home in the Midlands. After RACS lost its independence in 1985, the Central Stores closed and were used by Greenwich Council. In 1989 the building was listed. In 2011-13 it was converted into a hotel with 120 rooms and shop units.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 214-217. A vacant lot with a large car park separates the hotel from Woolwich County Court, built by the Office of Works in 1935-36, shortly after the road was widened here. It is a simple red brick building with a Portland stone entrance and the royal arms above. Further west is a short row of Neo-Georgian shops built in 1937-38 after the road-widening. The corner of Parson's Hill, originally the name of this whole area, is occupied by the Castle Tavern (nrs 179), a famous Woolwich hostelry in the 19th century, rebuilt in 1937.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 78-79.

This development on the corner of Hare Street was a spear point in the 2012 Woolwich Town Centre Masterplan.Woolwich Town Centre Masterplan SPD (2012), p. 36. The two smaller buildings further west (nrs 132-136) were once part of the RACS emporium. One was built in red brick by H.H. Church in 1901 and was used as a chemist's and optician's. The other one, a slender four-storey structure with bay windows, was built in 1930-31 as the Society's funeral furnishers.Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 212. Planning permission was granted in 2016 to convert both buildings into a pub.'Woolwich round-up: Antic's plan for second Woolwich pub proceeding & Barracks to close' on fromthemurkydepths.co.uk, 8 November 2016. The RACS department store (nrs 138-152) was built in 1938-40 in a streamlined Art Deco style. The store had an open arcade with glass display islands at ground floor and a stylish restaurant on the third floor. The large, metal-framed windows emphasise the horizontal lines in the faience-tiled gable, set between two end towers. The elegant east tower contains an open stairwell with wrought-iron railings with the letters 'co op' integrated in the design. The west tower is less pronounced and stands over an access road to Mortgramit Square. Early plans for the so-called Triangle between Powis Street and Hare Street comprised demolition of the locally listed building. In 2013-16 it was converted into apartments (\\"The Emporium\\"), adding three recessed storeys on top of the restored building.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 217-220. Next to the Mortgramit Square entrance is a row of eight two-storey shops, partly in a dilapidated state. Halfway is a tiled building that used to be the showroom of Furlongs Garage. The gate still provides access to the garage and petrol station on Woolwich High Street. The row ends with a former doctor's house and surgery (nrs 170-172; originally nr 1). This house of 1898-99 has a double datestone, one from 1798, a relic from the early beginnings of the street.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 71-73, 78-79. The last building on this side of Powis Street is the former Granada Cinema, Woolwich, now a church of Pentecostalism. The imposing brown-brick building has a curved façade and a slender advertising tower (Cecil Massey & Reginald Uren, 1936–37). It was built in a modified modern architecture style, mindful of the Dutch architect Willem Marinus Dudok. Its magnificent Gothic and eclectic interior, originally seating 3,000, was designed by Theodore Komisarjevsky.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 74-76.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and up to three small, pale creamy-white flowers. It has a relatively late flowering period compared to similar spider orchids. Description Caladenia postea is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and wide. Up to three pale creamy white flowers with red markings and long, wide are borne on a stalk tall. The sepals and petals have long, thin, brown, thread-like ends. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are about the same size as the dorsal sepal, held horizontally near their bases then turn downwards and droop. The petals are long, wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long, wide and creamy-white with pale red lines and spots. The sides of the labellum have short, blunt teeth and the tip is curled under. There are two rows of anvil-shaped, cream-coloured calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from October to November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia postea was first described in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown from a specimen collected in the Mundaring State Forest and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (postea) is a Latin word meaning \\"after\\", \\"behind\\" or \\"following\\" referring to the late flowering period of this orchid. Distribution and habitat The dark-tipped spider orchid is found in a few locations between York and the Brookton Highway in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic region where it grows in damp places. Conservation Caladenia postea is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only one or a few locations.

Also known as Interurban Train Mexico City-Toluca, the passenger railway line will connect the cities of Toluca and Mexico City. The project was announced by President Enrique Peña Nieto on 1 December 2012. Construction began in July 2014. By December 2018, it was estimated to open around 2022. Map of the commuter rail line under construction Background As a part of Enrique Peña Nieto's Presidency to offer public transport from Toluca to Mexico City, a cost–benefit analysis report was drafted and published in November 2013. The report proposed several routes. The three routes were concentrated to the metro terminals of Cuatro Caminos, Tacubaya, and Observatorio. Ultimately, the third route along Avenida Las Torres to Observatorio was chosen in order to avert future sprawl, avoid deforestation in the Sierra de las Cruces, and prevent pollution of aquifers that supply water to residents. A section of the chosen route was altered by in October 2015 to no longer run above Avenida Vasco de Quiroga in Cuajimalpa. The railway line will be electrified and elevated with a tunnel portion between the State of Mexico and Mexico City. There are six stations planned. Four stations will be located in the State of Mexico and the remaining two will be located in Mexico City. The line is designed to complement the Mexico City Metro by terminating at Observatorio station of Line 1 and provide heavy railway service to the Santa Fe business district. A shuttle will provide connection to Toluca International Airport at the Tecnológico station. The commuter line will run parallel to Avenida Las Torres and Mexican Federal Highway 15/Mexican Federal Highway 15D. The total cost of the project was estimated at $38.6 billion MXN in 2014. Construction The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) divided the project into three sections for contractors to bid on: :Section 1 covers the western terminal in Zinacantepec to the eastern tunnel entrance at Sierra de las Cruces. This encompasses of the project. The contracts were awarded to La Peninsular Compañía Constructora and Constructora de Proyectos Viales de México. :Section 2 is the tunnel portion underneath Sierra de las Cruces. was awarded the contract. :Section 3 involves the Mexico City portion from the western tunnel entrance at Sierra de las Cruces to the Metro Observatorio Station. The contract was awarded to a consortium. For its rolling stock, Spanish manufacturing company CAF was awarded a contract in 2014 to construct 30 EMUs for $11.6 billion MXN (€690 million). Each EMU will have five cars, have a capacity of 700 passengers, and operate at a maximum speed of . Deliveries for the trainsets began in January 2017. The train depot will be located west of Zinacantepec station at a cost of MXN942 million. The contract was awarded to a consortium in March 2016. In July 2014, a formal ceremony was carried out by the head of SCT, Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, to mark the start of construction. There have been several construction accidents during the project. On 4 May 2016, the temporary support structures gave way, causing the concrete decking to collapse near the intersection of Avenida Las Torres and Avenida Colón in Toluca. On 2 June 2016, bad weather caused concrete-reinforced rebar to fold onto traffic near the intersection of Avenida Las Torres and Avenida Díaz Mirón in Toluca. On 7 July 2016, a work site caved in killing one worker and injuring two. On 16 July 2016, a construction worker was killed when a truck lost control and struck the worker on a construction site in Metepec. In July 2019, the SCT determined the project's completion would be delayed to the end of 2022. Javier Jiménez Espriú, head of the SCT, announced the project was 87% complete, however, there have been cost overruns from $42.72 billion MXN in 2015 to $73.72 billion MXN in 2019.

Edwin Fuller was a fast bowler. On his first-class debut, in the annual match between Canterbury and Otago in 1872–73, he opened the attack and, bowling unchanged, took 5 for 20 and 6 for 23 in an innings victory for Canterbury. Ten of his 11 victims were bowled. In his next match, in 1873–74, he took 5 for 38 and 7 for 47 when Canterbury lost by 7 runs to Auckland. Later that season Otago beat Canterbury by an innings, but Fuller still took 6 for 44. In 1881–82 he took 6 for 62 and 5 for 29 against Otago, but Otago won by 77 runs. His most notable feat occurred not in a first-class match but when a Canterbury XV played the touring Australians in January 1878. He did not bowl in the first innings when Canterbury dismissed the Australians for 46. In the second innings, after Canterbury had taken a first-innings lead of 89, he took advantage of a pitch that \\"played rather bumpily\\", taking 8 for 35 to restrict the Australians' second innings to 143. Canterbury had only 55 to chase, which they reached with eight wickets down and six to spare. It was the only defeat the Australians suffered on their tour of New Zealand. Fuller was also Canterbury's most successful bowler when the English team visited in 1881-82, taking 4 for 49 off 54 four-ball overs. Bowling for the Midland club in senior club cricket in Christchurch in 1880-81 he took 83 wickets at an average of 9.7. He ran a sporting goods shop in central Christchurch. He returned to Australia with his wife and family in March 1883.

Attack at the 31 Connollystraße In the early morning of 5 September 1972, Safady and seven of his fellow fedayeen broke into the Israeli delegations headquarters at 31 Connollystraße. After the fedayeen had captured the Israel's in apartment number one and three, they led the Israeli's under guard down the stairs to the ground floor of the building. As Israeli wrestler Gad Tsobari reached the bottom of the stairs, he pushed a hooded terrorist aside and made a dash towards the entrance to the underground car park. As Tsobari made his escape, the wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg tackled Safady, landing a devastating punch on the young fedayeen's jaw, fracturing it and knocking out several of his teeth. As Moshe Weinberg attempted to seize Safady's gun, which now lay on the floor, another fedayeen shot Weinberg through the chest with a burst from his Kalashnikov rifle. Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base Safady, along with Jamal and Adnan Al-Gashey were the only three of the eight terrorists to survive the firefight between German police and the Palestinian terrorists at Fürstenfeldbruck. Aftermath After their release by the German government on 29 October 1972, seven and a half weeks after they were captured, Safady along with Jamal and Adnan Al-Gashey were flown to Tripoli where they gave a press conference to the world's media. Safady can be seen seated to the right of Jamal Al-Gashey in the centre. Both Safady's and Adnan Al-Gashey's fate after the Munich attack has caused much speculation. The documentary One Day In September (2000) states that he was killed by Israeli assassination squads in the aftermath of the Munich operation. However, in his book Striking back : the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and Israel's deadly response, author Aaron J Klein claims that during a conversation with Tawfiq Tirawi in Ramallah in 2005 he was told that Safady was \\"alive as you are\\". Tirawi did not divulge any further information, only adding that \\"the Israelis could still harm him.\\" Klein also claims that members of the intelligence community speculated that Safady could have been killed by Lebanese Christian Phalangists as a 'gesture' to the Israeli Mossad.

They are an example of an engineering control within the hierarchy of hazard controls. Sticky mats are typically used in cleanrooms and construction sites. Their purpose is to prevent contaminants from entering the site with personnel, and hazardous materials from exiting. In a cleanroom setting, airborne particles that are not removed by the ventilation system deposit themselves onto a surface, where they can be transported by personnel walking on or past them. Sticky mats can be temporary or permanent. Temporary sticky mats are made of a stack of adhesive plastic film layers that are periodically peeled off and discarded. Permanent mats are made of a polymer, usually polyester- or polyvinyl chloride-based, that binds particles through electrostatic forces. The peeling process for temporary mats may dislodge particles from the mat, causing inhalation risk. However, permanent mats must be washed with a mop and detergent, which is more time- consuming and may be done less often. A 2012 study found that temporary adhesive mats reduced the particle level on shoes and overshoes by 20–50% while permanent polymeric flooring reduced it by approximately 80%, and that adhesive mats released more particles when they were dirtier and when they were peeled quickly. However, sticky mats placed outside the entrance to an operating room or suite have not been shown to reduce the number of organisms on shoes or stretcher wheels, nor do they reduce the risk of surgical site infections.

It came from a very old war dance called Atrikpui and usually performed by the Ewe people of the Volta Region of Ghana, particularly during the Hogbetsotso Festival, a celebration by the Anlo Ewe people. In addition, it is also performed by Togolese and Beninese of Ewe descent. The dance has five movements in performing it, 1. Banyinyi which is a short introductory in prayer to the gods and ancestors, 2. Vutsortsor which is the main dance, 3. Adzo- which is less energetic and only the master is made to drum along with Gankogui and Axatse, 4. Hatsatsa- historical songs are performed along with Gankogui and Atoke, 5. Vutsortsor- finally, another round of the main dance which usually last for a number of hours. Gankogui is an instrument in a form of a bell where a stick is used to play. Atoke is also an iron banana shaped bell and played with a small forged iron rod. The Atoke can be used in place of the Gankogui they are both used for the same purpose. The dance is usually played at funerals, weddings, and parties. Essentially, it is played at any occasion that called for an Ewe identity emblem, since this music is known by other ethnic groups to be uniquely Ewe. Everyone is welcome to join in the dance, unlike other Ewe dances, which sometimes are reserved for people of a certain age, religion, or gender. The dance is sometimes known as the “chicken dance” due to the bird-like motions required for the dance.  Origin  Agbadza finds its origin in the times of war. The Ewe people went through various times of war and oppression before settling down in the Volta Region of Ghana and in Southern Togo. In order to train their warriors to be ready for battle, the Ewes used various songs and dances to encourage the warriors. Through this a dance called Atrikpui was born. This dance later evolved to Agbadza, which is no longer used for war but rather in events that are more joyful. Through Agbadza, at the time known as Atrikpui, Ewe singers and poets sang about battles, life and death, heroism, cowardice, migration, conquest, imperialism, and a warrior ethos. The move towards Agbadza was done due to a period of peace that was enjoyed by the Ewes around the 1920s, and so instead they decided to use some of their old songs as entertainment. Today, Agbadza is the most famous and widely played Ewe dance. Drummers playing the Agbadza drum  Instruments  Bell: It has a recurring phrase that establishes the tempo of the song and serves as a timeline for the rest of the ensemble. Sogo: This is the ensemble leader drum. It indicates to the other drums what they are supposed to be playing. This drum also signals the dancers when they are supposed to be starting to dance, through the use of drumming language. Kidi: This is the second drum in the ensemble. It communicates with the Sogo to create a conversation using drumming language. Kagan: This is a support drum, which has a recurring rhythm throughout the performance that interacts with the bell to create a specific melody. Rattle/ Axatse: This is a beaded-rattle that follows the rhythm of the timeline closely to complement the Agbadza song. Handclaps: The handclaps in Agbadza are used to add human interaction to the song and create a dense musical texture of high energy.

He was a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea from 2002 to 2012 and again from 2012 to 2013, representing the electorate of Ambunti-Drekikir Open. He was Minister for orrectional Services under Michael Somare from 2007 until 2011, although he was stood aside for three months in 2010. A long-time People's Action Party member, he was briefly reported to have joined the Papua New Guinea Party following the fall of the Somare government, only to emerge as a member of Somare's National Alliance Party. First term He was first elected to parliament at the 2002 election, representing the People's Action Party. In August 2004, he moved a leadership challenge that replaced Moses Maladina with Brian Pulayasi as PAP leader, resolving to keep the party in government after Maladina's sacking as deputy prime minister. He was a candidate in a long-running battle over a mid-term vacancy for Governor of West Sepik Province, eventually dropping his candidacy in favour of Peter Wararu Waranaka after a series of court battles. He was re-elected for PAP at the 2007 election. Minister for Correctional Services In September 2007, Aimo was appointed Minister for Correctional Services as part of Michael Somare's post-election reshuffle. His first year in the role saw refurbishment work on five prisons, reviving of promotion within the correctional services department, the implementation of an equal opportunity policy, and recruiting more than 200 warders. He was the cause of some controversy when, on a trip to open a refurbished jail in Madang, he refused to pay a hotel minibar bill and swore at hotel and airport staff in a drunken outburst. He was temporarily stripped of his portfolio in January 2010 after a major prison escape at the maximum-security Bomana prison in Port Moresby, while remaining in Cabinet as minister without portfolio. Aimo publicly blamed the broader government for the breakout, claiming that security had been compromised due to \\"insufficient funding for manpower and upgrades\\", and suggested that Papua New Guinea's prisons were outdated and needed to be replaced to meet modern requirements. However, he was reinstated to his portfolio by April. In June 2010, Aimo was one of three politicians accused in court by an alleged bank robber as having benefited from the refinery of a gold robbery, in claims which he slammed as \\"malicious and unfounded\\"; the allegations were again repeated in court the next year. In August 2010, he publicly floated the notion of recruiting an expatriate to head the country's prison system, which received cautious praise from the Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce; however, after heavy criticism from the Public Employees Association, he declared it was \\"just an idea\\". Defeat, reinstatement, unseating and second defeat Aimo was reported to have been one of 48 MPs to defect from the government and elect Opposition Leader Peter O'Neill as Prime Minister in August 2011. In October, he and three other PAP MPs defected to the Papua New Guinea Party, a member of the new governing coalition. However, after ousted Prime Minister Somare, who was contesting his removal in court, appointed Aimo to his alternative ministry, he publicly called on the Australian government not to recognise O'Neill, declaring him an \\"illegal Prime Minister\\" who \\"repeatedly thumbs his nose at the highest court\\". He contested the 2012 election for Somare's National Alliance Party, but was defeated by newcomer Ezekiel Anisi. He filed an election petition challenging the result two weeks later, alleging that Anisi was under the constitutional minimum age of 25 and that his name was not on the Common Roll. In October, the National Court upheld Aimo's petition, declared Anisi's election null and void, and declared Aimo duly elected. He took his seat in late October, sitting as a National Alliance MP. However, Anisi appealed to the Supreme Court, which in July 2013 ruled in Anisi's favour, finding Aimo not duly elected, and declaring a by-election in the seat. Anisi won the by- election in December 2013, with Aimo also beaten for second place. He is contesting the 2017 general election for the National Party.

The partnership of the Tarletons and Backhouse purchased her in 1779. She first traded between Liverpool and Jamaica, and then became a slaver. She was lost in November 1788. Merchantman The High Court of Admiralty condemned her on 4 November 1778 and she was made free on 5 February 1779 at Liverpool. She underwent a good repair in 1780. She then sailed and between Liverpool and Jamaica.Lloyd's Register (1781), Seq. №T6. She underwent a good repair again in 1782. After Parliament passed the Registry Act (1786), the Tarletons and Backhouse twice registered her at Liverpool: on 13 November 1786 (Liverpool; №154/86), and then on 16 October 1788 (Liverpool; №79/88). Slave trading voyages Between 1785 and 1788 Tarleton made three voyages as a slaver, foundering at the outset of the fourth.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Voyages: Tarleton (1785-88). Captain Patrick Fairweather was an experienced captain of slave ships. He had made his first voyage to Calabar in 1755, probably as an apprentice on Dalrymple while still a teenager. His first command had been in 1768. First slaving voyage: Fairweather left Liverpool on 24 March 1784, bound for the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands to gather his slaves. He gathered the slaves at Calabar and then delivered them to Grenada, arriving on 3 February 1785. Fairweather had embarked 557 slaves and disembarked 510, for a loss rate of 8.4%. Her crew of 38 suffered three deaths. Tarleton left Grenada 7 March and arrived at Liverpool 21 April 1785. Second slaving voyage: Fairweather sailed from Liverpool on 23 June 1785 bound for the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands to gather his slaves. She arrived at Calabar on 14 August. She stayed there 180 days. Tarleton left on 20 March 1786. Tarleton delivered the slaves to Dominica, where she arrived on 9 May. She had embarked 440 slaves and disembarked 360, for a loss rate of 18.2%. She also had 46 crew men, five of whom died on the voyage. At some point in the voyage Captain Thomas Smith replaced Fairweather. Tarleton left Dominica on 4 July, and arrived at Liverpool on 5 September. When she arrived at Liverpool she brought with her 57 puncheons and one butt of palm oil, 50 barrels of pepper, 105 ivory tusks, eight tons of redwood, and cargo from the West Indies. A listing of cargoes taken up at Old Calabar between 1785 and 1788 states records that on one voyage Tarleton loaded 440 slaves, an estimated 1,512 lbs of ivory, 4,915 gals of palm oil, 9,800 lbs of pepper, and 17,920 lbs of redwood. While Fairweather and Tarleton were at Calabar, , another vessel under the ownership of the Tarleton-Backhouse partnership, arrived there. Fairweather sent Banastre, Thomas Smith, master, to the coast of Cameroon. When she arrived there some natives in a canoe approached to trade with her, but were warned off by a shot from another slave vessel, , that killed one of the natives. Captain James McGauley, of Othello, had ordered the shot fired because the natives on that coast owed him a debt and he had declared that he would permit no trade until they had paid him. In 1793 the case of Tarleton and others vs. McGauley came to trial with the plaintiffs suing McGauley for loss of trade. The court found for the plaintiffs, establishing that it is a tort \\"to cause damage to a person by maliciously using any unlawful means, (e.g. fraud, or threats of assault), to induce anyone to abstain from entering into a contract with him.\\" Third slaving voyage: Tarletons master was J. Smith, and her trade was Liverpool- Africa.Lloyd's Register (1787), Seq. №7. Alternatively, her master may have been Thomas Smith, replaced by Patrick Fairweather. She left Liverpool on 26 August 1786 and left Calabar after 281 days. (However, the same source states that Tarleton and Fairweather left Liverpool on 25 December 1786, which is more consistent with having arrived in Liverpool in September, and is also consistent with the data in the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade Database.) Tarleton left Africa on 19 February 1788 and arrived at Dominica on 11 May. When she arrived she was carrying 308 slaves, 45 ivory tusks, 94 puncheons, 8 butts, and 15 tierces of palm oil, 50 tons of redwood, and 60 barrels of Guinea pepper. She had started with 371 slaves, and another three to five slaves died after arrival, for a loss rate o f18.6%. She left Dominica on 24 June and arrived at Liverpool on 24 June with 80 tons of redwood and cargo from the West Indies. Another account describes her cargo from Africa as 377 slaves, an estimated 648 lbs. of ivory, 9,600 gallons of palm oil, 11,760 lbs. of pepper, and 112,000 lbs of redwood. Loss Tarleton, Christian, master, was on her way to Africa on her fourth slaving voyage when she foundered on 28 November 1788 off St David's Head. Her crew was saved.Lloyd's List №1788. She had left Liverpool 10 November 1788. The Liverpool Registry records her as having been lost off the coast of Wales, and gives a date of 26 May 1789, but this date may represent a declaration rather than the date of the actual loss.

Davis (July 8, 1916 – November 30, 1997) was an American artist, graphic designer and muralist who created three post office murals as part of the art projects for the New Deal's Section of Painting and Sculpture. Early life Fay Elizabeth Davis was born on July 8, 1916, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Georgia (née Amick) and Julian Davis. She attended the John Herron Art Institute, graduating in 1938. That same year, she won the prize for the best entry in the Indiana Art Exhibit. Career The Illini and Potawatomies Struggle at Starved Rock, mural study, for the U.S. Post Office at Oglesby, Illinois, by Fay E. Davis, ca. 1941 Davis was one of the artists working for the Works Project Administration (WPA) to complete murals depicting regional scenes. The artists were encouraged to visit the towns where they were to work to incorporate themes important to the local area. Paintings typically were completed off-site and then sent to the building in which they were to be installed. She won a commission to complete the post office mural for Ligonier, Indiana, which was installed in 1940. The painting, Cutting Timber depicted lumberjacks felling trees and removing them by oxcart. Davis won two commissions in Illinois, Loading the Packet for the Chester post office and The Illini and Potawatomies Struggle at Starved Rock at Oglesby. Loading the Packet was completed in 1940 and portrays the daily lives of citizens during the peak of riverboat travel—children playing, families talking and dockworkers loading boats. It was cherished by the community as reflective of their heritage, with the postmaster once saying if the building caught fire, the mural rather than the mail should be saved. In 1942, Davis's second Illinois mural, The Illini and Potawatomies Struggle at Starved Rock, was installed in the post office at Oglesby. She had won the commission to paint the mural the previous year and made several trips to Starved Rock State Park to prepare the painting, which features 14 Native Americans in battle. Some of the fighters are on horseback and others are on foot. Painted in muted earth tones, the painting faded badly and was restored in 1988. In 1993, the mural came back into the news when a janitor at the post office claimed the nudity of the figures rendered the scene pornographic and filed a union grievance; while his complaint was being reviewed, the painting was shielded from the public by blinds. After a petition drive by local citizens to remove the blinds, the mural was uncovered and back on public display. Post office employees reported that the controversy had elevated the number of people who came to see the painting. On December 18, 1943, Davis married fellow artist and Herron alumnus, George M. Prout in Columbus, Indiana. She worked at Staley Manufacturing Company as a drafter, while continuing to work in a studio she and her husband shared in Columbus. The year following her marriage, Davis- Prout won first prize in the 37th Annual Indiana Artists Exhibition, the oldest art competition in the state, with her entry Coal for Chicago. In 1947, she went to work at Arvin Industries in the Columbus plant, remaining there for at least five years. In 1959, the couple relocated to Sarasota, Florida, and then moved to Bradenton in 1972. Death and legacy Davis-Prout died on November 30, 1997, in Bradenton, Manatee County, Florida.

Throughout 1862 and 1863, Lowry was involved in shootings, an escape from prison, and robberies, including the bail up of the Mudgee Mail which earned him and his companions £6,000, the largest haul in bushranging history since the Lachlan Gold Escort robbery the previous year.

More specifically, it was found to be from the Cenomanian Age about 93.9-100.5 million years ago in the suburb area of Bileca, Herzegovina. Pachyophis belongs to the family Simoliophiidae (hind- limbed snakes) in the clade Ophidia. The family is characterized by the presence of hindlimbs and pelvic girdles, as seen in Pachyrhachis (one of the first discovered hind-limbed snakes). Included in the most basal of snake relatives, Pachyophis in contrast does not have evidence of any form of limb preservation. Despite this, they are considered under Pachyophiidae due to their other morphological similarities along with the generas Mesophis and Simoliophis. Only one species has been discovered for the genus Pachyophis. This holotype is known as Pachyophis woodwardi. Description Pachyophis Cladogram Pachyophis is considered a hind-limbed snake despite presence of any indication of forelimbs or shoulder girdle due to its other shared general morphology. All Simoliophiidae display evident pachyostosis (increase in bone massiveness) and osteosclerosis (increase in inner bone compactness). Pachyophis evidently displays such in their vertebrae specifically. Other shared characteristics include a smaller head and distally straight ribs for a lateral compression of the trunk. The holotype Pachyophis woodwardi exhibits a body extension of a total of 60 cm. The body structure of such has an overall flattened morphology and distinctively severe pachyostosis. This is especially in comparison to other related taxa like Pachyrhacis. The differences are likely attributed to adaptations to its aquatic dwelling habitat. All physical characteristic known are based solely specific on the three specimens discovered under this holotype. =Skull= The skull itself is slender and pointed in nature. Relation wise, the skull is about an eighteenth of the trunk length. The jaw bones are more reminiscent of lizards than snakes. The upper jaw closely relates to that of varanids, scincoids, and dolichosaurids. The maxilla specifically resembles that of lepidosaurs more so than that of snakes. The lower jaw is more resembles that of dolichosaurids. The upper jaw measures 17 mm in length. Its shaped into a long triangular surface which is longitudinally concave and narrow in structure. Its highest point reaches 2.1mm forming a blunt tip and concave posterior outline on the shorter edge. The jawbone is approximately 1m thick. The anterior end represents the antorbital part of the jaw. A notable posterior concave outline represents the orbital opening as well as the beginning of the lacrimal. This projection then forms the connection of the jawbone with the palatine. At the anterior tip a small grove at the lower edge shows swollen character. Directly above it are two small groves with blunt lumps dividing them. This is representative of a suture and likely the location where the upper jawbone joins the premaxilla in the nasal opening region. The lower jaw measures 15.5mm in length and 1.9mm in width. The edges are elevated to produce a concavity that extends 3.5mm to a point posteriorly. The angular is the largest bone being widest anteriorly. It meets the splenial anteroventrally in a vertical joint. The splenial is preserved only at the joint, forming a bulge on the ventral margin. It is inferred then that the intramandibular joint is situated far anteriorly. This resembles that of Pachyrhachis. The tooth row extends the same length as exhibited in the upper jaw for equal alignment. =Dentition= In contrast to the jaw, Pachyophis teeth clearly resemble that of snakes. Their dentition show thecodont nature, their teeth fitted into bowl like alveoli lined on the jaw bones. The enamel layer of the teeth is well developed with large, hollow pulp cavities possessing small openings leading into them. The tooth row extends the entirety of the jaw with the teeth curving backwards anteriorly. The first three teeth stand 2.8mm apart, with the following becoming more crowded so the last six teeth stand only 2.4mm apart. The more spaced teeth are longer and stronger in form, with lengths up to 1.6mm and 0.5mm thickness. The closer proximal teeth in contrast are shorter with lengths of 0.8mm and widths of 0.3mm. =Vertebrae= The articulation of all the vertebrae together is very snakelike. Yet the construction of the vertebrae themselves are very unlike such. The anterior vertebrae are smaller than the more posterior. The neural arches grow to be more swollen moving anterior to posterior, indicative of pachystotic nature. Zygosphenes presence are notable in some vertebrae. They project anteriorly from the neural arch and reach more dorsally than that of the zygapophyses located above the centrum. Neural spines rise from the zygosphene horizontally for a reach midlength of the vertebrae. This length increases to peak at the posterior end. At the anterior end, the neural arches are characteristically thin and shorter rising at an angle of 45o post dorsally. Prezygapophyses are inclined at 40 degree angle anteriorly, becoming almost horizontal in the middle and then reobtaining their inclination anteriorly. Postzygapophyses width is slightly larger than that of the prezygapophyses. Both do not project very far laterally, with the anterior being more elongated that the posterior. =Ribs= The ribs are characterized by their needle like shape. Generally associated with the vertebrae, the ribs are technically not articulated to them. The upper third along the vertebral column are straight in shape, followed by a section of distinctive 120 degree bending, and then a return to the original straight form. The length of the ribs increases through the vertebral column. Pchyostosis also results in rib thickening, where the proximal section in each rib is around three times thicker in the posterior most than the anterior most. All exhibit a tapering to the distal tip for a consistent slender end. =Scales= Exact knowledge of scalation of Pachyophis is not definitive. Scale repetition is defined in transverse rows, running parallel to one at notable right angles to the cervical vertebral column. Each bulge believed to be a scale is approximately 2.2mm in length, with minimal thickness and spacing between neighbors of about 0.8mm. Paleobiology =Habitat= Pachyophis likely dwelled in shallow aquatic sea regions as evidenced by fossil location and morphology. Pre and post zygapophyses lend to undulating horizontal movement of the body. The neck in addition to this, had more flexibility and also indicates a range of vertical movement. This likely means that the Pachyophis' would hold its head above its flat bodied stature, indicative of shallow water dwelling character. Fossils were preserved specifically in calcareous mud, indicative of very little water movement in the environment. The rocks of Selišta were deposited in environments analogous to patch reef and inter reef basin systems. It is likely that Pachyophis coexisted along a diverse assemblage of marine squamates with a large diversity of fish fauna of a limited wave action lagoons. =Diet= Pachyophis' narrowly tapered mouth and sharp backward pointing teeth indicates its carnivorous diet by action of gripping versus biting methods. The jaw- teeth structure is designed for simultaneous grabbing and swallowing, fighting back against the forward pushing force of escaping prey. The jaw's posterior elongation was also notably blocked from opening very wide, another usual characteristic of snake feeding mechanisms. Thus soft, small and slippery animals were likely the main form of prey. Specifically, marine worms. Discovery Nopsca 1923 Skull and Skeleton Slab of Pachyophis woodwardi There is a single species discovered of Pachyophis, found in 1923 by F. Nopsca. The holotype Pachyophis woodwardi was discovered in a quarry in an eastern suburb of Bileca known as Selišta, located in East Herzegovina 40 km inland from Dubrovnik. Fossils of the area are generally from the Cenomanian- Turonian age, with Pachyophis being slightly younger found ranging in the mid to late Cenomanian layers. Three known preserved fossil specimens have been found. Specimens were preserved in bedded carbonate mudstone. One specimen was a postcranial skeleton and disarticulated skull preserved on a large slab of stone. Adjacently was another slab preserving three vertebral column segments in cross section. It is not known if these were all from the same individual organism. Yet the consistent ventral view, related bone size, and the overall skeletal arrangement does suggest such. *The only identifiable pieces of the skull in the larger slab was determined to be a well preserved maxilla and the posterior portion of the lower jaw. *The first of the vertebral segments consisted of thirty three articulated vertebrae with ribs. Following this was nine vertebrae shown in dorsal view, with the last few shown in right lateral face. Pelvic girdle and hindlimbs are absent. This segment is thought to represent the cervical vertebrae and few following dorsal. *The second segment is smaller and in ventral view consisting of sixteen articulated dorsal vertebrae with ribs. Less structural information is drawn from this segment, though all do display characteristic pachyostosis and osteosclerosis. Thickening proximal rib sections and notable emphasis anteriorly specifically. This segment is thought to represent the posterior dorsal section. *The third segment is most evident of pachyostotic ribs, which appear articulated with the vertebral column.

He served during several stages of the Napoleonic Wars, including the War of the Fourth Coalition, the War of the Fifth Coalition, as well as the Patriotic War of 1812. He also functioned as the commandant of the capital St. Petersburg for numerous years. After ending his active military service, he served in the Ministry of War. Military career Bashutsky was a member of the Polish Bashutsky family, whose members had moved to Russia in 1709. He entered military service on 24 June 1786, when he enlisted in the 3rd Marine Battalion. Two years later, he took part in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–1790, and served at the battles of Seskar and Vyborg. In June 1796, Bashutsky moved to the Gatchina troops (as a lieutenant), while on 20 November of the same year he was transferred to the Life Guard Izmailovsk Regiment. In the ensuing years, Bashutsky would steadily rise through the ranks. On 9 September 1799, he became colonel (polkovnik), and four years later, on 8 September 1803, he was promoted to major general. Later that year, in December, he was appointed commander of St. Petersburg. In 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, Bashutsky led an army composed of the Life Guard Semyonovsk and Izmailovsk regiments at the battles of Heilsberg and Friedland. For his efforts in these battles, he earned the Order of St. George (3rd class) on 2 June 1808. Several months prior to receiving the award, in February 1808, he was appointed commander of the entire Life Guard Izmailovsk regiment. He remained its commander for about three years. On 10 November 1811, he was given command of the 25th division. Amidst Napoleon's invasion, Bashutsky oversaw the recruiting and training of the reserve battalions. In 1813, he was given command of the 1st Reserve Infantry Corps, and with it took part in the sieges of Modlin and Danzig. However, in March of the next year, in 1814, General replaced Bashutsky, and he therefore returned to his previous post as commander of the capital St. Petersburg. On 11 September 1816, Bashutsky was promoted to lieutenant general. About a decade later, in December 1825, he took part in the general suppression of the Decembrist revolt. On 7 July 1828, he was promoted to the rank of General of the Infantry. Bashutsky then served for a few more years, until 1832, after which he served in the Imperial Russian Ministry of War. He was dismissed from his post as commandant of St. Petersburg on 6 December 1833.

Dekle Beach is a Gulf coastal community in the southern part of Taylor County, Florida, United States. Dekle Beach is located at 29.8491° N, 83.6193° W. Dekle Beach is 21.8 miles south of the county seat of Perry. History According to local historians, Dekle Beach was acquired and developed by Perry, Florida businessman and politician Gus J. Dekle sometime in the mid 1940s. Mr. Dekle was the owner of Dekle Motor Company, a local Chevrolet dealership, as well as a previous member of the City Council of Perry and a member of the Florida House of Representatives during the 1940s and 1950s. According to some accounts the property had previously been owned by the United States government, and operated as a United States Air Force training facility during World War II (although that information is not verified). However it is known that it was used for salt manufacturing by the Confederacy during the American Civil War. It is also known that Mr. Dekle was the owner of the property when it was developed into its current state as a residential beach area. Previous residents said that Mr. Dekle dredged the channels, dug the canals and developed Dekle Beach into the area that we know and love today. During the residential development period of the beach, Mr. Dekle traded the southernmost point of the beach to his friend, Jimmy Archer, a Texan who had been a long-time resident of Perry, Florida after marrying local resident Sybil Poppell. Mr. Archer was the owner of a local salvage yard and wrecker service that was utilized by Dekle Motor Company, and the land was provided as a barter in return for wrecker services. The descendants of Mr. Archer still live on part of the property to this day. Mr. Lewis Hamilton and his wife, Janis, along with their friends Willie Joe and Ann Moody purchased much of the property as well, and significantly impacted the growth of the community by investing extensive time and effort into developing much of the land into the beautiful residential area currently seen today. This area is still enjoyed by several of their descendants as well, many of whom call Dekle Beach home to this day. The Storm of the Century Dekle was devastated on March 13, 1993 when the “Jordan lovely” (also known as “The Storm of the Century”) battered the beach without warning in the wee hours that fateful Saturday morning. Several residents and visitors lost their lives that day, including Mrs. Sybil Archer, the widow of Mr. Jimmy Archer. Although the devastating Storm changed the face of the beach, it didn’t change the heart of the residents, and the survivors rebuilt their beloved beach from the ground up.

His parents, Joel C. and Elizabeth (Goodson) Garretson, were two of the earliest settlers in Henry County, settling here in 1837. The elder Garretson's were opposed to slavery and their farm house was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Owen farmed with his father, and eventually acquired his father's farm. He was involved locally and on the state level with the People's Party, served as a county supervisor, and on the boards of local institutions. Garretson was the president of the Henry County Historical Society, and was a member of the State Historical Society of Iowa. He wrote several articles on the history of Henry County and southeast Iowa that were published in Palimpsest and the Iowa Journal of History and Politics.

Background As Ibn Ḥayyān preserved in his work Kitāb al-Muqtabis fī tarīkh al-Andalus, the Hungarians (or Magyars), in 942, passed through the Kingdom of the Lombards (northern Italy) and then through southern France, skirmishing along the way. They then invaded Thaghr al-Aqṣā (\\"Furthest March\\"), the northwestern frontier province of the Caliphate of Córdoba. Through the land of Aquileia, the Hungarians with Kabar auxiliary troops arrived to Italy by the spring of 942. There Hugh of Italy paid the previously agreed annual amount of tax (ten bushels of gold) then sent them to Hispania, according to the account of Liutprand of Cremona. As historian Ferenc Makk claims Hugh hired the Hungarians to a west oriented military campaign because of the Muslims of Fraxinet's continuous raids against his kingdom, including Provence. In addition, Hugh summoned a fleet from the Byzantine Empire in order to destroy the coastal forts in Fraxinet. The battle In early May 942, the Hungarian forces left Pavia for southern France. Just before 20 May, they arrived at Fraxinet, where the battle took place against the Muslims. As friar Ekkehard wrote in his chronicle Casus Sancti Galli (first half of 11th century) among the events from 926 to 937, the skirmish ended when Conrad I of Burgundy (r. 937–993) sent envoys to both armies warning them of the other. The envoys offered Burgundian aid to each invader against the other and then informed them of the other's whereabouts. When the Magyars and Saracens met, the Burgundians held back and only attacked when the opposing forces were spent. In this way, both invading armies were destroyed and the captives sold into slavery in Arles. Several historians do not accept the above account as credible. Italian historian Gina Fasoli considered that Ekkehard mistakenly confused Hugh with Conrad. Other scholars dated the event to 924, 926, 937, 943, 951 or 954. Makk argues the battle bound to happen during the rule of Conrad, excluding the years 924 and 926. He adds, the minor Conrad resided in the court of Otto I of Germany until early 943, which excludes his role in 937 or 942. The Hungarians led a campaign against the Byzantines in 943, omitting the western military raids. Makk also emphasizes, Conrad did not participate in any major struggles against the Muslims of Fraxinet, including the decisive Battle of Tourtour in 973. However Hugh's victorious naval campaign of 942 against the \\"Saracens\\" is well known in historiography, and during that time, he was in a political-military alliance with the Magyars. In Hungarian history, this was the first documented skirmish against a Muslim enemy. The Magyars defeated the \\"Saracens\\" and they continued on their way to Hispania. Their victory laid the foundation of a successful Italian–Byzantine campaign against the Muslims in the Mediterranean Sea.

It is a close homologue to the TAF7 gene, although its function may be different. Currently, little is known about this gene. It was originally demonstrated to be a testis-specific gene based on RT-PCR experiments on tissue extracts, however, it has now been found in white and brown adipose tissue,https://elifesciences.org/content/3/e02811 as well as in certain types of cancer. Function =Function in Adipose Tissue Formation= Studies conducted on knockout animals have revealed that Taf7l makes important contributions in determining the fate of mesenchymal stem cells. Importantly, Zhou et al. found that in Taf7L−/− (Taf7L knockout)animals have decreased fat pads that are infiltrated by skeletal muscle tissue. Using RNA-seq and Gene Ontology Enrichment (GO), this same group found that there was an increase in GO terms (and thus gene categories) that werew involved in skeletal and muscle development. Combined with in vitro evidence, it appears that Taf7l is capable of initiating brown fat (the so-called healthy fat) production. Additionally, they found that together with PPARgamma, Taf7l likely can regulate the binding of the TFIID/RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) complex. Specifically, the presence of Taf7l may alter chromatin looping and thus the association of distal enhancer sequences to BAT specific gene promoters, like Cidea and Scd1. =Function in Cancer= Recently, frameshift mutation was found to be present in 3 patients with colorectal cancer. Specifically, a poly-A mono-nucleotide repeat region in Exon 6 of Taf7l was found to be missing one nucleotide (deletion mutation), resulting in a frameshift mutation. It has additionally been found to be decreased in 58% of Acute Myelogenous Leukemai (AML). =Function in spermatogenesis: Reciprocity with TAF7= Much of the initial work came from Pointud et al. They found that Taf7l has dual functionality during spermatogenesis. In early stage spermatocytes, for example in primary spermatocytes (still diploid at this point), TAF7l is located in the cytoplasm, while TATA-binding protein (TBP) complex is located in the nucleus. Then, TAF7l slowly transitions to the nucleus during the mid-stage pachytene cell, where there is also a dramatic increase in TBP protein expression in the nucleus as well. Additionally, there is a reciprocal relationship to that of TAF7 expression: Unlike TAF7l, TAF7 at early stages is expressed in the nucleus, and thus separated from TAF7l. Then, at later stages, when TAF7l transitions into the nucleus, which happens around the time when the somatic (diploid) to germ cell (haploid) transition occurs, TAF7 dramatically declines. This may indicate that TAF7l plays an important role in regulating the TFIID during development of the sperm. Pointud et al. (2003) speculate that TAF7l may \\"bookmark\\" certain genes for expression or repression in the haploid spermatocyte. =Function during Transcription= A definitive role for TAF7l during transcription still remains elusive. Yeast-2-hybrid screens have identified that TAF7l strongly interacts with TAF1 in exactly the same region (amino acids 1170-1226 of TAF1) that TAF7 binds to and inactivates TAF1's acetyltransferase (AT) function. Thus, it is likely that TAF7l shares a similar role to TAF7, in inhibiting TAF1 and thus, the activity of the TFIID complex. TAF7l localizes in a different compartment relative to TBP during early spermatogenesis, implying a TBP-independent function that awaits further study. Additionally, Chromosome Conformation Capture, has identified a role of TAF7 in directly mediating binding of enhancer elements to promoter sequences that TFIID binds to. This further suggests that TAF7l replaces the function of TAF7, as TAF7 has also been demonstrated to bind to and regulate gene (Vitamin D3 or Thyroid Hormone, for example) expression in a promoter specific fashion * References ","title":"TAF7l"},{"id":"53406302","text":"The 305 mm /46 Model 1909 was a naval gun that was the main armament of two classes of Italian dreadnought battleships and one unique dreadnought of the Regia Marina built at the beginning of World War I. Many of these guns were later modified to 320 mm Model 1934 and 320 mm Model 1936 naval guns by boring out their barrels, adding new liners and developing new ammunition. A number of unconverted guns including those from the scrapped Dante Alighieri and the salvaged Leonardo da Vinci were also used as coastal artillery during World War II.

Often no distinction is made between the two guns and the model of gun fitted was not consistent by class of ship. Or in other words the two models of gun were carried by different ships within the same class.

He is best known for having supervised the construction of the first Fort Smith on what was to become the western boundary of Arkansas Territory in 1817–1818. He served as commander of the new fort from 1818 until February 1822. Biography William Bradford was born in Virginia in 1771. He moved to Kentucky at an unknown date. Settling in Muhlenberg County in 1799, he became a local leader. He won distinctions that included a commission as deputy sheriff, a captaincy in the county militia, and was elected four times to the Kentucky House of Representatives. During the period of hostilities that immediately preceded the War of 1812, Bradford was commissioned in the U.S. Army as a captain. He fought against the British and Native Americans in Ohio, and was wounded at Fort Meigs. He continued his Army service after the war and was promoted to major. As a major, Bradford was selected by General Andrew Jackson in fall 1817 to lead a column of rifle regulars up the Arkansas River to a strategic riverfront strongpoint, Belle Point, where the river crossed what was then the Osage Boundary. This location was deep, at that time, into frontier country. Bradford and 64 men arrived at Belle Point on December 25, 1817 and began to raise a stockade. The fortification became the first Fort Smith on the banks of the Arkansas River. Major Bradford served as the fort commander, and thus as the senior U.S. military officer in what was to become western Arkansas Territory, from December 1817 until his relief in February 1822. Age 50, Major Bradford then entered a retirement-oriented career pathway. It included honors such as his brief appointment, in 1823, as brigadier general of the Arkansas territorial militia. He is usually referred to by his Regular Army rank of major. When he laid down his commissions in 1824, his pension was only $15 per month. The retired major followed the Army to Fort Towson in Indian Territory, a post on the Red River, where he served as a civilian post sutler. The Red River post was afflicted by wetland health conditions, and in October 1826 the sutler fell ill with yellow fever. He died on October 20, and was buried as one of the senior persons interred at Fort Smith National Cemetery.Grave information Today The first Fort Smith was abandoned in 1824 in favor of Fort Gibson, Indian Territory. The foundations of the first Fort Smith survived, however, and are marked within the overall boundaries of the Fort Smith National Historic Site. National Park Service signage describes the work of Major Bradford and his men in their construction of the stockade.

Biography Born in Sajgó, Belső-Szolnok County, Principality of Transylvania, Austrian Empire, Pop's maternal grandfather was the Greek-Catholic canon Vasile Pop, who supported the boy's expenses during his school years.Ion Mamina, Monarhia constituțională în România, p. 387. Bucharest: Editura Enciclopedică, 2000. After attending high school in Szamosújvár (Gherla) and Nagyszeben (Sibiu), he went to the universities of Vienna and Budapest, obtaining a doctorate in law from the latter institution in 1891. The same year, he became a lawyer in Arad. Political activity Pop entered the Romanian National Party (PNR) while still a student, and drew notice for championing the defendants in the 1894 Transylvanian Memorandum trial. In 1895, together with Gheorghe Pop de Băsești, he represented the Romanians at the Budapest congress of nationalities. Following the PNR's switch to an activist political stance, Pop sat in the Hungarian House of Representatives from 1905 to 1918. He contributed to the press, including the dailies Lupta (Budapest) and Românul (Arad). Pop, as a member of the PNR executive, was involved in the process leading up to and following the union of Transylvania with Romania. He attended the party congress in Oradea on 12 October 1918, that adopted the declaration of self-determination for the Romanians and formed an Arad-based action committee that included Pop. On 30 October, he was named president of the Central Romanian National Council, which took control of the increasingly autonomous Transylvania as Austria- Hungary crumbled near the end of World War I. As such, Pop led negotiations between the PNR and the Socialist Party of Transylvania. One day later, on 1 December, Pop was at Alba Iulia, where he served as vice president of the Great National Assembly that proclaimed the union. According to a source, Ștefan Cicio Pop delayed by a couple of hours the opening of the session of the Great National Assembly and held the inaugural address without being asked to or mandated to do so by the elected President of the Assembly, Gheorghe Pop de Băsești. On 2 December, Pop became vice president and head of the army and public safety department within the Directory Council, the temporary authority of Transylvania. Bust of Ștefan Cicio Pop in Alba Iulia As such, Pop went to the Parliament of Romania in Bucharest and submitted the legislative proposal for the union, together with Ion Inculeț and Ion Nistor, who supplied similar proposals for, respectively, Bessarabia and Bukovina. All three were adopted at the end of 1919, in the first parliament of Greater Romania. During this time, Pop belonged to three successive cabinets, serving as Minister without portfolio for Transylvania under Ion I. C.

In 1926, after the PNR merged with the Peasants' Party to form the National Peasants' Party, Pop became vice president of the new formation. Active as a diplomat, he led the Romanian delegation to the first Balkan Conference, held at Athens in 1930; and to the second, at Istanbul in 1931, where he led the committee for political rapprochement.

Keaton Beach is located at 29.8244° N, 83.5949° W. Keaton Beach is 22.5 miles south of the county seat of Perry. Florida's official state tourism website offers the following description of the area, \\"Keaton Beach is an outpost town with a laid-back, relaxing atmosphere. The wild, natural public beach has a shaded picnic area, restrooms, boat ramp and a 700-foot fishing pier. These are prime scalloping waters from mid to late summer, and the area is famous for year 'round fishing.\\" History According to local historians, Keaton Beach was named for Abb and Sam Keaton, two brothers who apparently first settled in the area and who are thought to be its original owners. It is believed that their family originally owned cotton farms in the area, however, their primary source of income gradually shifted as mullet fishing became one of the thriving industries in Taylor County. In the early 1900s, mullet were caught off the Florida coast and residents of south Georgia and north Florida would come to Keaton Beach to buy the fish, which were salted down for use during the winter. Thus mullet became a staple food of the regional diet. The real commercialization of the beach came when Captain W. Alston \\"Cap'n\\" Brown, who owned the turpentine works at Blue Springs Creek, became involved with the area in the early 1920s. The Keaton Brothers were said to have worked with Brown, and he named the Beach in honor of them. Keaton Beach has had several primary owners throughout the years, however it has currently developed into a residential area with homes that are owned by individual families. Early on the community consisted of two houses, a pavilion, a sawmill, a church, a commissary and several workers' houses along Blue Creek Spring. The pavilion was constructed by Captain Brown in the early 1900s, and was passed on to Walter Howard at a later date. By day it was used by Mr. Howard and his partner, Mr. Kelly, as a place to repair their mullet nets. However the pavilion soon became known as a non-commercial place for family and friends to meet in the evenings. One area resident was quoted in a local publication as having said, \\"The pavilion was a fun place to square dance at night.\\" Later the pavilion was used primarily as a fish camp by day and as a dance hall and restaurant by night. The Stephens family purchased the property of Keaton Beach from Clarence Kelly of Madison County, Florida in 1946. In the 1940s the Stephens family frequently visited Keaton Beach as a weekend getaway. However, the Keaton Beach, Inc. company eventually bought a parcel of 337 acres of Taylor County beaches that included the Keaton Beach area from Mr. and Mrs. Stephens. The Keaton Beach restaurant, pavilion and eight cottages were included in the deal. The land area included the frontage on the Gulf as well as Blue Creek. The Storm of the Century Keaton and the surrounding beaches were devastated on March 13, 1993 when the \\"No Name Storm\\" (also known as \\"The Storm of the Century\\") battered the beach without warning early Saturday morning. Several residents and visitors of neighboring Dekle Beach lost their lives that day. Current development Keaton Beach is home to Taylor County's primary public beach area, which includes sandy beaches, a local pier and children's play area known as Hodges Park. Keaton is also home to the county's primary public boat ramp, which is owned and maintained by Taylor County and the Board of County Commissioners. Keaton Beach is also well known for being a premier summer scalloping destination as well as providing an abundance of fishing opportunities for Florida anglers.

It is a ground orchid with a single leaf and up to four white flowers which are often tinged with green or pink. Description Caladenia praecox is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single leaf, long and wide. Up to four white flowers which are often tinged with green or pink, are borne on a spike tall. The backs of the sepals and petals have dark red glandular hairs. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and curves forward, forming a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are long and wide and spread apart. The petals are long, about wide and spread widely. The labellum is white, often with red marks and is long and wide. The sides of the labellum turn upwards and have stalked teeth and the tip is curled under. There are four or six rows of crowded calli in the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August and October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia praecox was first formally described in 1926 by William Nicholls and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (praecox) is a Latin word meaning \\"too early ripe\\" or \\"precocious\\". Although recognised by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne as a valid name, C. praecox is regarded as a synonym of Caladenia dimorpha by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Distribution and habitat Caladenia praecox is widespread in Victoria especially in the Victorian goldfields and is often recorded from areas to the north-east of Melbourne, growing in open forest and woodland. In also occurs in the south-east of New South Wales. Conservation Caladenia praecox is not listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.

The state park is surrounded by the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, whose north side is bordered by the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park. Jointly created and managed by the National Park Service and Maryland Park Service, the visitor center opened on March 10, 2017. Building the center =History of the parks= Location (in red) of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park within the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge (in yellow). Harriet Tubman was born Araminta Ross in the early 1820s on the plantation of Anthony Thompson near the village of Madison in Dorchester County on Maryland's Eastern Shore. A year or two after she was born, Edward Brodess claimed Tubman, her mother, and her four siblings as an inheritance and took them away to his farm near Bucktown, about to the east. After Brodess died in 1849, Tubman was at risk of being sold. Instead, she fled slavery and moved to Pennsylvania, a state where slavery was outlawed. Over roughly the next decade, Tubman gained national fame by returning to Maryland repeatedly to lead her siblings and other slaves to freedom via what is now called the Underground Railroad. The entire area remained in private hands until 1933, when the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge was established. This protected area encompassed much of the shoreline of the Blackwater River, but did not protect areas such as the Thompson farm, Brodess farm, or other areas important to Tubman's life and the history of the Underground Railroad. On March 9, 2013—the 100th anniversary of Tubman's death—the State of Maryland and the National Park Service broke ground for a new protected area within the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. This state- owned site lay entirely within the refuge's boundaries on Maryland Route 335. The state designated the land a state park, and named it the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park. The Maryland Park Service and the National Park Service jointly provided funding to construct the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center. On the same date, the State of Maryland unveiled the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Scenic Byway, a route along an existing system of county, state, and federal roads which mirrored the route Tubman took while rescuing slaves. On March 25, 2013, President Barack Obama declared much of the area adjacent to the northern boundary of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge as a national monument. A little under two years later, on December 19, 2014, Congress enacted H.R. 3979, which incorporated the Harriet Tubman National Historical Parks Act (H.R.664) as an amendment. This act established the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park as a unit of the National Park Service. The park boundaries are essentially the same as the national monument's, and protect nearly all the important sites associated with Tubman's life. =The visitors' center= Beginning in the 1970s, descendants of Harriet Tubman and her siblings began advocating for a state park to commemorate Tubman, her legacy, and her connection to rural Maryland. In 2007, Maryland acquired adjacent to the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge for a park. The onset of the Great Recession significantly hurt both state and federal budgets, stalling any move toward construction of the park. In 2008, Maryland and the National Park Service (NPS) entered into negotiations to jointly create the Tubman park. The two sides reached an agreement in 2009, after the National Park Service endorsed a plan to create national parks at Tubman-associated sites in Maryland and New York. The NPS plan required legislative approval from Congress, but none was immediately forthcoming. The negotiations for a state park nevertheless bore fruit in August 2011. Funding for the , $21 million project came from a state appropriation, several federal grants, and $8.5 million in Federal Transportation Enhancement Program money. Plans called for an exhibit hall with displays, and a garden with a walking trail. The goal was to have the center completed in 2013 in time for the 100th anniversary of Tubman's death. The visitor center and gardens were designed by GWWO, Inc., Architects, an architectural design firm based in Baltimore. Chris Elcock was the lead architect. The buildings were located on the site and oriented to face north, the direction in which Tubman led slaves to freedom. Plans called for four buildings, three dedicated to exhibits and one to house administrative offices. Each of the buildings is shaped like a barn, since Tubman and the slaves she was leading to freedom often slept in barns at night and barns are evocative of the rural architecture of the area. The three exhibit buildings are clad in a light green zinc siding which will dull with time. Zinc was chosen because it is a self-healing material which the architects felt reflected the healing which has gone on since the American Civil War. The administration building is clad in wood. Construction of the buildings utilized a number of craftsman. Building materials included stone and reclaimed wood, and the architectural style featured exposed beams and timbers. The buildings were designed to have windows which featured views of the surrounding wildlife refuge, little of which had changed since Tubman's day. All the structures were designed to be green buildings with at least a LEED Silver certification. The buildings feature geothermal heating and cooling, green roofs, permeable paving in parking areas and on pathways, and solar-powered external lighting. Various construction and funding delays meant that the center did not open in 2013. That year, officials estimated completion in 2015. The 2015 deadline was missed as well, and officials estimated in February 2016 that the facility would finally open in March 2017. The final cost of the state park and visitor center was $22 million. About the center Rear view of the visitors center, showing the distinctive zinc siding of the three exhibit buildings and the wood siding of the administration building. The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center is on the grounds of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park. The visitor center consists of of exhibition and administrative spread over four buildings. Visitors enter through a south door, and proceed through a series of corridors and galleries to the north. The initial spaces are narrow and have low ceilings, reflecting the restrictions of slavery. Interior areas become more spacious and feature more natural light as the visitor moves to the north. The west wall of the northernmost building consists of 18 windows of varying shape, each with a different stained glass design depicting a different season of the year. The exhibit halls contains a number of interactive exhibits focused on three themes: The Choptank River area, the local community, Tubman's family, and Tubman's Christian faith; the Underground Railroad; and how Tubman and her activities remain relevant today. Exhibits include a recreation of the corn crib in which Tubman and her brothers hid in 1854' a sculpture depicting the Raid at Combahee Ferry, which Tubman helped lead; and displays about the disguises Tubman used, her method of soundlessly walking through the forest to avoid capture, and her use of spirituals as a means of communication. There is also a small movie theater, which will screen a 10-minute film about Tubman. The administration building provides space for Maryland Park Service and National Park Service personnel. It will also serve as the national headquarters for the National Park Service's National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Program, which works to promote public understanding about the Underground Railroad and acts as a coordinating umbrella organization for a wide range of private, local, state, and federal Underground Railroad sites. The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center also features a memorial garden, of walking paths through the local landscape, and a outdoor pavilion. The memorial garden contains three distinctive areas: Closely mowed lawns, meadows of knee-high grass, and woodland consisting of waist-high grass, shrubs, and trees. The garden mimics the kind of concealment (or lack of it) which Tubman and her escapees faced. Two paths lead the visitor through the garden, just as Tubman and escaping slaves often had to choose which path to take. The pavilion features a stone fireplace and picnic tables, and may be reserved by large groups. The state park and visitor center are managed by Dana Paterra of the Maryland Park Service. The National Park Service and Maryland Park Service opened the visitor center on March 10, 2017.

Pleurants or weepers (the English meaning of pleurants) are anonymous sculpted figures representing mourners, used to decorate elaborate tomb monuments, mostly in the late Middle Ages in Western Europe. Typically they are relatively small, and a group were placed around the sides of a raised tomb monument, perhaps interspersed with armorial decoration, or carrying shields with this. They may be in relief or free-standing. In English usage the term \\"weepers\\" is sometimes extended to cover the small figures of the deceased's children often seen kneeling underneath the tomb effigy in Tudor tomb monuments. These figures represent the mourners, who pray for the deceased standing during the funeral procession.Stone, 146 Because many of the original tombs have been vandalised or destroyed, relatively few examples remain to be studied. Many figures have been detached from their original context, which is not always known. In the 16th and 17th century the practice of placing anonymous pleurant figures disappeared, although the group at Brou for Margaret of Bourbon were not begun until 1526 at the earliest. But these were commissioned over 40 years after her death by her daughter, along with tombs for herself and her husband, and reflected the taste of Margaret's lifetime.Burk, Jens Ludwig, \\"Conrat Meit, Margaret of Austria's Court Sculptor in Malines and Brou\\", Centre des monuments nationaux (France) Britain The type began in England in the 13th century, inspired by French examples. The first examples had relief figures set within quatrefoil frames, as in the tomb now used for Henry Marshal, Bishop of Exeter (d. 1206) in Exeter Cathedral.Stone, 146. The tomb now carries his effigy, but dates to the second half of the century The first recorded use of the English word is in a contract relating to the construction of the very grand tomb of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, who died in 1437 in France, though the contract is some time later, and the weepers were made in 1452–53. This has the effigy and weepers in gilt-bronze, and still stands in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, with the \\"xiv images embossed of lords and ladyes in divers verstures, called weepers\\", standing in niches around the sides, that were specified.Stone, 207–209; the contract  Franco-Burgundian examples  On the Continent they are especially a feature of the tombs of Franco-Burgundian royalty, imitated by some grand nobles. The tomb at Royaumont Abbey of Louis of France (1244–1260), son of Louis IX of France, appears to have popularized the type.

Initially, the internet and its precursors, LANs and WANs, were used merely as another media to disseminate jokes and other kinds of humor, in addition to the traditional ones (\\"word of mouth\\", printed media, sound recording, radio, film, and TV).Limor Shifman, \\"Humor in the Age of Digital Reproduction: Continuity and Change in Internet-Based Comic Texts\\", International Journal of Communication, vol. 1, 2007, Quote: \\" A content analysis of 400 humorous texts from eight salient humorous websites shows that the Internet functions both as a ‘carrier’ of old humor types such as jokes and cartoons and as a ‘generator’ of new humor types.\\" In lockstep with the progress of electronic communication technologies, jokers took advantage of the ARPANET,Eric S. Raymond, The Art of UNIX Programming, p. 44. Quote: \\"Software, ideas, slang, and a good deal of humor flowed over the experimental ARPANET links. Something like a shared culture began to form\\" e-mail,Trevor J. Blank, Folklore and the Internet: Vernacular Expression in a Digital World, 2009, . Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press. Usenet newsgroups (e.g., rec.humor and alt.humor), bulletin board systems, etc, and finally the Whole World Wide Web. Gradually, new forms of humor evolved, based on the new possibilities delivered by electronic means of communication. A popular form of internet humour is found in the form of 'internet memes'. Impact on humor Internet made an impact on humor in several important ways. Similarly to other technical innovations (from printing to TV), Internet significantly increased the speed and the extent of the propagation of humor over the world.Giselinde Kuipers, \\"Good Humor, Bad Taste: A Sociology of the Joke\\", , 2015, pp.41, 42 The joke is a commonly transmitted type of internet meme. It is well-known that orally-transmitted jokes and other kind of folklore undergo evolution and mutations. Internet speeds up and globalizes these processes.Limor Shifman, Mike Thelwall, \\"Assessing Global Diffusion with Web Memetics: The Spread and Evolution of a Popular Joke\\", Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology Vol. 60, Issue 12, pp. 2567–2576 A FAQ of rec.humor gave the following tongue-in-cheek description how jokes propagated in the era of newsgroups:Rec.humor FAQ (retrieved March 6, 2017) > #Somebody makes up the joke. #The joke spreads to about 50 people. #Somebody > posts it to rec.humor. #Ten thousand people read the joke on rec.humor. > #Eight hundred of these people repeat the joke to somebody. #Twenty of > _those_ people are clueless enough to repost the joke to rec.humor, > apparently lacking either the reading skills to have seen it the first time, > the basic pattern-recognition capability to identify it in its last ten > repetitions, or the short-term memory to realize that it's the same joke > again. #Loop back to step 4, about ten times. #Repeat from step 3 about > every two months. On the opposite side, unlike previous technical means, internet as a whole eliminates censorship and self-censorship of humor. For example, before the Internet extremely sick jokes, such as dead baby jokes, were almost exclusively spread orally. Internet blurred the lines between written and spoken in terms of language use and the directness of speech, between what is permitted in private and in public. Also, YouTube blurred the distinction between a spoken and recorded joke, in that the narrator is actually present. Limor and Lemish observe that internet humor is a part of the participatory culture, where the \\"consumers\\" of jokes may reciprocate by generating and transmitting humor, i.e., act as \\"producers\\" and \\"distributors\\".Limor Shifman, Dafna Lemish, \\"“Mars and Venus” in Virtual Space: Post-feminist Humor and the Internet\\", Critical Studies in Media Communication, 28(3), 253-273. (preprint version) New types of humor New possibilities provided by electronic means of communication gave rise to new types of humor. An early example of these is humorous ASCII art. While the precursor of the ASCII art, the \\"typewrite art\\", has been known since 19th century, it was available to few. Whereas ASCII art, including silly one, has become ubiquitous in sig blocks in discussion boards and e-mails. One may find quite a few silly examples in the Jargon File, which also mentions subgenres of ASCII art humor: puns on the letter/character names (e.g., if read \\"B\\" as \\"bee\\" and the caret character (^) as \\"carrot\\", the one may create an ASCII art rebus for a \\"bee in a carrot patch\\") and pictures of \\"silly cows\\" .Eric S. Raymond, The New Hacker's Dictionary, , 1996, pp. 48, 49 The ability to easily manipulate with images and videos combined with ease of the dissemination of them via the Internet introduced new forms of graphical humor, such as lolcats, demotivators, and funny animations.

Headquartered in Santa Barbara, California, Wyatt Technology was founded in 1981 and incorporated in 1984, Wyatt Technology has developed and introduced instrumentation for the measurement of multiangle light scattering (MALS), quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) (also called photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS)), differential refractive index, electrophoresis, viscosity and composition gradient multiangle light scattering (CG-MALS) for the determination of the absolute molecular weights and sizes of nanoparticles, proteins and polymers in solution. History Wyatt Technology arose from the ashes of founder Philip J. Wyatt’s earlier venture, Science Spectrum, Inc. (SSI), which was founded in 1968 to investigate the characterization of bacteria using light scattering. Wyatt used a breadboard instrument developed at SSI to confirm that light scattering could reveal bacterial effects that are not observable with a microscope. Further studies explored the efficacy of antibiotic agents on bacteria. A commercial instrument, the Differential I, was ultimately developed in an attempt to provide convenient and accurate data while still maintaining flexibility necessary in exploring this new field. In order to better test antibiotic susceptibility, SSI developed the Differential III which was one of the first analytical instruments to incorporate an onboard computer and utilized the first batch run of Intel’s 8008 chips. Although SSI attracted several clients and was awarded several U.S. Government contracts, cash flow problems ultimately led to its collapse. =Wine, Coca-Cola and the company founding= As he wrapped up the business of the company, Wyatt published a letter in Science recounting light scattering patterns of various wines analyzed with the Differential III and correlated the scattering patterns to price and the opinions of the quality of the wine by a panel of local wine enthusiasts. This article drew national attention from various media outlets including an write up in the popular scientific magazine Science News and newspaper articles across the country with titles such as “Grape Nuts! No Loser with Laser,” by New York Daily News science editor Edward Edelson, and “A Curvy Little wine.” Wyatt followed up this successful article with a paper in Applied Optics entitled “A Taste of Things to Come,” in which he reported similar studies on popular cola drinks such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola and RC Cola. The interest in laser fingerprinting of beverages even attracted the attention of science fiction icon Isaac Asimov whose article “No Accounting” explained to the lay person just how Wyatt's light scattering experiments worked and how they were being used to classify not only wine but cola drinks as well, and questioned how far this kind of testing could go in determining which competing brand actually “tasted better,” and how this type of analysis might be used to aid producers in emulating successful drinks by analyzing and attempting to reproduce their light scattering patterns. In 1983 Ballard Canyon Winery, located in Solvang, California, produced a “Laser Certified” cabernet sauvignon. The label displayed a laser fingerprint and values including a Body score of 447 and a Structure of 218, and stated, “We believe this unique laser fingerprint will provide a reference standard of this fine wine for many years to come and permit, thereby, an objective comparison with other vintages.” Wyatt formed Wyatt Technology Company in 1981 in order to wrap up uncompleted government research contracts as interest in his Science letter continued. National interest in wine fingerprinting and media reports on the Applied Optics cola studies ultimately garnered the attention of the Coca-Cola Company, who engaged the newly founded Wyatt Technology Company and awarded them a contract to study various attributes pertaining to their beverages. The wine studies also caught the attention of S.C. Johnson & Son, who requested an instrument to study the light scattering properties of their wax particles. =New instrumentation= As a result, Wyatt Technology developed the first in its line of DAWN (originally an acronym for “Dual Angle Weighted Nephelometry”) multiangle light scattering instruments. Continuing interest in the DAWN instruments as well as Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts involving the rapid detection of contaminants in water and air spurred the growth of the company which was incorporated as Wyatt Technology Corporation in 1984. Wyatt proceeded to develop batch light scattering instruments (DAWN-B) that made measurements from samples contained within scintillation vials as well as flow through instruments (DAWN-F) for use in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the late 1980s Wyatt purchased the Optilab line of interferometric refractometers from the Swedish company Tekator. =Expansion into the pharmaceutical and protein markets and DynaPro acquisition= In the mid 1990s the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry showed interest in using DAWN instruments coupled with HPLC to measure the molecular weight of proteins, widening the scope of utility of Wyatt instruments which had, up to that time, been primarily used for the characterization of synthetic polymers. In 2004 Wyatt Technology acquired the DynaPro line of dynamic light scattering instruments from bankrupt Proterion. Since this time Wyatt Technology has modernized its instruments into a full line of state-of-the-art particle and molecular characterization tools. Accolades Wyatt Technology is largely notable as a SBIR success story. Begun primarily with SBIR grants, Wyatt Technology has grown to be the largest supplier of multiangle light scattering instruments in the world. Its instruments are used by about 30,000 scientists worldwide, data from the use of their instruments has been published in over 12,000 peer reviewed articles, and have been used in the research of several Nobel Laureates. Wyatt Technology, its founder, and its instruments have received many awards from the scientific and business communities, including the Tibbetts Award in 2011 in recognition visible technological impact on the socio-economic front. Winners of the “Tibbie” exemplify the very best in SBIR achievements. Founder, Philip Wyatt, was granted the American Physical Society’s prize for “Industrial Applications of Physics” for pioneering developments in the inverse scattering problem as well successful and sustained commercialization of analytical instrumentation. Wyatt Technology has been named one of the “Best Places to Work in Industry” by The Scientist magazine from 2008-2013. Wyatt Technology's Optilab rEX differential refractometer was awarded the 2004 Pittcon Editor's Silver award, and was also named, by R&D; Magazine, one of the top 100 innovative new products of the year. At Pittcon in 2017 Wyatt's HELEOS II MALS detector won Select Science's Reviewers’ Choice Award for Instrument of the Year. In 2013 Wyatt's Optialb UT-rEX was awarded the Innovation Award by “The Analytical Scientist” magazine as was the µDAWN in 2014.

Prigozhin controls \\"a network of companies,\\" including three accused of interference in the 2016 United States elections. Prigozhin is also accused of attempting to influence the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Prigozhin, his companies and associates face economic sanctions and criminal charges in the United States. According to an investigation by Bellingcat, The Insider and Der Spiegel Prigozhin’s operations \\"are tightly integrated with Russia’s Defense Ministry and its intelligence arm, the GRU.\\" Early life Prigozhin was born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) on 1 June 1961, to Violetta Prigozhina (). He graduated from an athletics boarding school in 1977 and was engaged in cross-country skiing.? Ilya Zhegulyov, \\"The Right to Oblivion,\\" Meduza.June 9, 2016 (in Russian) His father and stepfather were of Russian-Jewish descent, while his mother is of ethnic Russian descent.http://www.compromat.ru/page_33163.htm On 29 November 1979, Prigozhin was given a suspended sentence for stealing (in Leningrad). In 1981 he was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment under articles of robbery, fraud, and involving teenagers in prostitution. Prigozhin spent nine years in prison before he was released. Casino, restaurant and catering career In 1990, after his release, he and his stepfather set up a network to sell hot dogs. Soon, according to a New York Times interview with him, \\"the rubles were piling up faster than his mother could count them.\\" He also became a 15% stakeholder and manager of a \\"Contrast,\\" started by Boris Spektor (), a classmate from his boarding school, which was the first grocery store chain in Saint Petersburg. Also, Prigozhine as CEO and Spektor and Igor Gorbenko () founded the first casinos in St Petersburg under Spectrum CJSC (). They founded Viking CJSC (), too. In 1995, when revenues began to fall, Prigozhin persuaded a director at Contrast, Kiril Ziminov, to open a restaurant with him. The two men opened the \\"Old Customs House\\" (Russian: Старая Таможня) in Saint Petersburg. In 1997, inspired by waterfront restaurants on the Seine in Paris, Prigozhin and Ziminov spent $400,000 remodeling a rusting boat on the Vyatka River and started the floating restaurant called New Island, which became one of the most fashionable dining spots in Saint Petersburg. He said his patrons \\"wanted to see something new in their lives and were tired of just eating cutlets with vodka.\\" In 2001, Prigozhin personally served food to Vladimir Putin and French president Jacques Chirac when they dined at \\"New Island\\". He also hosted US President George W. Bush in 2002. In 2003, Putin celebrated his birthday at New Island. By 2003, Prigozhin had left his business partners, established his own independent restaurants, and had become a confidante of Putin, apparently free to engage in illicit activities without fear of prosecution. Garrett M. Graff, \\"Inside the Mueller Agreement\\" Wired, February 20, 2018 His company, Concord Catering, got hundreds of millions in government contracts for feeding school children and government workers. In 2012 he got a contract to supply meals to the Russian military worth $1.2 billion over one year. Some of the profits from this contract are alleged to have been used to start and fund the Internet Research Agency. In 2012 he moved his family into a St. Petersburg compound with a basketball court and a helicopter pad. He has a private jet and a 115-foot yacht. The Anti-Corruption Foundation accused Prigozhin of corrupt business practices. They estimated his illegal wealth to be worth more than one billion rubles. Anti-Corruption Foundation founder Alexei Navalny alleged that Prigozhin was linked to a company called Moskovsky Shkolnik (Moscow schoolboy) that had supplied poor quality food to Moscow schools which had caused a dysentery outbreak. According to Novaya Gazeta in October 2018, Evgeny Arkadievich Gulyaev () is the head of the security service for Prigozhin. On December 11, 2019, which is \\"Heroes Day\\" or \\"Heroes of the Fatherland Day\\", Msk LLC () which has the same phone number as Concord Catering, was paid 4.1 million rubles for a Kremlin banquet. In 2018, Msk LLC was paid only 2.5 million rubles from the Presidential Administration for the exact same banquet at the Kremlin. Wagner Group Prigozhin has been linked to a mercenary group known as the Wagner Group which has been involved in various actions as a private military contractor. On 7 February 2018, Wagner attacked US backed Kurdish forces in Syria in an attempt to take an oil field. Wagner and their allies suffered dozens of casualties when the US responded with airpower. The Washington Post reported Prigozhin was in close contact with Russian and Syrian military officials before the February 7 action.Nathan Hodge, Sebastian Shukla and Mary Ilushina, \\"Putin's 'Chef' Accused of Trying to Cover His Tracks,\\" CNN, 23 February 2018 The connections between Prigozhin and Wagner have been the subject of press coverage in Russia and the United States. Wagner is led by Dmitry Utkin, who was once head of security for Prigozhin. A person by the name of Dmitry Utkin was also listed as Director General of Prigozhin's Concord Management. Since 2011, Prigozhin's mother Violetta Prigozhina has been the owner of Concord. Concord and Prigozhin denied any connection to Wagner, however in November 2016 the company confirmed to Russian media that the same Dmitry Utkin leading the Wagner Group was now in charge of Prigozhin's food businesses. Wagner has also been reported to be fighting in eastern Ukraine with pro-Russia forces. On 30 July 2018, three Russian journalists working for a news organization often critical of the Russian government were murdered in the Central African Republic, where they had been attempting to investigate the activities of the Wagner Group in that country. The Russian government had begun a collaboration with the president of the Central African Republic in October 2017. In its response to the killings, Russia's foreign ministry stressed that the dead journalists had been traveling without official accreditation. Internet Research Agency Prigozhin is alleged to have financed and directed a network of companies including a company called the Internet Research Agency Ltd., () Concord Management and Consulting Company and one other related company. The three companies are accused of Internet trolling and attempting to influence the 2016 US presidential elections and other activity to influence political events outside Russia. Russian journalist Andrey Soshnikov reported that Alexey Soskovets, who had participated in Russian youth political community, was directly connected to the offices of Internet Research in Olgino. His company, North-Western Service Agency, won 17 or 18 (according to different sources) contracts for organizing celebrations, forums and sport competitions for authorities of Saint Petersburg. The agency was the only participant in half of those bids. In the summer of 2013 the agency won a tender for providing freight services for participants of Seliger camp. Despite links to Alexei Soskovets, Nadejda Orlova, deputy head of the Committee for Youth Policy in Saint Petersburg, disputed connection between her institution and the trolling offices. =Spin offs= Campaigns against opposition in 2013 involved Dmitry Bykov and the then head of RIA Novosti, Svetlana Mironyuk, while a homepage claiming to fight fake news (Gazeta O Gazetah) was used to spread fake news.Cook with his cockroaches, Nowaja Gaseta, November 8th 2018 US Treasury Department sanctions On 20 December 2016, the US Treasury Department designated Prigozhin pursuant to E.O.13661 for sanctions for providing support to senior officials of the Russian Federation. In June 2017 US sanctions were imposed on one of Prigozhin's companies, Concord Management and Consulting, in connection with the war in Eastern Ukraine. On 28 January 2018, the US Treasury Department also designated Evro Polis Ltd for sanctions. Evro Polis is a Russian company that has contracted with the Government of Syria to protect Syrian oil fields in exchange for a 25 percent share in oil and gas production from the fields. The company was designated for being owned or controlled by Yevgeniy Prigozhin. The sanctions require that any property or interests in property of the designated persons in the possession or control of U.S. persons or within the United States must be blocked. Additionally, transactions by U.S. persons involving these persons (including companies) are generally prohibited. In September 2019, three more Prigozhin companies (Autolex Transport, Beratex Group and Linburg Industries) were sanctioned in connection with the Russian interference in the 2016 United States election. US criminal charges On 16 February 2018, Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency, Concord Management, another related company, and other connected Russian individuals were indicted by a U.S. grand jury. He was charged with funding and organizing operations for the purpose of interference with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the 2016 presidential election, and other crimes including identity theft. Africa interests During 2018 through both 100 to 200 political consultants and Prigozhin's mercenaries in his Wagner Group, Prigozhin established numerous interests in Africa especially in Madagascar and Central Africa Republic (CAR) along with other countries: Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Senegal, Rwanda, Sudan, Libya, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Mozambique, Nigeria, Chad, South Sudan, and South Africa. Pyotr Bychkov () is responsible for coordinating the \\"Africa expansion\\". =Central African Republic= In the Central African Republic (CAR) southwest prefecture of Lobaye and west of Bangui, the Prigozhin associated company Lobaye Invest has been engaged in the mining of diamonds, gold, and other minerals starting in early 2018. After traveling to Russia in the fall of 2017 to meet with Sergey Lavrov in Sochi and in June 2018 to meet with Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg, Faustin-Archange Touadera, the President of the Central African Republic, under advice from his national security advisor Valery Zakharov () increased the Russian presence in CAR by allowing 5 Russian military advisors and 170 Russian contractors to work starting in January 2018 near Bobangui at Berengo, which is the former palace of Jean-Bédel Bokassa and is 60 kilometers southwest of Bangui. Since December 2017, the Kimberley Process allowed diamonds to be mined in the southwest of CAR. Under managing director Evgeny Khodotov () who is associated with security for Touadera through the firm Sewa Security Service, Lobaye Invest was founded through M-Invest by Dmitry Syty () and is a subsidiary of M-Finance which were founded by Prigozhin. On the night of 31 July 2018, three Russian journalists, Alexander Rastorguev (), Orhan Dzhemal (), and Kirill Radchenko (), who were sent by the Mikhail Khodorkovsky-sponsored Investigation Management Center (SDG) (), were killed north of Sibut while they were investigating the operations of Lobaye Invest and Russians interests in the east of CAR at the Ndassima gold field for an upcoming film. On 15 April 2019, Putin sent 30 Russian troops as part of a UN mission in CAR to support Lobaye Invest interests. Financial support for Maria Butina in 2019 During May 2019, Maria Butina appealed for help in paying her attorney fees. In February 2019 Valery Butin (), Masha's father, told Izvestia that she owed her U.S. attorneys 40 million rubles ($659,000). Through Prigozhin's Fund for the Protection of National Values () which is managed by Petr Bychkov, 5 million rubles were donated to Maria Butina's defense attorney costs. She had not been receiving any funds for her defense attorneys fees from Igor Levitin through Konstantin Nikolaev. Financial support for Saif Gaddafi On March 20, 2020, it was revealed that Prigozhin had financially assisted Saif Qaddafi, son of the late overthrown Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, in a bid to win the Libyan Presidency in 2019. Personal life and family Prigozhin is married to a pharmacist () Lyubov Valentinovna Prigozhina (). She owns a network of boutique stores known as the Chocolate Museum () in Saint Petersburg. In 2012, she started her first \\"luxury dayspa\\", the Crystal Spa & Lounge which won a third place award in 2013 for the Perfect Urban Day Spa.

Dating from 1916, it was renovated in 2016 to become a live music venue. History Called the New Palace upon opening on November 27, 1916, the theater was designed by Saint Paul architects Buechner & Orth in a Beaux-Arts style. It was built with the surrounding St. Francis Hotel, which also included shops, a ballroom, and the largest single-room billiard hall in the country. The basement was later home to the Granada Club, famous for its Spanish style and known as a gangster hangout. The theater originally seated 2,300 people on the main floor and one balcony, and was part of the Finkelstein & Ruben circuit – a large regional chain that developed several other theaters in downtown Saint Paul, including the Princess (1909–1931) and the Capitol (1920–1965), as well as the State Theatre in Minneapolis. It made the transition from vaudeville to talkies, and was considered one of the city's two finest movie palaces – the other being the Paramount located directly across the street. Over the years the Palace would be affiliated with different production companies, including the Orpheum, RKO, and Ted Mann. First-run feature films were shown from the 1920s until its closure in 1977 due to new competition from both multiplexes and television. In the following years the theater was used only for sporadic events, such as a few live broadcasts of A Prairie Home Companion while the nearby Fitzgerald Theater underwent renovations. While dozens of theaters were built in the early 20th century in downtown Saint Paul, the Palace and the Fitzgerald are the only two that have survived. Renovation The building was dark for three decades and on the verge of condemnation before the City of Saint Paul purchased it in 2015, embarking on a $15 million rehabilitation meant to prepare the venue for concerts. The scope of the project was not a full historical restoration; instead they stabilized the structure and preserved what remained, adding new plumbing and mechanical systems but leaving \\"rough edges\\" throughout. Seats on the main floor were removed to accommodate larger crowds in general admission and differentiate the Palace from other regional venues with similar capacities, including the Orpheum Theatre and Northrop Auditorium in Minneapolis. The balcony's 725 seats were refurbished. The Palace had a public unveiling on December 16, 2016, around the time of its 100th anniversary. Bookings will be handled by First Avenue of Minneapolis and JAM Productions of Chicago. The first show at the renovated theater was March 10, 2017 by Atmosphere, with The Jayhawks and Phantogram also playing opening weekend.

Both two countries were, at least, under influence of India during historical past, as Siam and Southern part of Vietnam, Champa, were heavily Indianized by culture. However, the first real contact between Siam and Vietnam was recorded at 16th century. =Siamese-Vietnamese wars= At least in historical records , Thailand (as Siam) and Vietnamese state had fought together in a massive war series which would begin in the early 18th century. However, the real biggest conflicts were recorded from the later 18th century. Tây Sơn unrest After the overthrow of the Nguyễn Lord, Nguyễn Ánh, the last few survivors, sought vengeance by requesting assistance from Siam. Siamese force conducted a massive invasion into the newly annexed Southern Vietnam and committed atrocities there. It turned into a massive blow which, later, Siamese force was beaten disastrously by the Tay Son force, led by Nguyễn Huệ. 19th century The Siamese and Vietnamese had encountered in two massive wars at the region, which led much to the destruction of Cambodia. Vietnam had defeated Siam one and another war ended stalemate. Thus, rivalry between two powers in the region remained until the French invasion of Cochinchina, thus prevented another further conflict.

Thailand deployed 12,000–15,000 troops to fight on this war; of these, over 2,000 casualties were recorded. After 1975, Thailand–Vietnam relations remained sour and very tense. After the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia resulted in the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, Vietnam conflicted deeply with Thailand due to Thailand's support for the overthrown regime. Border raids were launched between both nations which damaged much of Cambodia, further souring their relationship. Hostility between Thailand and Vietnam only ended at 1989, when Vietnamese forces retreated from Cambodia. Modern relations After Nguyễn Văn Linh's 1986 Đổi mới reforms, Vietnam moved from a socialist state into one more integrated into international society. As a result, Thai–Vietnamese relations have quickly improved. Thailand, a founding member of ASEAN, supported Vietnam in joining the ASEAN which culminated in Vietnam becoming a member in 1995.

The architectural firm of Cope and Stewardson designed the houses in an exuberant Neo-Jacobean version of the Collegiate Gothic style, and completed most of them between 1894 and 1912. The dormitories stretch from 36th to 38th Streets and from Spruce Street to Hamilton Walk (Pine Street). West of the Memorial Tower at 37th Street, the houses on the north side follow the diagonal of Woodland Avenue (now Woodland Walk) and form a long triangle with the houses on the south side. From 1895 to 1971, the dormitories housed only male students. The Quadrangle Dormitories were listed as a contributing property in the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District in 1978. The Quad is now grouped into 3 college houses: Fisher Hassenfeld College House (west), Ware College House (center), and Riepe College House (east).The Quadrangle, from University of Pennsylvania.

Linck, The Quadrangle (University of Pennsylvania Archives, 1990). (PDF) from University of Pennsylvania Archives. Prior to its construction, Penn was largely a commuter school for Philadelphia-area residents; students from elsewhere either lived with Philadelphia relatives or family friends, or found lodgings in off-campus boarding houses. The driving force behind building the dormitory was Charles Custis Harrison, heir to a sugar fortune and university provost, 1894–1910. He removed the unofficial campus architect, Frank Furness, replacing him with Cope & Stewardson, who were making a reputation as practitioners of the fashionable Collegiate Gothic style.George E. Thomas, et al., Frank Furness: The Complete Works (Princeton University Press, 1996), pp. 54–55. Walter Cope and John Stewardson had designed exquisitely detailed historicist buildings for Bryn Mawr College beginning in the late-1880s, but the Quadrangle would be a project at a far larger scale and with a much higher level of ornament. Provost Harrison took as his model the English college experience of Oxford and Cambridge, where students lived, studied, ate, socialized and worshiped in a single community. Often defraying construction costs with his own funds, Harrison, through Cope & Stewardson, remade the Penn campus with Collegiate Gothic buildings. Built on the former site of the university's athletic fields,A Documentary History of Title to Penn's West Philadelphia Campus, 1870–1900, from University of Pennsylvania Archives. fifteen of the Quadrangle's houses had been completed by 1897, and six more were added by 1906. George Henderson, President of the Class of 1889, wrote a short book that he distributed to his classmates at their 20th reunion in June 1909.George Henderson, Old Penn and Other Universities: A Comparative Study of Twenty Years Progress of The University of Pennsylvania, (U. of Pa. Class of '89, 1909).(PDF) Old Penn and Other Universities charted Penn's strong growth in acreage and number of buildings between 1889 and 1909, but also the near- quadrupling in the size of the student body and the surge in out-of-state and foreign students. Henderson argued that the Quadrangle (then 22 buildings) played a vital role in attracting students, and made an impassioned plea for its expansion: By 1912, the Spruce Street row had been extended to 36th Street and turned the corner to the newly completed Provosts' Tower, honoring the recently retired Provost Harrison. That same year, Cope & Stewardson was reorganized as Stewardson & Page.

The rebellion was initiated in 1735, but was put down by Russian troops in 1740 after a series of heavy clashes.  Background  From at least the time of Peter the Great, there had been talk of Russian pushing southeast toward Persia and India. Ivan Kirillov, a Russian commander, drew up a plan to build a fort to be called Orenburg at Orsk at the confluence of the Or River and the Ural River southeast of the Urals where the Bashkir, Kalmyk and Kazakh lands join. Construction was started at Orsk in 1735, but by 1743 'Orenburg' was moved about 250 km west to its present location. The next planned step was to build a fort on the Aral Sea. This would involve crossing the Bashkir country and then the lands of the Kazakh Lesser Horde, some of whom had recently offered a nominal submission. However, a significant portion of the Bashkir population resented this plan.  Rebellion  Kirillov's plan was approved on May 1, 1734 and he was placed in command. He was warned that this would provoke a Bashkir rebellion, but the warnings were ignored. He left Ufa with 2,500 men in 1735 and fighting started on the first of July. The war consisted of many small raids and complex troop movements, so it cannot be easily summarized. For example: In the spring of 1736, Kirillov burned 200 Bashkir villages, killed 700 rebels in battle and executed 158. An expedition of 773 men left Orenburg in November and lost 500 from cold and hunger. During the time, the Bashkir rebels planned to massacre the sleeping Russians at Seiantusa. The ambush failed. In retaliation, one thousand villagers, including women and children, were put to the sword and another 500 driven into a storehouse and burned to death. Raiding parties then went out and burned about 50 villages and killed another 2,000. Eight thousand Bashkirs attacked a Russian camp and killed 158, losing 40 killed and three prisoners who were promptly hanged. Bashkir rebels also attacked Bashkirs loyal to Russia. But number of Bashkirs loyal to Russia was small and amounted to approximately 150.Акманов И. Г. Башкирские восстания XVII–XVIII вв. Феномен в истории народов Евразии. - Уфа: Китап, 2016. Стр. 191 Leaders who submitted were sometimes fined one horse per household and sometimes hanged. All this was at the time of Empress Anna of Russia and the Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739). The rebellion was finally put down in 1740.  Aftermath  Although the history of the Bashkir rebellion cannot be easily summarized, its results can be: * Russian imperial goal of expansion into Central Asia was delayed due to the Bashkir problem. * Bashkiria was pacified in 1740. * Orenburg was established. * The southern side of Bashkiria was fenced off by the Orenburg Line of forts. It ran from Samara on the Volga east up the Samara River to its headwaters, crossed to the middle Ural River and followed it east and then north on the east side of the Urals and went east down the Uy River to Ust-Uisk on the Tobol River where it connected to the ill-defined 'Siberian Line' along the forest-steppe boundary. * In 1740 a report was made of Bashkir losses during the rebellion. According to the report, 16,893 Bashkir rebels were killed, 3,236 were captured and forcibly conscripted (they were sent to Baltic regiments and fleet), and a further 8,382 women and children were distributed (presumably as serfs), putting the total Bashkir losses at 28,511. Moreover, 12,283 horses, 6,076 cattle and sheep and 9,828 rubles were extracted from the rebellious Bashkirs as fines. Furthermore, at least 1,175 Bashkir villages were destroyed. As this was compiled from army reports, it excludes losses from irregular raiding, hunger, disease and cold. All this was from an estimated Bashkir population of 100,000. * According to Vasily Tatishchev total losses among Bashkirs amounted to 60,000.

Early life He was the third son of a prominent pastoralist, Price Maurice, and was born at Fourth Creek in 1859 (a tributary of the Torrens River which runs through Adelaide). At the early age of two or three, his family moved to Bath in England. He attended Somerset College for his education, and in 1876 began farming at Dorset. He travelled to the United States as a young man to visit some of his father's properties, then spent one year in New Zealand sheep farming. On arrival back in Australia, he spent two years inspecting his father's properties on the west coast, then returned to Fourth Creek. In his early 20s, Maurice tried his luck in the Kimberley goldfields in the 1880s but serious illness forced his return to Adelaide for a period of convalescence. Once recovered Richard Thelwell Maurice headed to Fowlers Bay where he found work with George Murray, a personal friend and manager of the nearby Yalata Station. During this period, Maurice established himself as a kangaroo hunter on the Nullarbor Plain.Gara, T (1989). The Aborigines of the Great Victoria Desert: The ethnographic observations of the Explorer Richard Maurice – Journal of the Anthropological Society of South Australia – Vol 27 No 5 July 1989 On his father's death in 1894, Maurice received a substantial inheritance from the estate enabling him to quit Kangaroo-hunting and pursue the exploration of the desert wilderness beyond the northern edge of the Nullarbor Plain. Exploration From a new base at Fowlers Bay on the Great Australian Bight, Maurice spent the years 1897 and 1898 searching north of the Nullarbor Plain and the Great Victoria Desert, noting the position of Aboriginal water holes, while maintaining a keen lookout for evidence of gold bearing rocks. In late 1898 he ventured further north to the Everard Ranges collecting Aboriginal artifacts and returned in April the following year. In 1901 a longer expedition took him to the Rawlinson Ranges in Western Australia to explore the region between the tracks of Ernest Giles in 1875 and the Elder Expedition of 1891–92. He was joined by the government surveyor William Murray whose task was to accurately record water supplies. Other members were William Voake (general hand and cook), Lambert (part Aboriginal cameleer) and his wife. It was during this expedition that Voakes Hill was named. The year 1902 was the most testing trek for Maurice and his small party, venturing from Fowlers Bay in April, to the distant Wyndham in the north-west of the continent. Personnel on this expedition were R.T. Maurice (leader), W. Murray (surveyor), H. Hausscheldt (cook and general hand), Khasta Khan (Afghan camel handler), Munjena (indigenous assistant to Maurice), plus two trackers, Yarrie and Peter. The party started with 14 camels, but six days after departing Tallaringa, Khan absconded with the best camel. They lost a further six along the way through eating poison bush Gastrolobium. Drought conditions prevailed and lack of water was a constant concern. The route was via Tallaringa to the Everard Ranges, Musgrave Ranges, Ayers Rock (Uluru), Tanami Desert, Sturt Creek, Halls Creek and Wyndham. The expedition mapped waterholes, collected mineral samples and ethnographic specimens. They reached Sturt Creek on 25 August and arrived at Wyndham in October 1902. Maurice made one final expedition into the country north of Ooldea in 1903 however his arduous life in the bush had left him debilitated and he retired to Sydney later that year.Gara, T 1994. \\"Tackling the back country\\": Richard Maurice's expeditions in the Great Victoria Desert 1897-1903 - South Australian Geographical Journal Vol 93 (1994) P42 - 60https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/163034978?searchTerm=R.T.%20Maurice&searchLimits;=dateFrom=1903-10-10dateTo=1903-10-10 Epilogue In 1904 Maurice's journals were published in the South Australian Parliamentary Papers, and numerous specimens were presented to the South Australian museum.

Danforth, founder of the Ralston Purina Company, and his wife. The Danforth Foundation focused on national education philanthropy: providing scholarships to college students, supporting projects to revitalize the city of St. Louis, and funding the Danforth Chapels. (The Danforth Foundation closed in 2011 with a gift of $70M to the Donald Danforth Plant Center, a research center that focuses on solving world hunger.) The Danforth Chapel Program supported the establishment of 24 chapels: 15 chapels on college and university campuses and nine other chapels. The chapels and the chapel program emphasized Christian faith in chapel designs but designs and chapels did accommodate for other faiths. The foundation's first requirement was that each chapel include religious (predominantly Christian) images, such as Heinrich Hoffman's Christ in the Garden. The second requirement was that each include a plaque with an inscription: > Dedicated to the worship of God with the prayer that here in the communion > with the highest those who enter may acquire the spiritual power to aspire > nobly, adventure daringly, serve humbly. The third requirement was that the Danforths have a say in the design of each chapel. Most of the Christian iconography in the chapels has been removed to ensure that the spaces are not religiously specific and to welcome groups of other faiths to use the chapel spaces. 24 Danforth All-Faith Chapels Each chapel has its own architect, history, location, and story. Three chapels (at North Carolina State University, Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, and Wartburg College) have been demolished to make room for other building. William Danforth's vision statement—\\"Aspire Nobly • Adventure Daringly • Serve Humbly\\"—is engraved on a plaque in each of the Danforth Chapels. An article from the dedication of the Danforth Chapel at the University of Chattanooga states that a chapel was being built in South America, but the Danforth archives reflect chapels in the U.S. with one in Japan and one in India. (Lists of the chapel locations are incomplete; research also reflects a Danforth Chapel at Southern Mississippi University, but sources of information are limited.) Several sources state that the Danforth Foundation funded 24 chapels. Each of the 24 chapels are introduced below. =Camp Miniwanca Danforth Chapel (1941)= William Danforth was one of four progressive leaders who founded the American Youth Foundation and established the first of its two camps—Camp Miniwanca—in Shelby, Michigan. (Danforth's influence is evident in the American Youth Foundation's logo, similar to that of the Ralston Purina Corporation, and the vision statement—\\"Aspire Nobly • Adventure Daringly • Serve Humbly\\"—is iterated in the Miniwanca archives of the original founders' newsletters to campers, The Founders-Four Folder.) These founders focused on a Christian perspective but the youth foundation has shifted to accept a variety of faiths. The Danforth Chapel at Camp Miniwanca was started in 1936 and completed 1941. The chapel is a small meditation chapel of stone built on a wooded dune near the camp's Church of the Dunes. The founder of the American Youth Foundation describes the chapel in a published manual: > Come with me to the little stone Chapel that stands on the dune-side at > Miniwanca! > —Ruggedly plain, masoned of stone from nearby fields, harmoniously it blends > with the soft foliage of surrounding woods; > —Arched doors and windows, and a tower d [sic] roof add grace and beauty to > its symmetric lines; > —Roof beams, hand hewn, plain seats of oak, and rough tiled floor give > strength and dignity within; > —On raised altar, plain built and strong, there stands The Cross, illumed by > candle flame on right and left; > —And just above, a dossal of blood red hue, to bring relief to wide expanse > of solid wall; > —In tiny northex hands the Gethsemane portrait of Him whose name youth > enters here to meditate and pray.... The Danforth Chapel is reported to be the final resting place for Mr. William H. Danforth and Mrs. Adda B. Danforth; their ashes rest in a crypt in the chancel of the small Miniwanca Danforth Chapel. (An additional memorial site exists in St. Louis, Missouri.) =Berea College Danforth Chapel (1938)= Berea College, located in Berea, Kentucky, is home to the second Danforth Chapel, built in 1938. This Gothic-style building was intended to demonstrate the relationship between spirituality and education. The Berea Danforth Chapel was designed by architects James P. Jamieson, George Spearl, and Charles Cellarius. The chapel's walls contain 54 stones from various spiritual and international landmarks and leaders, all gifted to Danforth.

She is known for her modern abstract murals and large-scale paintings and her work with the culinary-art startup, Studio Table. Her artwork has been featured in galleries and private collections in New York City, Madrid, Seoul, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. She is based in San Francisco, California.  Career  Heather Day grew up in Hawaii and along the East Coast of the United States. She graduated from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2012 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Painting. Following graduation, she moved to San Francisco to expand her studio practice. Early in her career and after her graduation, she was outspoken about her use of social media for the promotion of the arts which was not common at that time.  Work  Day considers her work a form of visual storytelling, where each painting acts as a page to a larger story about “risk and comfort.” Citing the lines and textures of nature, travel, music and the depth of the color blue as her main sources of inspiration, Day works primarily with paint and non-traditional materials on canvas. She also works in both interior and exterior murals and experimental sculpture. Day painted a commissioned mural at the Dropbox office in Seattle, conveying movement and creating her own canvas by painting over existing design elements such as a moose head sculpture. Aside from working with traditional painting materials, Day used her process to create the world's first augmented reality art for Facebook Camera in collaboration with Facebook's Applied Machine Learning group. Using her social media platform as a vehicle for community discussion, Day addresses feminism, current political events and their impacts on the community, and entrepreneurship. Day regards Helen Frankenthaler, Katharina Gross, Sam Gilliam, Agnes Martin, Willem DeKooning and Noah Purifoy as admirable artists. Together with product manager Michelle Wei, Day co-founded a culinary-art startup company called Studio Table. Studio Table started in Day’s studio space in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco.

It covers a total distance of that runs through the major north states of India.The old ICF coaches of the trains were replaced with the new LHB coaches during Mid August 2018. History In 1975 in order to bring equality amongst all classes and provide good train experience to all strata of society, the Himgiri Express was launched. The Himgiri Express made its inaugural run on 1 January 1979. It made its first run on Monday. However this idea of bringing in equality failed miserably. It was also in this era that steam engines were brought to an end and paved way for electrified trains. The Himgiri Express was a part of the electrified wagon. It was also when this express was launched that the Indian Railways abolished the third class in trains. Stations The Himgiri Express train passes through the following stations: Howrah Junction, Asansol Junction, Chittaranjan, Madhupur Junction,Jasidih Junction,Jhajha, Jamui, Kiul Junction, Mokameh,Bakhtiyarpur junction,Patna junction, Danapur,Ara jn, Buxar, Pt Deendayal Upadhyay Junction, Varanasi Junction, Jaunpur City, Sultanpur, Nihalgarh, Lucknow, Bareilly, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Jagadhri, Ambala Cant Junction, Ludhiana , Phagwara Junction, Jalandhar Cant, Chakki Bank and then Jammu Tawi.

No subspecies are listed in the Catalogue of Life. Nomenclature The current name Colona evecta appears to have been coined by Burret, but most Vietnamese texts refer to C. evecta (Pierre) Gagnep. However this is probably a nomen superfluum: Burret (1926) and Gagnepain independently transferring the species from one genus to the other. Gagnepain's 1943 paper is now available online (page 67), and does not mention this species. At the time of writing (2017) the Plant List refers to C. erecta (Pierre) Burret as an accepted name with 8 accessions in the Kew herbarium catalogue also under the latter name . The Vietnamese name is chàm ron (sometimes bồ an is used, but this is better applied to C. auriculata); in Khmer it is töngoor. Description Colona evecta was described from southern Vietnam, it is also found in neighbouring provinces of Cambodia, where the species often survives forest clearing. The tree grows from 6-20m, with radiating pubescent branches and terminal flowers. The bark of young trees is very tough. The leaves are relatively thick, lanceolate, denticulate, glossy on upper sides, with 5–7 mm petioles. The pods have 3-4 wings and are approximately 20–25 mm; the seeds are 6–7 mm.

García Ponce is best known for his abstract paintings and collages, most of which utilize structured and geometric forms rather than organic shapes.  Life  García Ponce was born in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico on August 25, 1933 to Juan García Rodes, immigrant from Spain, and María \\"Monina\\" Ponce G. Cantón, a member of the so-called \\"casta divina\\" of Yucatán. At the age of 11, García Ponce's family moved to Mexico City. In 1952, García Ponce enrolled at the National Autonomous University of Mexico to study architecture. In 1967, García Ponce met the French Canadian actress Denise Brosseau, who had previously been married to Alejandro Jodorowsky. Brosseau and García Ponce married and had one child, Esteban García Brosseau. On July 11, 1987, García Ponce died of a heart attack in Coyoacán, Mexico City; García Ponce was 54 at the time. His elder brother, Juan Garcia Ponce, was a well known author and has published works about his brother's art and life.  Works  Garcia Ponce is part of a generation of artist that began to seek new creative option after 1945. In Mexico this desire to create a new tradition was particularly difficult in Mexico, because of the omnipresence of the \\"three great\\" muralist: Siqueiros, Rivera and Orozco. Garcia Ponce and other painters of his generation felt the necessity to establish the independence of painting towards any type of social or political program. After traveling to Paris in his youth Garcia Ponce assimilated the philosophical background that characterized Informalism in France and Abstract Expressionism in the U.S. of which he appreciated the freedom. Nonetheless his formation as an architect undeniably influenced his painting in which geometry and structure are essential components even if treated lyrically. Garcia Ponce first teacher was the Spanish painter Enrique Climent who took him as his only student. García Ponce's artwork was first inspired by the cubist experience. The artist chose to work through depersonalization and the search of purity. Later, he became more focused in exploring the balance between form and space. His goal was to push his artwork past its initial appearance to the viewer. García Ponce has allowed for his paintings to speak for themselves. His artworks are living spaces animated by the artist's spirit. “Since his first exhibition, Fernando Garcia Ponce showed that his paintings could be presided over by a sign of rigor. Influenced by cubism, his early works clearly displayed the feeling that had determined the choices of painters before him. Before Braque or Picasso, the memory of Juan Gris. Facing the temptation to include the complete reality of the object in the closed atmosphere of the painting, facing the creative liberty and the will to transform, the painter would choose depersonalization, the search of final purity of which is capable of formal representation. His cubism was, in the most profound sense, analytic.” “His paintings are simple and difficult, empty spaces, spaces made alive through the presence of the creator’s spirit that becomes incarnated in the work.” Some of his works are: * Self-portrait (1951) * Natural Death (1959) * Painting A-63 (1963) * Bottling Peninsula, ca (1966) * Relief and Space (1970) * Homage to Picasso (1976) * Glory and Death (1980) * Horizontal Composition with Red Point (1986) References * Ponce, Juan García.

He briefly served as chancellor during Later Han.  Background  Assuming that Li Tao died in 961, he would be born in 898, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. He was from Wannian (), one of the two counties making up the Tang dynasty capital Chang'an.History of Song, vol. 262. He was a 10th-generation descendant of Li Yi (), an uncle of Tang's founding emperor Emperor Gaozu, and was a great-grandnephew of the Tang chancellor Li Hui.Li Tao's biography in the History of Song actually indicated that this 10th generation ancestor was Li Wei (李瑋) and was a son of Emperor Jingzong, but this account seems implausible given that Emperor Jingzong's reign was from 809 to 827 (less than 100 years prior to Li Tao's birth), and his own biography and the biographies of his sons did not indicate that he had a son named Li Wei. See Old Book of Tang, vols. 17, part 1 and 175. The account used here is based on the Zizhi Tongjian, which asserted that Li Tao was a great-grandnephew of Li Hui's, and the Old Book of Tang, vol. 173, which indicated that Li Hui was a descendant of Li Yi's. See also New Book of Tang, vol. 70, part 1, which gave Li Yi's family tree and included Li Tao as a descendant. His grandfather Li Zhen () served as a county magistrate, while his father Li Yuan () served as the director of palace construction (將作監, Jiangzuo Jian). He had at least one younger brother, Li Huan (), who would later be known for literary capabilities. In 907, the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong seized the throne, ending Tang and establishing Later Liang. Li Yuan, as he was a member of Tang's imperial clan, feared that disaster would come to him, and therefore took Li Tao to the land of Later Liang's vassal state Chu to look for refuge from Chu's ruler Ma Yin. Ma commissioned Li Tao as the magistrate of Hengyang County (衡陽, in modern Hengyang, Hunan). Li Tao's cousin Li Yu () served in the Later Liang imperial guards and apparently informed Zhu about Li Yuan's and Li Tao's flight to Chu. Zhu ordered Ma to send Li Yuan and Li Tao back to Later Liang proper, and made Li Tao the magistrate of Heyang County (河陽, in modern Luoyang, Henan).  During Later Tang  Early in the Tiancheng era (926-930) of Later Liang's successor state Later Tang's emperor Li Siyuan, Li Tao passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi () class, and thereafter became an assistant to the prefect of Jin Prefecture (晉州, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), and later successively served as an imperial censor with the title of Jiancha Yushi (), and then You Bujue (), a consultant at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). When Li Siyuan's son Li Conghou the Prince of Song was made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), Li Tao was made his assistant in his role as governor (觀察使, Guanchashi).Li Conghou became the military governor of Tianxiong in 931 and was recalled back to the capital Luoyang to succeed his father in 933, so Li Tao's service under him must have been during those years. See Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 45 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. After about a year of serving at Tianxiong, Li Tao was recalled to the imperial government to serve as an imperial chronicler (起居舍人, Qiju Sheren).  During Later Jin  In 936, Later Tang was destroyed and succeeded by Later Jin, with Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang becoming emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. In this new administration, Li Tao received the titles of Kaogong Yuanwailang (考功員外郎, a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Libu)) and editor of imperial history (史館修撰, Shiguan Xiuzhuan). In 937, when the general Zhang Congbin () rebelled against Shi, but was then quickly defeated, one of Zhang Congbin's chief co-conspirators was Zhang Jizuo (). When Shi was set to slaughter Zhang Jizuo's clan on account of his treason, Li cited the fact that Zhang Jizuo's father Zhang Quanyi had been a great benefactor to the people in rebuilding Luoyang to beg Shi to spare his clan; Shi agreed, and ended up limiting the executions to Zhang Jizuo's wife and children.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. There was a subsequent time when Li served as an imperial emissary to Song Prefecture (宋州, in modern Shangqiu, Henan) to review the farms of the prefecture to revise the taxes to be levied there. The official Yuan Zhengci (), who had an estate at Song, sent Li a gift of textile, trying to get Li to overlook his estate. Li instead revealed this to Shi, who honored him for his honesty. As a result, Yuan was demoted a rank, and Li was made the magistrate of Junyi County (), one of the two counties making up the Later Jin capital Kaifeng. He later was made Bibu Langzhong () and then Xingbu Langzhong (刑部郎中, both supervisory positions at the ministry of justice (刑部, Xingbu)), while also serving as an assistant to the director of salt and iron monopolies specifically dealing with salt monopoly. In 941, there was an infamous incident where Zhang Yanze the military governor of Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) executed his secretary Zhang Shi () cruellyZizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. and, after Zhang Shi's death, took Zhang Shi's wife as a concubine. After Zhang Shi's father Zhang Duo () went to Shi Jingtang's then-location Yedu (鄴都, i.e., Tianxiong's capital) to plead to the emperor about what happened to his son, Shi removed Zhang Yanze from his post as military governor of Zhangyi. However, even though Zhang Yanze's successor Wang Zhou () then reported that Zhang Yanze had committed 26 crimes at Zhangyi (in addition to what he did to Zhang Shi), Shi took no further actions against Zhang Yanze, on account of Zhang Yanze's past battlefield accomplishments and the fact that Zhang Yanze was related by marriage with the powerful general Yang Guangyuan. A number of officials, including Li, complained bitterly, going as far as to prostrate themselves in front of the palace to plead that Zhang receive the death penalty. When Shi summoned Li to his presence, Li spoke harshly in tone and words, drawing Shi's anger, and Shi ordered him to leave. Li initially did not withdraw and continued arguing, causing Shi to respond, \\"I already promised to Zhang Yanze that he would not die.\\" Li responded, \\"Your Imperial Majesty does not want to turn against your words promising life to Zhang Yanze. But, where is Fan Yanguang's iron certificate [(i.e., promise of life)]?\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. (This was a reference to how Fan had rebelled against Shi but was induced into surrendering by promise of an iron certificate guaranteeing his life, but Shi had later subsequently implicitly permitted Yang to have Fan killed.) In anger, Shi walked away. Li subsequently returned to Luoyang and wrote a poem lamenting this incident. When Shi Jingtang died later in the year and was succeeded by his adoptive son (biological nephew) Shi Chonggui, Li was accused of not visiting the emperor's casket, and was removed from his post. Soon, he was recalled to government service to serve as the magistrate of Luoyang County (the other county making up Luoyang). He then successively served as Tuntian Langzhong (屯田郎中, a supervisory official at the ministry of public works (工部, Gongbu)), and then Zhifang Langzhong (職方郎中, a supervisory official at the ministry of defense (兵部, Bingbu)), and then Zhongshu Sheren (中書舍人, a mid-level official at the legislative bureau).  During the Liao incursion  Around new year 947, Later Jin was destroyed by the Khitan Liao dynasty's Emperor Taizong — with Zhang Yanze, who had surrendered to Liao, serving as Emperor Taizong's forward commander in taking Liao troops into the Later Jin capital Daliang. Zhang executed a number of Later Jin officials that he had grudges with. Li Tao, believing that he could not escape, decided to go see Zhang, sending a note requesting a meeting and stating, \\"Li Tao, who had requested that the Taiwei [(太尉, the title that Zhang carried in the Liao government)] be executed, is requesting an audience and asking for death.\\" Zhang gladly received him and stated, \\"Are you afraid now, Sheren?\\" Li responded, \\"Tao's fear today is like the fear that Your Honor had then. If Emperor Gaozu [(i.e., Shi Jingtang)] had followed my words, how can such things happen?\\" Zhang laughed, drank with him, and released him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285.  During Later Han  = During Liu Zhiyuan's reign = Emperor Taizong claimed to be the emperor of China as well, but soon, there were numerous rebellions that rose against him, and he withdrew from Daliang. The most prominent of the rebels was Liu Zhiyuan, who declared himself emperor of a new state later known as Later Han at his base at Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. When Liu approached Luoyang, Li Tao, along with the other Later Jin officials, went to Luoyang to welcome him, Liu inquired of him of the status of the imperial treasury in light of the Liao incursion. Li was able to give a detail report, and Liu was pleased by his knowledge. Once Liu entered Daliang, he made Li an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi). (Meanwhile, Li Tao's brother Li Huan was taken to Liao proper, and later served as an imperial scholar under Emperor Taizong's nephew Emperor Shizong and son Emperor Jingzong.) Later in 947, Liu, who had initially upon his uprising made his staff members Su Fengji and Su Yugui his chancellors, was considering naming additional chancellors. When he asked Su Fengji for recommendations, Su Fengji, who was friendly with Li, recommended Li, pointing out Li's earlier insistence for Zhang Yanze's death that Liu agreed with. At that time, it happened that Liu was facing the problem of the rebellion of Du Chongwei at Yedu, with the generals that Liu sent to attack Du, Gao Xingzhou and Murong Yanchao, having discord among themselves. Li submitted a petition asking Liu to head to Yedu to oversee the siege himself, and Liu was pleased with the proposal and found Li to be wise. Liu thereafter named both Li and Dou Zhengu chancellors with the title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), with Li receiving additional titles of minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu) and Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎, deputy head of the legislative bureau).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. = During Liu Chengyou's reign = In 948, Liu Zhiyuan died and was succeeded by his son Liu Chengyou. Early in Liu Chengyou's reign, the high-level officials were in a collective leadership, with different responsibilities. However, Yang Bin, as chief of staff (Shumishi), oversaw the government overall,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. and when the chancellors, led by Su Fengji, wanted to promote officials and fill unfilled positions, Yang saw the requests as wasteful and often rejected them, causing the chancellors to be displeased. In spring 948, Li Tao submitted a petition to Liu Chengyou suggesting that Yang and Guo Wei (who was then deputy chief of staff) be given military commands outside the capital and that key matters be decided by Su Fengji and Su Yugui. When Yang and Guo heard of this, they went to see Liu Chengyou's mother (Liu Zhiyuan's wife) Empress Dowager Li, stating to her, \\"Your subjects have followed the deceased emperor ever since difficult times. Now, the Son of Heaven is accepting other people's word and wants to send us out. Given that there are troubles west of the pass [(i.e., in the Guanzhong region, where the general Wang Jingchong was fostering a rebellion)], how can we, your subjects and ignore the affairs of the state? If we are not to remain, we hope to at least remain until the deceased emperor's burial.\\" Empress Dowager Li was angered, and she went to Liu Chengyou, stating to him, \\"These are the old and accomplished subjects of the state. Why are you listening to others and expelling them?\\" When Liu Chengyou blamed the matter on the chancellors in general, Li Tao took the blame by himself, and was relieved of his chancellor position.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. By late 950, Liu Chengyou himself had tired of the control the senior officials had on his government. He thereafter had Yang, Shi Hongzhao the commander of the imperial guards, and Wang Zhang the director of the financial agencies executed. Guo was, at that time, serving as the defender of Yedu, and therefore not killed, but Liu had Guo's family, as well as the family of Guo's assistant Wang Jun, slaughtered. When Guo thereafter rebelled and attacked Daliang, Empress Dowager Li lamented, \\"I did not accept Li Tao's words. Now we are facing destruction.\\" Thereafter, Liu tried to engage Guo in battle, but was killed in battle. Guo entered Daliang and, after persuading Empress Dowager Li that he would continue to treat her as a mother, she ordered that the throne be yielded to him. Guo took the throne and established Later Zhou. (Liu Zhiyuan's younger brother Liu Chong claimed the Later Han throne at Hedong, but his state is considered by traditional historians to be a new state known as Northern Han.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290.  During Later Zhou  Guo Wei gave Li Tao the title of Taizi Binke (太子賓客 — advisor to the Crown Prince, but completely honorary as a title as there was no crown prince at the time). In 952, Li Tao's brother Li Huan, having befriended Liao's military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), Xiao Haizhen (蕭海真, a brother-in-law to Emperor Jingzong), persuaded Xiao to consider submitting to Later Zhou. Xiao agreed. Li Huan thereafter wrote Li Tao a letter outlining his plans, pointing out that Emperor Jingzong lacked experience and ambition. Li Huan proposed that the Later Zhou government either immediately attack Liao (upon which Xiao would defect, allowing Later Zhou to obtain Lulong) or seek peace (upon which Liao would agree to a long- term peace treaty). The Later Zhou government, however, was preoccupied and unable to act on Li Huan's proposal. Later (during the reigns of Guo Wei and/or his adoptive son Guo Rong), Li Tao successively served as the minister of justice (刑部尚書, Xingbu Shangshu) and then minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu). In 959, when Guo Rong fell seriously ill and was considering naming additional chancellors to assist his young son Guo Zongxun, who would be succeeding him. When he inquired of this matter with the minister of defense Zhang Zhao (), Zhang recommended Li Tao, arguing that both Zhang's request to execute Zhang Yanze and his request to have Yang Bin and Guo Wei relieved of their duties showed foresight proper for a chancellor. However, Guo, despite acknowledging Zhang Zhao's arguments, refused, because he considered Li Tao's disposition to be frivolous and lacking in propriety.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 294. Upon Guo Rong's death later that year, Li was made the deputy director of the emperor's funereal matters. Guo Zongxun also created Li the Duke of Ju.  During Song  In 960, the major Later Zhou general Zhao Kuangyin overthrew Later Zhou and took the throne himself, establishing Song dynasty as its Emperor Taizu.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 1. In the new administration, Li Tao received the title of minister of defense (兵部尚書, Bingbu Shangshu). He fell ill in 961, when there was an incident that the army commander Yin Xun (), who was assigned to Xu Prefecture (許州, in modern Xuchang, Henan), was commanding a project to sift the Wuzhang Canal (); the conscripted man had a night terror event, and, in the aftermaths, Yin executed more than 10 crew leaders, and captured more than 70 men who fled and cut off their left ears. When a complaint was made to the emperor that this was undue cruel punishment, Li, despite his illness, got up and wrote a petition urging for Yin to be executed to avenge the people. When Li's family members pointed out that he was ill and should rest, he responded, \\"Death happens to everyone, and I cannot be spared of it. I hold the authority over the army; how can I not discuss a matter where an officer killed people unduly?\\" When the emperor received Li's report, he was appreciative of it, but on account of Yin's bravery and past accomplishments, only rebuked him.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 2. Li died shortly after (impliedly, in 961), and was given posthumous honors. (However, the biography of his brother Li Huan indicated that Li Huan died in 962 while still in Liao service and that Li Tao published a collection of Li Huan's writings, appearing to imply that Li Tao died after Li Huan, but not explicitly stating so, although it could also be read as that Li Tao published Li Huan's works sometime before.)

Owned by the city, the park spans an area of 58-acres (23 hectares), comprising three adjoining canyons of the Santa Ana foothills. It has an elevation range from 525 to 825 feet (160 to 251 m).,\\"Oak Canyon Trail Guide. Brochure. Anaheim Community Services\\". Retrieved March 3, 2017. and contains three major vegetation zones: coastal sage scrub, oak woodland and riparian. Open on weekends, the John J. Collier Interpretive Center features a museum with live animal and regional natural history exhibits. The center offers nature education programs and summer camp programs. Ecology =Precipitation= The annual precipitation average per rainfall year (July 1 to June 30) within a 20-year period between 1982 and 2002. Most of the precipitation occurs during the November–April rainy season. =Vegetation= The Oak Canyon ridge is covered in oak woodland on its northern side and coastal sage scrub habitat on its southern side. Due to the slope effect, the southern slope of the ridge is exposed to direct solar radiation. The consequent higher rate of evapotranspiration creates a dry, warm environment that favors drought-tolerant deciduous shrubs and herb. The exposed slope also favors low-growing plants with small leaves to avoid wind shear damage. Characteristic shrubs on the south slope include: California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), black sage (Salvia mellifera), and California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum).. Retrieved March 4, 2017 The north-facing slope of the canyon is shaded from the Sun's direct impact. The cooler environment has enough moisture to support dense oak woodland. The most commonly encountered trees are California live oak (Quercus agrifolia), California black walnut (Juglans californica) and western poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum). At the park's lower elevation, a year-round stream runs along the canyon foothill. The western sycamore (Platanus racemosa), cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and Wood duck (Aix sponsa) are restricted in range to this riparian habitat. =Soil characteristics= The soil on the southern slope consists of coarse sand and gravel. The poor water- retaining ability of this soil contributes to the dominance of drought- tolerant scrubs and pyrophyte plants. These xerophytes have shallow but extensive root network to rapidly absorb water from the soil. The soil from the north-facing slope is covered by a thick layer of leaf litter. This organic layer allows water retention by the soil and supports the growth of larger trees species. As the result, oak and other broadleaf outcompete scrubs on the north-facing slope. Activities Over 4 miles (6 km) of trails are available to hikers{http://www.anaheim.net/1096/Oak-Canyon-Nature-Center. Retrieved March 3, 2017 The trails range from flat to moderate incline.

Zumbo (born 1966) is an applied mathematician (psychometrician and mathematical psychologist) working primarily in the psychological, social and health sciences. He is currently Professor and Distinguished University Scholar, the Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Psychometrics and Measurement, and the Paragon UBC Professor of Psychometrics & Measurement at University of British Columbia. He is known for his contributions in the fields of statistics, psychometrics, validity theory, and studies of the mathematical basis of classical test theory and measurement error models. He currently teaches in the graduate Measurement, Evaluation, & Research Methodology Program with additional appointment in the Institute of Applied Mathematics, and earlier also in the Department of Statistics, at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Prior to arriving at UBC in 2000, he held professorships in the Departments of Psychology and of Mathematics at the University of Northern British Columbia (1994-2000), and earlier in the Faculty of Education with adjunct appointment in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Ottawa (1990-1994).  Biography  Bruno Domenico Zumbo was born to Italian parents from Calabria and was raised in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Zumbo's parents immigrated from Pellaro, Reggio di Calabria to Prince Rupert, British Columbia, then Edmonton, Alberta. Before immigrating to Canada post war, his father and mother carried on a long tradition of olive oil and wine-making, and small-scale terrace farming of grapes, olives, bergamot oranges, and figs in the hillsides of southern Calabria. Although he excelled and competed as an olympic weightlifter, his passions were always mathematics, romance languages (Italian and French), and philosophy. He speaks English and Italian (including the Calabrese dialect), and reads English, Italian and French. He has a twin sister and four other siblings. He completed his B.Sc. at the University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB) and his MA and Ph.D. from Carleton University (Ottawa, ON). His studies reflected his curiosity and diverse interests. With an eye to fostering his talents and interests, the University of Alberta allowed him to take graduate (Masters and PhD) courses in statistics and mathematics while eventually completing his B.Sc. in Psychology. Likewise, in graduate school his professors allowed him to pursue and integrate mathematics, philosophy of science and Psychology. His interests continue to be focused on scientific methodology with a blend of mathematics, social sciences like Psychology, philosophy of science and measurement in science. His doctoral dissertation titled \\"Statistical Methods to Overcome Nonindependence of Coupled Data in Significance Testing\\" was under the direction of Prof. Donald W. Zimmerman (Carleton University, Ottawa). Program of research Professor Zumbo is an internationally renowned applied statistician/mathematician, measurement theorist, and research methodologist. His program of research has had wide influence in psychometrics, validity theory, educational and behavioral statistics, and language testing. * Over the last nearly 30 years his interdisciplinary program of research has emerged to have broad interdisciplinary impact and as such is well-recognized in a variety of disciplines including psychometrics and measurement, statistics, language testing, educational research, quality of life and well being, health and human development. * His research has branched to many areas in statistics, measurement, and scientific methodology. He takes a problem-solving point of view to his research in that the research is not tied to any one area of statistics or measurement. His interests in mathematics focused mostly in analysis (e.g., real analysis, measure theory, metric spaces), with some secondary interests in applications of number theory, abstract algebra and linear algebra. He continues to learn and integrate new ideas and areas of mathematics (and philosophy) as necessary to solve a new scientific problem. * As is evident from the list of publications and awards, his program of research is noted for his having addressed cross-disciplinary recurring controversial topics such as theories of measurement validity, measurement invariance, the role of levels (or scales) of measurement in statistics, and the role of hypothesis testing in empirical studies and particularly their lack of robustness to violations of assumptions. His contributions to these debates have highlighted his orientation from the intersection of mathematics, measurement and statistical science with consideration given to philosophy of science and scientific methodology. * His program of research is actively engaged in psychometrics for language testing, quality of life and wellbeing, and health and human development. This applied work, in the end, feeds his basic program of research in research methodology and measurement.

Grubb is an American physician, researcher and scientist, currently a Distinguished University Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at the University of Toledo. He is well known for his contributions to the study of syncope and disorders of the autonomic nervous system (in particular Postural Tachycardia Syndrome) (3).  History and Career  Dr. Grubb was born in Baltimore, Maryland on January 21, 1954 and grew up in the then rural Carroll County of Maryland. The son of an electrician, Dr Grubb began working full- time as an electrician and sign maker starting at the age of 14 years and continued to do so until his early twenties. He graduated from South Carroll High School in 1972, and later earned a BA in Biologic Sciences from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in 1976. He earned a Medical degree from the Universidad Central del Este in the Dominican Republic in 1980. He then completed a medical residency at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, where he also served as chief medical resident. While doing a rotation in cardiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital he became interested in cardiac electrophysiology after watching some of the first human defibrillator implants. He thereafter completed fellowships in both cardiology and clinical cardiac electrophysiology at the Pennsylvania State University's Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania(4). Grubb then joined the faculty of the Medical College of Ohio (later renamed the University of Toledo Medical Center) as an Assistant Professor of Medicine in 1988 where he initiated the institution's cardiac electrophysiology program. He became an Associate Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics in 1993, and was elevated to a full Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics in 1999. Dr. Grubb is widely known for his research into the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of syncope. He was among the first researchers in the United States to employ head upright tilt table testing for the diagnosis of vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) syncope. He is also widely considered one of the world's leading experts on Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and orthostatic hypotension. Dr. Grubb has also pioneered new wound closure techniques designed to reduce infection rates and enhance wound appearance during permanent pacemaker and implantable defibrillator surgeries. His current focus of research is in exploring the role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of POTS and other autonomic disorders. He has authored over 250 peer reviewed scientific papers and 34 book chapters. He is co-editor of the textbook Syncope: Mechanisms and Management and the author of the book The Fainting Phenomenon. He was a Senior Editor of the journal Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiologyfor 25 years. He is currently the Director of the Cardiac Electrophysiology Program and the Syncope and Autonomic Disorders Clinic at the University of Toledo Medical Center in Toledo, Ohio. Dr. Grubb has also published numerous essays on his experiences as a physician and patient, a collection of which were published as a book entitled The Calling(5). He has also published a number of poems. Dr. Grubb achieved the rank of Eagle in Boy Scouts, and earned varsity athletic letters in both high school and college. He has also received numerous awards throughout his career and received UMBC's Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1994, and was elected to the Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) medical honor society in 1997. Dr. Grubb was presented with the Northwest Ohio American Heart Associations' \\"Legacy of Achievement\\" Award in 2001. He was named as a Distinguished University Professor by the University of Toledo in 2009. He was given the Leonard Tow Humanism in Medicine Award in 2006. He received the University's Dean's Award for Career Achievement in 2016 as well as the University's Outstanding Research and Scholarship Award in 2017. Dr. Grubb received Dysautonomia International's \\"Physician of the Year\\" Award in 2015(6,7,8). That same year the British Arrhythmia Alliance named him \\"Medical Professional of the Decade\\"(9). Also in 2015 he was recognized by the Ohio State Senate for outstanding research and clinical practice naming him \\"One of Ohio's finest citizens\\". In 2017 he received the Dion D. Raftopoulos/Sigma Xi Honor Society Award for outstanding original research. In 2018 he was given the University of Toledo's President's Award for Outstanding Contributions in Scholarship and Creative Activity. In 2019 he received the \\"Revolutionary Researcher Award\\" by the Dysautonomia Support Network. Dr Grubb has been recognized as one of \\"America's Top Doctors\\" for 20 years in a row. He is a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology and a Fellow of the American Heart Association as well as a member of the Heart Rhythm Society. He was married to the late Dr. Barbara Straus for 38 years(10). He is currently married to Dena Eber PhD. He has two children, Helen and Alex, and one step daughter, Margaret.

It was broadcast from September 2000 to September 2007. Carla Estrada and Reynaldo Lopez participated in the production. The program starred comedians such as: Consuelo Duval, Miguel Galvan, Adrian Uribe, Lorena de la Garza, Gustavo Munguia (since 2001), Reynaldo Rossano (2001 to 2005), Javier Carranza “El Costeno” (since 2004), Ariel Manzano (since 2005) and Ricardo Hill (2001 to 2003). At the beginning of its broadcast, it was hosted by Andres Garcia and Jaime Camil. History At the beginning of the series models such as Jazmin, Ivonne and Sabelle participated. In April 2001, Jazmin was replaced by Marian, who remained a model from April 2001 to the last showing in September 2007. Then, in early 2002, the show decided to replace Sabelle with Sabrina. From then on, Ivonne, Marian and Sabrina were the models from 2002 to early 2005, because in early January 2005, Sabrina had to leave the country. For this reason, the show was left with Ivonne and Marian as models from January to May 2005. In June, the show found another model, Paola, to take Sabrina’s place. Since then, Ivonne, Marian and Paola were the models until the last episode in September 2007. Before the next sketch starts, the models would appear dancing sexy in bikinis or other skimpy outfits (such as angels, policewoman, nurses, cheerleaders etc..) while also revealing cleavage. They would also usually make cameo appearances in sketches, sometimes having lines. When the whole cast went to Acapulco in a couple episodes during season 3, the models appeared on the beach, dancing in full on bikini. Beginning in 2001, the program no longer had a set host, and was replaced by stellar guests in each broadcast, among those include \\"Resortes\\", \\"India Maria\\", Silvia Pinal, Lucía Méndez, Héctor Suárez, María Victoria, Eugenio Derbez, Kuno Becker, among many other great stars of the world of Cinema, Television and Sport. Originally, the show was transmitted by “Canal de las Estrellas” on Thursdays, taking place of the show “Picardía Mexicana” as part of Televisa’s comedy bar. During the time that the show aired, it underwent many schedule changes: Initially, it was broadcast at 10:00 pm., later at 11:00 pm. In 2002, when the comedy bar titled, “Nos Vemos a las 10”, it was once again broadcast at 10:00 pm, being the only show to have remained on the comedy bar from 2002 to 2005. That same year, it began to be airing on Saturdays around 7:00 pm. Finally, in 2007, it was broadcast Friday nights at 8:00 pm. La Hora Pico was formed from a series of sketches and gags from all different kinds of humors: black humor, urban, white, double meanings, and puns. The sketches were specially prepared and according to the characteristics of each of the guests, without ridiculing, offending or mocking his person. Only comical situations were proposed in which the public enjoyed its star in another facet of his career. All these elements resulted in an entertaining and humorous program for the whole family. La Hora Pico addressed issues of universal and topical interest.

The Battle of Länkipohja was a Finnish Civil War battle fought in the village of Länkipohja (now part of the Jämsä municipality) on 16 March 1918 between the Whites and the Reds. Together with the battles fought in Kuru, Ruovesi and Vilppula between 15 and 18 March, the Battle of Länkipohja was one the first military operations related to the Battle of Tampere, which was the decisive battle of the Finnish Civil War. The battle is known for its bloody aftermath as the Whites executed 70–100 capitulated Reds. One of the executions was photographed and the images have become one of the best known pictures of the Finnish Civil War.  Background  The village of Länkipohja is located by the Tampere–Jyväskylä highway, 60 kilometers northeast of Tampere which was the main base for Red Guards on the Tavastia Front. The Reds took control in Länkipohja in 10 February. It was one of the northernmost areas occupied by the Reds. Their intention was to proceed to the town of Jyväskylä in Central Finland and reach the Haapamäki–Jyväskylä and Jyväskylä–Pieksämäki railways. As the Whites launched their offensive against Tampere, Länkipohja's location was strategically important as the village closed the way to the town. Preceding clashes occurred in 12 March, as 360 men of the Red Guards from Urjala, Jämsä and Hämeenlinna attacked to the village of Eväjärvi, 9 kilometres north of Länkipohja, but the offense failed. At the same time, a White Guard unit from Kuortane invaded Länkipohja from the east. They were pushed back as the Reds returned from Eväjärvi. Several Reds were killed and the local Red commander Vihtori Hurri was severely wounded, but the Whites had no fatalities.  Battle  As the White Army launched their major offensive against Tampere, their plan was to take Länkipohja, then attack Orivesi 25 kilometres west of Länkipohja and cut the Tampere–Haapamäki railway. The White troops were commanded by the colonel K. F. Wilkman. The 2,500-men regiment was divided into three battalions which were led by the major Torsten Aminoff, rittmeister Oskar Wilkman and captain Aarne Heikinheimo. They were supported by an artillery battery commanded by the Swedish volunteer Nils Palme and a reserve battalion under the command of the major Sixten Öberg. The number of Red Guard fighters in Länkipohja is unknown, but most likely there was about 1,000 Reds. The Swedish count Archibald Douglas, who fought for the Whites, estimated about 2,000 fighters. According to the Red commander Vihtori Hurri, a couple of days before the battle the number of Reds was only 552. The Red Guards came from the nearby villages of Längelmäki, Jämsä and Orivesi, and from the southern Finland from Urjala, Hämeenlinna, Tuusula, Kerava, Mäntsälä, Espoo and Helsinki. The Helsinki Red Guard had sent its famous A-komppania (the ″A Company″). It was one of the Red elite units, composed of strength sports athletes and gymnasts. The Reds were aware of the oncoming offensive. For example, the newspaper Työmies wrote a day before how the Whites had gathered their troops in the Länkipohja area. In the night before the battle, a large number of civilians fled the village. The Reds had built their main defensive line to the Hirsikangas Hill, two kilometres north of Länkipohja. They had brought down a large number of trees, then piled the cut logs on the both sides of the road and soaked them with water. In the below zero temperature, the stacks of wood were now covered by thick ice. The structure extended more than 50 meters on both sides of the road. As the trees in the slopes were cut, the attacking Whites had to cross a wide open ground covered in deep snow. Executed Reds in Vilkkilä after the battle. The Whites attacked Länkipohja from three directions; rittmeister Wilkman from north, major Aminoff from east and captain Heikinheimo from west. The white offensive was launched at 7 AM with heavy artillery fire. The bombing destroyed several buildings in both Länkipohja and the nearby village of Vilkkilä where the Heikiheimo battalion was to strike. Most of the Reds remained in the village, the defensive post in the Hirsikangas Hill was occupied with only 80 fighters of the Tuusula and Helsinki Red Guards. The Urjala Red Guard was placed behind them, while the rest were ensuring the eastern and western sides. The Aminoff battalion, which attacked from east, was stopped in a less than an hour as well as the Heikinheimo battalion in Vilkkilä, two kilometres west of Länkipohja. The Wilkman battalion attacking the main defensive line was forced to retreat at 10 AM. With the help of Öhman reserves, Wilkman soon launched a new offensive and finally reached the Red positions. The battle was now fought with bayonets and knives and the outnumbered Reds were forced to retreat. The wounded Reds remaining in the defensive posts were killed. As the Red defense collapsed, Wilkman was now able to enter Länkipohja, only to be hit by their own men as the Aminoff battalion mistook them for Reds. Finally the Whites took the village at 3 PM as the Reds fled south across the frozen lake Längelmävesi. After Länkipohja was lost, the only remaining Reds were now the 300 fighters of Tuusula Red Guard who were still resisting in Vilkkilä. The Wilkman battalion attacked from their rear and the battle was over in the late afternoon. Most of the Reds managed to flee, but about 100 surrendered believing that they were treated like prisoners of war. However, all the surrendered Reds were executed. Leander Viljanen, the commander of the Tuusula Red Guard, hid from the Whites and committed suicide the next day. A White firing squad executes Red prisoners (photo taken by Harald Netvig).  Executions and casualties  The executions started immediately as the fighting ceased. They were carried out by the battalions of Oskar Wilkman and Sixten Öberg. The firing squads were led by the Jäger officers Bjarne Wegelius and Jarl Wegelius. The number of executed is estimated between 70 and 100, including several local civilians. The number of Reds killed in the battle is estimated 20–60. The White casualties were 37 men, including two Swedish volunteers.  Natvig photographs  The battle was photographed by the Norwegian Red Cross medic Harald Natvig. His images on the Finnish Civil War are featured in the book Fra den finske frihedskrig 1918: Vestarméen, published in late 1918. In Länkipohja, Natvig also took a series of three photographs on the execution of 13 surrendered Red Guard fighters, who were found hiding in basement and shot on 17 March. The first image shows the firing squad preparing for the execution, the second shows the Red Guard fighters being hit by bullets, and the last one shows a White officer giving a death blow to a suffering victim. The last two images of the series are some of the best-known images of the Finnish Civil War.  Commemoration  The memorial of the fallen Whites was erected in 1938 by the Hirsikangas Hill. Next to the present-day National road 9 is the memorial of two killed Whites, father Matti Laurila and son Ilmari Laurila. Fallen and executed Reds were buried to a mass grave by the Längelmäki Church. The memorial was erected in 1946.

He has been a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea since 2002, representing the electorate of Unggai-Bena Open, variously as an independent (2002) and for the United Resources Party (2002-2012) and People's National Congress (2012-present). He has been Minister for Lands and Physical Planning in the government of Peter O'Neill since August 2012. Allan previously served as Minister for Environment and Conservation under Michael Somare from 2007 to 2011. Allan was educated at Goroka High School, Lae Technical College and Goroka Teachers College. He was a high school teacher before leaving to work in the private sector, managing liquor distribution company Negiso Distributors. He was elected to the National Parliament as an independent at the 2002 election, after which he joined the United Resources Party. He served in the opposition shadow ministry under Mekere Morauta from February until May 2005 when he crossed over to the government, becoming a parliamentary secretary in June 2005. He was re-elected at the 2007 election as a URP candidate, after which he was appointed Minister for Environment and Conservation by Prime Minister Michael Somare. Allan was an advocate for addressing climate change in this capacity, telling the United States at the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference \\"if for some reason you are not willing to lead, leave it to the rest of us and please get out of the way\\". In February 2008, he stated that three foreign firms had attempted to bribe him with free travel in order to fast-track approvals for their investments. In April 2008, he announced that no further exploration licenses along the historically sensitive Kokoda Track would be approved while the Somare government was in power. In April 2009, he proposed a national ban on the use of plastic bags. In April 2010, Allan defended controversial laws which sought to protect development projects from delays caused by environmental challenges by preventing departmental approvals from being challenged in court, which had been criticised by some lawyers and human rights organisations as \\"draconian\\". In May 2011, in his electorate capacity, he advocated for a total ban on liquor sales in the Eastern Highlands Province. In May 2011, he was one of several government ministers to switch to the opposition and bring down the Somare government, resulting in the election of Opposition Leader Peter O'Neill as Prime Minister. Allan was re-elected for the People's National Congress at the 2012 election, having crossed to the new governing party led by O'Neill. He was subsequently appointed Minister for Lands and Physical Planning in O'Neill's post-election reshuffle. He faced significant ongoing concerns in this role around corruption in relation to the distribution of land titles. In October 2012, he moved to have the Lands Department collect more than K94 million (US$45 million) in unpaid state land rents. In March 2013, he announced an investigation into land deals alleged to have been fraudulently acquired across the country. Under Allan, the department subsequently undertook an audit of the extent of land that is under state lease and land under customary tenure in the National Capital District, with the intent to do the same nationally, in order to settle widespread confusion about legal land ownership. In October 2013, he proposed restricting land ownership to Papua New Guineans, with foreign investors to be required to partner with local entrepreneurs. In March 2017, he refused to revoke a subset of leases that had previously been found to be largely fraudulently obtained, and in the face of public controversy resolved to instead convert them to registered land.

She served as an ocean escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. Background The ship was ordered on 19 September 1939 from Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The ship's keel was laid on 22 May 1940,Lynch, p. 98 and the ship was launched on 2 September. The ship was commissioned about one month later, on 18 October.Friedman, p. 340 War Service On 21 November 1940, Rhododendron, part of the escort for Convoy OB244, attacked the German U-Boat U-103 with depth charges, helping to drive the submarine away from the convoy. Although U-103 escaped unscathed, this attack led to the incorrect claim that Rhododendron had sunk U-104. That same day, she picked up 36 survivors from the merchant ship Daydawn, which earlier that day had been sunk by U-103. At the beginning of 1941, Rhododendron was part of the 8th Escort Group. On 17 January 1941, she detonated a mine in Liverpool harbor, knocking out her engines and steering gear and causing minor structural damage. Rhododendron was under repair at Liverpool for three months. On 28 July 1941, she picked up 26 survivors from the Lapland, a merchant ship which was torpedoed by U-203. On 1 October 1941, Rhododendron was part of the 36th Escort Group, based at Liverpool. In November 1942, the British and Americans landed in French North Africa in Operation Torch, with Rhododendron helping to escort one of the convoys carrying invasion forces from Britain to the Centre Task Force beaches at Arzew near Oran in Algeria on 9 November. On 4 July 1943, she picked up more than 300 survivors from several merchant ships which were torpedoed by German submarines U-409 and U-375 off of Algeria. Fate She was sold in 1950 to a shipping company, where she was turned into the merchant Maj Finke. She was sold for demolition in South Africa in 1968.

She served as the founding and honorary Secretary of the Bird-Ringing Committee in 1937 and continued to work on ringing until 1963. Born in Plymouth, the younger daughter of Sir Edward Pemberton Leach, Elsie grew up in well-connected family that moved across the United Kingdom. From an early age she was introduced into outdoors pursuits, riding, fishing and hunting. An interest in birds was sparked off through her friendship with Emma Louisa Turner which led to a meeting with H. F. Witherby in 1930. At that time Witherby was working on the establishment of a marking scheme for British Birds and she took responsibility for the Ringing Scheme in 1937. Her skills at ringing and care in maintaining records were well known and her memory and ability to recall recoveries helped in her work. She compiled recovery records and produced annual reports from 1938 and went on to produce them until 1951. She retired in 1953 but continued to work on ringing until 1963 when the ringing office shifted to Tring. Her work was recognized by the award of the Bernard Tucker Medal and she was made Member of the Order of the British Empire.

History From 1709 the board of admiralty usually had a minimum of two Civil Lord Commissioners, however, there was not a settled arrangement for the distribution of duties amongst the members of the Board. In 1805 the First Lord of the Admiralty Charles Middleton, the Lord Barham, began a period of reform of the commissioners responsibilities during his tenure. He initially gave a new name to the Naval Lord Commissioners now referred to as \\"Professional Naval Lords\\", whilst the Civil Lords were given the duty of signing off all official documents. In 1830 when Sir James Graham was appointed First Lord he also underwent further re- organising of the board following the abolition of the Navy Board each of the members were given particular responsibility for different areas of naval administration from this year it was fixed in principle that, other than the First Lord, there should be four Naval Lords; and one Civil Lord who was added in 1832. This arrangement was subject to minor variations. In 1834-5 there were three Naval and two Civil Lords. Between 1830 and 1868 he had main responsibility for Naval Finance, this however changed when Parliamentary Secretary was re-designated the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary. In January 1869 the civil lord through an order in Order in Council was designated an assistant to the First Lord of the Admiralty. These orders usually had a much wider remit in that they outlined the general regulations of governance of the Naval Service. In March 1872 another order in council was issued this time the civil lord would have specific duties assigned to them by the First Lord defining on this occasion the structure of the board. In 1874 the civil lord was given much wider powers. Exceptional changes to these rules meant that during wartime periods additional civil lords (though not officially styled so until after 1882) were added to the board to ease the burden of workload on the Civil Lord. The office existed until 1964 when the Admiralty was abolished and replaced by the Navy Department within a new Ministry of Defence. Responsibilities The Civil Lord assisted the First Lord in political and parliamentary duties, between 1830 and 1964 his remit changed from time to time but generally included the following responsibilities: * Deal with all special questions relating to the retirements, pay, and allowances of naval and marine officers and men. * Direct Civil Engineering Works. * Manage all Admiralty buildings including repairs and the construction as well as the storing of building materials that were within the Works Department. * Manage business within the Greenwich Hospital Department. * Manage compassionate allowances, the admiralty charitable fund, the allowances to ministers of religion, the various Dockyard and Marine Schools. * Manage leasing arrangements in regards to coastguard stations. * Superintendence of all Admiralty works and labour services. * Superintend all civilian staff at naval establishments, including: classifications, appointments, promotions, pay, allowances, and pensions, excluding appointments and promotions in London, and of professional officers of the Controller's Department of Dockyards. * Superintends the Contracts Department. * Superintends the Department of the Accountant General of the Navy. (in 1932 this department is abolished its financial functions were merged within the Department of the Permanent Secretary.
