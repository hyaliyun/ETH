He founded the French branch of the Erlanger banking businesses, Emile Erlanger & Co. Biography Frédéric Émile, Baron d'Erlanger was born to banker Raphael Erlanger and his young wife, Margarete Helene Albert (1800–1834). Raphael was the son of a Frankfurt currency broker, Löb Moses, later named Ludwig Moritz Erlanger (b. 1780; d. 1857). Raphael Erlanger had begun as a disponent in the Frankfurt business of the Rothschild family. In 1848 he founded his own bank, named Erlanger & Söhne (Erlanger & Sons) in 1865, and became a major competitor to the Rothschild banks in Frankfurt, Vienna and Paris. In 1859, Raphael Erlanger was created a Portuguese Baron by Pedro V of Portugal, he also was ennobled as von Erlanger by the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen in 1860, and elevated to the rank of a baron, together with his whole family, by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1871. Just prior the birth of his oldest child Susanne Adolphine (1829–1873), Raphael Erlanger converted from Judaism to Christianity for his wife's sake. Susanne eventually married the Frankfurt merchant Franz Josef Carl Langenberger (1821–1878) who became a partner in the bank. As the eldest son, Friedrich Emil Erlanger became involved in extensive banking and bill transactions early in life. By age 19, he was so successful with his father in the brokerage business that he was appointed Consul General and fiscal agent at Paris by the Greek Government under Otto I. He visited the royal court in Stockholm and was involved in successful Swedish and Portuguese state financial negotiations. Ferdinand II of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, as a ruler for his son King Pedro of Portugal, ennobled his father Raphael as a hereditary Portuguese Baron in order to thank Friedrich Emil, who would eventually inherit the title, for his services. Raphael was subsequently granted titles by the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and the Austrian Empire, who named him a hereditary baron and awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph. In 1853 Frederick Emil fell ill and withdrew from business activities. In order to restore his health, he began to conduct travelers to Greece and Egypt. Here he met the Suez Canal planner Lesseps and became fascinated by the idea of the Canal. After his recovery, he became a partner of his father's Frankfurt bank, Erlanger & Sons. First marriage On 30 June 1858, Frederick Emil Erlanger married a young Parisian socialite, Florence Louise Odette Lafitte (1840–1931). Her grandfather, Jacques Laffitte, was a banker, governor of the Bank of France, Finance Minister, and Prime Minister of France temporarily. In 1859, d'Erlanger officially took over the business of the banking house in Paris. He changed his name and was afterwards called Frédéric Émile Baron d'Erlanger. His marriage failed, however. The couple had no children and they divorced in December 1862. Second marriage On 3 October 1864, Baron d'Erlanger married the American Marguerite Mathilde Slidell (1842–1927), the daughter of the influential American lawyer, businessman and politician John Slidell (1793–1871). Slidell was the Ambassador of the Confederate States of America at the court of Emperor Napoleon III. His wife, Maria Deslonde Mathilde, was from an influential Creole family whose ancestors emigrated from Brest, France, in the seventeenth century. D'Erlanger met his second wife in New Orleans during a trip to America. She grew up on the prosperous plantation Belle Pointe in Laplace, Louisiana, 25 miles (40 km) west of New Orleans. Later, she moved with her family to Paris, where she and her sister received great attention because of their extraordinary beauty. Her sister Marie Rosine married Comte de Saint- Roman. D'Erlanger and his wife built a villa situated in the affluent 16th Arrondissement of Paris that still exists today. The access roads to the villa, \\"Villa Erlanger\\" and \\"Rue Erlanger,\\" are named in his honor. In 1870, shortly before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, the family moved to London. The headquarters of the banking house moved there from Paris as well. D'Erlanger resided at 139 Piccadilly in London, the former home of Lord Byron. The German-born baron and all his family members became British citizens. He was authorized to use his foreign titles of nobility, despite some strong opposition at first. The couple had four children. Raphael Slidell d'Erlanger (1865–1897) was a zoologist and professor at Heidelberg. Baron Emile Beaumont d'Erlanger (1866–1939) later successfully took over the bank's management. Baron Frédéric Alfred d'Erlanger (1868–1943) became a banker, but later acquired acclaim as a composer. François Rodolphe d'Erlanger (1872–1932) was a musicologist and painter whose palace, Ennejma Ezzahra in Sidi Bou Said, Tunisia, now houses the Centre des Musiques Arabes et Méditerranéennes. The latter's son Leo Alfred Frédéric d'Erlanger (1898–1978) eventually became the head of the family-owned bank. Career Baron d'Erlanger was one of the leading bankers of Paris, the dominant financial center of continental Europe in the second half of the 19th Century. He invented high-risk bonds, especially for developing countries. Towards the end of the 1850ies, Erlanger was able to terminate a banking crisis in Sweden with his bonds; since he became banker of Scandinavian governments. In 1862 Erlanger & Sons issued the first Egyptian government bond, together with the Frankfurt bank Sulzbach brothers, namely Siegmund Sulzbach de (1813–1876) and Rudolf Sulzbach de (1827–1904), with whom he also worked together on railroad bonds. He invested in railroads and mines in Africa, North America, South America, and Europe, as well as Russian and Tunisian government bonds and Southern cotton during the American Civil War. Other than most German and European banks he bet on the southern states during the American Civil War. In the late 1870ies Erlanger invested in the British enterprise Alabama Great Southern Railway Company Limited which funded the takeover of Alabama Great Southern Railway and Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway (CNO&TP;). This railroad net, also known as „Erlanger System“, consisted of over 1,100 miles. He also financed the Swiss Simplon Tunnels between the Valais and Aosta Valley, then the largest railway tunnel in Europe. In 1884 Erlanger accompanied the IPO of the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways. In 1870 he saved the House of Thurn und Taxis after the crash of Belgian speculator André Langrand- Dumonceau. The Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga, Tennessee Along with Paul Julius Reuter (1816–1899), the founder of Reuters news agency, his bank, Erlanger Ltd., funded the construction of a French transatlantic telegraph cable in 1869. His wife, Mathilde, Baroness d'Erlanger, sent the historic first message. In 1889, during an inspection tour of their American railroad investments, the couple created the d'Erlanger Grant for start-up capital to build a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It is known today as the „Erlanger Health System“. Erlanger, Kentucky was named to honor the d'Erlangers' financial contributions. In 1904 however, the Erlangers sold their Frankfurt branch to Dresdner Bank and concentrated on their French and British branches. The main reason may have been the early deaths of Ludwig Gottlieb Friedrich von Erlanger (1836–1898), Viktor Alexander von Erlanger (1840–1896) and Carlo von Erlanger (1872–1904). Yet competition by big trading banks may have contributed, just as relocation of banks to Berlin and stricter stock exchange legislation. Culture As music lovers and influential members of the haute bourgeoisie who had personal relationships with the leaders of many countries, they promoted Richard Wagner and his music, including the first performance of Tannhäuser at the Paris Opera after the Franco-Prussian War. D'Erlanger also donated several art works, including the seventeenth-century allegorical tapestries depicting the Duke of Alba to the Hampton Court Palace of the British crown. The d'Erlangers also funded the rescue of the murals from the Quinta del Sordo in 1873. This house, which they bought, was temporarily residence of Francisco de Goya. Goya's Pinturas Negras were costly to save from destruction. These \\"black paintings\\" that Goya painted directly on plaster, were gently transferred to canvas. After their lack of public acceptance at the Paris Exposition of 1878. These works were given to the Prado in Madrid two years later. In Italy, the d'Erlangers leased Villa Foscari, the famous mansion built in the seventeenth century by Andrea Palladio, and commissioned restoration work. Frédéric Emile, Baron d'Erlanger died in Versailles on 22 May 1911. His second son, Baron Emile Beaumont d'Erlanger, had previously succeeded him in the management of the bank.

Martin. \\"The Promise of Institutionalist Theory\\" International Security. Vol. 20 No. 1. p. 39. Terminology Some call the school of thought rational functionalism instead of liberal institutionalism. Liberal institutionalism is also close to—but not synonymous with—regime theory and neoliberalism.David Baldwin (1993) Neorealism and Neoliberalism: The Contemporary Debate.

New York: Columbia University Press, p. 273. Keohane dislikes using the adjectives \\"liberal\\" or \\"neoliberal\\" to describe his work because he also draws from realism, a school of thought that is often contrasted with liberalism.Robert Keohane (1984). After Hegemony: Power and Discord in the World Political Economy. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 14.Robert Keohane (1993). Institutional Theory and the Realist Challenge after the Cold War. In \\"Neorealism and Neoliberalism: The Contemporary Debate,\\" edited by David A. Baldwin, 269–300. New York: Columbia University Press, p. 272. Liberal institutionalism differs from other common international relations theories like realism in the fact that it does not ignore internal politics. Furthermore, institutional liberalism follows the idea that democracy and capitalism create systems which not only maintain peace but also create beneficial economic opportunities for those involved. Liberal institutionalists believe that democracies naturally lead to peace because the many govern and not the few, and therefore those who decide to go to war will be the many that serve. This is in stark contrast to monarchies and dictatorships that are more warlike due to the fact that the few that do not serve will go to war. Beyond that liberal institutionalists defend capitalism on an international scale because they believe that if two nations are friendly, democratic, and capitalist the two nations will inevitably negotiate mutually beneficial trade deals.

It was considered a prominent stream. Buck Creek is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed June 3, 2011 stream in Pushmataha County, Oklahoma. It flows generally southward from its headwaters in the western Kiamichi Mountains to its confluence with the Kiamichi River. Description Buck Creek rises in southern Pittsburg County and proceeds southwest into the McGee Valley in Atoka County. Turning east, it runs into Buck Creek Mountain and turns south, entering Pushmataha County. The creek cuts through several water gaps, first between White Rock Mountain and Horsehead Mountain, then between White Rock Mountain and Big Mountain, and finally between Parker Mountain and Little Mountain just before its confluence with the Kiamichi. The creek is spring-fed along its entire length, ensuring a minimal and steady flow of water year-round. For much of its course it flows through a narrow, steeply-sided, winding valley. Due to the numerous ravines and smaller creeks which feed it, Buck Creek rises rapidly during heavy rains. Its principal tributaries are Kimbrough, Little Kimbrough and Horsehead creeks.Oklahoma Atlas & Gazetteer Spectacular formations of boulders, many of them as large as houses or buildings, line portions of the Buck Creek valley. History Buck Creek played a role during the Civil War as a camp, southwest of Fort Smith, for Confederate forces under General Douglas H. Cooper during an incident known as \\"Marston's Skirmish. In August 1864, Cooper detached Captain B.W. Marston, Acting Adjutant-General, with Captain Samuel H. Gunter of Stand Watie’s Cherokee troops, and four other men to cross the Arkansas River and reconnoiter Federal forces north of the river. The men swam across the river, where they captured some Federal weapons, horses and money. Then they swam back across the Arkansas and reported back to Cooper's camp.Oklahoma Civil War Sesquicentennial. Marston's Skirmish. Retrieved October 18, 2013. During the years following the 1880s, when the region was opened to development by the arrival of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway—whose track crossed Buck Creek at its mouth on the Kiamichi River—its valley provided a route into the mountains and was used by loggers. Extensive logging took place throughout the creek watershed, and its timber was brought down to the railroad via a railroad tram constructed up the creek valley. Floods did great damage to the tram, and it was eventually closed. Until construction of Oklahoma State Highway 2, which bridged the stream, Buck Creek was a serious impediment to overland transportation in the Kiamichi River valley. A low- water ford was used, but was unreliable and unsafe due to frequent floods or other periods of high water. Proposed dams The Oklahoma Water Resources Board has in past contemplated building a flood-control dam on Buck Creek, but those plans no longer appear under active consideration, particularly since construction of dams impounding Jack’s Fork Creek for Sardis Lake and the lower Kiamichi River (Hugo Lake). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers more recently studied the idea of damming several tributaries of the river below Sardis Lake—Buck Creek, Ten Mile Creek, Pine Creek and Cedar Creek—to better regulate and restore the river’s health and temperature. Given fiscal restraints and public sentiment—which no longer favors construction of dams—no activity is anticipated.

However, the theory does not propose that democracies are more peaceful than non-democracies, as many democracies are engaged in wars with non-democracies. The theory holds that the reason for this intra-democratic peace is rooted in the regime type of these countries (democracy) and the existence of similar domestic political cultures, common moral values, economic cooperation and interdependence.Jackson, Robert and Georg Sorensen (2006), Introduction to International Relations: theories and approaches, Oxford, OUP, 3ed, p111  Kantian liberalism  The issue of war and peace has been a very important political issue since the birth of armed conflicts as a \\"universal norm in human history\\". In particular, the 20th century turning into the nuclear age, leading to increased threats. The question then becomes, what can we do to ensure that the world is at peace, rather than at war and is it possible in this current climate? Liberal theories in terms of international relations attempt to explain how both peace and co-operation are possible. Perpetual peace is a reference in world affairs where peace is established permanently. The idea of perpetual peace was made famous by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant in his essay called \\"Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch\\" (1795). On the other hand, realism tells us that international communities are in chaos. Realism focus on dominance and \\"explains international relations in terms of power\\". Modern realist theory was created as a reaction to the liberal theory which scholars of realism called idealism. Idealism is the middle ground between realist and liberal theory. Idealism emphasizes international law, morality and international organizations rather than the concept of power alone. Another issue when it comes to the study of war and crises is \\"scholars seeking to understand them [wars and crises] focus much more on these events than in the situations of peace\\". Kant and the liberal school of thought state that international co- operation is a more rational option for states than resorting to war. However, the neo-liberal approach concedes to the realist school of thought since the realist believes that states achieve co-operation fairly often because it is in the best interest of the state.  The definitive articles of perpetual peace  Kant offers three definitive articles to make permanent peace function, each of which has become a dominant strain of post–World War II liberal international relations theory. :I \\"The Civil Constitution of Every State should be Republican\\" :II \\"The Law of Nations shall be founded on a Federation of Free States\\" :III \\"The Law of World Citizenship shall be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality\\"  I: \\"The Civil Constitution of Every State should be Republican\\"  Kant explains that \\"The Civil Constitution of Every State should be Republican.\\" When he says that every state should be republican, we need to move away from the notion of political parties. Kant is not talking about conservatism, but rather the form of government that existed in Rome. In Ancient Rome, they began to move away from Athenian democracy (direct democracy) and started a representative democracy. Kant's main argument for this form of government is that if all nations were to be republics and all citizens had the right to vote on issues such as going to war, war would come to end fairly quickly. Another reason for republics is, with a \\"legislatures to check the power of monarchs (or presidents) to make war\\". This is an example of the principle of checks and balances to make sure that no one person holds absolute power in the decision making process that impacts everyone. Kant also says, operating at a lower level of analysis and consistent with reciprocity but also relying on identity principles. This means that peace is always dependent on the internal character of governments, republics, with a legislative body that will be able to hold the executive (monarch or president) in check, this will be more peaceful than autocracies.  II: \\"The Law of Nations shall be founded on a Federation of Free States\\"  Kant argues that nations are like individuals. The rule of law should be established internationally, but in order for that to occur nations must be willing to participate in it. If nations fail to establish laws and courts of judgement, then force, or war, would be the only way to settle disputes. States ought to instead develop international organizations and rules that facilitate co-operation. In any case, some kind of federation is necessary in order to maintain peace between nations. Contemporary examples include the United Nations and the European Union, which try to maintain peace respectfully and via the governing of international affairs.  III: \\"The Law of World Citizenship shall be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality\\"  By \\"hospitality\\", Kant means \\"the right of the stranger to be treated with hospitality when he enters on someone else's territory\\". If the \\"stranger\\" is peaceful, he can in fact be turned away without aggression or even welcomed with open arms. An example of this is when a country is receiving a world leader, the host country usually holds a state welcoming ceremony which is usually reserved for special relationships and reaffirms that bond. Kant reinforces this by writing, \\"One may refuse to receive him when this can be done without causing his destruction ... It is not the right to be a permanent visitor that one may demand.\\" Many countries also protect themselves from countries occupying them. For instance, the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution states, \\"No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\\" Even though this is addressing the quartering of American soldiers, the idea is the same. A country does in fact have the right to protect itself against aggression from anyone. This can also be achieved through trade which increases wealth, co-operation and a state's well-being. Under this theory, trade is another way to promote peace because it would, in theory, create fewer conflicts since governments would not want to disrupt anything that would add to the wealth of their states.

History Plan of the Erivan Fortress, 1827 The fortress was built during the Ottoman rule in 1582–83 by Serdar Ferhat Pasha.Arutyunyan, V. “Yerevan”, Moscow, 1968, p. 18 The fortress was destroyed by an earthquake in 1679. After the earthquake, the Safavid governor of Erivan, Zal Khan, asked the Shah for help to rebuild Erivan, including the fortress and the Palace of the Sardars. On 12 July 1679, the Safavid vice-regent of Azerbaijan (historic Azerbaijan, also known as Iranian Azerbaijan), Mirza Ibrahim, visited Erivan. He was directed to recover the fortress, the seat of the governor of Erivan. Many villagers from Ganja, Agulis and Dasht (Nakhchivan) were moved to Erivan to rebuild the fortress. The forced labor continued until winter. Later, the Shah allowed everyone to return to their homes. The reconstruction of the Erivan Fortress was not finished. It was continued and finished in the following years. In October 1827, during the Russo-Persian War of 1826–1829, the Russian army by the leadership of Ivan Paskevich captured Erivan and the Erivan Fortress was not used for military purposes since then, until its complete destruction in 1930s. In 1853, the fortress was ruined by another earthquake. In 1865 the territory of the fortress was purchased by Nerses Tairyants, a merchant of the first guild. Later in 1880s, Tairyants built a brandy factory in the northern part of the fortress. The fortress was completely demolished in 1930s during the Soviet rule, although some parts of the defensive walls still remain. Բերդերը Description The Erivan Fortress was considered to be a small town separate from the city. It was separated from the city with large and unwrought space. The fortress was rectangular with a perimeter of about . It was walled on three sides; on the fourth (western) it was flanked by the Zangu River gorge. The gorge on the north-western part of the fortress had a depth of 300 sazhen (640 meters). As it was considered inaccessible it was not walled. The earth mound was considered as a wall. The Erivan Fortress had three gateways on its double line battlements: Tabriz, Shirvan and Korpu. The walls had towers like old eastern castles. Each wall had an iron gate, and each one had its guard. The garrison had about 2,000 soldiers. There were 800 houses inside the fortress. The permanent residents of the fortress were local Muslims only. Although Armenians were allowed to work in the markets during the day, they had to lock up and return to their homes in Shahar (the main town) at night. Interior Sardar's Palace The palace was in the north-western part of the fortress. The palace hanged on the Hrazdan gorge. It was a square wide building with many sections. The harem was one of the biggest sections, it was long and wide. It was divided into many rooms and corridors. This palace was built in 1798 during the reign of Huseyn-Ali khan's son, Mahmud.

It is a part of the Kiamichi Mountains, a subrange of the Ouachita Mountains. Its summit is 791 feet above sea level.Oklahoma Atlas & Gazetteer The commonly accepted definition of mountain calls for a mountain's summit to top 1,000 feet in elevation. In that sense Lost Mountain qualifies as a hill. Lost Mountain is notable for its unusual isolation. It is in the middle of the valley of the Kiamichi River, and stands alone from the mountains lining either side of the valley floor. In addition, its isolation is enforced by the river, which flows around much of its base, and Spirit Lake, an ancient channel of the Kiamichi River, which lies along another side. A fishing camp was located at the base of Lost Mountain for decades. Aside from the mountain's unusual geological prominence, its only other cause for note occurred during the early 20th century, when a self-proclaimed religious leader, who referred to himself as the supreme deity, established a commune of his followers at the top of the mountain. Traces of their residency still exist, in the form of hand-dug water wells. Squatters who defied authority, the mountain's isolation, and the ease of keeping unwanted people off the mountain made it a perfect location for their settlement. The mountain was part of a very busy setting due to the location of Kosoma, Oklahoma—an early boomtown turned ghost town—nearby. The St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, whose tracks ran along the mountain's base, operated from the 1880s until 100 years later. Timber, logged from Lost Mountain and adjacent mountains, was shipped from the railroad depot at Kosoma. The mountain's name was most likely given during this time—the 1880s through the early 1900s (decade).

It chronicles the story of a young boy named Kenshi Masaki, the younger brother of Tenchi Muyo!'s protagonist Tenchi, who is transported to the world of Geminar. The story shares some character names and general terms from the anime Photon, another series created by Masaki Kajishima. A light novel adaptation by Atsushi Wada was published by Fujimi Shobo on August 20, 2009 under their Fujimi Fantasia Bunko imprint. A manga adaptation was serialized in Comic REX and published by Ichijinsha on June 9, 2010, spanning two volumes. At Otakon 2012, Funimation Entertainment announced they have licensed the series for release in North America. The anime is part of the Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki continuity, taking place 15 years after the events of Tenchi Muyo! GXP. Plot Kenshi Masaki is a 15-year-old boy that has unwillingly traveled from his home on Earth to the alternate world of . On Geminar, the countries wage wars using Sacred Mechanoids, humanoid exoskeletal weapons that were originally discovered within ancient ruins and developed over centuries. After being tricked by a mysterious organization into participating in an attempt to assassinate Lashara Earth XXVIII, the young ruler of the Shtrayu Empire, he ends up captured after he chooses not to kill her. Deducing enough about Kenshi to interest her and because his abilities make him an extremely valuable property, Lashara decides to take Kenshi under her protection. Disguised as her attendant, Kenshi travels with her and her bodyguard Chiaia Flann to the Holy Land, a virtually impregnable fortress that serves as an academy to train Sacred Mechanoid pilots, most of whom are female. With his kindness, tenacity, and skills that vary from carpentry and cooking to advanced survival techniques, Kenshi eventually becomes a celebrity in the academy, becoming the object of affection of many female students and making some of the male students envious. However, the same organization who deceived Kenshi is secretly working inside and against the academy, and a worldwide conflict is about to begin. Characters Main ; : :Kenshi, the main protagonist of the series, is a 15-year-old, hardworking boy from Earth. He is the younger half-brother of Tenchi Masaki, son of Tenchi's father Nobuyuki Masaki and his second wife and former secretary, Rea. Just like his brother, Kenshi's kindness, strength and courage have led most of the girls he befriends to become infatuated with him. Possibly due to his upbringing around several gifted individuals (like Tenchi and the alien women who love him), Kenshi shows himself as a boy of many talents, ranging from swordsmanship and martial arts training to cooking and housekeeping. He has also shown to have an unlimited amount of energy, which many characters have commented on; he is not only able to outrun all the girls chasing him, but then aid in the rescue of all the girls that collapsed chasing him. It is later revealed that he was hypnotized by Washu prior to his journey so that as a child he would not give away that they were aliens to strangers, and exhibits characteristics of Ryo- Ohki when startled. Kenshi has a habit of collecting crystals from the hull of the Swan, as it reminds him of the same crystal-like structure from Ryo-Ohki's spaceship form and even has a necklace made from it which was given to him by one of his \\"big sisters\\", possibly by either Ryoko or Washu (until Chiaia accidentally breaks the string and replaces it with a red braided cord which [much to her chagrin] symbolizes love). Later on, he becomes captain/ruler of the Swan and declares it an independent nation, although he is no longer allowed to dig in its hull for crystals courtesy of a unanimous vote from the others (much to his dismay). :While piloting a Sacred Mechanoid, his primary weapon is a katana-type sword; later, he uses a railgun with compressed bullets of his own making (which are far more powerful than ordinary compressed bullets) and then the from Yukine's home village, which is created from a gigantic stone monolith used to worship the Goddesses. Due to its heavy weight, a special weight-inhibiting ring was installed by Wahanly in order for him to wield it. His Sacred Mechanoid's unique white color implies that he may be the legendary destined to save the world of Geminar. Throughout the anime, it is clear he has shown no clear signs of love interest to the women, although it is suggested he might have feelings for Yukine, Aura and Doll/Mexiah. :Part of the reason Kenshi may have been sent to Geminar is that on occasion while in his Sacred Mechanoid, which unlike the others seems more organic, he sometimes goes into a berserker mode, causing his Sacred Mechanoid to turn black and grow huge with more devastating power. It also matches a prophecy involving a white warrior and a black warrior who may save or destroy the world. Originally it was thought the black warrior was Doll, but after Kenshi transforms and manages to instill fear into his enemies with his power, it becomes clear that he is in fact both. :In the final episode of the series, he was shown using a Light Hawk sword, like his brother Tenchi, however, series creator disclosed that it wasn't Kenchi who produced it, but, rather, it came from the stone monolith, which had been a focus of worship for the Choushin (the three goddesses, Washu, Tsunami and Tokimi), and emphasises that, as Kenchi's name (剣士) states, he is a \\"Swordsman\\". Later it is revealed in Tenchi Muyo's 4th OVA that Rea was sent from Geminar to have a child with an individual from another dimension and send him back, as he would have immensurable power to deal with the threat of Gaia, thus Tenchi and his family trained and raised him in the best way possible for him to fulfill his destiny and survive against all odds. :His given name means \\"Swordsman\\", in reference to his swordfighting preference while piloting his Sacred Mechanoid. ; : :Lashara is the 12-year-old ruler of the Shtrayu Empire. The sudden death of her father causes her to inherit the throne, but as the series begins she is traveling away to school in the Holy Land. She slowly loses her position of power to Babalun as the series progresses. She is notorious for being extremely tight with and concerned about spending money (a trait, according to a remark made by one of Ulyte's operatives, possibly inherited from her mother), and when not busy with other tasks she is usually seen busily adding up her finances with an abacus (as her kingdom is currently in debt) and she is always on the lookout to make some \\"easy money\\" without the outlay of any capital. She refuses to pay Kenshi's wages as her attendant from the Shtrayu national budget, and at one point she is questioned about why Kenshi's Holy Land earnings have not been paid to him; her reaction intimates that she may be keeping the money for herself. She takes Kenshi in as an attendant after he fails to follow through on an attempt to assassinate her, and along with Chiaia she keeps Kenshi's identity a secret until he shows his capabilities in battling the Sacred Mechanoids of Dagmyer and his cronies. Lashara is the niece of Queen Flora and always refers to herself was if she is actually two people, using terms such as \\"we, or us\\" (it is, in fact, majestic plural). It is hinted that she is most likely in love with Kenshi, but given her circumstances, she is not allowed to show such feelings to others. She shows a bit of curiosity towards the opposite sex, as shown in episodes 2 and 3 where she is shown to be a little perverted about Kenshi (especially in allowing Mexiah to turn Kenshi into a \\"massage machine\\"). Despite her mature-like behavior, she claims that she acts this way because of her upbringing and former education, not because she was like that initially. Her personal vessel is the . From episode 10 onwards, there are clear signs of feelings for Kenshi, especially when she breaks down into tears and pleads for him not to leave her side. Her name is a reference to Lashara Moon and Photon Earth from Kajishima's earlier work, Photon. She also uses Kenshi as a combination work horse and method of tying other rich people to her in various ways. ; : :Chiaia is Lashara's personal escort and bodyguard, charged with protecting her life at all costs. She also attends Holy Land Academy to complete her Sacred Mechamaster training, and officially becomes a Sacred Mechamaster at the end of episode 2. She is very skilled at combat, being able to imitate Kenshi's unusual Sacred Mechanoid fighting style after only seeing it once. She has a crush on her childhood friend Dagmyer, which causes her to ignore clues regarding his schemes until it was too late. She frequently gets upset with both Kenshi (due to his cluelessness) and Lashara (due to her seemingly- reckless schemes), and Chiaia's temper is one of the few things that both Lashara and Kenshi seem to be wary of. While not happy about it, she agrees to go along with Lashara's scheme to hide the fact that Kenshi is both the Sacred Mechanoid pilot that tried to kill her and from another world. Her Sacred Mechanoid is pink and red with a fox-like tail, and uses a longsword as her primary weapon. She realizes she might have feelings for Kenshi when she sees him wearing the pendant with the red cord she made. Another instance is when she was manipulated by Dagmyer to kill Kenshi, but could not bring herself to do it. Her reactions around Kenshi have caused others to remark that they act like a pair of siblings (with her as the older sister), and despite her complaining that he always causes trouble (and calling him a \\"moron\\"), she is ready to risk her own life for Kenshi and (despite her grumbling about it) joins in the chase for him at the end of the final episode. ; : :Maria is the young princess from the country of Havoniwa who currently attends Holy Land Academy along with Lashara. She and Lashara are cousins, but they are not fond of each other and attempt to engage in constant one-upmanship. She, like Lashara, refers to herself as if she were two people (majestic plural again). She is very close to her servant Yukine, and is rarely seen without her. Maria is the daughter of Flora, and along with Lashara is frequently embarrassed by her mother's antics. She supports Yukine into having Kenshi fall for her (Yukine), and has recently shown that she too has feelings for him. Her mother has also fallen hard for Kenshi (to Maria's and her own household's profound embarrassment), even to go as far as making herself, Aura and Kenshi engaged, thereby making Kenshi Maria's prospective stepfather. Her family name is a reference to Sir Papacharino Nanadan from Kajishima's earlier work Photon. ; : :Yukine is the quiet, shy and faithful personal servant of Maria, with her quiet and shy demeanor hiding both a very talented skillset and expert combat skills; during the attack on the resort, she wields a sword similar to a khanda. Yukine acts as Maria's primary information-gatherer, and the two of them are able to figure out that Kenshi is the Sacred Mechanoid pilot that attacked Lashara. There is a clear mutual attraction between Kenshi and Yukine, and merely being in close proximity to each other can cause her cheeks to color; there have been two occasions in which circumstances have caused people to mistakenly believe that Kenshi and Yukine have been physically intimate (and it seems that Yukine wouldn't mind in the least!). She is from a clan that protects a temple dedicated to the Choushin, but lets Kenshi compress it into a sword. Her Sacred Mechanoid is a mixture of light colors with moth antennae and a mane armed with a railgun and jets that allows her to travel at supersonic speeds. ; : :Nicknamed , she is a good friend of Lashara (although technically in Lashara's employ), a brilliant inventor, and a genius when it comes to heavy artillery and gunpowder (ironically, she can't seem to hit her targets, though she gradually improves throughout the series). While she may appear to be a 15-year-old girl, her actual age is 97 due to difference in time flow at the Barrier Workshop, where she lived prior to moving to the Swan with the others. She later invented the Mechaworker, a steam-powered mechanoid resembling an Uchikoma with greater maneuverability than what a Sacred Mechanoid would provide. Her Sacred Mechanoid is brown with bull's horns made for heavy combat. Like Lashara and Chiaia, she has feelings for Kenshi, although she usually wants to test her machines' destructive abilities on him. ; : :Lithia is the granddaughter of the current Pope of Geminar and President of The Holy Land Academy's Student Council. She is a harsh and sarcastic woman who often thinks of and refers to Kenshi as a , and after the massage that was given to her (courtesy of Mexiah), she referred to him as that ever since. She suffers from extreme stress due to driving herself and the intense amount of work she has, and tends to pass out when she's overworked. However, she begins to feel more relaxed and enervated after Kenshi makes her some energy-increasing tea, though her sarcastic nature still remains. She also seems to fear Morga, the former Student Council President because Morga, while extremely talented as a Sacred Mechamaster, does not work well with others and is also something of a lunatic in combat. Only in the last few episodes, although she still refers to Kenshi as a \\"wild beast\\", it is shown that she gets flustered around him and even when speaking about him, hinting she may also have feelings for him, and there is no doubt that she has grown to respect Kenshi greatly. ; : :The Dark Elf Princess of the Shurifon Kingdom and a member of the Pilgrimage Route Guard. While she initially shows a very serious and sober personality (of all the girls that interact with Kenshi, she seems the most emotionally mature), it is later revealed that her personality shifts based on the time of day; at certain times-such as in the early morning-she has a much more innocent and girlish personality (the reason for this is because her kind were summoned by the Senshi Civilization to pilot the Sacred Mechalord, and her time of weakness shows that her people have not yet fully stabilized in this world). Initially, she admires Kenshi's wilderness skills, but grows to develop a romantic interest in him, even going so far as to feed him water mouth-to-mouth after he has passed out and then attempting to confess her feelings (even her own father suggests she should marry him); on a few occasions, she and Kenchi have worked well together as a scouting team. When not dealing with school-related tasks, she is nearly always accompanied by two male retainers. Her Sacred Mechanoid is green and brown (forest colors) armed with a crossbow, and has the ability to generate the Dark Elf Field, a powerful force field that can repel any enemy that comes in range; however, using the field is extremely taxing on the user's body. Holy Land Academy Students ;, , , and :Yeliss :Bwoole :Gryino :Wreda :A quartet of students at Holy Land Academy, each having a crush on Kenshi. Each of the girls is named after a color, represented by their hair color and the Sacred Mechanoids they pilot; Yeliss is named after the color yellow, Bwoole after the color blue, Gryino after the color green, and Wreda after the color red. Out of the four, Wreda appears to be the de facto leader of the group. ; : :A student at Holy Land Academy and Lithia's assistant. It is shown that she has feelings for Kenshi, and her devotion to Lithia is such that she stays by Lithia's bedside while Lithia is recovering from her fever, then later risks her own life to protect Lithia when they are attacked by Dagmyer's cronies in their Sacred Mechanoids and in the battle in the ravine at the re-taking of The Holy Land defeats an enemy Sacred Mechanoid that has the upper hand over Lithia. Her own Sacred Mechanoid is yellow with a puff- tipped tail and a spear as her primary weapon. ; : :A student at Holy Land Academy who is in the same class as Kenshi. He is also a Sacred Mechamaster, but unlike most Sacred Mechamasters who are born in nobility, he was born into a common family, which is highly unusual. He is in love with a young girl named , but because of his Sacred Mechamaster status, he cannot be seen with her (male Sacred Mechamasters are forbidden to have relationships with commoners). He was taken prisoner by Cordyline and her bandit group (either for ransom or for the use of his Sacred Mechamaster bloodline in breeding) and later forced against his will to kill Kenshi when Cliff Clees, Lan and the bandits held Hazuki hostage, using a bomb installed on his Sacred Mechanoid's back to take both Kenshi and himself out (taunts from pursuing female ronin hint that he was \\"raped\\" by one or more of them). After the failed attempt, he and Hazuki later join Kenshi onboard the Swan following the events of \\"Barrier Workshop\\", and Ceres assists in the making of the Tenchi sword. ; : :The Student Council President before Lithia who is now a knight for the Trible Royal Court. She only makes a brief appearance in the anime, but it is hinted that she and Lithia are not on good terms and that everyone who either knows or remembers her is extremely wary of and around her. Morga was shown to be a strong-headed and reckless Sacred Mechamaster who obliterates anything in her path, regardless of friend or foe. Her Sacred Mechanoid is red and black, and she uses a pair of axes to fight. Lithia states that while Morga is a skilled fighter, she lacks the ability to work as a member of a team. Faculty ; : :The director of Holy Land Academy and chief administrator of the Holy Land. ; : :A muscular woman who runs the underground operations of the Academy. ; : :One of Hannah's assistants, in charge of Laundry and Room Service at the Academy. Antagonists ; / :Doll :Mexiah :Doll is one of the three artificial humans created by the Senshi Civilization for the purpose of defeating the last Sacred Mechalord, Gaia. Gaia was defeated only by the sacrifice of one of the three artificial beings. After Gaia's defeat, Doll/Mexiah's memory of the events was erased and she was buried along with the damaged Sacred Mechalord. Doll/Mexiah was eventually unearthed and discovered as an infant with pink hair by Naua Flan, who adopted her with the name Mexiah Flan, and she was raised as Chiaia's older sister. As Mexiah, she is a martial arts instructor at the Holy Land Academy and, unlike her serious sister, is shockingly affectionate toward Kenshi; however, there are also hints of her having lesbian relationships with some of the female students, all of whom worship her. :Doll has little regard for the importance of life, shown when she laughs while trying to kill Aura during an early encounter. Despite this, she feels an attraction to Kenshi that she believes is a remnant of when Mexiah's personality was dominant. When piloting her Sacred Mechanoid, she can easily defeat any opponent except for Kenshi. In the last episode, the merged Doll/Mexiah calls upon Kenshi through their shared bond of being artificial humans to save her from being subsumed by the merged Gaia/Babalan Sacred Mechalord. Doll's Sacred Mechanoid wields a scythe (which doubles as a gun) and later is armed with the retrieved , a massive and indestructible shield with a mouth capable of eating parts of her opponents. Her Sacred Mechanoid's black color implies that she may be the legendary destined to destroy the world and Kenshi's nemesis. As Mexiah, her Sacred Mechanoid is lavender with a pink lion's mane armed with a launcher. :Doll bears a close resemblance to the character Neju Na Melmas from Tenchi Muyo! GXP and the character D from Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure in terms of appearance (they all share a child-like appearance) and hair color (green). The child-form Doll also has pink eyes. As Mexiah, her hair and eye color are reversed. ; : :The hot-blooded and hot-tempered son of Babalun (who seems to have a very low opinion of his son's abilities), Chiaia's childhood friend, and a student of Holy Land Academy. He manipulated Kenshi into attempting to assassinate Lashara in the first episode, and is also responsible for recruiting some of the Academy's male students for the invasion of the Holy Land. His Sacred Mechanoid is blue and gold with a sword that can fire energy blasts from the tip and hilt and a shield as its weapons. His primary motive in betraying and attacking the Holy Land seems to stem from the unfair conditions faced by male Sacred Mechamasters, due to the fact that, on account of their scarcity, male Sacred Mechamasters, no matter how talented or powerful, are considered more like breeding stock and therefore given less freedom than female Sacred Mechamasters; he therefore recruits to his cause other male Mechamasters who feel as he does. His attitude is demonstrated by his refusal to accept help or sound advice from Emera, his cavalier treatment of Cordyline, his manipulation of Chiaia to get her to kill Kenshi and his rough treatment of her after her failed attempt. In episode 11, he becomes traumatized after nearly being killed by Kenshi's Sacred Mechanoid in berserker mode and seeing Cliff Cleese hurled to his death in the process, but gradually recovers in the following episode. In the final episode, he finally acknowledges Kenshi's skill after he loses to him in a duel. At the end of the story, it's hinted that he's become infected by Babalun's core jewel. ; : :He is the first male Sacred Mechamaster at Holy Land Academy to be wooed over to Babalun's cause by Dagmyer. It is not sure just how talented he is, but he clearly lacks battle experience since like the other male turncoats he is very arrogant when he thinks he has the upper hand but terrified and unable to fight back powerfully when facing a superior opponent (namely Kenshi), even screaming, begging for mercy and fleeing in terror. His Sacred Mechanoid is green and pink and does not seem to have any special weaponry. Acting on information from his uncle, a former Councilman of Havoniwa who fled to save his own skin when Havoniwa was attacked, Cliff originates the plan to force Ceres to kill Kenshi. Kenshi goes into berserker mode on learning that his friend was tormented into doing this and literally tears Cliff's Sacred Mechanoid apart, finally hurling him down a chasm. Cliff's last words before he falls to his death are \\"It wasn't supposed to be like this!\\" ; and :Alan :Neil :These two male Sacred Mechamasters are recruited by Dagmyer and act as his lieutenants. Although possibly strong fighters, they are easily defeated by Kenshi, and later when Lan takes charge after Dagmyer's collapse and female ronin are recruited into the Babalun forces, they are pushed to the rear by the same apparent lack of respect towards male Mechamasters that they were supposed to be fighting against to the extent that they become more observers than fighters. In the final battle between the Holy Land students led by Lithia and the Babalun ronin forces, they deliberately choose not to fight and are taken into custody after the battle. ; : :Ulyte is Babalun's younger brother, Dagmyer's uncle and one of the most popular instructors within the Academy; he seems to have a different intent for invading the Holy Land than his older brother. His personality is extremely friendly and easy-going, even a little hedonistic, which serves to conceal a keen and penetrating intelligence. It is later revealed that he is an entity created by one of the Core Crystals, which later created the alternate being/personality of Rea Second. This duality is hinted at being the cause of his physical weakness, which is partially cured by Kenshi's herbal tea. ; : :The chancellor (later Prime Minister) of the Shtrayu empire, Dagmyer's father, Ulyte's older brother, and the main antagonist of the series. He is the one who planned the invasion of the Holy Land so he could obtain the Sacred Mechalord Gaia and the Shield of Gaia within. It is later learned by the Church that Babalun wants not only Shtrayu and the Holy Land, but Havoniwa, Shurifon, and possibly the entire world of Geminar to himself. He later merged with Gaia to defeat Kenshi, only to meet his destruction at the hands of Kenshi and Ulyte, where it was later revealed that he is actually an entity created from the implantation of one of the Core Crystals, his Core Crystal having been the Core Crystal of the original pilot of Gaia MechaLord who's went rogue all those millennia-ago; a fragment of his Core Crystal was soon picked up by Dagmyer following his defeat. His personal war vessel is called the , named and modeled after the Tower of Babel with an array of cannons equipped on its hull. ; and :Cordyline :Lan :The mother/daughter leaders of a group of bandits. Cordyline is a 38-year-old ronin Sacred Mechamaster who went rogue because of her short operational limits when piloting a Sacred Mechanoid; her Sacred Mechanoid is purple with lavender pauldrons and gauntlets and her weapon is a pole-axe that can also fire fiery signal flares. Her daughter Lan is a sarcastic and rebellious teenager who takes her job seriously (though she is not as serious as her mother) and views both Emera and Doll with contempt; she is also extremely ambitious and the most ruthless of all the antagonists (including not hesitating to order the slaughter of an entire Church ship's crew even though they had already surrendered). Lan originally believes Kenshi to be a thief like herself after he foils her attempted pickpocketing, and asks him to join her; Kenshi good- naturedly rejects her offer, causing her to grumble that he's been \\"domesticated\\". Originally planning to kidnap Ceres and Dagmyer in Havoniwa, they and the rest of the bandits were later recruited by Dagmyer to participate in the invasion of the Holy Land, Cordyline becoming Dagmyer's lover. Cordyline piloted a purple Sacred Mechanoid that was eventually crushed by Kenshi and was later killed when the Meteor Fall in Havoniwa (which she and her crew had hijacked) collapsed and crashed after Kenshi took down one of its supports, leaving her daughter to take command. Lan has an enormous ego, demonstrated by showing growing contempt for Dagmyer, taking control of the ronin forces after he suffers his emotional collapse and continually believing that she and her bandits will triumph even in the face of her continual defeats at the hands of Kenshi and his comrades. After her total defeat at the checkpoint in the final battle, she is seen at the end of the series going after Dagmyer, attempting to kill him in order to re-establish her reputation, only to meet her end by Emera. ; : :Dagmyer's right-hand/servant and a Sacred Mechamaster. She has feelings for Dagmyer (who does not reciprocate and who barely even acknowledges her) and appears to be far more skilled than him; she manages to save him from some falling rubble while Kenshi (with Mexiah in his arms) is escaping from Wahanly, Lithia, Aura, Chiaia, Maria, and Yukine (who were chasing them on board Wahanly's Mechaworker prototype), and again from near-death during Kenshi's rampage in his Sacred Mechanoid. She shows concern for Dagmyer and his honor as the show progresses; her own sense of honor is far more evident than his when she voices her concerns about his hiring Lan and the other bandits, Lan's continuing and growing reckless behavior and the dishonorable methods Dagmyer uses against Kenshi. She regards Kenshi as someone who is kind and is grateful to him for helping Dagmyer change his ways at the end. At the end of the final episode, she kills Lan who is attempting to kill Dagmyer. Her Sacred Mechanoid is red and pink and equipped with a gunblade. Others ;, , and :Mahya :Angela :Vanessa :Lashara's attendants, with Mahya being the oldest and most mature of the three; Mahya also acts as a personal and trusted councilor to Lashara. When Kenshi accepts the role of Lashara's attendant, Mahya's intuition tells her that this has been an historical moment. Angela and Vanessa may have a crush on Kenshi, as they both admit that he's cute. They also serve as part of the Swan's crew. ; :Two- tailed, Cabbit-like creatures that also double as security alarms due to their piercing meows. For some strange reason, they appear to be attracted to Kenshi (in episode 4, they are also attracted to the crystal from Ryo-Ohki's ship when Ulyte analyzed it); Kenshi is many times during the series compared to, and even called (by Chiaia mostly), a koro. ; / : :A member of the Church whose alter ego is Neizai One, a mysterious masked woman working under Ulyte's orders with an unknown agenda. As Rea, she briefly joined Lashara's group after the Head Church's headquarters was destroyed by Doll, but she later shows her true colors at the Barrier Workshop by stealing a mysterious object which Naua described as being the only way to destroy Gaia. Her Sacred Mechanoid is grey with a cape and a mask with active camouflage armed with a large sniper rifle. She shares the same civilian name as Kenshi's mother, also named Rea. ; : :The Queen of Havoniwa, Maria's mother and Lashara's aunt. While she may appear polite and modest at first glance, she is in reality a hedonistic woman. This causes Maria and Lashara to be frequently embarrassed by her antics (and is one of the few points in which they are entirely in agreement with each other and work together). At one point, in episode 6, they attempted to get retribution by using Kenshi's hypnotized state on her, in which he gives massages that can cause intense orgasms (sometimes hours or days after they are delivered, causing the young girls deep embarrassment since even a slight touch after the massage will cause them to have more intense orgasms). Unfortunately, to Lashara and Maria's shock, it backfired when they realized that the Queen enjoyed it a great deal. As a result afterwards, Flora developed a large crush on Kenshi. Flora is also shown to be a great pilot when she tested Wahanly's Mechaworker in the forest. She later defends the Holy Land in the invasion plotted by Babalun, with a train equipped with two cannons in each car and a giant cannon hidden in the engine. She had no idea that Kenshi was a Sacred Mechamaster, but when she found out this only increased her passion for him, even more so as to want to have some \\"one on one\\" time with him (to Lashara and Maria's dismay). ; : :Naua is Chiaia's father and a leading member of the Barrier Workshop. He was the one who found the Sacred Mechalord and Doll in the ruins of what once was a highly advanced civilization prior to Chiaia's birth. Upon finding Doll in the ruins, he adopted her as Mexiah, who would later be Chiaia's adoptive sister. When Kenshi and the rest of the Swan's crew finally arrive, he reveals the history of the Senshi Civilization, the Sacred Mechalord Gaia, and how Doll came into being. The tests on Kenshi by his team prove that Kenshi is somehow connected to the third artificial human. ; : :Aura's father and the ruler of the Shurifon Kingdom, as well as the kingdom's strongest Sacred Mechamaster. He challenges Kenshi to race to see if he is truly capable of leading his men to battle; after he loses to Kenshi's ability, he announced his intention for Kenshi to marry Aura, to her delight. Later, when the King and Flora come on the Swan, they teasingly suggest that Kenshi marry both Aura and Flora in an effort to unite the three kingdoms. ; : :The leader of the Church and Lithia's grandfather, with his first name being Gen. He is a very understanding and kind person who tries to find the best solution which does not lead to war. He has shown great respect for Kenshi not only as a Sacred Mechamaster of Light but also as the man who looked after his granddaughter when she collapsed and as the unifyer of all the Holy Land students. It is hinted that he knows Lithia has feelings for Kenshi. ; : :The leader of Yukine's home village in Havoniwa. He is extremely devoted to tradition and it takes drastic measures to cause him to change his mind. Terminology General ; :Aho is a form of energy that permeates the air of Geminar and used to power the Sacred Mechanoid. ; :Seas of Ena are low-altitude areas where the Aho is so thick that allows flying ships to transit there. ; :Sacred Mechamasters are the guardians of the Holy Land and the only people qualified to pilot Sacred Mechanoids. Most of the Sacred Mechamasters are female, though there are some male Sacred Mechamasters (such as Dagmyer and Ceres) and they're considered rare in numbers. Female Sacred Mechamasters have the freedom of marriage and relationships if they fulfill their duties, which is to produce more Sacred Mechamaster breeds. Male Sacred Mechamasters, however, cannot due to their scarcity and are usually forced to engage in marriages of convenience, and in ancient times, the semen of a male Sacred Mechamaster was a high-priced item. A Sacred Mechamaster who can repair Sacred Mechanoids using Aho (like Mexiah, for example) is called a . To obtain this ability, a Sacred Mechamaster has to be baptized by the Church. Unemployed Sacred Mechamasters, like Cordyline, are called ronin Sacred Mechamasters. Some female Sacred Mechamasters wear unique tight-fitting (and sometimes revealing) bodysuits underneath their clothing that protects them from the Aho emitted in the Sacred Mechamasters' cockpit and the Moving Armor. :The main factor that distinguishes a Sacred Mechamaster from a regular human is their ability to endure proximity to Aho energy, which is used to power the Sacred Mechanoid. Ulyte explains that, while fighting skill can be enhanced through training, a Sacred Mechamasters' level of endurance is something they are born with, and therefore cannot be changed. Sacred Mechamasters are limited by the amount of time they can endure an Aho field, called the operational limit. Sacred Mechamasters cannot pilot a Sacred Mechanoid for longer than their operational limit. ; :Ancient and powerful humanoid constructs that were built by an ancient race called the Senshi. , the only surviving Sacred Mechalord, was unearthed intact (although immobile) by the Shtrayu Empire, and was mainly used as a decoration before the arrival of Kenshi triggered a response from it. It was revealed that the Senshi civilization was completely destroyed by Gaia. ; :Humanoid mecha that are powered by an energy source called Aho. They usually reside in egg-like cocoons until they're activated. To enter a Sacred Mechanoid, a Sacred Mechamaster places his or her palm on the cocoon. After the palm is read, the Sacred Mechamaster is then encased in a sphere as he or she travels to the chest cavity. As soon as a pilot in the cockpit activates it, the Sacred Mechanoid breaks from the cocoon, which then forms the armor (and tail if the Sacred Mechamaster is powerful) depending on who is in the Sacred Mechanoid. Normal people cannot be taken inside the cockpit due to the high amount of Aho radiated inside. :A weakness for Sacred Mechanoids is due to their human anatomy, they are vulnerable to pressure points, which was demonstrated when Kenshi paralyzed Cordyline's Sacred Mechanoid using one of Wahanly's Mechaworker. Another weakness is that if the pilot passes their operational limits or if one of the energy reactors (the rings on a Sacred Mechanoid's back and forearms) either break or go out of control, the Sacred Mechanoid will revert to its cocoon form. According to Aura, Sacred Mechanoids are a cost-effective alternative to raising armies or building heavy artillery to defend their homelands. To repair a damaged Sacred Mechanoid using Aho, a Sacred Mechamaster has to undergo being baptized by the Church in order to repair them. Otherwise, the damaged Sacred Mechanoid has to be sent to the Church directly for repairs. To maintain the balance of power in each country, the Church can only supply a certain number of Sacred Mechanoids to each country to prevent further power struggles. ; :Suits of Aho-powered armor that Sacred Mechamasters-in-training use to train. When it is hit, the site of impact turns red and it affects the armor's movement based on the damage received. They are later modified by Wahanly to run on steam power for a limited time (only 30 minutes) should the cord supplying the Aho be removed. ; :Four-legged mechanoids resembling Uchikomas that are powered by steam instead of Aho. Invented by Wahanly, Mechaworkers provide much greater maneuverability than what a Sacred Mechanoid provides and can be equipped with various gunpowder weapons, though it will hamper its high maneuverability. It is also proven to be more efficient than Sacred Mechanoids without Ena's Draft. In episode 12, Lan and her group of bandits are seen with grey Mechaworkers attacking Chiaia and Aura while Kenshi is compressing the rock used to form the Tenchi-ken, most likely based on the plans Emera stole from Wahanly's workshop in episode 4. Locations and Organizations ; :The home country of Lashara and Chiaia prior to moving to the Holy Land. Shtrayu lacks some technological advances, as quoted by Maria, so it relies on using the technologies of other countries such as Havoniwa. It is also the place where the Sacred Mechalord and Doll were unearthed. Shtrayu's past ruler, Lashara's father, died prior to the series, leaving Lashara to become his successor. However, Lashara slowly loses her position of power to Babalun after his promotion to Prime Minister. ; :An impregnable fortress made in the image of the Choushin goddess. It is also home to , a special school where nobles and the wealthy train to become Sacred Mechamasters. The Holy Land also holds the , a tournament where Sacred Mechamasters from all over Geminar compete (Aura once stated that Flora was one of the champions). In the Holy Arena, pillars and Ena's Draft are placed as challenging obstacles for the most skilled Sacred Mechamasters, though Kenshi is able to maneuver through them with ease. According to Lashara, winning the Holy Tournament is the greatest achievement for a Sacred Mechamaster. It was later invaded and conquered by Babalun, who was after the Shield of Gaia that was buried underneath and Gaia itself, but was later reconquered following Babalun's defeat. ; :The homeland of Flora, Maria, and Yukine, and one of the more technologically advanced countries in comparison to the others. In Havoniwa, there is a welcome ceremony in the form of a pillow fight, where the competitors are to pull the sashes off of their opponents' yukata and the last person standing wins. Their main defense is the a floating fortress that drops meteor-sized rocks to destroy their invaders. It is stated in the anime that the main city that was destroyed by Dagmyer's forces was actually its governing area and there was little to no residents in the area so it was a small loss to Havoniwa. It also has an underground city in case their main city is destroyed. Havoniwa's capital was destroyed by Doll, but its people managed to find refuge in the underground city. ; :The nature-affiliated home of the , who have dark skin, silvery-white hair, and blue eyes much like Aura's. Also like Aura, their personalities shift based on the time of day, which is described by others as their . In Shurifon, there is a rare mushroom that can be sold for a huge fortune (Kenshi found four during the series' run), and it is often used as a gourmet ingredient in the royal courts. Also in Shurifon, there is an event called the Stew Battle, where the contestants find ingredients from the forest to make a stew. The winner is determined by a judge and the person with the most delicious stew wins. Shurifon was the first of the countries to be destroyed by Dagmyer's forces. It is later revealed by Naua that Shurifon's people were brought to Geminar by the Senshi Civilization in ancient times to pilot the Sacred Mechalord, and their weak periods are actually side effects of trying to adapt to the new world. ; :The main overseers of Geminar. They are the remnants of the Senshi civilization and are well-aware of the dangers of Sacred Mechanoids. They tried to prevent the introduction of Sacred Mechanoids into the current world but had no choice once the Sacred Mechalord was unearthed in the Shtrayu Empire. To prevent the occurrence of an arms race of the kind that destroyed the Senshi civilization, the Church decided to allot a fixed number of Sacred Mechanoids and Sacred Mechamasters to each country to maintain a balance. The Church was shown to have superior technology, such as teleportation pads, apart from monopolizing the construction and repair of Sacred Mechanoids. ; :An area outside of the Draft of Ena where Sacred Mechanoids and other devices powered by Aho no longer function. It is far less advanced than most of the countries that use the Draft of Ena, and it is said that the people living there are isolated socially as well as physically. ; :An ancient civilization on the world of Geminar. The Senshi civilization was world-wide and unified, with individual units such as cities and villages. Naua Flan explains that the Senshi civilization created the Sacred Mechanoids, not for war, but for sports and other athletic competitions. Eventually, the Sacred Mechanoids were used for gladiator-like fight events, and the Sacred Mechamasters became an elite class. Massive technological advancements were made to the Sacred Mechanoids as people tried to one-up their opponents. As the battles between Sacred Mechanoids grew more fierce and the number of Sacred Mechamaster fatalities increased, the expertise and fighting instincts of the Sacred Mechamasters were downloaded onto crystals (called ) and embedded into newer Sacred Mechamasters to preserve them. Over time, the accumulation of fighting skills and bloodlust in the crystals caused the Sacred Mechanoids to go on a rampage. These rampaging Sacred Mechanoids were labelled as Sacred Mechalord because of their overwhelming power. The human remnants managed to disable the Sacred Mechalord, but were too late to save their civilization, which had split into several groups as the people fled the Sacred Mechalord.

Kellond is located approximately three miles northwest of Antlers on Oklahoma State Highway 2. The school building had two classrooms separated by a hallway, a larger playroom, two entryways, a large storage room which was later updated into two restrooms, (until then, there were two outhouses on the east side of the school) a large auditorium, and a basement which was used as a lunchroom and had a small kitchen, and various storage rooms. The two classrooms were for first through fourth grades, known as the Little Room and fifth through eighth grades known as the Big Room. In the early 1950s the two teachers were Mrs. Bertha Lee Wheeler Smith, better known as Miss Bertha, and Mr. Lonnie D. Killlan. Later, Mr. Charles Bolin of Finley, replaced Mr. Killian. Miss Bertha was the teacher for the Little Room and Mr. Killian and Mr. Bolin were teachers for the Big Room. The teacherage, a small frame house, sat to the north of the school. This is where Miss Bertha, her husband, Eanon, and daughter, Kathy, lived from 1953 until 1964. There was a rock wall that surrounded the school, teacherage, and large playground on the west and north sides. The east and south sides were bordered by barbed wire fences that kept out the livestock, mostly Brahman cattle owned by Wren Shaw. A large creek ran the full length of the south side, which provided many recess activities like catching crawdads.  History  During the 1880s the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, more popularly known as the “Frisco”, built a line from north to south through the Choctaw Nation, connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas with Paris, Texas. The railroad paralleled the Kiamichi River throughout much of its route in present-day Pushmataha County, Oklahoma. Train stations were established every few miles to aid in opening up the land and, more particularly, to serve as the locations of section houses. Supervisors for their respective miles of track lived in the section houses to administer the track and its right-of-way. These stations also served as points at which the trains could draw water. The site of Kellond was selected because of its proximity to the Kiamichi River, with its abundant water supply. Adjacent station stops were established at Moyers, Oklahoma to the north, and Antlers, Oklahoma to the south. By the early 1890s, the stop was known as Davenport. Named for Luda P. Davenport (1861-1924), a local resident and county judge, it was identified on maps as Davenport through the early 1900s (decade). The exact cause and date of its change of name to Kellond is unknown, and was not noted by the local press. The sparsely-populated area, at that time known as Jack’s Fork County, a part of the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation, in the Indian Territory, was home to Choctaw Indians who farmed or subsisted on the land.Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. Few roads or trails existed. Transportation was provided by the Frisco Railroad, which offered six trains per day—three in each direction—until it closed to passenger traffic during the late 1950s. It continued freight operations until 1981, when it closed altogether and its rails were removed. The loss of passenger rail coincided with the construction of Oklahoma State Highway 2. Near Kellond was a locally important low-water ford on the Kiamichi River known as Rodney Crossing. The crossing obtained its name from Rodney Mountain, located to the north of the settlement. It was also home to the short-lived post office and small community of Rodney, Oklahoma. Davenport, and later Kellond, never developed as a commercial center. Its most significant structure was, and continues to be, a handsome public school constructed of native stone as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The school, closed for many years, has served a variety of purposes, most recently as a night club and residence. More information on Kellond may be found in the Pushmataha County Historical Society.

Prewar life Karl Paul Schlegel was born in Wechselburg, the Kingdom of Saxony on 7 May 1893. He began attending military school in 1907. On 1 April 1912, he began active duty in the Royal Sachensburg Machine Gun Section #19 as a Gefreiter. He would later be serving with the 8th Cavalry Division when World War I began. World War I service Schlegel served in both France and Russia as a cavalry sergeant in the early days of World War I. He won the Second Class Iron Cross during 1914. In April 1915, he was also awarded his native Saxony's Silver Military Order of St. Henry. That summer, he was the first noncommissioned officer in his division to win the First Class Iron Cross. However, he was tired of service in the trenches and volunteered for aerial service. In Spring 1917, he underwent pilot's training and was posted to a Saxon two-seater replacement unit, Fliegerersatz-Abteilung 6. He transferred to Flieger-Abteilung 39, but after being injured in an accident, returned to FEA 6 in January 1918. He passed through Kest 1 on his way to posting with a fighter squadron, Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 45. On 14 June 1918, he became a balloon buster for his first aerial victory. He downed two more enemy observation balloons in early July. On 15 July, he was both promoted to vizefeldwebel and became an ace by shooting down a pair of Spads. He would run his victory total to 12 by the end of the month, and add seven more victories in August. Three more balloons would fall to his guns in September, bring his total confirmed victories to 14 balloons and eight enemy airplanes. On 15 October, his exploits were rewarded with the Golden Military Merit Cross. On 27 October 1918, he fought twelve French planes near Amifontaine, France and lost. Petar Marinovich was credited with victory over him. Schlegel's last victories, over a balloon and a SPAD S.XI, went unconfirmed. Schlegel died of his wounds on 28 October 1918.

Research and testing for the NEAR program was developed in 1956 during the Cold War to supplement the existing siren warning systems and radio broadcasts in the event of a nuclear attack. The advent of the radio Emergency Broadcast System rendered NEAR obsolete, although a severe disadvantage inherent in the Emergency Broadcast System was that it required a television or radio to be turned on for a household to receive the emergency alarm, whereas NEAR did not.

It is a part of the Kiamichi Mountains, a subrange of the Ouachita Mountains, and forms its southwest-most extremity. Its summit is 767 feet above sea level. It is found at GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) 34.2984336 and −95.6410833.Oklahoma Atlas and Gazetteer The commonly accepted definition of mountain calls for a mountain's summit to top 1,000 feet in elevation. In that sense Rodney Mountain qualifies as a hill. Certain of its physical characteristics, however—its rugged nature and often-steep slopes—suggest its name is not a misnomer. Rodney Mountain is named for Rodney Moyer, an early resident of the area, whose family patriarch, Roy A. Moyer, lent his name to Moyers, Oklahoma, the community north of Rodney Mountain. Rodney Moyer is thought to have left the area prior to Oklahoma's statehood to participate in Alaska's Klondike gold rush. He did not return, and his place and date of death are unknown.Information on Rodney Moyer was provided to the Pushmataha County Historical Society by Charlyne Moyer Hellekson, a local descendant of the Moyer family. For several years a United States Post Office was in operation in the area to serve those living nearby. It was called Rodney, Oklahoma. Oklahoma State Highway 2, built in the 1950s, now traverses the mountain and makes local transportation a simple matter. Until it opened, however, the mountain was the bane of good roads. The Antlers-to-Moyers road, particularly the segment at the mountain's base near Ten Mile Creek, was particularly problematic. Boulders and other rocks littered its slopes and the roadway. The Kiamichi River flows adjacent to the mountain, and Rodney Crossing, a low-water ford in the area, was for decades a locally important transportation link.

It is the fourth serial of the third series. The story involves the scientific investigation of a haunted house. Plot Part 1 Professor Rivers tells the story of Ashen Hill Manor, which is said to be haunted. She talks of a man named Lord Marchwood and how he employed Erasmus Darkening. Lord Marchwood thought that Erasmus could make gold out of base metals. His two children, Elizabeth and Joseph, spy on Erasmus. He spots them and makes them vanish. Professor Rivers is telling the story to Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani. She and her assistant Toby are making a scientific investigation of the ghostly phenomena. Luke is at home as he has no interest in ghost-hunting. Sarah Jane splits up from the group and finds a book on the history of the manor. She turns round from the book case which she is reading from and unknown to her, the books begin moving. Clyde and Rani go outside and find a dry fountain. All of a sudden the fountain starts and some wet foot prints appear leading in the direction of a shed. Clyde and Rani hear a young girl crying, and enter the shed. The crying stops as Clyde pulls a sheet off a mirror. A strange man's face appears in the mirror. Clyde and Rani run back into the manor and find Sarah Jane. Meanwhile, in the control room the camera in the playroom cuts out. Professor Rivers goes to investigate. The baby monitor starts to play, then seconds later the professor vanishes. They all go to investigate and they find that all the toys have started to move on their own. On the mirror in the room a message appears saying \\"GET OUT\\".

A creature in the bushes with red eyes appears and advances towards Sarah Jane. Lord Marchwood's ghost manifests and fights off the creature. Clyde and Rani find a computer, then when they turn around they see Erasmus Darkening. Part 2 Lord Marchwood arrives to rescue Clyde and Rani. Then they are aided by his children. Sarah Jane hears a recording of Professor Rivers saying \\"Sarah Jane help me\\" over and over. Then she sees her. She warns her that \\"he is coming for you\\" and then disappears. Sarah Jane reunites with Clyde and Rani and then they find Lord Marchwood. Sarah Jane believes they are not ghosts. Toby, Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani discover all the people that have disappeared except for Professor Rivers who has not been absorbed yet. Erasmus arrives and they all disappear. Erasmus tells them he will come for them all. Sarah Jane knows Erasmus is playing with them. Sarah Jane and Toby investigate Erasmus' secret chamber while Rani and Clyde distract Erasmus. Toby tells Sarah Jane about a creature who came into his room and watched him every night when he was younger. Rani and Clyde are chased by something into a game room. When all the games start playing themselves they run outside and get locked out. Sarah Jane and Toby find Erasmus' machine. Sarah Jane suspects that Erasmus was trying to get home to another galaxy with the machine. The machine malfunctioned and all the people that disappeared got trapped between dimensions. Clyde and Rani run into the pavilion. Sarah Jane and Toby get interrupted by Erasmus. Sarah Jane works out that the machine is giving Erasmus and all the people that disappeared immortality. She also works out the creature that attacked her earlier came through the machine. Lord Marchwood once again rescues Clyde and Rani again by slaying the creature. Sarah Jane, Clyde, Rani and Toby reunite along with Lord Marchwood. Sarah Jane comes up with a plan to stop Erasmus. They can turn him into electricity but he has to step into a certain area. Lord Marchwood uses his sword and a wire to connect to it to do it. Erasmus is destroyed and Professor Rivers is returned. Sarah Jane destroys Erasmus' machine with the sonic lipstick. Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani say goodbye to Professor Rivers and Toby. Sarah Jane says that she still doesn't believe in ghosts. They drive away. We then see Lord Marchwood and his children at the window. Continuity * Tommy Knight was not available for filming of this episode due to his GCSE exams. This story is therefore the first not to feature Luke Smith. As a result of this absence, Elisabeth Sladen becomes the only cast member to have appeared in every episode of the series. Other series mainstays such as Mr Smith, K9, Sarah Jane's attic and Rani's parents, Haresh and Gita, do not appear in this story. * Professor Celeste Rivers and the Pharos Institute were previously shown in The Lost Boy and The Day of the Clown. * This is the first episode with scenes set prior to Sarah Jane's birth.

It is the fifth serial of the third series. Plot Part 1 Luke enters Clyde's painting for a competition and Clyde wins first prize. The prize is a trip to see the first showing of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa in Britain for Clyde and his class but Sarah Jane is unaware of this as she and Luke have argued over the untidiness of his room. While the class is at the International Gallery with its director, Mr Harding, something causes the image of Mona Lisa to come to life and step out of the painting, and to replace herself with Mr Harding's assistant, Miss Trupp. She also has the ability to make other people and objects from paintings come to life and able to make real people become part of paintings, and does this with some of the gallery staff. Believing the painting to be stolen, the gallery calls the police, who arrive. They have not been there long before the Mona Lisa also puts them into paintings. She removes a Sontaran blaster gun that Clyde has unwisely painted from his winning picture and commands the gallery's director to take her to find her \\"brother\\". Seeing the coverage of the apparent theft of the painting on television, Sarah Jane arrives at the gallery and argues with the Mona Lisa to let the painting people come back to life. Instead, she puts Sarah Jane into a painting. Part 2 The Mona Lisa tries to unleash a beast in the gallery basement, which she refers to as her brother. This creature is locked up in a vault and can only be released by using a puzzle box key. This key is destroyed by Mr Harding who, despite his admiration for La Gioconda, cannot allow her to unleash the beast on the world. Luke, Clyde, and Rani have to try to solve the problem without Sarah Jane as she is now trapped in a painting. The Dark Rider captures Clyde and takes him to the vaults along with the Mona Lisa and Harding. As Mr Harding has destroyed the original key, Clyde is encouraged to draw another, that the Mona Lisa can bring to life as a replacement. This is done and the key is used, but before the beast can escape, a picture of K9 drawn by Clyde also comes to life and fires at the beast, causing it to retreat into the vault. This sets off a chain reaction causing all the painting people to revert to being just works of art, and all those trapped in paintings to be released. The story ends with the Mona Lisa restored to her frame and Luke promising to tidy his room. Continuity * The Mona Lisa painting played a key role in the Fourth Doctor story City of Death. * Clyde painted Sontaran sidearms in his art, having encountered Commander Kaagh in The Last Sontaran and Enemy of the Bane. * Lionel Harding mentions 'the fiasco at Easter', a reference to \\"Planet of the Dead\\", in which Lady Christina DeSousa steals the cup of King Æthelstan from the International Gallery. * The concept of an alien force transforming living creatures into artworks (and vice versa) was previously explored in the Tenth Doctor episode \\"Fear Her\\" and would become an important and repeated plot device in the Eleventh/Tenth/War Doctor episode \\"The Day of the Doctor\\".

History The Hutton oil field is situated in the East Shetland Basin in the UK North Sea on the western side of the Viking Graben. It straddles UK Blocks 211/27 and 211/28. The field was discovered in July 1973 by ConocoPhillips well 211/28-la and was operated by Conoco (UK) Limited. The field is named after James Hutton, an eighteenth century geologist, known as the father of geology. Geology The structure comprises a series of southwesterly dipping tilted fault blocks. The reservoir sandstones are Middle Jurassic in age and were deposited as a result of deltaic progradation across the Hutton area. The oil bearing Brent Group sandstones vary in thickness from 150 ft to 380 ft with average porosities of 22% and permeabilities of 500-2000 md in the producing zones. Original recoverable reserves were estimated at 190 million barrels, of which the field has produced 107 million barrels by 1991.Geological Society, London (Lylle Memoirs) Production Production of the field began in August 1984 and increased rapidly to a peak in 1986 with a total annual production value of .Department of Energy & Climate Change (Web source) This then declined alarmingly and was stabilized somewhat with the introduction of water injection. The Hutton Field, Blocks 211/28, 211/27, UK North Sea (Haig 1991) By 1995 production rates were falling once again with just over produced over the first five months of 2001. The field was retired in summer 2001 having produced approximately over its lifetime, exceeding the initial estimates of of recoverable oil.The Hutton Field, Blocks 211/28, 211/27, UK North Sea (Haig 1991)Department of Energy & Climate Change (Web source) Facility Vickers Offshore (Projects & Developments), had been working on the TLP Concept since 1974. The Hutton topsides design was awarded in 1981 to Brown & Root. The integrated topsides was built at the McDermott Ardersier yard in Scotland, and the hull at the HiFab Nigg yard. Hutton TLP was installed in 1984 by Aker Offshore.Offshore Pioneers - Brown and Root, Gulf Publishing, 1997 It was the first Tension Leg Platform permanently moored to the sea floor via tethers or tendons at each of the structures corners. Tethers could be removed and replaced using an innovative polar crane located at the top of the four corner columns. The Hutton TLP was originally designed for a service life of 25 years in the North Sea depth of 100 to 1000 metres. It had 16 tension legs. Its weigh varied between 46,500 and 55,000 tons when moored to the seabed, but up to 61,580 tons when floating freely.http://everything.but.architecture.pagesperso- orange.fr/Oilrig/oilrig.htm The total area of its living quarters was about 3,500 square metres and accommodated over a 100 cabins though only 40 people were necessary to maintain the structure in place. At the time of decommissioning the field was operated by Kerr-McGee. The TLP platform was removed for re-use outside the UK when the platform was purchased by Sevmorneftegaz, a subsidiary of Gazprom, in August 2002, and after having its decommissioning programme accepted by the UK Government. The floating platform was towed to Murmansk in Russia where the topsides facilities and main hull were de-mated. Subsequently, the topsides were transported by barge to the Sevmash fabrication yard at Severodvinsk, where they were temporarily stored while undergoing refurbishment and refitting. After completion the topsides were reinstalled onto a new hull structure of the Prirazlomnaya platform, and will be towed into position ready for a new role in the development of the Prirazlomnoye Field, north east of Arkhangelsk in the Pechora Sea. In early 2009 the hull of the former Hutton TLP was being towed from Murmansk to the Gulf of Mexico for reinstalling on a new structure, however the project was cancelled, and hull is currently cold-stacked in the Cromarty Firth, Scotland.http://www.offshore-mag.com/index/article- display.articles.offshore.regional-reports.north-sea-northwest- europe.2009.09.rig-stacks_underline.QP129867.dcmp=rss.page=1.html  North West Hutton  The North West Hutton field is located 130km north-east of the Shetland Islands in Block 211/27a in the UK North Sea. The water depth is 143m. The field was discovered in 1975 by the Amoco Group and the installation was operated by Amoco (UK) Exploration Company, the field had total estimated reserves of 487 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). The North West Hutton steel jacket platform was constructed by McDermott Scotland at Ardersier and was installed in September 1981 and production began in 1983. The topsides were designed by McDermot Engineering. The plant had a capacity of 50,000 barrels of oil per day and 30,000 barrels of produced water per day. The plant comprised two parallel 3-phase (oil, gas and produced water) first stage separators operating at a pressure of 440 kPa and a common 3-phase second stage separator operating at a pressure of 241 kPa. Oil shipping pumps with a capacity of 55,000 barrels per day delivered oil to the export pipeline to the Cormorant A installation at a pressure of 3447 kPa. Gas from the first stage and second stage separators was compressed to a pressure of 7791 kPa. Gas was dehydrated in a counter-current glycol dehydrator operating at 1000 kPa, the gas stream could also be passed through a zinc oxide unit to remove sulphur compounds. A turbo-expander/re-compressor unit and a Joule-Thomson valve allowed the gas to expand and chill (from 7550 kPa at 11 °C to 3931 kPa at –13 °C) to extract natural gas liquids (NGL). These, together with condensate from the compressor scrubbers, was co-mingled with the export oil stream. There was also a facility to reinject NGL to a well. Gas was re-compressed in the Sales Gas Compressors to a pressure of 13894 kPa for export by pipeline at a flowrate of per day at standard conditions or in later field life for gas lift of the wells at per day. Gas was exported to the Ninian Central installation. The first stage compressor (6702 brake horse power, BHP) and second stage compressors (5128 BHP) were driven by gas turbines as were the sales gas compressors (2700 BHP and 1630 BHP). Fuel gas consumption on the platform was per day. In later field life hydrocyclones were installed to remove oil from the produced water streams prior to discharge to sea.Process Flow Diagram North West Hutton Rev C01 dated 13.12.91 Production on North West Hutton ceased in 2002, and the Department of Trade and Industry approved decommissioning in 2006.

The breakage of a defective coupling caused seventeen coaches and one brake van, containing about 450 passengers, of an excursion train to run backwards down the steep gradient between the stations, colliding with a following second portion of the excursion. 14 passengers were killed and 50 injured in the disaster. In the words of the Board of Trade accident inspector, Captain H. W. Tyler, it was at the time \\"decidedly the worst railway accident that has ever occurred in this country\\".  Circumstances of the accident  On 23 August 1858 the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway ran a special day excursion from Wolverhampton to Worcester and back. It was intended to be for school children and their teachers only, but this ruling was not adhered to and the train was packed with roughly equal numbers (about 750 of each) of children and adults. The train left Wolverhampton at 9.12 AM, comprising 42 four-wheeled coaches and four brake vans. Braking of the train was supplied entirely by manual application of brakes on the engine (and tender) and the four brake vans (each van manned by a guard). Guard Cooke was in the rear brake van of the train, together with six passengers, who should not have been there. Cooke and his passengers were drinking and smoking in the van, and Cooke invited passengers to apply the van handbrake. Correct operation of the brake was necessary, not only to slow the train, but also to control the tension in the carriage couplings. There were three separate breakages of couplings ahead of the rear brake van on the outward journey: at Brettell Lane and Hagley both the main screw couplings and side safety chains failed, and at Droitwich it was found that another screw coupling was failed, but its associated side chains had held. Cooke made temporary repairs on all three occasions. To repair the first two breakages, Cooke managed to find spare three-link or screw couplings; but at Droitwich he was only able to patch up the side chains, which were not designed to hold the full weight of a train. On arrival at Worcester, the train was examined by the inspector of rolling stock: the repaired/replaced side chains were replaced by four-link goods couplings before the return journey, but no attempt was made to repair or replace failed centre couplings: these were difficult to access, and the inspector considered that a re-made screw coupling was weaker than the goods couplings (which he considered adequate).  The accident  On the return journey, the excursion train was divided into two portions: the first, with Guard Cooke in the rear brake van, comprised 28 coaches and two brake vans pulled by one locomotive as far as Stourbridge where a second locomotive was attached; and the second comprised 14 coaches and two brake vans, hauled by one locomotive. There was a 1 in 75 rising gradient between Brettell Lane and Round Oak, and the line was worked on the interval system, in which trains were allowed to follow the previous train without positive confirmation that it had reached the next station, relying instead on it having been an adequate (specified) time interval ahead at the last station. The first train reached Round Oak at about 8.10 pm; as it drew to a halt a foreman-platelayer heard a loud 'snap' as the coupling behind the eleventh coach broke and 17 coaches and the rear brake van began to roll back down the incline towards Brettell Lane. The booking clerk at Round Oak, seeing the runaway, attempted to telegraph Brettell Lane to give warning, but he was unable to attract the attention of the clerk there. The second train had reached Brettell Lane about eleven or twelve minutes behind the first, and therefore was clear to proceed to Round Oak. The line ran in a series of curves, limiting forward visibility, the night was dark, there were no lights in the coaches, excursion trains did not have to have a red light on the rearmost vehicle, and smoke was blowing across the line from neighbouring factories; consequently the crew of the second train did not see the runaway coaches until they were about 300 yards away. The second train had virtually drawn to a standstill when the runaway coaches collided with it. The locomotive of the second train remained on the rails and was only superficially damaged; the same was not true of the runaway coaches. Cooke's brakevan and the two coaches next to it were, in the words of the inspector \\"broken all to pieces\\", killing 14 passengers and badly injuring 50 more.  The investigation  The accident was investigated by Captain Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate; there was also a coroner's inquest on those who had died in the crash. Tyler showed by experiment that when a string of carriages matching the runaway train section was allowed to run back down the incline for quarter of a mile before the brake was applied, application of the brake then brought the carriages to rest well before the site of the collision. Furthermore, he considered that the severity of damage showed that no braking at all had been applied to the runaway. The brakescrew on the runaway brake van had been bent in the collision, and the nut was at the bottom of the working section of the screw, indicating that the brake had been off at the time of collision. Tyler therefore rejected Cooke's evidence that he had applied the brake as the train was arriving at Round Oak; the coupling had failed when he released the brake, but he had reapplied the brake on becoming aware of the breakaway; this had initially had some effect, but the runaway had then skidded down the incline with gathering speed. Instead, Tyler thought, Cooke had left the brake van as it arrived at Round Oak, without applying the brake, an obviously necessary precaution against a 'rebound of the buffers' (a shock loading on couplings as coaches hit and bounced back from the coach ahead): consequently a screw coupling had failed (the failed coupling had a grossly defective weld, as did many of the couplings examined on other coaches in the train) and the side chains had in their turn been unable to resist the shock loading. Cooke, thought Tyler, had been unable to regain the brakevan as the portion of the train to the rear of the failed coupling ran away but had either travelled down on the runaway or run after it sufficiently fast to reach the collision site soon after the collision. > A very few words will suffice for summing up, in conclusion, the causes of > this accident. A man was selected by the company for the important duty of > head guard to a heavy train who proved to be anything but trustworthy and > careful, and who, in not performing that duty with the attention that it > required, caused the fracture of a defective coupling, and permitted the > greater part of his train to run backwards down a steep gradient, on which > it came into violent collision with a following train. Tyler had not restricted his criticism to Cooke. The best insurance against failure of couplings was the selection of intelligent men of known character and steadiness for the execution of responsible duties. Cooke had worked for the company as a goods guard for eight years, and had acted as a guard on excursion trains over several summers. > It cannot for a moment be supposed that a man habitually trustworthy should > on this occasion only have so far forgotten himself as to invite the > passengers into his van, to smoke and drink with them, to employ them at his > brake handle, and four times to fracture the couplings in one day by his > carelessness; and if the company or their officers were not aware of his > character previously, then it can only be said that they ought to have been > aware of it, and that they ought to have used an amount of circumspection > that would have prevented them from appointing a careless man, as he proves > clearly to have been, to such important duties For a train of 28 carriages, two brake vans were inadequate, more than 28 carriages were needed to hold a thousand pleasure-seeking excursionists without over-crowding, and to maintain good order in a thousand pleasure- seeking excursionists more was needed than two guards (who had their normal duties to perform). The accident would not have been avoided or mitigated by specifying a longer interval between trains, or by a greater use of the telegraph. Tyler also noted two points which, whilst having no bearing on the accident, were, he felt, indicative of 'a want of proper discipline in the administration of the company' * the stipulation that the excursion was restricted to schoolchildren and their teachers had been systematically ignored * the record-book at Round Oak station (which recorded the time of arrival and departure of trains - thereby recording whether the interval system was being correctly worked to) had been filled up some three weeks before the accident, and no replacement had yet been procured; for the three weeks before the accident no record had been kept. Trial of the guard A coroner's inquisition was also held. In his summing up, the coroner directed the jury as follows > Almost all the scientific witnesses agreed in thinking that if Cook, the > guard, had applied his brake in a proper manner when the carriages separated > at the Round Oak Station, he would have stopped the train and have prevented > the collision, and thus have avoided the death of the unfortunate deceased. > If you believe that Cook could have done that in the ordinary performance of > his duties, as guard on that occasion, and did not do so, Cook will have > been guilty of manslaughter The jury duly found that Cooke should be charged with manslaughter.http://www.84f.com/chronology/1850s/18581006BP.html The case was considered by the Grand Jury at Staffordshire Assizes in November 1858. In his charge to the Grand Jury, Mr Baron Bramwell took a very different view of the case, and of the law, from the coroner: > It did so happen that persons in the situation of Cook were made scapegoats > of, in order to mollify public indignation at such occurrences, though he > would not say such was the case on this particular occasion. He might also > say that it was a very easy thing for scientific gentlemen to get quietly > into a train and make experiments, with the knowledge that the result could > bring them into no trouble, and then to say what they could do about > stopping a train. This was very different from what a man would do in the > hurry of the moment, and under such circumstances in which Cook was placed. > If the guard mismanaged his brake, not from want of any intention or > opportunity, but because he became frightened, it might show that the man > was unfit for his situation, but it could not make him guilty of > manslaughter. \\"His lordship, having observed … that there was evidence to show that the guard was doing his best to stop the train by applying the brake, went on to remark that\\" > when a man had a duty to perform, if he performed it negligently, and death > ensued in consequence, he was liable for the consequences; but a man was not > guilty of manslaughter merely because he did not do that which a stronger or > more clever or cool-headed person would have done under similar > circumstances. There must, in fact, be culpability or something blameable in > the prisoner to warrant the grand jury in finding a true bill The grand jury found no case to answer; Cook was then charged on the basis of the coroner's inquisition, but no evidence was offered and he was duly acquitted. Reporting this, the Worcestershire Chronicle noted \\"This result entirely fulfils our prognostications as to the failure of this unfounded and unjustifiable prosecution.\\"  See also  * Railway coupling * List of steepest gradients on adhesion railways  Notes   Sources  * External links *Extracts from The Birmingham Post : **The Railway Catastrophe near Dudley (1 October 1858) **The Railway Accident near Bretell Lane, verdict of manslaughter against Cooke, the guard.

It is the sixth and last serial of the third series. This story features \\"the Blathereen\\", a family of Raxacoricofallapatorians distinct from the previously seen Slitheen. In the story, the Blathereen, a family from Raxacoricofallapatorius, gift the Earth with a plant from their homeworld via the ambassadorship of alien investigator Sarah Jane Smith, as an apparent token of apology for all of the past transgressions the criminal family the Slitheen have committed against the human race. Plot Part 1 The story begins with Sarah Jane and her companions chasing an overweight boy. After chasing him into a warehouse, he is revealed to be a Slitheen working with another family member, in an attempt to use a matter compressor to compress Earth into a diamond, in order to make themselves rich. After Sarah Jane's sonic lipstick fails, she calls K9 who tries to destroy it. Annoyed, the Slitheen grab Rani and hold her hostage, threatening to kill her if K9 continues to destroy their equipment, and Sarah Jane complies. Two orange Raxacoricofallapatorians appear and teleport the Slitheen away, stating that they have been sent back to their ship for trial. They then introduce themselves as the Blathereen, a separate, and according to them, law-abiding family of Raxacoricofallapatorians on a mission to track down members of the Slitheen and sentence them to death. As a token of thanks, the Blathereen visit Sarah Jane in Rani's house for a meal of shepherd's pie, which the Blathereen enjoy very much. After the meal, the Blathereen--Leef and Tree--give Sarah Jane a Raxacoricofallapatorian plant called Rakweed. They explain that the plant \\"can grow anywhere, even in the harshest conditions,\\" adding that because the people of Earth would be suspicious if the plant came directly from the Blathereen, that they would like Sarah Jane to be their ambassador. Mr Smith analyses the plant and deems it not to be dangerous, but the following night it starts to mutate. The next morning, the Rakweed plant releases spores, most of which fly out of the window, though some are inhaled by Luke. Rani and Clyde go to school, and Clyde surreptitiously takes K9 with him, intending to cheat on his Biology exam. Luke then finds himself falling ill, which is unusual for him as he has never been sick before, so he stays home. Mr Smith analyses Luke, determining that the inhaled spores would proceed to drain him of energy, resulting in a coma from which he would never recover. Meanwhile, Clyde and Rani are in science class preparing for the exam. Clyde uses an earbud device to enable K9 to discreetly give him the answers to the test's questions, despite K9's reluctance to do so. Just as the test begins, Rani spots a Rakweed plant growing in a nearby plant pot, which gains their teacher's attention. Just as the teacher inspects it, the Rakweed blasts a large amount of spores in her face, causing her to fall unconscious due to the illness. Everyone flees the classroom in panic and soon, the entire area is covered in Rakweed, resulting in several civilians affected by its spores to be rushed to the emergency room. In the attic, Sarah Jane is staying close to Luke, whose condition has worsened and is now covered in a strange rash. Things then take a turn for the worse when the Rakweed releases more spores and the episode concludes with the spores hurtling towards Sarah Jane and Luke. Part 2 As the Rakweed spores head toward Luke and Sarah Jane, Mr Smith reveals a powerful extractor fan behind his screen and removes the spores from the attic. Rani and Clyde attempt escape from the school where the Rakweed is taking over, but it becomes harder when they find Rakweed growing indoors as well as outdoors. Sarah Jane follows the transporter trace of the Blathereen to Antarctica, where she threatens them with a water gun loaded with vinegar. The Blathereen then apologise and announce that they will remove the Rakweed crop, claiming they never meant for it to go out of control. Unfortunately, this is revealed to be a trick and Sarah Jane is captured by the Blathereen, who reveal that they are from a mixed marriage of Slitheen- Blathereen. She also learns that they are addicted to the Rakweed, on which they are gorging themselves and intend to use the Earth to continue farming it. Meanwhile, Rani, Clyde and K9 are still attempting to escape from the Rakweed and its spores. Just when they find a window big enough for them to squeeze through, a nearby Rakweed plant unleashes its spores, but just before it strikes Rani and Clyde, the school bell starts ringing, destroying the Rakweed. They then realise that the Rakweed's weakness is loud noise, which disrupts its communication signals and prevents it from growing, thus killing it instantly. After escaping from the Blathereen, Sarah Jane returns to find Luke on the brink of unconsciousness. With no time to lose, Sarah Jane makes contact with Clyde, Rani and K9 and after explaining the Rakweed's weakness, they decide to use Mr Smith and K9 to activate all sound-producing devices in the area at the loudest possible frequency. K9 gives Mr Smith the frequency for the school bell and within seconds, all bells, alarms, radios and car alarms go off and the loudness ultimately destroys all the Rakweed. Luke is immediately cured and Sarah Jane is relieved to see him well again. Rani and Clyde return with K9 and they come clean about Clyde's attempts to use K9 for cheating on the biology exam. Sarah Jane tells Clyde that he does not need to cheat and needs to have more faith in his own abilities. Enraged at their plans being ruined, the Blathereen teleport to the attic and threaten to destroy everyone. Mr Smith generates the same frequency, destroying the partially digested Rakweed in their stomachs. The resultant build-up of methane gas in the Blathereens' stomachs causes them to explode. Clyde is then told to clean up the mess and they all later celebrate with a barbecue. Continuity *Sarah Jane visited Antarctica once before with the Fourth Doctor serial The Seeds of Doom. *The Blathereen had previously featured in the Doctor Who novel, The Monsters Inside by Stephen Cole. *This is the first reference to the Raxacoricofallapatorian family known as the Racdeen. *Part 1 includes K9's second reference to his hover mode, the first being in The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith, Part 1; he has never been actually seen hovering. *Sarah Jane uses a dog whistle to call K9; a trick used by the Fourth Doctor in the episode The Ribos Operation. *The use of plants as a weapon could be a reference to the deadly Varga plants in the episode \\"Mission to the Unknown\\". *This episode marks the second time that K9 has been in a school; the first being the Doctor Who episode \\"School Reunion\\". *Mr Smith hacking into millions of personal electronic devices and causing them to simultaneously emit a unified signal was done before, during his guest appearance in the Doctor Who episode, \\"Journey's End\\". The use of millions of personal electronic devices to transmit a simultaneous signal damaging to an alien aggressor is also reminiscent of Martha Jones' use of the Archangel Network against The Master in \\"Last of the Time Lords\\". After this episode, Sarah Jane and Luke briefly appeared in The Tenth Doctor's final story, \\"The End of Time\\". *Upon defeating the Blathereen, Sarah Jane says \\"There should have been a better way,\\" as part of an atypically sombre scene where the characters are experiencing a pyrrhic victory. This is similar to the Fifth Doctor's final comment in the serial Warriors of the Deep, in which that story's enemies also suffered an unnecessary death and the death of the human race was narrowly averted; in the case of The Sarah Jane Adventures, the cause for despair is given a more comical twist for the programme's target audience. *In Part 2, a news reporter mentions the \\"tropical disease\\" (Rakweed) had affected Perivale. Perivale is Ace's home neighbourhood. Broadcast and reception \\"Part 1\\" was seen by 822,000 viewers, while \\"Part 2\\" was seen by 788,000.

The village is located three miles from the market town of Tewkesbury and features \\"a great number of interesting buildings\\", fine views, several duck ponds, a church, a collection of thatched cottages and farmsteads, a village hall and a village club. Forthampton was designated a Conservation Area in 2003 due to its special architectural and historic interest, character and appearance which it was desirable to preserve and enhance.Forthampton Conservation Area Character Statement, February 2004. Notable features of the village include extensive historic buildings clustered around farm houses situated at the centre of the village, the many roadside ponds and grass verges around and between buildings and significant panoramic views. The village forms a wide arc on rising, elevated ground well above the flood-plain of the Severn, from Hill End on the south to Sezincote on the east. Near the crown of the arc is the greatest concentration of houses and the church.British History Online, http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol8/pp196-208 The centre of the village is approximately 175' above sea level affording fine views over the Severn Valley. The Church Forthampton is home to the church of St Mary the Virgin, which was grade II listed in 1955. The church is of significant historical interest and forms part of the wider Severnside Benefice, which comprises the Parishes of Chaceley, Forthampton, Deerhurst with Apperley, and Tredington with Stoke Orchard and Hardwicke. The Benefice is set in the Severn Vale, and is part of the Diocese of Gloucester. The church consists of a nave, chancel, north aisle, west tower, and south porch. The tower is 13th-century with massive diagonal west buttresses and a stair-vice on the north-east corner. The tower has three stages and a plain parapet. The font is a memorial to Susan Plumtre who died in 1849. It is elaborately fashioned in stone and marble. There is stained glass in the church - in the west window of the north aisle - by Clayton & Bell, 1862. The chancel was restored in 1864-66 by William Burges, who also added the reredos, the altar rails, and some stained glass. In the churchyard, there is a whipping post and stocks, west of the church. The post has manacles and stocks for three which have survived from 1787. At the bottom of the hill is the Pound Pond, which is believed to have been the ducking pool for scolding wives. Forthampton was originally owned by the Church, hence such street names as 'Bishop's Walk' and 'Church Lane'. The abbots of Tewkesbury used Forthampton Court as a residence from the mid twelfth to mid sixteenth centuries.Forthampton Conservation Area Statement Yorke Almshouses Yorke Almshouses To the east of the Church stands a row of four almshouses by William Burges of 1863-64.

Mfd functions in transcription-coupled repair to remove a stalled RNA polymerase that has encountered DNA damage and is unable to continue translocating.  About  Mfd utilizes ATP to translocate along DNA, most likely forcing RNA polymerase forward and ultimately dissociating it from the DNA template. Mfd also contains binding domains which recruit UvrA and trigger the associated nucleotide excision repair pathway and was initially discovered when its mutation led to a decrease in mutation rates after irradiation by UV light. Structural studies of E. coli Mfd by X-ray crystallography have revealed that this molecule is autoinhibited for UvrA-binding in its apo form due to a \\"clamp\\" interaction between the N-terminal UvrB-homology module and the C-terminal domain. In 2002, it was shown that Mfd may also re-initiate transcription at backtracked RNAP by forcing the polymerase forward and out of its backtracked state. In 2015, Merrikh Lab at University of Washington discovered the bacterial protein called Mutation Frequency Decline (Mfd) quickens the bacterial mutation process. This work researches ways to slow the rate of bacterial mutations and to block their evolution, in order to fight against antibiotic resistance.

First, in the middle of the German occupation in Paris, she falls for a Nazi, which indirectly leads to the death of her father.

Adults measure about long. It is a fossorial scorpion with relatively large, strong claws (pedipalps) and a short, thin tail.  Distribution  The native range of E. flavicaudis extends through Northwest Africa and Southern Europe, but it has also been accidentally introduced into the United Kingdom at Sheerness Dockyard on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. The introduction is thought to have taken place in the early 19th century via a shipment of Italian masonry. The resulting colony, numbering 10,000 to 15,000 individuals in 2013, is the northernmost population of scorpions known.Distribution Habitat In warm temperate climates, this species can be found in built-up areas. In the UK, the scorpion occupies cracks and holes in walls where the mortar pointing has crumbled away. Venom It is a mildly venomous scorpion, which rarely uses its stinger. Their sting is less painful than a bee sting to humans.Venom Reproduction The gestation period is 10–14 months, depending on the availability of food and the prevalent climate. After union with the male, a pregnant female looks for a secluded, humid place to give birth to live young, from a few to about 30, which are white, soft, and swollen. The mother raises her forelegs to facilitate the release of the young, which then climb onto her back, where they remain until the first moult (about 6 six days). After that, the young start to wander around the surrounding area, but remain together close to the hiding place for a few days. The young scorpions reach adulthood after 1-2 years.Reproduction  Feeding  E. flavicaudis is an ambush predator, lying motionless at the entrance to its lair, but moving quickly to capture prey that wanders by. The main prey of E. flavicaudis are woodlice, although most small insects are taken. Cannibalism has been noted in colonies of E. flavicaudis. Thanks to their low metabolic rate these scorpions may go for long periods of time without food and subsist on as few as four or five woodlice per year.

As the soil has high fertility value there is no need of fertilizer to cultivate paddy which will give high yields to the farmers. However, the main problem faced by farmers is that the fields are covered with water for the whole year. If needed, farmers' association takes initiatives to dry the fields by using water pumps, but it is very expensive and local self-government authorities help is needed for it to take place. If the fields in Polachira get dry and are suitable for paddy cultivation during May, November,January. Unscientific construction of bund affected three times paddy cultivations. Consequently, there are complaints from farmers that the authorities of the local self-government intend to catch and sell fish from Polachira by drying its fields and have no intention to help the farmers in their paddy cultivation.  Tourism  There is a high scope to develop Polachira as a tourist spot. But the relevant authorities have not yet taken action for it.

Early life and education Batts was born in Washington D.C. and lived there until he was 5 years old when his family relocated to San Francisco and then several years laterLos Angeles. He grew up in South Los Angeles . Batts has earned a Doctorate in Public Administration, a Master in Business Management, and a Bachelor of Science in Law Enforcement Administration. Career 2000s Batts was chief of police for the Californian cities of Oakland and Long Beach. He worked in the Long Beach Police Department for 27 years, rising to Chief of Police in 2002. Under Batts, homicides decreased 45% and overall crime decreased 13% in Long Beach. The drop in violent crime rate in the city was the lowest in nearly 40 years. He led the police department for seven years. In 2006, as chief of police in Long Beach, Batts became embroiled in \\"lobstergate\\": three officers reported colleagues for fishing for lobsters while on duty. Batts allegedly called the reporting officers \\"malcontents\\" and forced them into a variety of bad assignments in retribution. The officers sued and won a case and LBPD & Batts in 2008 and were awarded $1 million each by a jury. Batts left Long Beach PD shortly afterwards. Batts has said that he was motivated to seek the Oakland Chief of Police job by the aftermath of the killing of four Oakland police officers in March 2009. He was appointed Chief of Police in late 2009. In mid 2011 Batts applied to the San Jose Police Department without informing the Mayor of his intention to leave. Having lost confidence of both the Mayor and the rank-and-file officers he resigned in October 2011.

On December 23, 2014, Batts was named in a lawsuit by a whistle blower in the Baltimore Police Department for failing to protect the officer from retaliation for reporting severe brutality. The suit was settled on June 1, 2016 (after Batts was fired) for $42,000. On July 8, 2015, Batts was fired from the Baltimore Police Department in the aftermath of a spike in homicide rates weeks after the 2015 Baltimore riots. Reports also cited the controversial handling of Freddie Gray's arrest as the cause of Batt's removal. Gray died in police custody. Batts has received various awards and commendations for heroism, crime reduction, community activism, and innovative programs, including California State University Long Beach Alumni of the Year, Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Citizen Award in the cities of Long Beach and Oakland, and Leadership Long Beach Alumnus of the Year. Batts was also honored by the Anti-Defamation League for community outreach efforts to erase antisemitism, bigotry, and other such intolerances.

In many of his first-class matches, he opened the batting with his identical twin brother, Sydney Rippon. The Rippon family hailed from London but had relocated to Radstock in Somerset, and the twins were sent to school at King's College, Taunton, where they made a lot of runs and caused confusion by their close resemblance to each other. Sydney joined the Knowle Cricket Club in Bristol and scored heavily in club cricket; Dudley got a job on a Bath newspaper and played for a local team. Dudley Rippon was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler. He played regularly for Somerset in the 1914 season and was joined in his third match by his brother, with whom he opened the innings. In his fourth match, against Sussex, he carried his bat for an unbeaten 105 (though Somerset had two players injured and unable to bat in this innings). Rippon himself was also injured in this match and had to use a runner. Later in the same season, in the match against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, he took five Yorkshire wickets in an innings for 107 runs, the only time he returned a five-wicket-innings analysis; Somerset lost the match by an innings inside two days, but Rippon also top-scored in each Somerset innings. Following Britain's entry into the First World War on 4 August 1914, Rippon was commissioned into the horse transport section of the Army Service Corps as a second lieutenant. He was badly wounded during the Gallipoli Campaign, which he had joined on 5 November 1915. As a result of his wounds he was discharged with the Silver War Badge and the honorary rank of lieutenant. On 10 October 1918 he managed to obtain a new commission as a second lieutenant in the Administrative Branch of the fledgling Royal Air Force and was based in Edmonton, London. Despite his wartime injuries, he appeared fairly regularly for Somerset again in 1919. Against Essex at Leyton, he and Sydney put on 144 for the first Somerset wicket, and Dudley went on to score 134, his highest first-class score. But after this season, he made just one further first-class appearance, in the 1920 season, his wounds finally taking their toll. His brother continued to play occasional matches for Somerset through to 1937. After his retirement from first-class cricket, Rippon became cricket correspondent for the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News and Daily Chronicle.

It stars Alex Descas, Mati Diop, Nicole Dogue, and Grégoire Colin. It tells the story of a father-daughter relationship complicated by the arrival of an attractive young man. The film had its world premiere out of competition at the 65th Venice International Film Festival on 2 September 2008. It was released in France on 18 February 2009, and in Germany on 5 March 2009. Plot Lionel (Alex Descas), a widower who drives RER trains in metropolitan Paris, has raised his daughter Josephine (Mati Diop) alone for many years. They have always shared a special bond and live a secure and contented life somewhat isolated from others, in an apartment building in a suburb of Paris. Josephine, an anthropology student, is now grown and become a young woman, but she remains deeply devoted to her father. They have developed a loose family with some of the other residents of the building: Gabrielle (Nicole Dogue), a cab driver, who once had a love affair with Lionel; and Noé (Grégoire Colin), a moody young man who lives with his cat and has feelings for Josephine. Noé leads a disorganized life and goes abroad often. Gabrielle appears to have feelings for Lionel and motherly feelings towards Josephine. However, both father and daughter are ambivalent toward more than a casual friendship with anyone outside their special relationship. While attending the retirement party for a colleague and friend, Lionel declines to try the customary feat of downing 35 shots of rum. His colleague appears to be lost without his job, and Lionel realizes that time is moving on. He (Lionel) must find meaning and security in things other than his present life, lest he end up the same way. During an outing with Gabrielle and Noé, their car breaks down and the four friends take refuge in a closed bar. Noé shows his feelings for Josephine, and Lionel realizes that she must eventually leave him. He knows that she needs to live her own life independent of him. It is subtly suggested that Josephine decides to marry Noé in a scene of her emotionally charged visit to Noé's apartment. When Lionel's former colleague commits suicide on the RER tracks, Lionel has to stop his train when he comes across the body. The father and the daughter then go on a long car trip to visit her mother's tomb in Germany before her wedding. In the final scene, Josephine weds a nervous but happy Noé. At the party, Lionel successfully downs 35 shots of rum in celebration of the occasion. It is not clear whether he does so in joy or in sadness. He returns home to live alone. Cast Production For the film, director Claire Denis got inspiration from Yasujirō Ozu's film Late Spring, as well as a relationship between her own mother and grandfather. She wrote the screenplay with Jean-Pol Fargeau. The film was shot by Agnès Godard. Tindersticks wrote the score for the film. The Commodores song Nightshift_(song) was featured in the film. Release The film had its world premiere out of competition at the 65th Venice International Film Festival on 2 September 2008. It was released in France on 18 February 2009, and in Germany on 5 March 2009. It was also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and the New York Film Festival. Reception Critical response On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 65 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"This slow-moving French family drama is rich, complex, subtle and emotionally eloquent.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Jay Weissberg of Variety wrote, \\"Claire Denis' latest may appear whisper-thin on the surface, yet it's marvelously profound, illuminating the love between a father and daughter but also highlighting the difficulty of relinquishing what most people spend a lifetime putting into place.\\" Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"French art house cinema at its unpretentious best.\\" Sight & Sound included it on the \\"30 Great Films of the 2000s\\" list.

It is native to the western United States, where it is known from about ten locations in and around the Great Basin within the states of Idaho, Oregon, and California. Specimens of the plant had been catalogued as Mimulus breviflorus, but on further examination it was evident that they were a separate, unclassified species; this was described to science in 1995. It is thought that the plant may have evolved via hybridization between M. breviflorus and M. latidens, or that M. evanescens evolved from M. latidens and then into M. breviflorus. M. evanescens is a succulent annual herb coated with tiny glandular hairs and having a somewhat slimy texture. The thin stems grow mostly erect to a maximum height near 25 centimeters. The leaves are lance-shaped to oval and up to 4 centimeters long by 3 wide. The flowers are small and barely open, their tubular bases enclosed in a ribbed calyx of sepals which becomes papery and inflated as the fruits mature. The flower is less than a centimeter long and is mostly yellow in color, sometimes with brownish dots in the throat. M. evanescens has been observed in rocky sagebrush habitat, especially in areas still moist from early spring soaking.USFS Sensitive Vascular Plant Profile Most of the areas where the plant grows are on rangeland used for grazing livestock.

To fulfill its statutory functions, the regional councils function as courts, hearing complaints against physicians and establishing the ethical and professional punishments when there is evidence of ethical violations. The penalties, as provided by law, may consist of confidential warnings, private censure, public censure, suspension of professional practice for 30 days, and forfeiture of professional practice.

It lost its role as population center to Rattan, and on October 31, 1954 its post office was closed. During the 1970s the filling of the newly constructed Hugo Lake reservoir on the Kiamichi River took much of the formerly rich agricultural land south of Belzoni, and submerged a well-known local landmark along the river known as the “Belzoni Narrows.” Belzoni is named for Giovanni Battista Belzoni,Shirk, George H.

Major Animals * Curious George: A tailless monkey who is the protagonist of the show. He is excessively curious and often causes unintentional problems. He is used as the \\"teachable\\" character in the show, and he is the one to whom new concepts are explained in detail by the other characters. He is a character that children enjoy watching and can learn from. (Voiced by Frank Welker) * Hundley: An orange male dachshund. Hundley is very proper and gentlemanly; he keeps vigil on the lobby of George's apartment building when his owner, the Doorman, is absent. George's behavior is not enjoyed by Hundley but despite this, he enjoys George's company. However, Hundley is very practical minded, and does not shy away from scolding George for reckless antics. Hundley is allergic to some cats, including Professor Wiseman's kitten Lucky, but not to Chef Pisghetti's cat Gnocchi. (Voiced by Bill Chott (Season 1), Lex Lang (Season 2-9)) * Compass: A blue male homing pigeon, also cared for by the doorman. His sense of direction is substandard, he is therefore often referred to as an \\"Almost-Homing Pigeon\\". In the early seasons he is shown attempting mentally to discover what George was. (Cooing by Rob Paulsen) * Jumpy Squirrel: A male squirrel who lives in the country. Although he primarily stays in the trees, he will often end up involved with George. A recurring joke in the series is when Jumpy gets caught in a situation with George and the narrator says \\"At that moment Jumpy remembered why he always stayed in trees.\\" (Voiced by Jim Cummings) * Gnocchi: A beige female cat, who is owned by Chef Pisghetti. She is very sedate and contemplative, frequently disregarding the surrounding people. (Voiced by Debi Derryberry) * Charkie: A female black cocker spaniel owned by Steve and Betsy. Charkie is very hyperactive, loves doing backflips, and frequently runs away from her caretakers. She is very skilled in opening and unlocking things. (Voiced by Rob Paulsen) * Bill's Bunnies: Seven baby bunnies owned by Bill. Their names are Fuzzy, Whitey, Brownie, Spotty, Black Ears, Cotton Tail, and Herbert Nenninger. He also owns their mother (Ma Rabbit), whose burrowing abilities are highlighted in several episodes. In several episodes, most notably the perfect carrot, Fuzzy and Black Ears are omitted from the group, with George expecting only five to be present. (They are all voiced by Frank Welker) Note: In Curious George's Bunny Hunt, Herbert Nenninger is a brownish- tannish color. In Bee is for Bear, he is white. However, in Curious George's Bunny Hunt, the only white bunny is Whitey. People * Narrator: The Narrator is the unnamed storyteller who narrates the events of each episode of the show. He mostly talks about the feelings of George and The Man with the Yellow Hat along with their actions. (Voiced by: William H. Macy (Season 1), Rino Romano (Season 2-9)) * The Man with the Yellow Hat: The man who first befriended George and also acts as his primary teacher and mentor. In a 2006 deleted scene, it was revealed that his real name is Ted Shackleford.http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/wayoflife/06/13/mf.real.names.fictional.characters/index.html He does not wear his hat at home but wears it when going in public. the Man often has bad luck and makes mistakes (such as constantly losing his hat, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, tasting something terrible with a sour reaction, etc.). He is also absent-minded and a bit awkward. His catchphrase when leaving George alone is often \\"Be a good little monkey.\\" Or sometimes his catchphrase is \\"Come on. Can't be late.\\" when the Man leaves with George. He never gets angry with George, no matter what George does. It is unclear what his occupation is, but in Curious George and the Invisible Sound he has been asked to survey animals around the country house, and in The Fully Automatic Monkey Fun Hat, Dr. Wiseman has asked him to give a speech about the scientific method, Which may imply that he has the same occupation he held in the 2006 film. He also is the leader of a troop of the Sprouts, to which George and Bill belong. The man makes a couple of references to \\"going to work\\"; however, we never discover what this pertains to. He owns a country house that has been in his family since his childhood; and also lives in a spacious, high-income apartment building in the city. The man primarily drives a yellow convertible car as his main transportation to the country; however, he usually walks when staying in the apartment. The Man's hobbies include playing the tuba, bowling, sketching and painting pictures, and long-distance running. He also paints in the style of the H. A. Rey drawings. He won an award for being the first to climb and map what became known as Yellow Hat Mountain and placed seventeenth in a marathon. No mention of his parents is never made, other than an occasional reference to his mother in a few episodes. (Voiced by Jeff Bennett) * The Doorman: The doorman for the apartment building in which George and the Man with the Yellow Hat live. He is Hundley's owner. When on duty, he wears red clothes similar to a British Sentry Guard; different only by a red cap. When he went camping with George and Hundley, he wore an outfit somewhat similar to that of a Canadian Mountie. He is friendly and always loves to see George. He keeps a coop of homing pigeons on the roof of the building. Like the Man with the Yellow Hat, the Doorman's name is never mentioned. The doorman has a noticeable Brooklyn accent. (Voiced by Bill Chott (Season 1), Lex Lang (Season 2-9)) * Professor Wiseman: A scientist friend of George and the Man. In different episodes she is seen to be a rocket scientist, and working at a local museum. Her name is a play on the words wise man. She seems to have an occupation directly related to the man with the yellow hat. She is frequently invited to spend time with the man with the yellow hat and George. (Voiced by Rolonda Watts) * Chef Pisghetti and Netti: An Italian chef in the City who owns a restaurant with his wife. George frequently visits him and often helps him by doing errands and chores around the restaurant. The Chef often uses the fresh vegetables he grows in a rooftop garden. His name is a reference to the way some toddlers pronounce the word \\"spaghetti.\\" Often, when things seem to go wrong, the Chef's catchphrase is \\"I'm Ruined!\\" He often threatens to never cook again if there is any problem with his food. He often refers to George as the Italian equivalent \\"Giorgio\\" and referred to the Man with the Yellow Hat at least once with an Italian name when speaking to George, calling him \\"Your friend with the Cappello Giallo Grande, or \\"Big Yellow Hat\\". (Incidentally, Google Translate says that \\"Big Yellow Hat is said as grande cappello giallo.) (Chef Pisghetti is voiced by Jim Cummings and Netti is voiced by Susan Silo) * The Renkins: A couple who own a farm near the country house. They have horses, cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, a goat, a sheepdog named Bo, and bees. George also sometimes borrows materials from them, including a water pump and scrap lumber. (Mr. Renkins is voiced by Jeff Bennett and Mrs. Renkins is voiced by Kath Soucie) * Marco: A Mexican boy who lives in The Puerto Del Sol district, a Mexican neighborhood in the city, he and his family play Spanish music anywhere. He often claims that he's always thinking, saying \\"I'm always thinking,\\" referring to the fact that he is always thinking about ways to solve a problem and he is always analyzing a situation. (Voiced by Grey DeLisle (Season 1), Elizabeth Daily (Season 2)) * Allie: The five-year-old granddaughter of the Renkins, who is first introduced in George Meets Allie- Whoops! where she and George become fast friends. Allie is a very perky and spunky little girl who is about George's height and is as adventurous and curious as he. Mrs. Renkins refers to her as a “spark plug.” When she first meets George, she is excited and eager to learn the ways of a monkey. (Voiced by Lara Jill Miller) * Bill: George's neighbor from across the street in the country. He owns a hutch of bunnies and has a paper route. He also enjoys flying kites, but seems to be an acrophobic. His catchphrases are, \\"There's a proper way to ....\\" And \\"why didn't I think of that\\". Bill has a copious knowledge of many subjects, but apparently does not realize that George is a monkey and often refers to him as a \\"city kid\\" to explain the odd things George does. (Voiced by Annie Mumolo) * Steve and Betsy: Siblings from George's neighborhood in the city. They live with their Aunt Margaret and their dog, Charkie. Steve likes video games and is always \\"going for a record\\" of some kind. He is the older child of the duo, and is always obtaining ideas on how to solve a problem. He often tells George, \\"I'm in fifth grade. This has to work.\\" In the episode Piñata Vision, their Aunt called him by his full name, Steven. Betsy is more responsible and caring, and is often pulling a red wagon. She is frequently annoyed at Steve, and has to fix his mistakes. She is in third grade. Bill is seemingly the country counterpart to Steve and Betsy. They do not appear in the same episode until Season 3, in \\"Chasing Rainbows.\\" In that episode Bill's ignorance of George being a monkey is elucidated by them. However, he still does not comprehend the fact. (Steve is voiced by Elizabeth Daily and Betsy is voiced by Grey DeLisle) * Mr. Glass: A man who owns a building known as \\"The Glass Palace\\" and hires window washers in the City. In his debut episode, he has George clean his windows after he helped Chef Pisghetti dry dishes in his kitchen. Later, George uncovers a catastrophic flaw in a building that Mr. Glass was constructing, though Mr. Glass is still pleased with the building's new angular shape, deciding that it will save money and even rewards George with a new dollar bill. He likes things to be unique ever since George painted a jungle-themed room in The Glass Palace. On a few occasions, he yells at George for doing something he wasn't supposed to do, though he is still pleased with him. Mr. Glass is very wealthy and speaks with a high pitched accent, similar to Gilbert Gottfried. (Voiced by Rob Paulsen; with the vocal impression of Gilbert Gottfried) * Dinwoodie (Voiced by Jess Harnell) * Mr. Zoobel: George's upstairs neighbor in the City. Mr. Zoobel is a painter in a modern (non-representational) style who sometimes uses stamps shaped like animal feet. He has a de-scented pet skunk named Geoffrey, a gopher snake named Bruno, and two mice named Benjy and Willy. When he first moved in, he used the stamps so much it made a loud stomping noise in George's apartment downstairs making George think he lived with an elephant. (Voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) * Mr. and Mrs. Quint: Mr. Quint is one of George's country friends, Clint Quint is an avid fisherman and one of a set of quintuplets. His siblings are a sister who is a track runner (Sprint), a brother who is a train-station master (Flint), a brother who is a police officer (Wint), and a sister who prints money (Mint). (All male Quints are voiced by Jim Cummings. All female Quints are voiced by Candi Milo) Minor Animals * Benjy & Willy: Mr. Zoobel's pet mice who are respectively black and white. They feel cooped up in their small terrarium and long for freedom. They are afraid of Zoobel's gopher snake Bruno because snakes eat mice. (Squeaks by Frank Welker) * Bruno: Mr. Zoobel's pet gopher snake who only eats once a day. He sheds his skin 3 times a year. Like many snakes, he likes sunshine. (Voiced by Frank Welker) * Doxie: Doxie is another dachshund who was introduced in Season 2. She is almost similar to Hundley in appearance, except that she wears a red collar; however, unlike Hundley, Doxie is bouncy and playful. (Voiced by Lex Lang) * Fluffy: In the episode Monkey Fever, Fluffy was a cat who belonged to Betsy's friend and had six kittens. Betsy brought one of the kittens over to George's apartment to show him. (Voiced by Frank Welker) * Geoffrey: Mr. Zoobel's pet skunk. He is descented and domesticated. * Leslie: Leslie is a cow, owned by the Renkins. She's a great friend of George.

However, George built a wall to protect the flowers, resulting Leslie and her cows sparing it. (Voiced by Rob Paulsen) * Little Mike: Mike is a pig owned by the Renkins. He first appears in Ski Monkey, when he is stranded in the snow. He also appears in Old McGeorgie had a Farm. * Lucky: Lucky is Professor Wiseman's kitten, introduced in season 2.

(Voiced by Debi Derryberry) * Oscar: A white pig owned by the Renkins who won the \\"prettiest pig\\" contest in (Old McGeorgie had a Farm). * Sue Berm: An elephant who works at the zoo as a painter and is presumably Mr. Zoobel's pet elephant. Every one of her paintings is unique. She signs a painting by marking it with her trunk with green paint when she is done. In the episode she debuts in, Mr. Glass seemingly believes that she's human upon finding out about her by Mr. Zoobell, only to find out she's an elephant herself and not having her own pets. When Charkie accidentally destroys the painting of Sue Berm, George and Sue Berm decide to create a replica of it. * Tracy: Tracy is a hen, owned by the Renkins. She has five (Up the River) or six (Old McGeorgie had a Farm and A Bridge to Farm) chicks who follow her around everywhere. The chicks also like George and often follow him around too. The chicks are curious just like George and are often wandering away from Tracy. The youngest of her chicks is named Al. (Voiced by Rob Paulsen (Season 1), Frank Welker (Season 2)) People * Ada & Luke: A couple who own a general store in the country. The store gives a free pickle to anyone who comes and visits.

(Andie is voiced by Elizabeth Daily, Stig by Rob Paulsen in season 1 and Jim Cummings in season 2, and Stew is voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) * Calhoun the Gopher Getter: A gopher exterminator in the country who is nerdy and has buck teeth, serving as the main antagonist of the episode Monkey Underground. He was hired by Mr. Renkins to eliminate a gopher family that was taking his grapes. However, this disgusts George, not liking the idea of someone catching innocent gophers, so he attempts to build a connecting tunnel for them to escape. Calhoun attempts to feed a gopher grapes in an attempt to capture it, though he is trapped in a gopher trap himself. As a result, Calhoun resorted to bulldoze the Renkins' garden at a last attempt to catch the gophers, resulting him accidentally capturing George by mistake. As a result, he was fired by Mr. Renkins, who decides to let the gophers stay. Oddly enough, he looks similar to a gopher himself. (Voiced by Rob Paulsen) * Vicky and Vinny: Vicky and Vinny are African American siblings who live in the country near George and the Man with the Yellow Hat. They were introduced in 2007 in the episode Ski Monkey, where they help George get back home after a heavy snowfall.

(Voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) * Dr. Ghesund: Another doctor who works in the same office as Dr. Baker. In his debut episode, he was shown playing a video game, losing track of time to check on his recent patients. His name is similar to the German word for \\"bless you\\", \\"Gesundheit.\\" (Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) * Dr. Raj Desai: A scientist that dug up all of the city Museum's dinosaur skeletons. He is very protective of his discoveries and only lets other scientists handle them. He is very forgetful though and his wife often tells him he'd forget his head if it weren't attached. His newest donated project to the museum had the incorrect skull; the correct one was placed on the older skeleton next to it. * Grocer: He owns the grocery store near George's apartment building in the city, and has an adult son who helps him run the store. (Voiced by Jim Cummings) * Gwen & Sisly: The respectively White & Black women who work at the city animal pound. * Mr. Auger: A plumber always hired by the Man in the Yellow Hat to fix household plumbing problems. He always lets George watch him do his job.

(Voiced by Candi Milo) * Mr. Ruffweek: A blimp pilot who flies the Ruffweek Blimp. The blimp flies over 7 N. Avenue once in the morning, and again at sunset. His name is a play on the words \\"Rough Week\\", perhaps referring to his tight schedule or a play on the Goodyear Blimp. (Voiced by Rob Paulsen) * Professor Anthony Pizza: One of the scientists who works with Dr. Alvin Einstein and Professor Wiseman. He often bickers with Dr. Einstein. (Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) * Rodney: An employee of a market in the city (not the market George visits, it is on a nearby street, and serves as the store's main competitor), serving as the main antagonist in the episode Bag Monkey. In the episode he only appears in, he is shown witnessing the son of the Grocer trying to practice for the annual Bag- A-Lympics competition, wanting to challenge him on the day it starts. But the son of the Grocer sprains his hand while trying to put a canned ham on the bag. While arriving at the doctor's office to see him, he taunts him that he was looking forward to \\"beating him\\", as the sprain on the Grocer's son will recover in a week. As a result, the Grocer has George take his son's place by participating in the competition, having his son train him. During the Bag-A- Lympics, he competes against George and another unnamed grocer from another store. He is presumed to have won the first round, as George was distracted trying to think what food will fit in the bag. However, George wins the 2nd round by taking his time wisely, while the unnamed rival grocer is automatically eliminated due to an egg leak. Because of this, this angers Rodney, wanting to win the final round against George. Rodney later competes against George in the final round of the contest. During the final round, George uses his thinking skills to fit the canned ham properly in the bag, while Rodney has a slight lead over the former. Despite George's efforts, Rodney wins the competition. However, as he is about to be declared winner, the bag breaks due to his overconfidence of not fitting the food right, allowing George to win the contest. Rodney is last shown crying over his defeat. (Voiced by Jim Cummings) * Uncle Tam: The Man with the Yellow Hat's uncle, who dresses in green clothes with a white shirt and lives in a castle in Scotland with a golf course. In the episode Castle Keep, he was going to be evicted from his castle because he could no longer find the castle's deed, which meant he would have to pay 400 years of back taxes. (Voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) * The Zucchinis: A family of three acrobats renowned for their balance. They are friends of Chef Pisghetti. (Voiced by James Arnold Taylor, Tara Strong and Grey DeLisle) * Dog Trainer Man A man that is involved with dog shows and competitions. Mainly seen in Curious George Dog Counter and Charkie Goes To School. In his first appearance, he is first shown having each of his dogs win the show. When George decides to bring the dogs to the apartment so he can count how many dogs participated in the tournament, this upsets the trainer, pretending to panic upon finding out that the dogs left. However, he is relieved to have them back after George counted the dogs so the Man in the Yellow Hat can know how many dogs George saw.

The church was made a designated heritage property in 1982.  History  The church was founded on land donated by Captain Daniel Rapelje, the founder of St. Thomas. It is considered an early example of North American pioneer architecture. The church was completed in 1824 and tower was added in 1825 with the aid of Col. Thomas Talbot. One of the earliest churches in the Talbot Settlement, the building is an example of Gothic Revival architecture. Ontario Heritage Trust St. Thomas' Church 1824 The first incumbent, the Rev. Alexander Mackintosh, served from 1824 to 1829, was also the village’s schoolmaster. The congregation began with only 12 parishioners in 1825 but quickly grew to 41 by 1827. In 1833 the church was consecrated. By 1840 the church was enlarged. In 1877 the church congregation moved to the Trinity Anglican church in St. Thomas where it gathers still today. By 1982 the church site was made an Ontario heritage site and in 1986 the church was restored and renovated. In 1877 the congregation built a larger church, Trinity Famous grave sites  The church is surrounded by a pioneer cemetery with many notable grave sites both nationally recognized and locally significant. The oldest grave site is that of Daniel Rapelje’s son George in 1819; the newest are modern. Nationally significant sites include that of Judge Hugh Richardson, who in 1885 sentenced Louis Riel to death. Locally significant folklore tells of the story of the witch’s grave, the Irish family curse of the Chisholm family where 7 family members died within 7 years,St Thomas Times Journal, 1952 (exact issue unknown) and that of Canadian soldier Octavius Wallace, who fought in the American Civil War as a corporal of the 2nd Michigan Volunteer Infantry, and died at the Battle of Williamsburg in 1862.

Ayl Nora Alilah, page 67.) is a piyyut (liturgical poem) that begins the Ne'ilah service at the conclusion of Yom Kippur. The piyyut is recited as part of the Sephardic and Mizrahi liturgy,E.g., The Orot Sephardic Yom Kippur Mahazor (1997, NJ) page 986; Nulman, Macy, Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson), s.v. Ayl Nora Alilah, page 67. and has been adopted into Ashkenazic Yom Kippur services as well.E.g., Birnbaum, Philip, High Holyday Prayer Book (1951, NY, Hebrew Publ'g Co.) page 975; Silverman, Morris, High Holiday Prayerbook (2nd ed. 1951, Hartford, Prayer Book Press) page 458; also adopted into American Reform liturgy as early as David Einhorn's Olath Tamid in 1858, the American Reform mahzor, Gates of Repentance: The New Union Prayer Book for the Days of Awe (1978, NY, Central Conference of American Rabbis) page 508 – however, unlike the Sephardic ritual, not in the opening prayers of the Ne'ilah service; but not included in the Orthodox mahzorim by Adler, by ArtScroll, or by Rinat Yisroel. The English translation offered below is a lyric rendering, reproducing a rhyme similar to the Hebrew. A more literal translation makes the title and recurring line, \\"God of awesome deeds\\". It consists of eight stanzas, each stanza consisting of four lines of five syllables to the line.Birnbaum, Philip, High Holyday Prayer Book (1951, NY, Hebrew Publ'g Co.) page 975. Each line (in Hebrew) has three words and the fourth line is always two words, \\"as Thy gates are closed at night\\"Nulman, Macy, Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson), s.v. Ayl Nora Alilah, page 67. This is Nulman's English rendering, but see the comments attached to the verses, below. – the gates being shut are presumably those of Heaven's gates for receiving prayers of repentance, and the hymn is one last impassioned plea for Divine pardon in the very last minutes of the Day of Atonement. The initial letters of the first six stanzas of the piyyut spell out משה חזק, \\"Moses, may he be strong\\", in reference to the piyyut's author Moses ibn Ezra (12th century Spain).

This emphasizes the theme of the Ne'ilah service, of the last possible moments for expressing repentance. The reference may be to the image, found in the Talmud and elsewhere in the Neilah service, of a heavenly \\"gate of prayer\\" by which (when it is open) the pleas of mortals may reach God, or the image, for example in Unetanneh Tokef , that the books of God's decrees are written on Rosh Hashana and then locked away in Heaven and no longer capable of being revised when Yom Kippur concludes. The mention of nighttime is assumed, not explicitly stated; the gates of the Temple in Jerusalem having been customarily been locked at night. We who few have been from yore,Deuteronomy 26:5. Raise our eyes to heaven's height, Trembling, fearful in our prayer, As Thy gates are closed this night. Pouring out our soul we pray That the sentence Thou will write Shall be one of pardoned sin, As Thy gates are closed this night. God, our refuge strong and sure, Rescue us from dreadful plight; Seal our destiny for joy, As Thy gates are closed this night. Grant us favor, show us grace; But of all who wrest the right And oppress, be Thou the judge, As Thy gates are closed this night. Generations of our sires Strong in faith walked in Thy light. As of old, renew our days,Lamentations 5:21. As Thy gates are closed this night. Gather Judah's scattered flock Unto Zion's rebuilt site. Bless this year with grace divine, As Thy are closed this night.The literal meaning of the Hebrew text is (from the Orot Sephardic Yom Kippur Mahazor ): \\"Proclaim, please, a year of favor / and restore the remnant of the sheep / to Aholivah and Aholah / at the time of the closing.\\" The \\"remnant of the sheep\\" alludes to Jeremiah 23:3; Aholivah and Ahola are names used in Ezekiel 23:4-5 for Jerusalem and Samaria, respectively. At this point the Orot Mahazor says \\"In some congregations, the following stanza is added\\" and then provides a stanza which does not seem to appear in most machzorim (but has been found in a French edition) - it disrupts the acrostic of the initial letters, significant evidence against its authenticity. The stanza in Hebrew: /מחה כעב פשׁעים/ ועשׂת נא חסד עם/מקראים סגלה/בשׁעת נעילה/ִִִ and Orot's literal translation is: \\"Erase sins like a thick cloud/ and please do kindness with/ those called 'a treasure' [Exodus 19:5]/ at the time of the closing ....\\" It may be significant that, unlike all the other stanzas, this one's second line has four words. May we all, both old and young, Look for gladness and delight In the many years to come, As Thy gates are closed this night. Michael, Prince of Israel,Daniel 12:1; Michael is the guardian angel of Israel. Gabriel,Daniel 8:16 et seq.; Gabriel is another angel, also powerful.

Its area is approximately 1600 hectares. History Grapes were already cultivated in the area during the Roman empire, emperor Probus introduced large plantations. In the Middle Ages the plantations were mainly owned by the church. The wine \\"badacsonyi ürmös\\" had a fame that equaled that of the Tokaji Aszu in the 18th and 19th centuries. The phylloxera plague at the end of the 19th century caused significant damage to this wine region as well and following the plague vineyards were modernized in order to avoid erosion of the soil. At the same time new varieties were also introduced to the area. Climate and geography The soil is a mixture of clay, loess, and sand on top of basalt. The climate is mild, tempered with relatively high air humidity. Due to the proximity of Lake Balaton the Southern slopes receive the sun light reflected from the lake's surface. The reflection of the sunshine makes that the micro-climate is ideal for grape cultivation. The following villages belong to the wine region: Ábrahámhegy, Badacsonytomaj, Badacsonytördemic, Balatonrendes, Balatonszepezd, Gyulakeszi, Hegymagas, Káptalantóti, Kisapáti, Kővágóörs, Nemesgulács, Raposka, Révfülöp, Salföld, Szigliget, Tapolca. Grapes and wines Szürkebarát is one of the best known varieties cultivated in the Badacsony wine region. Szürkebarát is a descendant of Pinot gris, brought to Hungary from France by monks around 1300. The special soil conditions and the microclimate of the Badacsony wine region made that Szürkebarát differs from Pinot gris. In certain years it develops noble rot. Olaszrizling is most widespread variety cultivated in the region. Under favorable conditions the grapes are left on the vine stock late in the Fall, and the resulting wine is sold as \\"szemelt rizling\\" (literally, selected riesling). Other grapes include Tramini, Ottonel muskotály, Rajnai rizling and Chardonnay. Kéknyelű is used to be the dominant grape variety of the region, but the plantations were severely damaged by frost in the 1980s, and its significance decreased. It has seen a rise of popularity lately, and is expected to become a characteristic variety of the Badacsony region in the near future. The wines from the Badacsony region own a special character, they tend to be full bodied, and have a rich taste. Traditional, oak barrel based wine production dominates in the region. The use of reductive techniques is spreading, but the modern techniques have not yet changed the typical character of the wines from the region.

History Stuck in the Sound were formed in Paris in 2002. The four group members shared a love of the band Nirvana and its lead singer Kurt Cobain. The name \\"Stuck in the Sound\\" came from the fact that when the band first started they locked themselves in a cellar and made music, so they were literally \\"stuck in the sound\\". The group released their eponymous début studio album on 1 October 2004, on a compact disc produced by the band's own record label, Stuck Records. Some time after this, the band were signed by French record label Discograph.

Founded in 1913, the refuge consists of two Lake Michigan islands that act as nesting grounds for native bird species. The refuge is part of the Wisconsin Islands Wilderness Area, and as such it is off-limits to the public to preserve the habitat of the islands. It is inhabited by large colonies of shore birds and waterfowl in addition to hosting a pair of great black-backed gulls, one of farthest westward breeding sites of the species. History In the years before the refuge's founding, multiple expeditions were made to the islands. Ornithologist Henry L. Ward, then-curator of the Milwaukee Public Museum, visited the area numerous times to study the herring gull populations. While visiting Gravel Island in 1906 and 1907, Ward noted very large colonies of herring gulls as well as Caspian terns while observing their behavior and collecting specimens from the island. In 1913, the refuge was formed by executive order from Gravel Island and Spider Island to protect the breeding grounds of birds living there. Upon its formation it became the 29th refuge in the United States and third in the Great Lakes region. In 1970 the refuge became part of the Wisconsin Islands Wilderness Area, one of the smallest in the country. Many studies have been performed at the refuge since the 1970s, and recent efforts have focused on tagging of the birds and studying their migration habits and breeding. In 2009 the refuge became part of a Comprehensive Conservation Planning (CCP) program which will help manage the refuge more efficiently. The plan is intended to provide long-term continuity in refuge management, ensure that the refuge is consistent with the policies of the National Wildlife Refuge System, and improve budgets for the refuge. In 2011, 1,000 double-crested cormorant chicks were banded. As an intern, Mandy was the first to take hold of a sleepy chick. Everything was done at night so that the chicks would be sleeping and less aware. Geography and geology The refuge covers divided between two islands: Spider Island, spanning , and Gravel Island at a size of . The refuge is located off the east side of the Door Peninsula in Lake Michigan near Porte des Morts or \\"Death's Door\\", and is in a geographically rugged part of the Niagara Escarpment. The islands are composed primarily of limestone, with little to no vegetation growing on them. They were shaped by years of receding water, powerful pre-glacial rivers, and advancing glaciers. As a result, the islands are mainly flat and rise only a few yards above the lake. Wildlife and ecology Flora Spider Island had a birch-cedar-tamarack forest until the late 1970s, but succumbed to the thousands of birds living on the island. The trees of Spider island have now fallen over or been washed away and no permanent vegetation is known on Gravel Island. Fauna The refuge is home for to a wide array of bird species that either use the islands as nesting grounds or as a place of shelter. The great black-backed gull (Larus marinus) is known to have a small breeding colony on Gravel Island, and historically on Spider Island. In 1994 the species was discovered on Spider Island, making it the westernmost breeding on record at the time. Large colonies of herring gulls (Larus smithsonianus) and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) are found on both islands, while a colony of Caspian terns (Sterna caspia) can be found on Gravel Island.

It lived from the Middle Miocene to the early Pliocene, during which it was a common component of North American mammalian faunas along with Teleoceras. Description Skull of A. malacorhinus On the basis of skull size, the largest species of Aphelops is A. mutilus (which is the largest North American rhinoceros) and the smallest is the type species A. megalodus. A. mutilus has been estimated to have weighed , and A. malacorhinus has been estimated at . Aphelops can be distinguished by other members of the Aceratheriinae by two traits: the arched top of the skull, and the long diastema (gap) between the second incisor (lower tusk) and first premolar. Many other aspects of its anatomy are typical of aceratheriines, including: the absence of a horn on the broad, unfused nasal bones; the reduced premaxilla and lost first incisor; a nasal incision (or notch below the nasal bones) reaching at least the level of the fourth premolar; a triangular-shaped skull when viewed from the rear; narrow zygomatic arches; brachydont or low-crowned teeth without cement; upper molars bearing a fold of enamel known as an anterocrochet; and lower tusks that are subcircular in cross-section. More derived (specialized) species have larger teeth and longer, more slender nasal bones (also producing a larger incision). The various species also differ in the depth of the nasal incision: in A. megalodus, it reaches the front of the fourth premolar; in A. malacorhinus, it reaches the rear of that tooth; and in A. mutilus, it reaches the first molar. Palaeobiology The lower tusks of Aphelops are informative about the sex and age of individuals, as in Teleoceras: males have much thicker tusks, while older individuals have more strongly erupted tusks showing more extensive wear patterns. The stages in the eruption of the molar- like cheek teeth were identical to living rhinos. These factors were used by Matthew Mihlbacher in 2003 to analyze a bone bed of Aphelops known as the Love Island bonebed; adults (between 35% and 68% of maximum lifespan) are most common, there appears to be no male bias, and young males are rare. This is unlike Teleoceras, where young males are disproportionately preserved in bone beds. Such a difference may imply different social behaviour: young male Aphelops perhaps died less frequently from fighting, and used different kinds of ritualistic displays. Aphelops were probably not completely monogamous, with the degree of sexual dimorphism being suggestive of polygyny. Palaeoecology Aphelops is thought to have been a browser on C3 plants, like the modern black rhinoceros, with its longer limbs adapted to traversing open, brushy country. Isotopic evidence suggests that, in the late Miocene, Teleoceras had limited intake on newly-emergent C4 grasses, but Aphelops continued to browse. This difference in feeding ecologies explains how they could coexist sympatrically across many environments for 13 million years. Both went extinct at the end of the Hemphillian North American land mammal age, most likely due to rapid climate cooling, increased seasonality and expansion of C4 grasses.

The charity provides breaks for UK families struggling with problems such as severe and long-term illness, bereavement, mental health issues, disability and domestic violence. All the families helped by the charity are referred by someone already working with them in a supporting role and families cannot apply for a break directly. By working with referrers, the Family Holiday Association ensures that the funds raised help the families who will benefit most. The referral network includes teachers, health visitors, social workers and other charities such as Barnardo’s and Shelter. The Family Holiday Association receives no government funding, and is wholly reliant on the generosity of donors, fundraisers and other supporters. The charity is chaired by travel journalist and broadcaster Alison Rice, and the charity President is Peter Long, who is Chairman of the Royal Mail and ex Joint Chief Executive of travel company TUI Group.  History  The Family Holiday Association became a registered national charity in 1975. The charity was started by North London couple Joan and Patrick Laurance, who had experienced first-hand what a difference a break away from home can make. Peter Binns, a school friend of Patrick, lived in Westcliff-on-Sea. He and his wife were planning a trip away and thought that their good friends the Laurances would benefit from a trip to the seaside, particularly as they were going through a difficult time. Joan and Patrick were at this point living in a single room with their daughter, Pamela, who was in poor health. Their second daughter had been born handicapped and, tragically, had died aged just three months. To make matters worse, Patrick had been made redundant. The family desperately needed a break but couldn’t afford to go away. After returning home, the couple felt refreshed. Happy memories of their family break gave them new hope and the resolve to move forward. This got them to thinking, “Could we help others by providing holidays for families in similar situations?” By the early 1970s, Patrick had become a councillor and was given an allowance for his duties. One of his first ideas was to ask fellow councillors to donate their expenses (as he had) to facilitate the launch of a new charity. According to Joan, “Pat could talk a cat into having puppies,” so it came as no surprise when most agreed. At the same time, he and Joan wrote to friends and relatives to ask if they would contribute £50, or whatever they could afford. In addition, Joan, who had gained experience and contacts in her work for the Samaritans and Red Cross, wrote to anyone she could think of, including trusts, to ask for help. Before long, the couple had the money they needed, and by 1975 the Family Holiday Association had become registered a national charity. Soon the Laurances began to feel that they were in a position to write to their local social services department to ask if they knew of any families who might benefit from a holiday. At this time, Joan and Patrick decided that for a family to be awarded a holiday, the family needed to be under stress and not to have had a holiday for three years. The couple were particularly keen that children should be able to see the seaside. As far as the charity’s message was concerned, they wanted holidays to be seen as a necessity and not a luxury – a key principle of the Family Holiday Association that survives to this day.  Research  The Family Holiday Association was founded on the principle that spending quality time together as a family away from home results in stronger, healthier and happier families and communities. For the founders Patrick and Joan Laurance, this was based on personal experience. Yet there is also a significant body of academic research that supports the work the charity does The charity maintains a dedicated online resource – or Knowledge Bank – for social tourism which is hosted on the Holidays Matter website. It documents a range of literature from journal articles, reports, webpages and other sources. The Knowledge Bank is updated regularly to include any new published literature and research. The charity has helped found the Social Tourism Consortium together with organisations such as the Youth Hostels Association (England & Wales), The Family Fund and UNISON Welfare. The consortium is responsible for a series of seminars that have been held in both London and Edinburgh. The charity is also a member of BITS the Brussels-based International Bureau of Social Tourism.  Impact  The charity's family holiday programme runs between Easter and mid-October each year. Families referred by frontline care professionals are helped to access a break away from home during this time, and their holiday usually comprises a day trip or a few days by the British seaside. The charity asks for feedback on the breaks provided, in order to make any necessary adjustments and continually improve their work. Based on this feedback, they produce an Impact Report summary of the holiday season.  2016 Holiday season  * 5,184 families benefitted from a short break or day out - that's 11,222 children and 7,767 adults * Half the families helped had a break together for the first time * The charity worked with over 1,000 referrers nationwide from 188 local authority areas _How families benefitted_ * 99% had fun and created happy memories * 98& of children had new experiences * 96% of families had a chance to spend more time together * 94% were more optimistic * 92% reduced stress and worries * 92% got on better as a family * 91% of families were able to cope better after the break * 87% had more confidence _Issues affecting families*_ * 61% mental health issues * 34% domestic violence * 32% physical health issues * 15% bereavement * 12% victims of antisocial behaviour and crime *Most families referred to the charity are facing multiple issues and challenges.

It is the seat and a parish of the Diocese of Joliet in Illinois. History St. Raymond Parish The original church is now part of the school. As the city of Joliet expanded in the early 20th century Archbishop George Mundelein of Chicago established St. Raymond Parish on June 28, 1917. The following day the Rev. Francis Scanlan, who was an assistant pastor at Holy Cross Parish in Chicago, was assigned as St. Raymond’s first pastor. Initially, Mass was celebrated for the parish at the Motherhouse of the Sisters of St. Francis of Mary Immaculate on Plainfield Road. Father Scanlan resided in the rectory of St. Patrick’s Church in Joliet. Ground was broken for a new church in November 1917 and the first Mass was celebrated in the new church on December 8, 1918. St. Raymond School opened in September 1918 with an enrollment of 178. The Sisters of St. Francis of Mary Immaculate formed the faculty. The school expanded quickly and the school building had to be enlarged several times over the next several decades. Cathedral of St. Raymond Cornerstone The Diocese of Joliet was established by Pope Pius XII on December 11, 1948. St. Raymond’s was chosen to be the diocese’s cathedral. It was decided that the church was not adequate for cathedral functions so plans were made for a new cathedral church. Construction began in 1952 and the present cathedral was completed in 1955 for $2.4 million The first Mass in the new cathedral was celebrated by Bishop Martin McNamara on December 8, 1954. The marble altar and ambo were installed for the diocese’s silver jubilee in 1973. The Rev. Roger Kaffer, a native of the parish, briefly served as the cathedral rector in 1985. On April 25 of that year Pope John Paul II appointed Father Kaffer as auxiliary bishop of Joliet. His Episcopal ordination took place in the cathedral on June 26, 1985. An extensive renovation of the cathedral took place during the pastorate of the Rev. Stanley Orlikiewicz. The altar was repositioned closer to the congregation and the baptismal font was moved into the nave of the church.

He won the Boston Marathon in 1934, after placing second the previous year.  Career  Taavi Komonen was born in Käkisalmi, Karelia, which then belonged to Finland but was invaded by the Soviet Union during World War II. He worked as a farmer and carpenter in Finland before moving to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1929. In Canada his first name was anglicized to Dave. In Toronto he looked for work in the construction industry, but because of the Great Depression and his lack of English he did not find a steady job and was unemployed for periods of time. He competed in the Boston Marathon for the first time in 1931 and finished seventh in the race. The same year he won the Canadian National Marathon Championship. In 1932 he returned to Finland to compete in the Olympic trials in Vyborg, but did not finish the race and consequently was not selected for the Finnish Olympic Team. Komonen returned to Toronto, and in 1933 placed second in the Boston Marathon; the winner, Les Pawson, defeated Komonen easily, 2:31:01 to 2:36:04. After the race Komonen sold his running shoes for four dollars to pay for a ticket back to Toronto. The same year Komonen won his second Canadian National Marathon Championship. He also competed in the United States National Marathon Championship and won that race in 2:53:43, although Mel Porter, who ran 2:53:46, was recognized as the National Champion. On account of these three races Komonen was awarded the Lionel Conacher Award as Canada's male athlete of the year. Despite his success Komonen was struggling with financial problems. He decided to move to Sudbury, Ontario, where there was a major Finnish community. In Sudbury he was employed as a carpenter at the Frood Mine. He also received financial aid making possible his trip to Boston in 1934. This time Komonen was overwhelmingly successful. His winning time of 2:32:53 was almost four minutes faster than that of runner-up Johnny Kelley. Early leader Willie Steiner was third in 2:40:29. On May 5, 1934, five years to the day from Komonen's arrival in Canada, he filed naturalization papers, aiming to compete in the 1934 British Empire Games in London. However, Canadian law required a three month waiting period for citizenship, meaning that Komonen would miss by three weeks the marathon trial scheduled for July. He was initially allowed to compete in the trial on the understanding that his citizenship papers would be finalized before the games. However, public pressure forced Komonen to drop out of the trial and he failed to qualify for the games. In October 1934 Komonen won his third Canadian National Marathon Championship. After 1934 Komonen still competed but his best years were past. He lived in Sudbury until 1951 when he returned to Finland. He died on April 19, 1978, exactly 54 years after his victory in Boston.

In many of his early first-class matches in 1914 and 1919, he opened the batting with his identical twin brother, Dudley Rippon. Background The Rippon family hailed from London but had relocated to Radstock in Somerset, and the twins were sent to school at King's College, Taunton, where they made a lot of runs and caused confusion by their close resemblance to each other. Sydney joined the Knowle Cricket Club in Bristol and scored heavily in club cricket; Dudley got a job on a Bath newspaper and played for a local team. Cricket career Like his brother, Sydney Rippon was a right-handed opening batsman; unlike Dudley, he was not a regular bowler in first-class cricket, and he took only three first-class wickets in his career. He made his debut a few days after his brother, and played only six matches in the 1914 season, with a top score of 60 in the final one of those, against Gloucestershire at Taunton. Rippon also played in the return match at Bristol: that match began on 3 August 1914, and the following day the United Kingdom declared war on Germany as the First World War broke out across Europe. Rippon was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, initially in its third (reserve) battalion. In 1916, he was transferred to one of the new service battalions being formed as part of \\"Kitchener's Army\\". He entered the Western Front in France on 14 May 1916. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1917. He was later wounded, and as a result, resigned his commission on 24 January 1918, he was issued with the Silver War Badge to show that he had been honourably discharged. After this he joined the Inland Revenue, and was appointed an Inspector of Taxes on 11 November 1921. Despite his wartime injuries, Rippon returned to first-class cricket in 1919. He played fairly regularly in that season and the next two, and then made a minimum of six and a maximum of 10 appearances for Somerset each season through to 1929 - except for the 1926 season, when he played just once. After 1929, he was out of cricket for eight years, but reappeared in six matches in 1937. In 1927, he played one first-class match for the Civil Service against the New Zealanders and in 1928 he played in one rain-ruined Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval. In the 1919 season, he made his then highest score, 92, in the match against Gloucestershire at Taunton while batting under an alias: Rippon was working for the Inland Revenue and had not been given permission to play in the match. So he batted as \\"S. Trimnell\\", using his grandmother's name. By the time the 1920 edition of Wisden was published, the story had come out and the innings is recorded under Rippon's real name: \\"A. E. S. Rippon, who played under an assumed name, enjoyed by far his biggest success during the season,\\" Wisden wrote. In six out of the ten seasons between 1920 and 1929, he made centuries, but never more than one in any season, and his total of runs in a season never exceeded 600. Among his centuries was one of 118, made in Somerset's first-ever first-class match against Glamorgan in 1921. He put on 189 for the first wicket with the dashing Peter Randall Johnson, who made 123 of the runs; Rippon was, by implication in Wisden's report, much slower, though his runs came in 190 minutes. His highest innings was 133 against Worcestershire at the Knowle ground in 1927, the runs being made out of 314 runs while he was at the wicket: he \\"wore down the attack\\", wrote Wisden, and \\"showed such patience in waiting for the right ball to hit that he did not give a chance\\". Not all of his batting was slow, however: in 1928, the last of his centuries was 112 against Hampshire and he put on 197 for the first wicket with Tom Young, the runs coming in less than 150 minutes. Rippon's return to the Somerset side after an absence of eight years in 1937 was less successful, and his top score in 12 innings was just 28. Personal life Sydney Rippon was the father of the UK Conservative Party politician Geoffrey Rippon, who was a minister in the government of Edward Heath.

For its efforts, B'nai Amoona USY was voted the EMTZA Region Chapter of the Year for 2009 - 2010.BAUSY Youth camps The congregation maintains two summer camps for youth in the St Louis community, based on age. Collectively known as the Alfred Fleishman Summer Camps, they are Ramot Amoona for older children and B'nai Ami for preschool children.  Ramot Amoona  Since 1983, Ramot Amoona has provided the St. Louis area with a day-camp environment with informal Jewish education and active recreation intertwined. Campers entering kindergarten through entering 6th grade learn by doing, as Judaism comes to life in a variety of activities. Campers enjoy a safe environment that challenges the body, enriches the mind and releases the Jewish spirit within. Our unparalleled programming, super staff, and campruach (spirit) make Camp Ramot Amoona a special place. The day starts with songs of T'fillah (prayer) and is filled with exciting Peulot (activities) that keep campers and staff moving all day long. The daily YMCA swim instruction is a short bus ride to the Elk's Lodge. Special days such as Maccabia and Yom Yisrael are just some of the high lights. Everyone is involved in creating positive Jewish experiences with memories and friendships that last a lifetime.  B'nai Ami  Camp B'nai Ami is an introduction to Jewish camping for young children between the ages of two and five, with the oldest entering pre-kindergarten. B'nai Ami has a long tradition of providing toddlers and preschoolers a summer of fun with a \\"Jewish twist\\". Campers explore their environment and are introduced to developmentally appropriate activities guided by caring, knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff members. The low child-to-staff ratio ensures a safe and positive experience. B'nai Ami stresses socialization, communication, morals and ethics within a Jewish framework. The activities include water play, amanut (art), rikud (dance), musica (music), and tarbut Yisrael (Israeli culture). Every Friday there is a special event along with practice Shabbat.

Life Bullingham was a native of Gloucestershire. He was elected a probationer fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, in July 1550, being then B.A. In the latter part of Edward VI's reign he went as a voluntary exile to France, staying at Rouen, to avoid the church reforms in England. On the accession of Queen Mary he returned to England and was restored to his place. He received his M.A. degree on 1 June 1554. Bullingham was in favour as domestic chaplain to Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, and rector of Boxwell and Withington in Gloucestershire. On the accession of Elizabeth I he remained Catholic and lost his livings. He was subsequently appointed by Edmund Grindal to the prebendal stall of Wenlocks-barn in St Paul's Cathedral on 1 August 1565 and admitted to the degree of B.D. at Oxford under the new reformed regime on 8 July 1566. The next year, on 27 December 1567, he was appointed Archdeacon of Huntingdon by his namesake and probable relation, Nicholas Bullingham, Bishop of Lincoln. He held the post until 1576. He was created D.D. by his university on 12 July 1568 and received from Bishop Bullingham the stall of Louth in Lincoln Cathedral on 10 September of the same year and still retaining his other preferments was installed canon of Worcester on 13 October 1570. He was incorporated D.D. of Cambridge on 7 July 1575. When Grindal held a visitation in 1576 of his province by commission, Bullingham was one of those appointed to visit the Diocese of Hereford. He was raised to the episcopate in 1581, being consecrated on 3 September of that year at Croydon to the see of Gloucester. He was allowed to hold the recently created bishopric of Bristol in commendam as well as the prebend of Norton in Hereford Cathedral, to which he was installed on 16 January 1582. He held the see of Bristol until the appointment of Richard Fletcher, at whose consecration he assisted on 14 December 1589. The rectory of Kilmington in Somerset was given him in compensation for the loss of the second bishopric and his Hereford stall. He served as commissioner for the confirmation of Whitgift's election as archbishop on 27 August 1583 and in 1584 was commissioned by the new primate to visit his own Diocese of Gloucester. When the see of Oxford fell vacant in 1592, John Aylmer, then Bishop of London, at his request unsuccessfully endeavoured to obtain it for Bullingham. Bullingham died at Kensington on 20 May 1598 and was buried in his own cathedral. He was one of the targets of attack for Martin Marprelate. Works A letter relating to his friend Julins Palmer is printed in John Foxe's Acts and Monuments. Palmer had also been a Roman Catholic exile but became a Reformation convert and martyr. The only other work attributed to Bullingham is \\"a translation of John Venerus's oration in defence of the Sacrament of the Aultare\\" (1554).

Bibliser Airfield was built by the United States Army Air Forces at the site of a Wehrmacht Army Barracks (Biblis Kaserne). It was also the first USAAF airfield to be built in support of Seventh Army operations east of the Rhine River after two divisions crossed the river near Worms on 26 March 1945. It was a vital airfield used in the encirclement of the Ruhr Pocket during the Western Allied invasion of Germany, in which more than 300,000 German troops were taken prisoner After being closed in July 1945, the facility was abandoned. Today it is the site of a sports complex to the south of Biblis. History The airfield was laid out very quickly at a captured German Army Barracks (Kaserne), just to the south of Biblis after the Rhine crossing. The 850th Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived at the site on 1 April 1945 and on 2 April they had laid down a square-mesh track and sod runway, using the captured army buildings as a support area. The airfield was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-78 Biblis \\"IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout The Twelfth Air Force 27th Fighter Bomber Group moved in almost immediately with its A-36 Apache ground-attack aircraft (a version of the P-51C Mustang optimized for ground support) and began flying missions in the Ruhr.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . The 27th attacked enemy troop formations, motorized vehicles, armored vehicles and bridges to keep the German forces pinned down while the United States First and Ninth Armies moved up to meet the British XXIst Army Group coming down from the north. By 4 April the encirclement was complete, and for the next two weeks the pocket was made smaller and smaller, eventually forcing the surrender of over 300,000 German troops and their equipment. The victory in the Ruhr essentially eliminated serious opposition by the German Armed forces in Western Germany and afterward American ground forces swept east into Central Germany and Southern Germany, while British and Commonwealth forces moved into northern Germany against little organized resistance. The 27th Fighter Bomber Group continued operations from Biblis supporting American forces as they advanced through Germany until the end of combat on 7 May. The unit remained at the airfield until the end of June when it returned to the United States. The airfield was closed in July and abandoned.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. After the war, the area was completely reconstructed and all of the military buildings, and airfield were removed. The airfield's antenna is now used by an American/German Radio surrounded by plantation fields and a small forest where once stood the maneuver area and hangars.

Link (1902–1982) was an American oil geologist. Career In 1926, Walter Link went to work for the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey as a junior geologist mapping deposits in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. His work for Standard Oil then took him to Indonesia, Ada, Oklahoma, and the American Gulf Coast. From 1940-1945, Link was Standard Oil's Chief Geologist for much of Latin America, living in San José, Costa Rica and later Havana, Cuba. Commercial shipping across the Caribbean was hazardous during World War II, making sources of oil closer than Venezuela increasingly desirable. In 1955 Link returned from semi-retirement when he accepted an invitation to become the leader of an exploration program for the new Brazilian petroleum monopoly, Petrobras. This led to the Link's memorandum summarizing the onshore petroleum potential of Brazil. Link recommended that Petrobras begin offshore exploration. The recommendation was unpopular with both Petrobras and the Brazilian press, but was borne out when after seven years the company took his advice. Personal life Link was born in La Porte, Indiana, the ninth of 10 children. In 1924, he graduated from University of Wisconsin–Madison with a bachelor's degree in geology. In 1928, he married a fellow graduate of the UW geology department. They divorced in Havana in 1945. They had three children. Walter Link died in 1982.  References  * Linkages by Robert H.

It proved difficult to fly and was discontinued, though a second machine was completed as the Latécoère 5 bomber. Development The Latécoère 4 (referred to in the initial contract as the Latécoère IV) was the company's first multi-engined aircraft, the result of a decision that passenger aircraft needed to be designed form scratch rather than modified from military machines. It was a three-engined, two bay biplane with accommodation for 16 passengers. Its wings had neither stagger nor sweep, but had an unusually large interplane gap. The lower wing, which carried dihedral was fixed to the lower fuselage with a thick wing root, but the upper one was high above the fuselage at its centre, supported by pairs of N form cabane struts. The interplane struts were streamlined and broad in chord, made from duralumin; there was a pair of these struts marking the inner bay but a single strut outboard. The wings, made of wood and fabric covered were of constant chord over most of the span, but final sections where the leading edges swept back produced triangular tips. There were balanced ailerons on both upper and lower planes. The fuselage in contrast was made of metal. The central Salmson water-cooled radial was mounted in the nose with rectangular radiators mounted on the fuselage forward of and just above the lower wing. The outer engines were also fuselage mounted, each having pairs of struts to the upper fuselage longeron and to the lower ones via the wing roots. Thus they were positioned a little above the lower wing, near to the centre of the inner bay in neatly faired nacelles with circular radiators at the front. The underlying fuselage structure was rectangular in cross-section aft of the leading edge, but faired at its sides and top into a rounder shape. It was deepest between the wings and gave the aircraft a somewhat short, fat look. The pilot sat just forward of the wings, high up and well above the central motor line, with a god view. Below and forward of him were positions for a radio operator and an engineer. The passenger cabin, entered via a port side door had tables, armchairs and sliding windows for thirteen, with another three places accessed forward via a 500 mm wide corridor. The tail unit was quite complicated with a biplane arrangement of tailplanes and elevators. One of the tailplanes could be adjusted in incidence in flight to trim the aircraft. There was a central fin and rudder rising above the upper tailplane, which had a cut-out to allow the rudder to move, and there were two outboard vertical surfaces, again moving in cut-outs, to assist stability. These latter could be turned in flight to offset asymmetric engine-out forces. The undercarriage was narrow track, with pairs of mainwheels on both sides mounted vertically to the wing and cross braced, with a tailwheel at the rear. The first flight was made in May 1920, when the aircraft was powered by three identical Salmson 9 Z engines of about , piloted by Pierre Beauté. The Laté 4 proved hard to control and it crashed on landing at Francazal, injuring its crew. It was rebuilt, though without its passenger cabin windows. It also gained a two-row Salmson 18 Z central engine of double the power of the 9 Zs retained outboard. The central engine drove a four-bladed wooden propeller and the outer pair two-bladed ones. The open cockpit was turned into an enclosed cabin with a corridor aft. It appeared in this form at the Salon d'Aéronautique in December 1921, but did not fly again until some major changes had been made. These included the replacement of the single outboard interplane struts by double ones, an exchange of the rectangular central engine radiators for tubular Lamblin ones and the addition of a substantial additional pair of wheels placed vertically below the engine bulkhead to prevent nose-overs. All engines now drove four-bladed propellers. In this form the Laté 4 flew, piloted by Gronin on 6 September 1922. The aircraft was still unstable and unready to try the intended Toulouse-Casablanca route. On 14 October the aircraft was caught by a gust and crashed, seriously injuring Gronin and his engineer Franck. At this point the civil aircraft was abandoned. In early 1921 a decision had already been made to submit the second Latécoère 4 as a bomber; it became the Latécoère 5.

Migration history The Netherlands has no longstanding historical links with Angola. Early Angolan migrants in Europe typically settled in Portugal, the former colonial power in their home country. However, they found it difficult to obtain work there, and also suffered from discrimination. Some thus travelled to other countries, including the Netherlands. The major draw for Angolan migration to the Netherlands was the relatively generous asylum policy. In the first half of 2001 alone, 1,800 Angolans applied for asylum in the Netherlands, making up nearly half of the total number of Angolan asylum-seekers in the western world. In total, from 1998-2002, more than 10,000 Angolans applied for asylum in the Netherlands. As many as 4,500 of those consisted of unaccompanied minors. Thousands had their claims for asylum rejected and were thus ineligible for residence permits, but had been permitted to delay their departure due to the lack of safety in their home country. In 1999, State Secretary for Justice Job Cohen pushed to have the delay of departure scheme ended; though in his judgment the situation in Angola as a whole was still not safe, Luanda was stable enough to enable Angolans to return. Before 2002, there was little return migration from the Netherlands to Angola; only ten such individuals were known to the International Organization for Migration. However, in 2003, the number of returnees began to increase sharply. Under the Return and Emigration of Aliens from the Netherlands programme, rejected asylum seekers are eligible for a variety of support including an airline ticket to the airport nearest their return destination, reimbursement of fees paid to acquire travel documents, and a resettlement payment to assist with the initial period after relocation. Unaccompanied minors returning to Angola voluntarily also receive assistance in locating their family, and may also be provided with free temporary accommodation at a reception centre if their family cannot be located or cannot receive them. There is also some illegal immigration from Angola to the Netherlands. Irregular migrants do not typically make use of people smugglers to enter the Netherlands; they instead get help from their social networks. Such practises have prevented the emergence of large-scale smuggling organisations in Angola. Demographic characteristics , statistics of the Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek with regards to people of Angolan origin showed: *6,286 persons of first- generation background (3,705 men, 2,581 women) *2,729 persons of second- generation background (1,336 men, 1,393 women), of which: **815 persons with one parent born in the Netherlands (401 men, 414 women) **1,914 persons with both parents born outside the Netherlands (935 men, 979 women) For a total of 9,015 persons (5,041 men, 3,974 women). This represented roughly 3.5 times the 1996 total of 2,594 persons. Their total population peaked in 2004 at 12,281 persons and has been in decline since then.; the year 1996 is the earliest for which statistics are available online Organisations , Angolans had established five of their own organisations in the Netherlands, as well as three jointly with Congolese migrants. The latter are unusual in Dutch society, as the two groups share neither a common language (other than Dutch) nor a common country of origin. The organisations generally aim to bring Angolans together and promote their integration into Dutch society, empower Angolan women, provide sex education, and organise social activities and sports competitions. The organisations are generally male-dominated, with as many as 80% of the members being men.

He was beatified on 29 April 1979 and canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 11 October 2009. Life Francisco Coll Guitart was born in Gombrèn (Ripoll) in 1812 as the tenth and last son of a wool carder. His childhood saw his commitment to the education of children and he combined this passion with his formation as a seminarian in Vic (a major town in Osona in Catalonia). He entered when he was just 10. He would later meet and became friends with Antonio Maria Claret. In 1830 he decided to join the Order of Preachers at the Dominican convent in Girona. His studies for the priesthood and Dominican religious life were jeopardized with the suppression of religious orders that occurred in 1835 due to the intervention of the Spanish government. During this time all religious were ejected from their properties and expected to live secular lives. However he did not give up on his vocation and continued to pursue the priesthood and God. On 28 March 1836 he was ordained as a Dominican priest. Coll's pastoral mission was all the more difficult due to the lack of social life and the support of fellow friars that would have been expected before the suppression of the religious orders. From 1839 to 1850 he worked with the poor and the sick. In 1850 he was appointed as the director of the Dominican Third Order; he was able to reopen a suppressed Dominican convent, which gave him a base for his mission as a priest. In 1854 he worked with those struck with cholera. In 1856 he founded a congregation of Dominican sisters which became known as the Congregation of the Dominican Sisters of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (aka La Annunciata). This group of sisters was founded as a teaching congregation. Guitart decided that the sisters of the congregation should be devoted to those children and adolescents in most need. Thus the first communities were directed to areas of rural Catalonia working in public schools. However, in the beginning, as a result of the socio-political situation – the revolution of September 1868 – the nuns were forced to leave these schools and to found private schools, most of them under the protection of the textile factories. After founding the first centers in Catalonia, the congregation worked in the mining areas of Asturias, and the towns of Castile and La Mancha. The first overseas base was in Argentina in 1908. In 1955 - after Guitart's death - the congregation began its activities as missionaries in Central America and later to Peru and Chile further south. At the time of Guitart's death the congregation numbered at 300 sisters with 50 communities; a remarkable fact given the hostile climate of Spain toward religious at that time. At present the members of this congregation work in Europe and has spread to the Americas, Africa and Asia. Blindness and death On 2 December 1869 - while Guitart was preaching in Sallent (in Catalonia) - he was struck blind. From that time on, his health grew worse and declined at a moderate pace. He died on 2 April 1875. Before his death, the suppression of religious orders was lifted in 1872, which allowed the Dominicans to return to Spain to resume their missions and religious life. The Dominicans found that while orders like theirs were gone it was Guitart who had maintained the structures of the Order, allowing pastoral missions to continue and flourish. Guitart's dedication to the Dominican life – learning and preaching for the salvation of souls – even in the face of impossible odds was a remarkable character trait. His teachings and legacies continues to grow more so through the work of the Annunciata Sisters in Spain and abroad. Veneration The cause for his canonization commenced in 1928 at Osona in which the title of Servant of God was bestowed upon him. In 1958 a miraculous healing of a Léonese woman (Justa Barrientos) was attributed to the intercession of Francisco Coll Guitart. This allowed for his beatification to take place on 29 April 1979 in a celebration over which Pope John Paul II presided. In 2008, a second miracle was proven, leading to his canonisation in Saint Peter's Square in a celebration led by Pope Benedict XVI on 11 October 2009. His liturgical feast is observed each 19 May - his date of baptism. It is celebrated on an annual basis.

Its founding convention was held at the University of California in Los Angeles, with speakers including authors David Crook and Han Suyin. The first National Chairman was William Hinton, author of Fanshen. He was later succeeded by California attorney Frank Pestana. Notable members of the National Steering Committee included Koji Ariyoshi, a veteran of the World War II Dixie Mission to Yenan and founder of the Hawaii-China Friendship Association, and New York activists Helen V. Rosen and Esther Gollobin. The Koji Ariyoshi Award, established after his death in 1976, is the organization's highest honor.

National policies are established by the membership, which meets biennially at a national convention. A national board of directors implements national policy and meets twice each year.

This action was criticized by members of the Pennsylvania Senate, with Senate Majority Whip Jeff Piccola saying \\"Mr. Rubin's position as a public official certainly raises a lot of questions.\\" Other Senators expressed concerns that Rubin's wife, Ruth Arnao, is a former staff member for State Senator Vince Fumo, who wrote the slots legislation. At the time Rubin's firm received the license, both Arnao and Rubin were under a federal corruption investigation by the Philadelphia-based United States Attorney. In filings submitted by the United States Attorney during Vince Fumo's corruption trial, Rubin was named as one of Fumo's \\"ghost employees,\\" saying that he was paid $30,000 annually for five years in exchange for no work. Moments after Arnao and Fumo's conviction on all 139 counts, an FBI agent handed a Rubin a \\"target letter\\" informing him that he was under investigation and that \\"substantial evidence\\" was present that linked him to a federal crime. Rubin then took an unpaid leave from the Turnpike Commission while Ed Rendell reviewed trial transcripts. The next day, Rendell fired Rubin from the Turnpike Commission, saying that \\"It is inappropriate for you to remain as a commissioner.\\" Rubin was found guilty of a misdemeanor charge of commercial bribery and sentenced to 24 months probation, 100 hours of community service and fined.

She is equally critical of Islamic and Western extremists and condemns all forms of terrorism. She rejects the label of Islamic Wahhabism applied to Saudis as a Western invention. Jawhar is a strong believer in the hijab as a religious obligation, but defends a woman's right to choose whether to wear one. Similarly, she personally opposes wearing the burqa, or abaya, in non-Muslim countries but asserts it's a woman's choice. Only in Saudi Arabia does she choose to wear the niqab to honor her cultural background.HuffingtonPostArabisto Her writing on women's rights include their right to drive an automobile in Saudi Arabia. She also argues for Saudi authorities to loosen male guardianship restrictions on women, but her position on women's rights is framed within the context of Islam. She strongly opposes revisions of the Qur’an. But she believes some aspects of Islam are flexible and are subject to modification based on changes in society. She also has written that dress codes, driving and some aspects of male guardianship have been left open to interpretation or not addressed in the Qur’an and should be revisited by Islamic scholars.HuffingtonPost  References  Category:Saudi Arabian journalists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:People from Medina Category:HuffPost writers and columnists ","title":"Sabria Jawhar"},{"id":"24655816","text":"Former court house (later a probate office), New Road, Oxford (1863) Charles Buckeridge (circa 1832–73) was a British Gothic Revival architect who trained as a pupil of Sir George Gilbert Scott.Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 366 He practised in Oxford 1856–68 and in London from 1869.

He has also played various films most notably “Amazing Grace” by the late director Amos Guttman, as well as directing his own films and theatre plays. His musical style incorporates cabaret, mizrahi music, Yemenite music and electronica. Early years Gilad Philip Ben-David was born in Rishon Le Zion to a Dutch mother and a Yemenite father. His first musical influences came from his grandfather, a cantor. At age 12, he began to perform original rock songs at events in his hometown as well as taking part in a competition of French songs organized by the French Embassy in Tel Aviv. At age 15, he performed in Tel Aviv for the first time, accompanied by Asaf Amdorsky, as a drummer, as a guest of Yoav Gal and Nimrod Eylim. Amdorsky was also the drummer and arranger in the band they have together formed, \\"Ben David bKaney HaSuf\\" in which cellist Karni Postel also participated. In 1989, Hamuchtar played his set \\"The Days of Awe\\" in the rock club Roxanne, accompanied by bassist Kozo Almakis from the group \\"Natasha's Friends\\". The set included songs from \\"The Yom Kippur Siddur\\" with traditional Yemenite influences. Later years In 1990, he performed “Guard of Zion”, a satirical anti- nationalistic group of songs. The show was a response to the (Intifada) and right wing Israeli movements. The following year he ditched social-political themes and came up with \\"The Moon and the Parthenon” his most successful set so far. Accompanied by an accordionist, he toured Israel amidst scud rocket attacks and re-introduced chansons and burlesque to Bauhaus Tel-Aviv. In 1992, he staged “Soldiers and Hookers”, a warriors show with reoccurrences of sexual frustrations and war crimes.

Formerly a medieval collegiate church, the large building of cathedral proportions with its later additions and iconic spire dominates the town. St Paul's is the largest Anglican church in Bedfordshire, and the church exercises a ministry of welcome to thousands of visitors and pilgrims from far and wide each year. St Paul's is officially recognised as a Major Parish Church and is a member of the Major Churches Network. Historically, St Paul's has played a key part in the life of the British nation: as the home for the BBC's daily worship during the Second World War; and the Service for the National Day of Prayer in 1941, at which the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang preached, was also broadcast to the UK and wider world from the church. St Paul's is today the Civic Church of the Borough of Bedford and the County of Bedfordshire; it is a focus for special commemorations and celebrations in the borough, county, and the wider region of the East of England, as well as being a central venue for concerts, recitals and exhibitions. As well as serving a diverse parish and ministering to a congregation of all ages, the church also enjoys fine choral and liturgical worship in the English cathedral tradition. History  The first Minster  Some evidence exists for the founding of St Paul's Church as a new minster by King Offa (d. AD 796) to serve the inhabitants of his new fortified urban burgh. Offa is understood to have been buried in Bedford, and his Minster Church of St Paul has been identified as a probable site of his grave. The church mentioned by name in the Domesday Book of 1086 was a house of secular canons in the eleventh century, ruled by an abbot in 971, and the church in which Oscytel (or Oskytel), Archbishop of York was buried in 956, indicating that St Paul's was an important minster church from at least the tenth century onwards.  The second and third churches  From the early ninth century the priests’ mission was frequently interrupted by the invasions of the heathen Danes which continued at intervals until the arrival of the Normans in 1066. The Danes caused sporadic damage wherever they plundered or settled. They used the river to move inland to Bedford on their way westwards into the Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex, and in 1009-10 destroyed the church in the fighting. The Anglo-Saxon chronicles report that ‘forever they burnt as they went, then they turned back to the ships with their booty’. Originally constructed in the early 13th century, the present church building has undergone numerous alterations, extensions, rebuilds and restorations since this time. An Early English south porch does survive from the original 13th-century structure, however, and records trace the existence of a previous Collegiate church on this site as far back as 1066. The Trinity Chapel of the church was first constructed in 1416, with maintenance of the chapel entrusted to the Holy Brotherhood of the Trinity. The church has long standing connections with Sir William Harpur and Dame Alice Harper, and the Trinity Chapel holds brasses of the couple. Sir William was the Lord Mayor of the City of London in 1562, and his Harpur Trust (which has a long history of operating independent schools in Bedford) has donated many of the stained glass windows in the church. Other improvements in the 15th century included Misericords in the Quire (or chancel) and two additional porches. The Trinity Chapel was used as an Archdeacon’s Court after the English Reformation. On 23 May 1656, John Bunyan, the Christian preacher and author of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\", preached at St. Paul's. John Wesley, the Anglican cleric and Christian theologian (also one of the founders of Methodism) preached the Assize Sermon at the church on 10 March 1758. During the 19th century St Paul's adopted the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England, where it remains. As a result, the Sisters of Saint Etheldreda began to be associated with the parish from 1869. Architectural work to the church in the 19th century includes the tower and spire, transepts, choir stalls, quire and quire roof. Early 20th- century work to the church includes the Rood screen (designed by George Frederick Bodley), the English Altar and altar rails (designed by the Bromsgrove Guild), and restoration work to the Trinity Chapel (instituted by C. E. Mallows). Later in the 20th century, from the mid-1970s to 1982, the church was restored and otherwise improved. In 2014 new work was completed on a Narthex at the west end of the church.  The church for the nation 1941-5  St Paul's moved centre stage nationally to play two special roles at a time when the United Kingdom faced its darkest hour. First, when during the Second World War, the BBC moved much of its operations out of London to Bedford, the Trinity Chapel in St Paul's was used by the BBC as the studio for broadcasting the Daily Service and The Epilogue both nationally and throughout Europe. This extraordinary period in the church's history is fittingly commemorated by an inscription on the floor at the entrance of the chapel: THE BBC BROADCAST THE CHRISTIAN MESSAGE FROM THIS CHAPEL 1941-1945 IN THE DARKNESS OF WAR: NATION SHALL SPEAK PEACE UNTO NATION THEY SHALL BEAT THEIR SWORDS INTO PLOUGHSHARES HOPE THROUGH RECONCILIATION FORGIVENESS THROUGH UNDERSTANDING PEACE Secondly, at the southern end of the high altar rail, an inscription on a wooden panel records the National Day of Prayer on Sunday 7 September 1941, when the Archbishops of both Canterbury and York came together to St Paul's, Bedford to lead the worship and broadcast live to the nation at a grim time in its history. The service was broadcast to all parts of the world, to uplift and inspire 'many millions to a new endeavour to set up a kingdom of righteousness on the earth'. The church was also home to a service led by Roman Catholic Cardinal Arthur Hinsley.  Notable features  The organ The present three manual instrument is the result of a rebuild in 2010. Although several of the 1985 tonal additions have been retained, the tonal basis of the present instrument is formed by the Norman & Beard pipework of 1900. In the 2010 rebuild all of the chorus reeds were re-voiced with a brighter tone so as to integrate with the original work. Three new replacement Mixtures and a Tuba were added to the specification and the number of stops was reduced from 66 stops down to 44, exactly the same number as in 1900. The specification may be viewed on the church website or on the NPOR The bells The church has had a ring of bells for centuries. Currently there are twelve bells, hung for English-style change ringing. The majority of the bells were cast in 1896–7 to form a new ring of ten to replace the eight that had been in the church since around 1744, one of these original bells was retained as the ninth of the new ten, but was recast in 1945. The bells had been taken out of the tower during the Second World War, in case the church was damaged by bombing (ringing of church bells was forbidden for much of the war, reserved as an alarm in case of invasion), and were rehung in 1945. In 1977, two new bells were added, to give the present twelve, these marked the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The church today St Paul's is a busy and active Church of England parish, Civic and County church in the heart of Bedford, working together with three other Anglican churches in a common witness to the community. As well as serving a most diverse parish, the church supports the work of schools, voluntary and community organisations through the county and East of England, as well as the work of the Lord-Lieutenant and High Sheriff. St Paul's enjoys a cathedral choral tradition within a modern 'catholic' liturgy with appeal to all ages. The team of clergy and lay ministers is augmented by a full-time Pastoral Assistant working with those in special need seeking help from the church, as well as the many visitors throughout the year. The Church is part of the ecumenical 'Town Centre Churches' and has many links to other churches and community groups, including the 'Bedford Council of Faiths'. The church is a member of the Major Churches Network and of Cathedrals Plus.

This fact highlights the utility of the usage of submerged specific gravity in problems involving buoyancy and force balances on submerged objects: the object will naturally rise when its submerged specific gravity is negative, and sink when its submerged specific gravity is positive. Because of this characteristic and its dimensionless nature, submerged specific gravity is ubiquitous in equations of sediment transport.

It is the oldest surviving building associated with agriculture on this land-grant university. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on January 4, 1990. History The Barnes Center began as the Clemson College Experimental Barn or ‘Sheep Barn.’ The barn is the oldest surviving and relatively intact structure associated with the original Clemson College Agricultural Department and was built in approximately 1904. The barn was extremely significant from 1904 to 1940 when it was used for agricultural exploration and experimentation. During this time, livestock practices were changing in order to prevent diseases, improve hygiene, and to increase productivity. The barn was created in order to support these goals as an agricultural education facility that investigated scientific problems that directly affected the advancement of agriculture. The barn began by researching the handling and care of cows, but became retrofitted to research sheep. As recently as 1935, the barn was used for hands on class instruction including determining wool quality and sheep judging. Some of the equipment remained intact within the structure until construction on The Barnes Center began. The barn was listed in The James Way Plan Book as a research participant. In 1940, the agricultural operations ceased and then the barn has been used for storage. On January 4, 1990, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its significance. In 2014, the Barnes Family gave a gift to Clemson University and the Sheep Barn became the Barnes Center. The Barnes Center is the social destination of campus where students can come make friends, relax, and attend late night programming every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night. The Barnes Center Grand Opening was February 18, 2017. Architecture The barn is a rectangular building about two stories tall on a brick foundation. It has a standing-seam metal, gabled roof. The roof has three square, vented cupolas with metal roofing and ball finials. The facade and about of the side elevations are constructed of clay brick. This native clay brick was laid in English bond. The brick is similar to that used for the Trustee House, which is a contributing property to the Clemson University Historic District II, and the Campbell Museum of Natural History, which was originally called the Kinard Annex, on the Clemson campus. The facade has a wooden sliding door on a metal track. Above this door, there is a weatherboarded section with a window for the hayloft. The gable is weatherboard with a louvered lozenge, which appears as a decoration on several other Clemson agricultural buildings. The rear elevation's original door was replaced with a garage door. Most of the sides are weatherboarded. The northeast elevation has a single door, another doorway covered with weatherboard, and nine window openings that have been covered with vertical boards. The southeast elevation has about ten window openings covered similarly. Additional pictures of the barn are available. Following a remodel starting in 2014, The Barnes Center now has space for dining, activities, and more. It now has white siding, refurbished floors and sliding door, and original brick. The building is also outfitted with modern amenities such as WiFi, televisions, and modern light fixtures. Additional information and construction timeline can be found on the Barnes Center website.

It is located near the industrial area, about to the shores of Dohat ad Dafi, one of the shallow bays near Jubail. The airport occupies an area of about 20 km².  Overview  Originally constructed by the Royal Commission of Jubail and Yanbu as part of Jubail project, it was meant to be used for commercial aviation until it was decided to utilize the large nearby King Fahd International Airport. Thus, it was handed over to the Ministry of Defence and has been used as a base for the naval aviation group/eastern fleet of the Royal Saudi Navy since then.http://www.arabnews.com/saudi- arabia/news/632811 However it was recently announced that the airport will be opened for private aviation operations starting September 2014, therefore a project to renovate the airfield was undertaken since some of the airfield's infrastructure was incomplete as a result of the previous change for the use of airport from commercial to military. Facilities There is one runway, 4,000 meters long and 45 meters wide. The taxiways however was not completed until recently after announcing the plans of using the airport for private aviation in addition to the current military use. Recent activities Due to the accelerating development in Jubail Industrial City and other nearby industrial complexes such as Khurisaniyah and Ras Al-Khair, the airport was handed over to the General Authority of Civil Aviation and will be operated as a civil airport starting from September 2014.

The word strath also means valley, and the area is now better known as Strathaven. The title Earl of Avondale, along with that of Lord Balveny, was created for James Douglas, known as \\"the Gross\\", in 1437. He was a younger son of Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Douglas and succeeded to the Earldom of Douglas in 1440 following the deaths of his nephew and great- nephew. The titles were forfeit in 1455 on the attainder of his son James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas and 3rd Earl of Avondale. The second creation was for Andrew Stuart, who was created Lord Avondale in 1459. He was a son of Sir Walter Stewart and therefore a grandson of Murdoch Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany. He served as Chancellor of Scotland between 1460 and 1482, and died in 1488, when the title became extinct. The third creation was for another Andrew Stuart, who was created Lord Avondale in about 1499. He was a great-grandson of Sir Walter Stewart, and thus a great-nephew of the first Lord Avondale. On his death on 9 September 1513, he was succeeded by his son, also named Andrew. The second Lord Avondale exchanged his title for that of Lord Ochiltree on 15 March 1543. The most recent creation was for Prince Albert Victor, eldest son of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). He was created Duke of Clarence and Avondale and Earl of Athlone on 24 May 1890, but died on 14 January 1892, when the titles became extinct.

Her career spanned the concert hall and the opera house. She conspired with Sir Thomas Beecham to appear at the Royal Opera House masquerading as an Italian singer by the name of Lisa Perli. Away from professional concerns she had an affair with Beecham, with whom she had a son. Biography Labbette was born Dorothy Bella Labbett in the London suburb of Purley, the daughter of a railway porter.Lucas, p. 170 She studied at the Guildhall School of Music, where she won the Melba scholarship, the Knill challenge cup for the best student of the year, and the Heilbut scholarship. She also studied with Liza Lehmann, who took her to sing to the music publisher and impresario William Boosey, who gave her a contract to sing songs published by his company, at \\"Ballad concerts, Promenades and Sunday evening concerts\\". She made her Wigmore Hall début in 1917,Jefferson, Alan. Dora Labbette, New Grove Dictionary of Opera, accessed 10 October 2009 (subscription required) and in April 1918 married a soldier, Captain David Rogerson Strang of the Royal Engineers, son of the painter William Strang.The Times, 5 April 1918, p. 9 The couple had one child, Joan Strang, born 18 April 1919, but Strang wanted his wife to abandon her musical career; she refused and left him after nineteen months of marriage to continue singing.Lucas, pp. 170–71 She had a long recital and oratorio career in which she appeared in London and in the provinces. She was the soprano soloist at the first performance of Delius's Idyll in 1933.The Times, obituary, 7 September 1984, p. 14 After making her operatic debut in Oxford in 1934, in Rameau's Castor et PolluxThe Times, 19 November 1934, p. 10 Labbette took the role of Mimì in La bohème at Covent Garden in 1935, using the mock-Italian name \\"Lisa Perli\\", after her birthplace, Purley. The press and public were not long deceived by the pseudonym, and she was rapidly accepted as an opera singer.Lucas, p. 224 When the hoax was revealed, The Gramophone published a short verse which included the lines: :Dora Labbette! Dora Labbette, O! :We rather like our pocket prima donna, :Who sings as well as any twenty-tonner. :Will Perli last? Will she become a habit, :Or dwindle back into Miss Dora Labbette?The Gramophone, November 1935, p. 19 In a later interview, Labbette explained that she had found it impossible to break out of the concert and oratorio repertoire into opera. \\"As for the Messiah, the Creation and Elijah, I must have sung the leading soprano parts in these oratorios hundreds of times, until I felt I would shriek if I were asked to do them again.... But it seemed quite hopeless and against all tradition that a singer who had been identified with the concert platform should desire to appear on the operatic stage.\\"Lisa Perli, The Gramophone, September 1939, p. 15 The critic Neville Cardus wrote of her, \\"Lisa Perli is the best of our Mimis. She has a genius for diminutive pathos and in the closing scene she can bring moistness to the throat of the hardened critic.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 1 December 1937, p. 3 After this operatic success, she went to Paris and studied Debussy's Pelléas and Mélisande, subsequently singing Melisande at Vichy and Bordeaux and at Covent Garden the following summer. In the autumn of 1937 she sang Mimì in La Bohème at Berlin, Munich and Dresden. After the first performance in Berlin, she was engaged to sing Mignon in German. Her other operatic roles included Desdemona in Otello, Juliette in Roméo et Juliette,The Times, 20 January 1936, p. 10 and Marguerite in Faust.The Times, 11 October 1938, p. 12 The New Grove Dictionary of Opera said of her: \\"Her voice was true, pure and youthful, and she was an outstanding actress.\\" Labbette made many gramophone records, including the first complete Messiah, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham, with whom she had an affair lasting thirteen years, which produced a son, Paul.Lucas, p. 212 World War II cut short her London career, and her last operatic performances were on tour with the Carl Rosa Opera Company.Lucas, p. 281 Among her last concert performances was in The Creation, with Beecham, in Sydney in 1940.

Schlegel diagram of truncated icosidodecahedral graph In geometric graph theory, a branch of mathematics, a polyhedral graph is the undirected graph formed from the vertices and edges of a convex polyhedron. Alternatively, in purely graph-theoretic terms, the polyhedral graphs are the 3-vertex-connected planar graphs. Characterization The Schlegel diagram of a convex polyhedron represents its vertices and edges as points and line segments in the Euclidean plane, forming a subdivision of an outer convex polygon into smaller convex polygons (a convex drawing of the graph of the polyhedron). It has no crossings, so every polyhedral graph is also a planar graph. Additionally, by Balinski's theorem, it is a 3-vertex-connected graph. According to Steinitz's theorem, these two graph-theoretic properties are enough to completely characterize the polyhedral graphs: they are exactly the 3-vertex-connected planar graphs. That is, whenever a graph is both planar and 3-vertex-connected, there exists a polyhedron whose vertices and edges form an isomorphic graph.Lectures on Polytopes, by Günter M. Ziegler (1995) , Chapter 4 \\"Steinitz' Theorem for 3-Polytopes\\", p.103.. Given such a graph, a representation of it as a subdivision of a convex polygon into smaller convex polygons may be found using the Tutte embedding.. Hamiltonicity and shortness Tait conjectured that every cubic polyhedral graph (that is, a polyhedral graph in which each vertex is incident to exactly three edges) has a Hamiltonian cycle, but this conjecture was disproved by a counterexample of W. T. Tutte, the polyhedral but non-Hamiltonian Tutte graph. If one relaxes the requirement that the graph be cubic, there are much smaller non- Hamiltonian polyhedral graphs. The graph with the fewest vertices and edges is the 11-vertex and 18-edge Herschel graph,. and there also exists an 11-vertex non-Hamiltonian polyhedral graph in which all faces are triangles, the Goldner–Harary graph.. More strongly, there exists a constant α < 1 (the shortness exponent) and an infinite family of polyhedral graphs such that the length of the longest simple path of an n-vertex graph in the family is O(nα)... Combinatorial enumeration Duijvestijn provides a count of the polyhedral graphs with up to 26 edges;. The number of these graphs with 6, 7, 8, ... edges is :1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 12, 22, 58, 158, 448, 1342, 4199, 13384, 43708, 144810, ... . One may also enumerate the polyhedral graphs by their numbers of vertices: for graphs with 4, 5, 6, ... vertices, the number of polyhedral graphs is :1, 2, 7, 34, 257, 2606, 32300, 440564, 6384634, 96262938, 1496225352, ... . Special cases A polyhedral graph is the graph of a simple polyhedron if it is cubic (every vertex has three edges), and it is the graph of a simplicial polyhedron if it is a maximal planar graph. The Halin graphs, graphs formed from a planar embedded tree by adding an outer cycle connecting all of the leaves of the tree, form another important subclass of the polyhedral graphs.

Construction and commissioning Tillamook was laid down as ATA-192 on 19 October 1944 by the Levingston Shipbuilding Corporation at Orange, Texas, and launched on 15 November 1944. She was commissioned as USS ATA-192 on 23 January 1945 with Lieutenant, junior grade, W. C. Heck in command. World War II After shakedown training in the Gulf of Mexico, ATA-192 departed Galveston, Texas, on 21 February 1945, transited the Panama Canal on 28 February 1945, and headed north. After visits to Acapulco, Mexico; San Diego, California; and Portland, Oregon, ATA-192 arrived in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 28 April 1945. On 10 May 1945, she departed Pearl Harbor for duty in the western Pacific. During the waning days of World War II, ATA-192 towed ships between various anchorages in the western Pacific. She visited Guam late in June 1945 and Okinawa in mid-July 1945. From there, she moved south to Leyte in the Philippine Islands, where she remained from 20 to 30 July 1945. Early in August 1945, she headed eastward and proceeded via Ulithi Atoll and Pearl Harbor to the United States West Coast. She arrived in San Francisco, California, on 1 September 1945. Operation Crossroads After almost a month in port at San Francisco, ATA—192 got underway for Pearl Harbor, bound for the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. She spent four months in the Marshall Islands during Operation Crossroads, the designation for the tests, ferrying personnel, helping fight fires caused by the tests, and, on one occasion, towing the former Imperial Japanese Navy battleship Nagato, in use as a target ship for the tests. During her stay in the Marshall Islands, ATA-192 also was a frequent visitor to Kwajalein Atoll and Eniwetok Atoll. On 8 September 1946, she left Kwajalein Lagoon to return to the United States. After a five-day stopover at Pearl Harbor, she reached San Francisco on 12 October 1946 and began the procedure for her post-test radiation contamination clearance. Service in the Territory of Alaska On 15 November 1946, ATA-192 departed San Francisco and headed north. After stops at Bremerton and Seattle, Washington, she arrived at Kodiak, Territory of Alaska, on 1 January 1946 to begin an extended tour of duty in the 17th Naval District. In February 1947, she underwent repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, and, early in March 1947, she returned to Alaskan waters. Over the next 10 years, she steamed between various ports in Alaska and along the Aleutian Islands chain. The name Tillamook became free in 1947 when the old tug USS Tillamook (YTM-122) was retired, and, on 31 May 1948, ATA-192 was named USS Tillamook (ATA-192). Until 25 April 1952, Tillamook operated out of the City of Kodiak/Kodiak Island [17th Naval District], when she began operations out of Naval Station Adak, Alaska in the Aleutian Islands. In addition to the usual towing operations she performed, Tillamook also conducted search and rescue missions in the cold and treacherous waters of the Bering Sea, as well as humanitarian work for Native Alaskans. Her clandestine mission was electronic and visual surveillance of Soviet [spy] vessels penetrating U.S. Territorial Waters, including Soviet spy vessels disguised as fishing trawlers and fish factory ships. Pacific Fleet service On 27 May 1957, Tillamook was ordered to be decommissioned and placed in reserve. However, that order was rescinded on the following day, and she was reassigned to the Pacific Fleet for duty with the Service Force, United States Pacific Fleet. From then until well into the fall of 1960, the tug was homeported at Pearl Harbor and conducted towing operations for the Pacific Fleet Service Force. Seventh Fleet service In November 1960, Tillamook was reassigned again, this time to East Asian waters guarded by the United States Seventh Fleet. On 17 November 1960, she reached Japan at her new home port, Yokosuka. During her first four years in the western Pacific, Tillamook performed towing operations between such bases as Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan, and Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippines. The highlight of this period of duty was a visit to Sihanoukville, Cambodia, in April 1962. Vietnam War Late in 1964, when the American presence in South Vietnam began to increase, Tillamook also began to visit the ports of that country. However, her missions in Vietnamese waters in 1964 were brief port visits to deliver tows at such places as Da Nang and Vung Tau, South Vietnam. Shortly after the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964, the US Navy developed a training exercise to simulate firing on small, high-speed targets at night and Tillamook was assigned to participate off Subic Bay. Tillmook would tow the sled in one direction at top speed—just over 11 knots—while a destroyer steamed in the opposite direction at something close to top speed—something close to 30 knots—creating a relative closing speed of about 40 knots. On the first two nights, the destroyers illuminated the tow with their star shells, locked the turrets on the two, but did not fire. On several occasions, the star shells illuminated Tillamook. On the third night, a destroyer commenced a live exercise, but also placed the star shells over Tillamook rather than over the tow. Shortly thereafter, the crew on Tillamook heard the destroyer radioman announced \\"Shot, out\\"—it was on the way. A few second later, a salvo of fire shattered about 50-100 yards short of Tillamook and then before the crew could react, a second salvo was on the way that landed about 50-100 yards long. Although the salvos missed, shrapnel hit the side of Tillamook, and the crew collected them in a box and gave them to the destroyer as a present the following day while delivering the mail to the fleet. In February 1965, she assisted the disabled United States Coast Guard Cutter into Yokosuka for repairs. Chatauqua was at Ocean Station Victor, approximately 1100 miles east of Yokosuka and was adrift, having lost its main bearing. Tillamook had been providing gunnery sled services, and had her lightweight 1\\" wire on the towing reel. Rather than take the time to replace the lightweight wire with the standard 2\\" towing wire, the skipper left immediately leaving the liberty section ashore. Because of the lightweight wire, Tillamook was unable to use full power and it was a long slog back to Yokosuka into a gale. During one 24-hour period, Tillamook actually averaged negative nautical miles for the day. In April 1965, she was assigned to Operation Market Time along the coast of Vietnam, that was designed to interdict enemy infiltration and coastwise logistics operations. A Republic of Vietnam Navy patrol boat, RVNS PC-04, had caught an enemy \\"trawler\\" unloading weapons at Vung Ro Bay, South Vietnam and there was growing concern with enemy coastal traffic. In July 1965, Tillamook entered Vung Ro Bay about midnight based on reports from her Vietnamese liaison that a RVN outpost had been captured by the Viet Cong, the idea being to use Tillamooks 3 inch 50 single gun to attack the outpost. After slinking quietly in the cove, the Captain ordered the First Lieutenant to anchor, whereupon the First lieutenant opened the wrong pelican hook, sending the spare anchor splashing into the sea. With that, Tillamook departed the cove without firing. In August 1965, she resumed operations towing district and landing craft between various East Asian bases and did not return to Vietnamese waters until December 1965 when she towed the large covered lighter USS YFNB-2 and the floating workshop USS YR-71 from Subic Bay to Danang. She visited South Vietnam again in January 1966 when she towed a barge into Cam Ranh Bay. After another period of towing operations outside the combat zone, Tillamook rejoined the American naval forces in Vietnam in August 1966. She provided gunfire support for forces operating on the Long Tau branch of the Saigon River. In December 1966, while attempting to retrieve a drifting barge, four of Tillamooks crew became separated from the ship. In the night, the barge drifted ashore, and Tillamook provided covering fire through the night to protect the four sailors from nearby enemy troops. The following morning, a small landing craft rescued the men. Tillamook returned to Subic Bay soon thereafter. While at Subic Bay, Tillamook answered a call for a rescue mission with only the duty section embarked. The call came in around 22:00 one evening, and she got underway immediately to rendezvous with the merchant ship , which was unable to return to port because of a damaged engine. Tillamook brought Enid Victory safely back to Subic Bay. During 1967, Tillamook made three short visits to South Vietnam, one to Vung Tau in mid-March, another to Da Nang in late June, and the third to Vung Tau again early in December. However, she spent most of 1967 occupied with routine operations in Japanese and Philippine waters. Tillamook also spent 1968 in much the same way, though highlighted by a visit to Da Nang in January, to Singapore and to Da Nang in June and to Da Nang in September. In 1969 and 1970, Tillamook made only four brief stops in Vietnam, at either Vung Tau or Da Nang. Her routine of tows between Japan and the Philippines was broken only by an escort mission to Keelung, Taiwan, in mid-September 1970. Honors and awards Tillamook received nine campaign stars for her Vietnam War service, for: *Vietnam Defense, 18 to 25 August 1965, 7 to 15 September 1965, and 24 December 1965 *Vietnam Counteroffensive, 25 to 26 December 1965 and 8 to 20 April 1966 *Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase II, 6 to 8 August 1966 *Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase IV, 25 May to 2 June 1968 and 8 to 23 June 1968 *Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase V, 21 July to 26 September 1968 and 3 to 7 October 1968 *Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase VI, 21 to 22 February 1969 *Tet 69/Counteroffensive, 23 to 28 February 1969 *Vietnam Summer-Fall 1969, 6 to 14 July 1969 and 17 to 24 July 1969 *Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase VII, 16 to 25 November 1970 Final operations In January and February 1971, Tillamook operated in Japanese waters out of Yokosuka. Early in March 1971, she made another round-trip voyage to Keelung and returned to Japan at Sasebo on 19 March 1971. On 20 March 1971, she began a voyage that took her to Pusan, South Korea, and Buckner Bay, Okinawa, before she returned to Yokosuka on 28 March 1971. She remained in port in Yokosuka until her decommissioning. Decommissioning and final disposition On 1 July 1971, Tillamook was decommissioned at Yokosuka and was leased to the Republic of Korea under the provisions of the Military Assistance Program. She served the Republic of Korea Coast and Geodetic Survey until 1976 when South Korea returned her to the U.S. Navy for final disposition. Tillamooks name was stricken from the Navy List on 15 April 1976 and disposed of by unrecorded means the same day.

He played for a number of teams in the Football League throughout his career, making over 90 league appearances. Alongside spells in non-league football, Harrison had a short foray into Finnish football in the 1980s when he signed for Oulun Palloseura and spent two seasons playing in 38 games. He managed Workington and Bamber Bridge in the Northern Premier League and was Assistant Manager at Lancaster City. In the 1998–99 season, Harrison had a short spell as manager of then Northern Premier League side Accrington Stanley. He then went on to be the Academy Director of Youth at Blackpool Football club for 4 years before moving to the United States to further his career. Playing career Harrison began his career as an amateur with Everton but did not make a first-team appearance for the club and returned to his native Cumbria ahead of the 1975–76 season, signing for Football League Fourth Division side Workington. He made four league appearances for the Reds, three of them as a substitute, before transferring to Sheffield Wednesday. However, he again failed to break into the senior side and left the club in September 1979 without having played in a league game. His subsequent move to Blackpool proved more successful and it was there that he enjoyed the best spell of his playing career, featuring in 86 league matches over the following three seasons. After his release from Blackpool in 1982, Harrison had trial spells with both Preston North End and Burnley, where he made one appearance as a substitute in a Lancashire Senior Cup match, but was not offered a permanent deal by either club having sustained a serious injury at the time. During the 1983 and 1984 seasons, Harrison assisted Finnish club Oulun Palloseura, scoring 7 goals in 31 league matches. He also had a spell playing indoor football in the United States, before returning to England to join Football Conference outfit Barrow in the 1984–85 campaign. In the summer of 1985, he was appointed player–manager of former club Workington, who had since been relegated to the Northern Premier League after failing re-election to the Football League several years previously. He spent just over a season in charge at Borough Park before resigning in November 1986. He had one final playing spell with Fourth Division side Carlisle United, making two league appearances, before retiring in 1988. Coaching career Following his retirement from playing, Harrison worked towards his coaching badges and completed his UEFA \\"A\\" licence in 1996. He spent time as a youth team coach at Carlisle before returning to Workington for a third spell with the club, and a second stint as manager, in January 1995. He guided the team to a 16th-placed finish in his first full season in charge in 1995–96 but left the club midway through the following campaign. Harrison was then assistant manager to Gordon Raynor at Lancaster City for a time in 1997 before resuming his managerial career when he was appointed as manager at Bamber Bridge later the same year. He steered the team clear of relegation during his sole season in charge, leading to a move to Accrington Stanley following the dismissal of Billy Rodaway in December 1998. Harrison tendered his resignation at Accrington Stanley to take up a full-time post as the Director of Coaching for Youth at Blackpool F.C.

The airfield was built by the Luftwaffe in 1944 to protect the Limburg railroad marshalling yards from aerial attack by Eighth Air Force heavy bombers. It was captured in late March 1945 by American forces, one of the first airfields to be taken by the Americans east of the Rhine River. It was also the location of the first American wartime radio broadcast east of the Rhine. Once operational, Limburg was used as a reconnaissance airfield by Ninth Air Force and later as a combat resupply and casualty evacuation airfield until the end of the war. History The airfield was laid out by the Luftwaffe in the summer of 1944 as a grass airfield, midway between Limburg and Dehrn, just to the east of the Rhine River in an agricultural area. Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3) moved in about 1 September with Messerschmitt Bf 109G day interceptors to halt in the defense of the Limburg railroad yards, a critical transportation point in Western Germany. Several Luftwaffe FlaK units were stationed in the area as well as the airfield. Besides the interceptors, Fliegerhorst Limburg was used by Aufklärungsgruppe 12 (AG 12); a Junkers Ju 88 day reconnaissance unit and Nahaufklärungsgruppe 1 (NG 1), a night Ju 88 reconnaissance unit. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 The United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force attacked the marshalling yards on 25 March and 31 March 1945, heavily damaging the facility.USAFHRA Document 00089290USAFHRA Document 00089644 The railroad yards were also attacked by Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers several times during March. In June 2019, an explosion created a crater wide and deep in a cornfield near the village of Ahlbach. Bomb disposal experts believe it was caused by a detonator decomposing on an unexploded AN-M64 General-Purpose Bomb that was mostly likely dropped in the area during the Allied bombing raids in March 1945. United States Army units began moving into the Limburg area in late March 1945, and ground forces captured Limburg Airfield and its facilities about 26 March. IX Engineering Command 816th Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in to de-mine the facility and clear out wrecked German aircraft. On 30 March the airfield was declared operationally ready for aircraft and designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-83 Limburg\\". On 2 April the National Broadcasting Company's commentator Lowell Thomas was flown to the airfield, making a news report from the captured airfield, one of the first operational USAAF airfields East of the Rhine.USAFHRA Document 00099249 Quickly, the Ninth Air Force 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group arrived at Limburg with a variety of reconnaissance aircraft, remaining for about a week until moving east into Central Germany.

Constructed in 1700, it became one of the most important Mazu temples in Taiwan and is known for its extravagant temple architecture. It is visited by more than a million pilgrims every year. Mazuism Mazu, the deified form of the medieval Fujianese teenager Lin Moniang, has an enthusiastic following on Taiwan. Beigang was one of the most important Taiwanese ports in the 17th century. As Beigang and its economy grew, at the same time the temple grew and expanded. Today the Chaotian Temple at Beigang is an important religious site and pilgrimage destination. Beigang's Mazu tours to other Mazu temples through whole Taiwan every year for visits and inspections. History In 1694, a monk requested that a statue of Mazu be brought to Beigang from the Chaotian Temple in her hometown of Meizhou in Fujian. In 1700, Chen Li-Shum donated a building lot and raised the funds to erect Beigang's own Chaotian Temple. In 1730, the temple was further expanded. In 1770, Penkang Magistrate Hsueh Chao- heng considered that the temple too simple to live up to the dignity of Goddess Matsu. Three years later another reconstruction of the temple started. In 1854 a number of ranking officials initiated a third project, expanding the temple into a palace-type architectural complex. The front wing consisted of worship courtyard and east and west chambers. The second wing was for worship of the Heavenly Mother, third wing for Goddess of mercy; east wing for San- Kuan Heavenly Emperors, west wing for Wenchang God, the 4th wing for Goddess Matsu's parents; east wing for Goddess of Childgiving and west wing, Lang God.

History The site has been used for Christian worship for more than a millennium. Although the current church is not that old and ruins of the earliest churches—probably build of wood—are no longer present, it does still house architectural artifacts among the oldest in Bedford. At one time, appointments within the church were made by the Augustinian Canons who had founded Merton Priory in Surrey. Their connection persists in the name 'de Merton' even though the English Crown took over patronage of St Peter after the Dissolution of the Monasteries of the 16th century. The rubble and cement tower of the church was constructed in Saxon times, as was an arch and a doorway which are set in the belfry's east wall. Notable Norman work in the church building includes an exterior doorway arch (originally from another Bedford Church) in the south porch. The chancel's font, priest's door and windows were added in the 13th and 14th centuries. A reproduction of an original fenestella from this time was added in the south wall of the sanctuary in the 19th century. As well as the 19th century additions to St Peter's previously mentioned, the church was enlarged at this time, and restoration work was undertaken. Additions included the vestry, aisles and west porch, as well as an extension to the nave. Work to the building in the 20th century included the paintings on the east wall, the tower ceiling decoration, the construction of the chapter house and the Burma Star stained glass window. Following the closure of the neighbouring parish church of St. Cuthberts in 1974, St. Peter's was also dedicated to Cuthbert of Lindisfarne. The church today St Peter's Church is an Anglican Parish Church in the heart of Bedford. The church is part of the Bedford Council of Faiths, and has many links to other churches and community groups. The church has strong links in particular with Bedford School located near to the church. Church services are held every Sunday 10.15am and at 9.00am and 4.00pm on the first Sunday of the month. The church has morning prayer on a Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Holy Communion is celebrated on Thursday at 10.30am. A coffee shop is open at the church on the second Saturday of the month from 10.30am for an hour.

The village comprises three neighbourhoods: Middletown on the main road between Witney and Charlbury, Poffley End on the minor road to Ramsden and Delly End on Whiting's Lane. The parish extends from the River Windrush in the south, almost to the village of Ramsden and the hamlet of Wilcote in the north, and it includes the hamlet of New Yatt. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,208. Manors The Old Manor House at Poffley End was a small house built of Cotswold stone in the 15th century, and was enlarged to its present size in the 16th and 17th centuries. It is a Grade II* listed building. Delly End has a terrace of 17th century cottages. Swanhall Farm, east of Poffley End, was built in about 1700. Hailey Manor at Delly End is an ashlar-fronted early Georgian house of six bays. Church and chapel Church of England Bell-turret of St John the Evangelist parish church A Church of England parish church was built in 1761 and extended in 1830. It was demolished and replaced by the present Gothic Revival parish church of St John the Evangelist in 1866–69. It was designed by the young Gothic Revival architect Clapton Crabb Rolfe, whose father Rev. George Crabb Rolfe was the perpetual curate. C.C. Rolfe applied his own interpretation of French Gothic architecture. The Oxford Diocesan Architect G.E. Street condemned his initial designs as \\"needlessly eccentric\\", so Rolfe modified them. But Sherwood and Pevsner describe the result as \\"still odd... a fantastic Gothic in colourful materials with bulbous forms and freakish detail\\". They single out the bell- turret as \\"particularly bizarre\\". The font, sited in the north aisle, is from the preceding Georgian parish church. St John's is a Grade II* listed building. Its parish is part of the Benefice of Witney, which also includes Curbridge. Methodist A Methodist chapel was built in 1908. It is now a private house. Economic and social history vernacular cottages at Delly End, with the Peace Memorial in front Farming The ancient Wychwood royal forest included the whole of Hailey, and the northern part of the parish was mostly woodland, wood-pasture and heath. But from the 13th century onwards assarting reduced the woodland in the north and east of the parish. The endings of local toponyms including Delly, Hailey and Poffley all come from leah, Middle English for a \\"clearing\\". The southwest of the parish was farmed on an open field system. Villagers seem to have enlarged the open fields by assarting in the 13th and 14th centuries, and by the early 17th century their combined area was . Parliament passed an inclosure act for Hailey in 1821, which was implemented in 1822–24. Wool New Mill on the River Windrush From the early 13th century there was a fulling mill on the Windrush in the south of the parish. It was run down in the latter half of the century, seems to have ceased trading by 1318 and may have been demolished. In the 1580s Thomas Box of Witney bought Burycroft, the land next to the former mill site, and had a new leat dug and mill built. By 1589 it was in production, and it has been called New Mill ever since. From the early 17th century, trades including fulling or tucking, broadweaving and clothing are frequently recorded in Hailey. By the middle of the 18th century blanket-making dominated Hailey's wool trade as it did Witney's. By the early 19th century more families seem to have worked in trade and industry than in agriculture. In the early history of the trade many weavers worked at home, but in the 18th and 19th centuries New Mill increasingly dominated Hailey's cloth trade. This was despite fires damaging the mill in the late 18th century and in 1809, 1818 and 1883. The Early family of Witney blanket-makers were renting at least part of the mill by 1818 and operating the whole premises by the 1820s. Legally the mill was in two parts, and in 1830 the Earlys bought one part copyhold and the other part leasehold. Earlys bought the freehold in 1894 and continued blanket-making there until the mid-1960s. It has since been converted to other trades. Blacksmithing Mr T. Harris had a smithy at Witheridge Farm, south of Hailey. Upon his death in February 1960 many of his tools were donated to The Museum of English Rural Life. School Hailey Primary School in Middletown, built in 1848 and extended in 1892 Hailey Primary SchoolHailey Primary School was founded by the charitable bequest of a local farmer's widow, Joan Smith, in 1661. It had 18 pupils in 1802, 28 in 1815 and 30 in 1835. By the 1820s Joan Smith's endowment paid for the education of only 16 of the pupils, and the parents of the remainder had to pay fees. In 1815 the school hoped to adopt the plan of the National Schools as soon as it could recruit a suitable teacher. By 1847 the school had 45 pupils and was accommodated in a run-down cottage in the village. John Williams Clinch of Witney, who was a banker and brewer, gave land next to the Lamb and Flag Inn on which to build a new school. The architect was William Wilkinson of Witney, who was George Crabb Rolfe's brother-in-law. The new building was completed in 1848 and had capacity for 79 pupils. In 1876 the school had 73 pupils — close to full capacity — so before 1880 capacity was increased to 108. By 1889 it had 107 pupils and needed to expand again. School inspectors called for an infants' classroom, and this was added in 1892. The architect was Clapton Crabb Rolfe, who had designed the parish church and was William Wilkinson's nephew. Oxfordshire County Council took over the school in 1903 and reorganised it as a junior school in 1930. Thereafter Hailey children of secondary school age went to Witney Central School. The school in Hailey became Hailey Church of England Voluntary Controlled School in 1978. Amenities Hailey has an 18th-century public house: the Lamb and Flag. The name is a reference to the parish church being dedicated to St John the Evangelist, whose Gospel of John is the source of the Lamb of God as a traditional symbol of Christ.

It is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The ridge contains a diverse selection of rare plants unique to the state of Colorado. Geology The Raven Ridge and the adjacent parallel Squaw Ridge are northwest striking rock exposures which provide an opportunity to understand this part of Earth's history. This section through a sequence of rock layers that were deposited between ~53-49 million years ago, has become exposed because of its later tectonic history. The outcrops span the geological time interval that includes the early and middle portions of the Eocene Epoch. During this time, ancestral horses, primates, and rodents, among many other mammal groups, were common at Raven Ridge. At the southern edge of Raven Ridge are found the only available surface coal beds in the area. The rocks of Raven Ridge were originally deposited on or near a shore line as horizontal sedimentary layers within the Uinta Basin. Uplift and folding associated with the later stages of the Laramide Orogeny subsequently tilted them into a nearly vertical position. Plants Raven Ridge is the habitat for eight endemic rare plant species: Penstemon grahamii (Graham's beardtongue), Penstemon albifluvis (White River beardtongue), Astragalus lutosus (Dragon milkvetch), Aquilegia barnebyi (Mancos columbine), Cryptantha rollinsii (Rollins's catseye), Parthenium ligulata (Colorado feverfew), Eriogonum ephedroides (ephedra buckwheat), and Phacelia incana (hoary phacelia). Numerous other plants are found there as well. Fossils Found at the summit of the ridge are a multitude of perfectly preserved fossil gastropods.

His epigrams were included in the Garland of Meleager (Prooem. 45.) Eleven of them are in the Greek Anthology, but the genuineness of two of these (ix. and x.) is very doubtful. Most of his epigrams are in praise of wine, and all of them are jocular. In some he describes the dedicatory offerings in the temple of Arsinoe, among which he mentions the hydraulic organ of Ctesibius. Besides this indication of his time, we know that he was the contemporary and rival of Callimachus and friend of Poseidippus of Pella. He lived therefore in the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, and is to be classed with the Alexandrian school of poets. According to Athenaeus, he killed himself for love of a certain Glaucus.

Biography His family left their home in the Palatinate c. 1637, fleeing the Thirty Years War, and moved to Amsterdam around 1640. There, Roos trained with his brother Johann Heinrich Roos during the years (1647–51) in history painting with Guilliam Dujardin (1597–after 1647), in landscape with Cornelis de Bie and in portraiture with Barent Graat. The brothers returned with the rest of the family to Germany in 1653, where they worked for a monastery in Mainz. When Johann left, Theodor Roos won a commission to paint the civic guard in Mannheim. The painting was displayed in the city hall. This painting won him the favor of Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, whose wedding portraits he painted in return for a golden necklace with a commemorative coin. Thereafter he painted in Strassbourg, Hof van Velde, van Birkenfelt, Bade, Hanau, and Hof van Wirtenburg. In Strassbourg he was granted amnesty when the city was taken by the French, because of his long history of painting military heroes.

He was famous for having been the first elephant born in the Western Hemisphere in 44 years. At the time of his death, he was the oldest male Asian elephant in North America. With a shoulder height of and overall height of more than when standing up straight, Packy was also one of the tallest elephants in the United States and perhaps one of the tallest worldwide. History Packy's mother, Belle, was wild-born in Thailand, around 1952. His father, Thonglaw, was born in Cambodia around 1947. Both were captured and brought to Morgan Berry, an elephant trainer in Seattle, Washington, in 1959. Belle became pregnant with Packy on July 19, 1960, at the Woodland Park Zoo. This went undiscovered for a year. Meanwhile, both 8-year- old Belle and 13-year-old Thonglaw, along with Berry's other female, 5-year- old Pet, were being transferred between Seattle and Portland every year. In December 1961, the staff at what was then the Portland Zoo confirmed Belle's pregnancy, although they decided not to tell the public until she gave birth. In January 1962, Belle went into false labor, so zoo staff decided to release the news to the public. Portlanders learned of the pregnancy through an Oregonian article, and citizens eagerly anticipated the birth. Then, late at night on April 13, Belle entered labor. On April 14, 1962, at 5:58 a.m., after 21 months of pregnancy and five hours of labor, Belle gave birth to a male calf. Ten days later,Getting to Know Packy (PDF). 2012. Oregon Zoo. Retrieved April 11, 2012. following a naming contest sponsored by a local radio station, he was named \\"Packy\\". The then-very-rare elephant birth received international media attention, and Life magazine devoted 11 pages to Packy in its issue of May 11, 1962. Visitors from all over the world came to Portland to see the famous baby elephant. The Portland Zoo set an attendance record in 1962, of more than 1 million visitors, a figure that remained unmatched until 27 years later (1989). Several circuses and zoos wanted to buy Belle and Packy, but their trainer, Morgan Berry, declined all offers, except for Portland's. After Portlanders raised enough money –$30,000 in donations – and made the purchase, Berry donated Thonglaw and Pet to keep the herd intact. Meanwhile, Thonglaw had also impregnated Pet, as well as Portland's own two females, Rosy and Tuy Hoa. On October 3, 1962, Rosy gave birth to a female, named Me-Tu. On September 15 of the following year, Pet gave birth to a male called Dino, and on September 24, Tuy Hoa gave birth to a female called Hanako. Of Packy's parents, Thonglaw died on November 25, 1974 (age 27), from a drug reaction to anesthesia. He sired 14 calves besides Packy. Belle died on April 22, 1997 (age 45), of a foot infection. She did not have any other offspring. Adulthood At 54 years of age, Packy was the oldest male (or \\"bull\\") Asian elephant in North America. In 2012, he weighed about , but also weighed at least 2,000 pounds more at times in the past. In 2008, he weighed . Packy sired seven calves (only one surviving): #Unnamed male calf, born to Packy and Me-Tu on May 10, 1975 at Los Angeles Zoo, died December 2 (6 months). #Unnamed female calf, born to Packy and Hanako on February 19, 1976 at Oregon Zoo, died March 5 (2 weeks). #Sumek, a female born to Packy and Hanako on March 15, 1978 at Oregon Zoo, died April 29 (6 weeks). #Khun-Chorn, a male born to Packy and Me-Tu on May 19, 1978 at Oregon Zoo, transferred to Dickerson Park Zoo in 1980 (age 2), died January 19, 2016 (age 37). #Thongtrii, a male born to Packy and Rosy on October 5, 1979, at Oregon Zoo, transferred to Fresno, California in 1981 (age 2), died February 1, 1993 (age 14). #Sung-Surin \\"Shine\\", a female born to Packy and Pet on December 26, 1982 at Oregon Zoo where she currently lives (age ). #Rama, a male born to Packy and Rosy on April 1, 1983, at Oregon Zoo, where he lived until his death on March 30, 2015.

The virus is exceptionally large, and larger than many bacteria. Mamavirus and other mimiviridae belong to nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDVs) family. Mamavirus can be compared to the similar complex virus mimivirus; mamavirus was so named because it is similar to but larger than mimivirus. Discovery Mamavirus was first reported in September 2008. Like mimivirus, mamavirus was isolated from an amoeba in a cooling tower. The mimiviridae were not discovered until recently because of their size; when filtered the mimiviridae stay with the bacteria which led scientists to believe they were also bacteria. Mimivirus was first isolated in 1992 when scientists were looking for the cause of a pneumonia outbreak in Bradford, UK. Due to its size it was named Bradfordcoccus and put in a freezer with scientists thinking it was a bacterium. A decade later, Jean-Michel Claverie and Didier Raoult discovered “Bradfordcoccus” was no bacterium when they tried to digest the cell wall with no success. Deciding to take a different route they looked at it under an electron microscope. They were surprised to find that it looked like a giant iridovirus, which are icosahedral viruses that infect insects, fish, and frogs. Knowing this paved the way for the discovery of mamavirus because scientists knew to look for other giant viruses. It was originally isolated from Acanthamoeba polyphaga, but subsequent work has involved Acanthamoeba castellanii (Acanthamoeba castellanii mamavirus, ACMV). Structure and genome Mamavirus, like other mimiviridae, is icosahedral with a core capsid and a peripheral fiber layer. It contains a linear double-stranded DNA genome which has a very high coding density that is characteristic of NCLDVs. The mimiviridae contain very similar genomes due to gene duplications, and a fair piece of the genome is associated with functions not previously found in a virus. Replication  Mamavirus possesses its own transcription machinery, and it packages transcription proteins in its particles. Transcription is believed to occur in the core particles. The core releases viral DNA and forms a cytoplasmic replication factory where DNA replication begins and transcription of late genes occurs. The replication factory forms around the viral core and expands until it occupies a large fraction of the amoeba cell volume. Later stages of the replication cycle involve partially assembled procapsids undergoing DNA packaging. Sputnik virophage While the mimiviridae were a surprise themselves, mamavirus contained an even bigger surprise. While looking at mamavirus under the electron microscope, Raoult discovered a second, small virus closely associated with mamavirus which was named Sputnik virophage, a satellite virus. Sputnik contains 21 genes and is tiny compared to mamavirus; however, it is quite powerful in its effects on mamavirus. Sputnik cannot replicate in acanthamoeba cells without a simultaneous infection by mamavirus (or mimivirus) so it infects the viral factory that mamavirus creates and hijacks it to replicate its own genome. This causes mamavirus to produce fewer viruses that are often deformed and less effective; there is also evidence of a partial thickening of the capsid. The fact that Sputnik can do this suggests that it is a viral parasite, and thus, was named the first virophage. A virophage is similar to bacteriophage viruses, which infect and sicken bacteria, but virophages infect viruses. Sputnik contains a circular double-stranded DNA of 18,343 base pairs, and is icosahedral in shape. Of the 21 genes it contains, eight encode proteins that have homologues. Of these eight, three are thought to be derived from mamavirus or mimivirus. This indicates that Sputnik can participate in gene- transfer processes and mediate lateral gene transfer between giant viruses. Implications  Mamavirus has caused scientists to review the criteria of life; to start questioning whether viruses are alive, revive the debate about the origin of DNA viruses and their possible role in the emergence of the eukaryotic nucleus.

In November, the Government announced that Cognita had been chosen to build a new school on the site. The school first opened in August 2009 at the Foundation Campus, located at 11 Lorong Chuan, while the purpose designed permanent campus was being built.

Originally, a store and blacksmith shop were at the location of the Darby Store, the intersection of Beallsville Road and Darnstown Road (Route 28), until in 1908 H.C. Darby bought the land.The Gazette: Germantown, Boyds, Poolesville edition, August 5, 2009, Meghan Tierney, \\"Volunteer Archeologists Explore Darby Store\\" (similar to Washington Post Montgomery edition) In 1910, H.C. Darby built a two-story general store. In the 19th and 20th century it was very common to have the family residence next to the family business. The Darby House was built in 1921, where the Darby family lived while they occupied their store.Places from the Past: The Tradition of Gardez Bien in Montgomery County, Maryland, MNCPPC, date unknown, pp. 150-151 After H.C. Darby managed the store, his son used it as a storage unit. Now the county has obtained the store and house, and is researching the history of the building. The general store is culturally and historically significant as one of the few remaining examples of rural vernacular architecture of the early 20th century in Montgomery County. History When the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Metropolitan Branch opened in 1873, creating the Sellman Station, development in the area increased. By the 1920s the Darby store included the area's post office. After H.C. Darby retired in 1974, his son H.D. Darby used the store as a storage unit. In 2004, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission purchased the Darby House for $670,000 after the Darby Store was claimed as one of the most endangered historic sites in the country by the Montgomery Preservation Inc. During the summer of 2009, the site was under excavation. A team of archaeologists spent three weeks at the site and their findings included: oyster shells, glass shards, coal, nails, ceramic pipe stems, a 1918 liberty dime, and a Yoo-hoo bottle, all of which provide clues to the history of the area, and the buildings occupying it since the 19th century. Planned move Volunteer archeologists are digging through the layers of the Darby Store to find artifacts before the store is moved. They are looking for any important artifacts on the present site of the building and the site to which it is to be moved. The Darby Store is going to be restored by the end of 2009. In 2010 the store is to be moved back off the corner of the streets by Robert Silman Associates. As of 2015, the Montgomery County Department of Parks was accepting requests for proposals to occupy the historical store. The county said it was hoping a new tenant would bring new life to the building that has been an intricate part of the community since 1910. https://www.mymcmedia.org/darby-store-up-for-rent-in-beallsville/ References Category:Historic buildings and structures in the United States http://www.montgomeryparks.org/PPSD/Cultural_Resources_Stewardship/heritage/darby_store.shtm http://www.montgomeryparks.org/PPSD/Cultural_Resources_Stewardship/crs_special_events/votedarby.org.shtm https://www.loc.gov/item/md1938/ ","title":"Darby Store"},{"id":"24657381","text":"Anatoly Tyurin () (born July 1, 1968, in Vologda, Russian SFSR) is an Uzbek sprint canoer who competed in the early to mid-1990s.

Under the Communist regime, he was a driving force behind alternative cultural and intellectual projects in Socialist Slovenia, which challenged the cultural policies of the Titoist system. During the Slovenian Spring (1988–1990), he actively participated in the efforts for the democratization and independence of Slovenia.(14 July 2011). Stari sloni, do zadnjega diha na okopih, Dnevnik (Slovenia) (in Slovenian)  Biography  Taufer was born Venčeslav Taufer in Ljubljana, Slovenia, then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. His father was a left liberal activist, and prominent member of the Sokol athletic movement. Due to his political activities, he was transferred by the Yugoslav conservative regime to the heavily industrialized Central Sava Valley in central Slovenia, where Veno spent his childhood. In 1943, during the German occupation of Yugoslavia in World War II, his father was killed by the Nazis as one of the leaders of the local partisan resistance. In 1944, he moved to Ljubljana, where he attended high school. He enrolled at the University of Ljubljana, where he studied comparative literature. In the late 1950s, he became one of the initiators, together with Taras Kermauner, of a circle of young Slovene artists and intellectuals who challenged the rigid cultural policies of the Yugoslav Communist regime. In 1957, he became one of the co-editors of the literary journal Revija 57, the first autonomous journal in Slovenia prior to the Communist takeover in 1945. Due to its open criticism of the Communist regime, the journal was soon censored by the authorities and several of its collaborators, like Jože Pučnik and Taufer himself, were imprisoned. In 1961, he briefly worked as an editor for the Slovenian Television service, but soon resigned in the face of political pressures. Between 1962 and 1964, he worked as the director of the alternative theatre Oder 57, staging innovative and subversive plays by Slovenian and foreign modernist authors, among them Dominik Smole, Primož Kozak and Marjan Rožanc. In the mid 1960s, he also collaborated on the alternative journal Perspektive, although he never joined its editorial board. After the prohibition of the journal Perspektive in 1964, Taufer withdrew from public life, dedicating most of his time to translating. In 1966, he moved to London, where he worked at the Yugoslav section of the BBC. He returned to Slovenia in 1970, and was employed once again by the Slovenian television service, where he worked as an editor in the cultural programme section. In the early 1980s, he was one of the founders of the new alternative journal Nova revija. Throughout the 1980s, he was active in the process of gradual pluralization of public life in Slovenia. In 1987, he joined the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights. He also participated in the so-called May Declaration of 1989, in which a group of Slovenian intellectuals and public activists openly demanded full democratization of the politics of the nation, the introduction of a market economy, and the secession of Slovenia from Yugoslavia. He was one of the co-founders of the Slovenian Democratic Union, one of the first anti-Communist political parties established in 1989. Between 1990 and 1995, he worked as an advisor at the Ministry of Culture of Slovenia. In 1996, he received the Prešeren Award for life achievements. In the 1990s, Taufer was supportive of various humanitarian activities during the Yugoslav Wars. During the war in Bosnia, he personally visited the besieged city of Sarajevo, together with Drago Jančar, Niko Grafenauer and Boris A. Novak, to take supplies collected by the Slovene Writers' Association to the civilian population. In 2002 Taufer received the Jan Smrek Prize, the highest literature prize given to foreign writers in Slovakia. In 2011 he became president of the Slovene Writers' Association. He is the father of film director Lara Simona Taufer.  Work  Taufer began his public literary career in 1956 and 1957, when he published poems in the student journal Tribuna. During the period of 1958–72, he established himself as a poet. Other notable Slovenian poets of the time include, Gregor Strniša, Dane Zajc, Tomaž Šalamun, and Jože Snoj. He published a collection titled Lead Stars (Svinčene zvezde) in 1958. His second collection of poems, published in 1963, dealt mostly with love themes. His third collection, titled Exercises and Tasks (Vaje in naloge) and published in 1969, is considered to be Taufer's most daring poetic achievement. Taufer uses extracts and collages in an accumulation of allusions to political reality, using parody in order to convey his message. In his later poetry in the 1970s, his literary experimentation went even further, marking the way to a complete transformation of poetic language, that would be then picked up by younger poets, especially by Tomaž Šalamun and Niko Grafenauer. Taufer's poetry of the 70s and 80s has entered the canon of modern Slovenian literature. His Songbook of Used Words (Pesmarica rabljenih besed), published 1975, was conceived as a collection of contemporary variations on Slovene folk songs (especially ballads), and was declared by the philosopher and critic Tine Hribar as the first post-modern work in Slovenian literature. Taufer's next collection, The Management of Nails (Ravnanje žebljev), published 1979, was partly an exercise in linguistic experimentation. The poems in the collection Water Marks (Vodenjaki), published 1986, record a story of chaos, and a decline of civilization, cultures, beliefs, ideas and values. The collection Crocks of Songs (Črepinje pesmi), published 1989, shows clear influences by Ezra Pound. The poems contained in this collection use fragments from ancient Greek myths, archaic images and visions of disasters, mobilized as an instrument of post- modern reality. During the 1990s, his most important collection of poetry was Still Odes (Še ode), published 1996, which marks a return to classical poetic forms, mostly sonnets. The collection is opened by two poems containing a violent condemnation of the destruction of Vukovar and Sarajevo during the Yugoslav wars. Taufer has also written several plays. His most famous one is called Odysseus & Son or on the World and Home (1990), in which he renews the story of Odysseus and Telemachus, including whole passages from Homer's text, supplemented by fragments from diverse genres.

This volcanic plateau is part of the Nasu Volcanic Zone and straddles the border between the Iwate Prefecture and Akita Prefecture. The volcano is listed as one of the 100 Famous Japanese Mountains, and forms part of the Towada- Hachimantai National Park.  Etymology  There are several legends concerning the origin of the name “Hachimantai”. In one legend, the late Nara period General Sakanoue no Tamuramaro pursued a group of Emishi warriors into the area, and was so impressed with the natural beauty of the region that he said it must be the abode of the kami Hachiman. In another legend, the area was named after Minamoto Yoshiie, a late Heian period warrior whose nickname was “Hachiman Tarō”. Geography Situation The Hachimantai plateau is located approximately south of Lake Towada and northeast of Lake Tazawa, within the borders of the city of Hachimantai, Iwate, and village of Kazuno, Akita. Mount Akita-Komagatake the highest peak in Akita Prefecture, lies to the southwest, and Mount Iwate is to the southeast. Both peaks are sometimes included in the geographic perimeter of the Hachimantai plateau, although they form distinct volcanic groups. Geology In a general sense, the Hachimantai plateau is an ancient volcanic shield, levelled by erosion or deformed by landslides or lateral overlaps, or covered by products of more recent volcanic activity. The deepest layer is composed of Tertiary bedrock resting on a layer of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks containing Cretaceous granite blocks. The lithospheric layer is composed of acid pyroclastic rock of the Lower Pleistocene [and of the Holocene. On the surface, the volcanic extent is composed of magmatic rocks: ignimbrite and volcanic cones of andesite, dacite, and basalt.Masao Ban, Akihiko Fujinawa and Tsukasa Ohba, Active Volcanoes in Northeast Japan, Bulletin of the Volcanological Society of Japan, Tokyo, The volcanological society of japan, vol. 58, no B1-1-34, 2013 On the Hachimantai plateau and in its immediate periphery, the relief is marked by two chains of volcanic cones, aligned one along a north–south axis and the other a west–east axis, and which intersect at the site of the Mount Hachimantai. The north-south chain extends for 10 km and includes, from north to south, Mount Mokko (1577 m), Mount Morobi (1516 m), an anonymous peak (1481 m), Mount Keson (1448 m), Mount Ōbuka (1541 m) and Mount Komokko (1467 m). The west-east range is 15 km long and includes, from west to east, Mount Fukenoyu (1120 m), Mount Hachimantai, Mount Gentan (1595 m), Mount Appi (1176 m), Mount Ebisu (1496 m) and Mount Daikoku (1446 m), Mount Yanomune (1397 m), Mount Maemori (1304 m) and Mount Nishimori (1328 m). This second chain is extends to the west to include the stratovolcano Mount Akita-Yakeyama (1366 m) which has a double summit crate. More than twenty craters are distributed on the plateau, sometimes forming chains, with diameters ranging from a few meters to 180 m. Most of these volcanic depressions are partially filled by lakes or marshes. History Today, hydrothermal activity is maintained in and around the caldera of Mount Akita-Yakeyama in the form of fumaroles, the circulation of water from hot springs and, in places, boiling puddles of mud and sulfur deposits. In the common era, more than eight eruptions of Mount Akita-Yakeyama were recorded, notably in 1678, three in the nineteenth century, and five in the twentieth century, but no eruptions of Mount Hachimantai itself. However, the Japan Meteorological Agency, in compliance with international standards since 2003, considers that a volcano is active if it has erupted during the Holocene, for the last 10,000 years or so, or shows significant geothermal activity. As a result, the entire Hachimantai Plateau (including Mount Hachimantai) in its list of active volcanoes in Japan. Human activity Mineral extraction In 1882, a villager discovered a native sulphur outcrop in the village of Matsuo, at the foot of the southeast slope of Mount Chausu. The large-scale exploitation of the deposit began in 1914 with the opening of the Matsuo mine, which also produced iron and copper. The mine employed 1500 people at its peak, but was closed in 1971. Tourism The Hachimantai area is accessible from the city centers of Kazuno, Hachimantai, Semboku and Morioka. The Aspite Line is a 27-km mountain sightseeing road that runs through the area noted for its autumn scenery and high walls of snow in spring. Winter sports Apppi Kogen Ski Resort is one of the largest in Japan, with 21 ski runs and over 45 kilometers of trails, with six lifts. The Hachimantai Resort has two areas: The Panorama Ski Area has seven ski runs and four lifts, and is popular with novices. The Shimokura Ski Area has three runs and three lifts, and is popular with medium to advanced skiers Onsen As the Hachimantai Plateau is a particularly active geothermal area, traditional hot springs resorts, some of which have a history of over 250 years, are common. The temperature and composition of the water varies from location to location. The Hachimantai onsen is a sulfur spring. Appi onsen is a simple alkaline spring, and Shin-Appi onsen has highly saline water. The Toshichi onsen at 1400 meters is the highest in the Tohoku region and has milky-white waters. Environmental Protection Mount Hachimantai and its immediate surroundings have been protected since February 1936 in the Towada-Hachimantai National Park, which covers an area of 855.34 km2 divided into two zones: one includes the Towada crater lake at the Prefectures of Akita and Aomori, the other the high volcanic plateau Hachimantai. Hachimantai High Plateau is a biotope for the cohabitation of many wild bird species and its forests and wetlands provide fertile ground for various plant species including several varieties of alpine plants.

It was turned over to the German government on 23 June 2006 and is now a general aviation airport. Fliegerhorst Giebelstadt was one of the first Luftwaffe airfields, being established in 1935. During World War II, it was a reserve airfield in the rear area of Central Germany. Later, it was a key defensive airfield as part of the Defence of the Reich campaign where Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters assigned to the field intercepted Allied bombers attacking Germany. After being captured by the United States Army in April 1945, it briefly became a combat airfield for the Ninth Air Force and was used by the United States Air Forces in Europe until 1968 in a variety of missions, from strategic reconnaissance to air defense interceptors. Turned over to the United States Army in 1968, it was the home of the Air Defense Artillery and many other units. History Origins The layout for Fliegerhorst Giebelstadt began in June 1934 with site reconnaissance, and land purchasing began shortly afterwards. Official construction began in the late summer under the code name Höhenflugzentrale Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (Altitude Flight Central of the German Airline Pilot School). Giebelstadt Airfield By January 1935 enough construction was completed for the airfield to open. It was, however, a school only in name because the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, did not permit Germany to have a military air force.Giebelstadt Army Airfield prepares to closse its gates 69th ADA Public Affairs, The Monitor, 6 July 2006. In addition to the airfield construction, in the village of Giebelstadt, many housing units were built for both officers and enlisted men assigned to the airfield. Although the town was damaged significantly during World War II, many of these houses and barracks still exist and are in use as private homes and apartments. The existence of the Luftwaffe was revealed by Germany on 3 January 1935, and Fliegerhorst Giebelstadt was one of its first operational airfields. It first consisted of a turf runway along with two paved launch platforms. The first operational flying unit assigned to Giebelstadt was Fliegergruppe Giebelstadt, activated at the base on 10 January 1935. Adolf Hitler officially opened the airfield after a review of the troops on 11 September 1936. Major General Albert Kesselring inspected the base in February 1937 and presented the unit with its colors. Later that year, the people of Giebelstadt held a festival on the airbase as part of the celebration commemorating the town's 1100th year of existence.History of Giebelstadt Army Airfield Fliegergruppe Giebelstadt was later redesignated as Kampfgeschwader 155 (KG 155) and was equipped with an early version of the Heinkel He 111 Bomber (He 111A-0).The Luftwaffe, 1933–45 KG 155 moved to Austria following the Anschluss in 1938, being reassigned to Wiener Neustadt. KG 155 was replaced by the formation of Kampfgeschwader 53 \\"Legion Condor\\" (KG 53) in January 1939, being equipped also with He 111s. The bomber unit remained until August 1939, when at the brink of World War II it was reassigned to Ansbach where it engaged in operations over Poland. During the \\"Phony War\\" with the British and French, Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2) was based there with Dornier Do 17Zs between February and March 1940. Luftwaffe use during World War II At the beginning of World War II, aircraft from Giebelstadt flew support missions in conjunction with the German Blitzkrieg, flying many missions against various targets in France. As the war moved away from Giebelstadt, the base became a training facility for pilots, observers and radio operators from 1939 until 1941. I/KG 76 used the airfield from October 1940 to April 1941 to upgrade from Do 17s to Junkers Ju 88As. III/KG 76 was stationed at the airfield during August/September 1941 and from April/May 1942, for rest and rearmament from duty in the Soviet Union. During 1943, Kampfgeschwader 100 (KG 100) moved in for R&R; in May, exchanging He 111H's for newer Dornier Do 217E/K model bombers. At first, the sod airfield was circular with planes taking off and landing into the wind, whichever direction that happened to be. Beginning in 1944, Giebelstadt received a very long (3000m 9,100 ft) paved runway aligned 08/26 slightly to the east and south of the original 1935 airfield. In addition, other upgrades to facilities were included in the plans for Giebelstadt to be used for jet interceptor aircraft operations such as additional aircraft dispersal sites, an expansion of the fuel dump and other facilities. This in turn made a significant extension of the airfield. With this construction, the expanded air base site was about 250ha in size. Not only was the location of the airbase a closely held secret, the town name itself was banned from all maps of the region and can still be hard to find on some maps today. To hide the airfield from Allied reconnaissance aircraft, workers painted the runway to resemble a grassy field complete with fluffy white sheep. In April 1944, jet aircraft arrived at Giebelstadt with Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG 54) and the Messerschmitt Me 262 A. In addition, testing of the Messerschmitt Me 163A Rocket fighter took place. In March 1945, KG 54 was replaced by Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51) with newer model Me 262s, remaining until March 1945 when aircraft operation at the airfield became unsustainable. The Jet aircraft at Giebelstadt drew the attention of the USAAF Eighth Air Force, with no less than five heavy bomber attacks on the airfield between September 1944 and March 1945.USAFHRA Document Search, Giebelstadt In addition, as Giebelstadt came in range of Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolt fighter bombers in eastern France, attacks on the airfield by these tactical units with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps were frequent. These attacks would take place when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe jets assigned to the base, with the attacks being timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) World War II USAAF use At the end of March 1945, the 12th Armored Division captured Giebelstadt and its airfield shortly before the end of the war in Europe. The airfield had been heavily bombed and Soldiers of the United States Army's 12th Armored Division rolled into Giebelstadt capturing it unopposed. In the fields surrounding the base, the Army Soldiers found the burned out hulks of numerous bombers, night fighters and other military aircraft destroyed by the fleeing German forces, one of many across the former Reich. On 5 April the IX Engineer Command 819th Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began patching the bomb craters of the airfield's concrete runway. Within a day the airfield was usable for C-47 Skytrain transports for combat resupply and casualty evacuation (S&E;) use, with the airfield being designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-90 Giebelstadt\\". Combat units arrived on 20 April when the P-47 Thunderbolt-equipped 50th Fighter Group began using the airfield, and the 417th Night Fighter Squadron arrived for night fighter defensive interceptor missions against any rogue Luftwaffe aircraft still in the skies.Maurer, Maurer.

Repairing the damage to the airfield and the support area was performed, in large part, by German Prisoners of War, into 1946 and turning the airfield into a usable, long-term facility to be used by the Air Force. The last POW was released from Giebelstadt on 20 August 1946.USAFHRA Document 00017136 Then, for nearly a decade after the war, Giebelstadt airfield was used periodically by the Air Force until it was made a permanent United States Air Forces in Europe airbase in 1956. With the base and facilities undergoing repair, USAFE moved the 55th Fighter Group to Giebelstadt in April 1946 from Kaufbeuren Air Base, equipped first with P-47s, then, due to the long runway, upgraded the unit to P-80 Shooting Star jet aircraft later in 1946. General Carl A \\"Tooey\\" Spaatz, Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, visited the base in July 1946, witnessing an aerial review of the newly acquired P-80 jet fighters. The 55th was inactivated in August due to budget reductions, the P-80s being reassigned to the incoming 31st Fighter Group which replaced the 55th. Giebelstadt was placed on \\"Standby\\" status due to budget reductions in September, with the 31st and its jets being moved to Kitzingen Air Base. During 1947, with the airfield inactive, the war-damaged and repaired German jet runway was replaced with a new, 7,200' runway, and additional facilities were upgraded and brought into service. New hangars were constructed along with a large concrete parking apron, and in late 1947 was redesignated as Giebelstadt Air Base The new Strategic Air Command dispatched nine B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombers of the 97th Bombardment Group to Giebelstadt to conduct training during temporary deployments to Europe. The last SAC personnel returned to the United States in January 1948, and afterward the facility was closed and placed on standby status due to budget reductions in the postwar era. The US Air Force returned in April 1950, when the 603rd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, stationed at Hof arrived at Giebelstadt AB as part of an Operational Readiness Test. In May they were placed on temporary status and finally in August 1950, Giebelstadt was made the home of the 603d, with the main mission of Giebelstadt becoming an Air Defense Radar Station, equipped with the Bendix AN/FPS-3.3A search RADAR. With the breakout of the Cold War, the usefulness of the airfield by the Air Force became limited, as Giebelstadt was simply too close to the East German border to station tactical aircraft. The flight time for jet aircraft from the border was less than 15 minutes, which meant little or no time was available to launch aircraft from the field before it coming under attack. The airfield, however, remained active as various MATS C-54 Skymaster transport units used the base during 1951–1952; then it was used by various transient transport aircraft throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In January and February 1956, Giebelstadt Army Airfield was one of the two West German launch sites for Project Genetrix surveillance balloons, which were targeted to obtain aerial photographs over Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. In July 1956 the 603d ACW departed for Langerkopf AS, and the RADAR station was taken over by the 602d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, which moved in from Birkenfeld AS. With the arrival, Giebelstat was upgraded to the AN/FPS-20 General Surveillance Radar and the AN/FPS-6 Long-Range Height Finder Radar. Starting in 1956 Central Intelligence Agency Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft flew from the airfield in support of operation AQUATONE/OILSTONE. Detachment \\"A\\", with four U-2 aircraft, arrived at Giebelstadt from Wiesbaden Air Base in October 1956, the reason being that U-2 operations from the relatively isolated Giebelstadt would draw much less attention than from Wiesbaden. Towards the end of the year, Detachment A flew U-2s three times over Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia. The Detachment was operational at Giebelstadt until 15 November 1957, when it was closed down, and U-2 operations were moved to Pakistan. During the 1960s, F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors of the 86th Air Division used the base frequently as a forward base from their home bases west of the Rhine. The departure of the F-102 from USAFE and budget reductions in the Air Force led to the departure of the 602nd ACW in July 1968. Giebelstadt Air Base and all of its facilities were transferred to United States Army control in August 1968. United States Army use Many Army units came and went over the years, but in recent time the airfield hosted the 4th Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) flying mostly AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters, UH-1 Huey and UH-60 Blackhawk transport helicopters. The 4th Brigade left Giebelstadt in early 1992, replaced by AH-64 Apache attack helicopters of the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment, and UH-60 Blackhawk and OH-58 Kiowas of the 12th Aviation Brigade. Air Defense Artillery (ADA) continued to play a major role on the airfield with the presence of \\"C\\" Battery of the 6th Battalion, 52nd ADA Regiment, with its Hawk missile batteries and the senior officer on post commanding the 69th ADA Brigade. In 1993, the Apache helicopter and Hawk ADA units deactivated and a CH-47 Chinook company (A Co. 5–159th Aviation Regiment – \\"Big Windy\\") arrived from Schwaebisch Hall Army Airfield. In 1994, the OH-58 Kiowa units disbanded as the aircraft returned to the states for conversion to armed OH-58 Kiowa Warriors. Also in 1994, tragedy struck the Giebelstadt military community in April when two Blackhawk helicopters of the 5th Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment, assigned to Giebelstadt were mistakenly shot down by USAF F-15's over Iraq. All 26 people were killed, including eight Giebelstadt crew members. In 1995, the primary units on Giebelstadt Army Airfield are: the 69th ADA Brigade, the 5th Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment (UH-60's); A Company, 5th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment (Big Windy CH-47s); C Company 6th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment (War Eagles UH-60's); C Company 7th Battalion 158th Aviation Regiment (Blue Stars UH-60's) and B Company, 7th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment (Third Corps Support Command aircraft maintenance), US Air Force units on Giebelstadt AAF are Det. 10, 617th Weather Squadron, providing weather support for the airfield and to the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) headquartered in Wuerzburg, and OL-C, 617th Comm Squadron, providing maintenance support for meteorological and navigation equipment in the area. The Department of Defense announced on 29 July 2005 plans for the return of eleven Army bases to Germany in fiscal year 2007. These installation returns were scheduled as part of plans for the 1st Infantry Division headquarters' return to the United States with its divisional flag in the summer of 2006. As part of this redeployment, Giebelstadt Army Airfield was closed by the United States Army on 23 June 2006. Current use After being turned over to the German government in 2006, Giebelstadt Airfield has become a commercial airport used by general aviation aircraft (see Giebelstadt Airport). Due to the frequent wartime bombing attacks, much of the wartime airfield was destroyed. Almost all of the buildings on the airfield are of postwar vintage, although the modern buildings are constructed in a traditional German style. In the town of Giebelstadt, many of the buildings used for personnel barracks and housing still exist and still are being used. The original circular airfield still exists, in part, and some wartime concrete hardstands remain. A pre-war Luftwaffe hangar which was repaired remains to the west side of the original airfield, connected to an enclosing taxiway and some aircraft parking hardstands. The 1944 extension with the extended length jet runway remains, with the taxiways and hardstands for Me 262 use remaining. The runway, reduced in length in 1947 still has part of its wartime concrete remaining between the Bundesstraße 19 (B-19) highway and the current runway 20 (west) end. Remains of the original B-19 highway, which was cut in 1944 when the jet runway was built, still remain to the south of the airfield, today being a single lane farm road running north-south that intersects the airfield about midway between the runway ends. In the neighboring town of Wolkshausen, south of the airfield, the old B-19 is still known as \\"Giebelstadter Straße\\" See also * Advanced Landing Ground References External links * Giebelstadt Airfield (In German – Many photographs over the years) Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces in Germany Category:Airports established in 1935 Category:Airports in Bavaria ","title":"Giebelstadt Army Airfield"},{"id":"24657686","text":"Vira Lozinsky (born 1974) is an Israeli-Moldovan musician and Yiddish language singer.

Sonderstab F was created on 20 May 1941 and ceased to exist on 20 June 1941. Description On 23 May, the instructions for Sonderstab F were detailed by German dictator Adolf Hitler in Führer Directive No. 30 (Weisung Nr. 30). The directive detailed German intervention in support of Arab nationalists who seized the government in Iraq and were being confronted by the British Army (10th Indian Infantry Division). The mission included a Brandenburger Regiment, a German Air Force (Luftwaffe), and a German Foreign Office (Auswärtiges Amt) component. Many members of the various mission components had received orders prior to 23 May and were in Iraq at the time Weisung Nr. 30 was issued. The Anglo-Iraqi War started on 2 May. According to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the “vigorous instructions” provided by Hitler were \\"belated\\" and developed at a time when “all chance of useful Axis intervention had passed.”Churchill, pg. 234 Sonderstab F was commanded by General Hellmuth Felmy.Kurowski, pg. 131 While Felmy was a General der Flieger, he did not command the air component of Sonderstab F. General Felmy commanded Sonderstab F from Greece and it was Major Axel von Blomberg who flew to Iraq. He was the commander of the reconnaissance group in Iraq until his untimely death. Had he lived, von Blomberg was to integrate the Luftwaffe component, Fliegerführer Irak, with Iraqi armed forces in operations against the British. In addition, he and other members of the Brandenburger Regiment were to raise a German-led Arab Brigade (Arabische Brigade). The brigade was to have been raised in Iraq from the thousands of Arab volunteers available from Iraq, from Syria, from Palestine, from Saudi Arabia, and from throughout the Arab world. After his death and after the mission was a failure, the small group of German Military Intelligence (Abwehr) officers who followed him discussed the destruction of all oil facilities in Iraq. But this was pure fantasy for the four Brandenburgers available.Kurowski, pg. 134 Dr. Fritz Grobba represented the German Foreign Office in Iraq for Sonderstab F. As such, he was responsible for the direction of mission-related propaganda in addition to his diplomatic duties. In accordance with ’’Weisung Nr. 30’’, the command structure for the Luftwaffe component of Sonderstab F was independent from the rest of the mission. Luftwaffe Colonel Werner Junck commanded Fliegerführer Irak in Iraq. He reported directly to Lieutenant General Hans Jeschonnek in Germany. Fliegerführer Irak arrived in Iraq on 13 May, fought against the British under conditions which became more and more difficult, and, by the end of the month, was forced to abandon Iraq.Lyman, pg. 84 See also * Anglo-Iraqi War * Condor Legion Notes  References   * Category:German World War II special forces Category:Special forces units and formations Category:Military units and formations established in 1941 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1941 Category:Iraq in World War II ","title":"Special Staff F"},{"id":"24657845","text":"The 242nd Training Centre of the Airborne Forces (242 TC VDV) is a brigade- sized training formation of the Russian Airborne Troops.  History   Cold War  To prepare sergeants and junior specialists for airborne units in accordance with a directive of the Commander Soviet Ground Forces, the 44th Training Airborne Division was formed in July–October 1960 in Ostrov and Cheryokha, in Pskov Oblast. The Deputy Commander of the Airborne Troops, Lieutenant-General Vasily Margelov, supervised the division's formation. The formation's birthday is 17 September, when the formation of the division was completed and Major General N.G. Zharenov assumed command. The division was formed from the 17th Airborne Training Centre at Dyatkovo, the 78th Separate Self-Propelled Artillery Training Battalion at Kaunas, and the 11th School for Junior Specialists of the Medical Service at Ostrov. The vast majority of officers had experience in training units of the regimental schools, which had been disbanded at the same time. Among the officers selected to staff the training centre were 131 veterans of the Great Patriotic War. The division consisted of three training Airborne Regiments; 301st and 304th Training Airborne Regiments - Ostrov, 302 - Cheryokha, a training artillery regiment (1120th, Ostrov) and other units. The division's regiments were the heirs of the regiments with the corresponding World War II numbers: 301st and 304th were part of the 100th Guards Airborne Division/Rifle Division, and the 302nd had been part of the 98th Guards Airborne Division/Rifle Division. However, for unclear reasons, the division was soon renamed the 44th. Also the regiment numbering changed: instead of, respectively, the 302nd and 304th, the 226th and 285th regiments appeared (no longer associated historically with the VDV). While it was not clear whether the division was formed as a Guards formation, when it became the 44th, it was not just not a Guards formation, but the only non-Guards formation in the Soviet Airborne Forces. The regiments were not Guards units either. In September 1961, available stocks, weapons, military equipment, and the bulk of the division were moved to the Lithuanian SSR. The Divisional Headquarters and the 301st Regiment were established at Gaižiūnai, the 304th Regiment at Rukla (8 km south-east of Jonava), and the 1120th Training Artillery Regiment in the city of Prienai (28 km south of Kaunas). On 15 May 1972, the 332nd School for Praporshchiks was formed in Gaižiūnai from the 226th Training Airborne Regiment. On 1 December 1987 in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Defence of the Soviet Union of 18 August 1987, the 44th Training Airborne Division was renamed the 242nd Airborne Training Centre.  Russian Airborne Troops  In accordance with the directive of the Defense Ministry on 13 November 1992, the Airborne Training Centre was removed from the Republic of Lithuania to Omsk in Russian territory. Shortly after the relocation, the 301st Training Airborne Regiment was disbanded, and the 1120th Training Artillery Regiment was moved to Ishim in Tyumen Oblast. The training centre headquarters is currently located in the village of Svetloe ('Bright') in the Omsk Oblast. In the years since its relocation to Omsk the formerly division-sized formation has shrunk to the size of a brigade. In July 2015, a barracks of the centre in the village of Svetloe collapsed, killing 23. Colonel Oleg Ponomarev, who commanded the centre at the time, was arrested. Colonel Arkady Furdeyev replaced him in command of the centre in late August.

Carrillo (born January 5, 1965) is a Texas geologist and politician who was formerly chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission and county judge of Taylor County, Texas. Biography The son of an immigrant from Mexico, Carrillo is a native of Abilene, Texas. He received a bachelor of science degree in geology from Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene. He then attended Baylor University in Waco, where he earned a master of science degree, also in geology. From 1988 to 1994 he worked as a petroleum geophysicist for Amoco. He attended law school at night and in 1994 procured his J.D. degree from the University of Houston Law Center. From 1994 to 1996, he was an attorney for the Texas General Land Office under the Democratic commissioner Garry Mauro. Having returned to Abilene in 1996, he taught political science for a time at Hardin-Simmons and served on the city council and as an assistant city attorney while maintaining a law practice. He and his wife, Joy McClellan Carrillo, have three daughters. While in Abilene, they attended Abilene Bible Church, and Carrillo was a member of the Chamber of Commerce, the Abilene Hispanic Leadership Council, Keep Abilene Beautiful, the Salvation Army, and the board of advisors of the Texas Journal of Oil, Gas, and Energy, published by the University of Texas at Austin School of Law. He was appointed Taylor County Judge, and in 2002 ran for and won election to full four-year term in that position. However, he served less than two months of his elected term before resigning in February 2003 to accept a gubernatorial appointment to the Texas Railroad Commission, filling a seat vacated by Tony Garza, who had resigned to become U.S. Ambassador to Mexico. Carillo joined the Railroad Commission, the state's petroleum, natural gas, and pipeline regulatory body as an appointee of Governor Rick Perry. In 2004 he sought an elective term on the Railroad Commission, failing to win the primary outright, but winning the Republican nomination after a runoff against the politically unknown Robert Butler. In that year's general election he won a full six-year term on the Commission, easily defeating Democrat Bob Scarborough. Carillo served on the Railroad Commission until 2011, when his elective term ended. He was a candidate for renomination in the statewide Republican primary election on March 2, 2010, but he was handily defeated by newcomer David J. Porter, an accountant from Giddings who received 732,892 votes (60.7 percent) to Carrillo's 474,096 (39.3 percent). In the November 2, 2010, general election, Porter then defeated the Democrat Jeff Weems, an oil-and-gas lawyer from Houston. On his website as Railroad Commission chairman, Carrillo used the slogan \\"Promoting Texas Energy for All Texans\\", adding: \\"Texas is our nation’s premier energy producing state and the Texas energy sector plays a critical role in ensuring domestic energy security. At this critical stage in our nation’s energy security future, we must responsibly drill more in our own backyard to minimize foreign oil and gas imports.\\" References Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:American geologists Category:Baylor University alumni Category:Hardin–Simmons University alumni Category:County judges in Texas Category:Members of the Railroad Commission of Texas Category:People from Abilene, Texas Category:Abilene City Council members Category:Texas Republicans Category:Texas lawyers Category:University of Houston Law Center alumni Category:People from Rockwall, Texas ","title":"Victor G.

It is a small woody shrub that grows to 100 cm high with prickly foliage. It is extremely sensitive to dieback from the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi Description Isopogon ceratophyllus is a prickly shrub, growing to 15–100 cm (6–40 in) tall and to 120 cm (4 ft) across. The oval to round flower heads, known as inflorescences, appear between July and January, and are around 3 cm in diameter. Taxonomy Isopogon ceratophyllus was first described by Robert Brown in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek words cerat- \\"horn\\" and phyllon \\"leaf\\", relating to the leaves' resemblance to antlers. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, his response to what he perceived as a lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice. Because Isopogon was based on Isopogon anemonifolius, and that species had already been placed by Richard Salisbury in the segregate genus Atylus in 1807, Kuntze revived the latter genus on the grounds of priority, and made the new combination Atylus ceratophyllus for this species. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905. Common names include horny cone bush and, from Kangaroo Island, wild Irishman. Distribution and habitat The species ranges from south-western Victoria into the south-eastern corner of South Australia and in the Furneaux Group of Bass Strait islands, principally Flinders, Cape Barren and Clarke Islands. A King Island record has not been reconfirmed and is unlikely. It is the only Isopogon species found in South Australia. It grows on sandy soils in open eucalyptus forest or woodland. or heathland. Ecology Isopogon ceratophyllus is extremely sensitive to dieback (infection by the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi). Fieldwork in the Brisbane Ranges in 1994 showed that I. ceratophyllus, which had been common in areas before dieback and had vanished along with other sensitive species, had yet to return after 30 years. This was despite other sensitive species, such as grasstree (Xanthorrhoea australis), smooth parrot- pea (Dillwynia glaberrima), erect guinea flower (Hibbertia stricta) and prickly broom heath (Monotoca scoparia), eventually regenerating around 10 years post-infection. All Tasmanian populations are at risk of eradication by P. cinnamomi. Plants are perishing at Wingaroo Nature Reserve on Flinders Island from exposure to the pathogen. Cultivation Rarely cultivated, it is slow growing and requires well-drained yet moist sandy soils. It would suit a rockery garden.

Madero and Victoriano Huerta. Biography She was born Edith Louise Coues on January 31, 1876 in Columbia, South Carolina. Her parents were from an upper-class Roman Catholic family. She was privately tutored before being sent to a convent school in Maryland.Wadsworth, Sarah, \\"O'Shaugnessy, Edith\\" Women's Travel Writing, University of Minnesota http://etrc.lib.umn.edu/travbio.htm#oshaugh retrieved 11 October 2009 After a convent education she was sent to Europe both for the experience, and in the hope of finding a suitable husband. She married Oxford-educated diplomat and lawyer Nelson O’Shaughnessy in 1901. From 1901 to 1915, Edith O’Shaughnessy was a diplomatic wife, serving her country (and tea) as a proper diplomatic hostess in Copenhagen, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Vienna, Bucharest, Mexico, and Rio de Janeiro.

A Diplomat's Wife in Mexico covers events in 1913 and 1914, when Madero was overthrown in a violent coup (the \\"Ten Tragic Days\\") by Victoriano Huerta on February 13, 1913 and murdered by the new regime. In A Diplomat's Wife, O’Shaughnessy has no illusions about Huerta's alcoholism and bloody-mindedness, sometimes displaying a condescending attitude based mostly on the racial background of the indigenous Huerta. However, she defends him as \\"a necessarily iron-fisted leader, doing his best to control an unruly populace.\\" Grabman, \\"Diplomatic Days,\\" passum.)

Nelson O'Shaughnessy was later posted to several embassies in Europe, providing Edith with material for travel books on northern France. She also wrote a biography of Marie Adelaide, the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, and a novel, Viennese Medley, based on her screenplay The Greater Glory which tells the story of former aristocrats at loose ends in Vienna after the end of the First World War and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Grabman O'Shaughnessy also contributed articles to many periodicals, including Harper's Magazine and Review of Reviews.Wadsworth She died on February 18, 1939 in New York City.

It stars George C. Scott, who also served as director and distributor. Plot In 1902, John (Scott), his wife Maida (Scott's real-life wife, Trish Van Devere) and their infant son David (played by both Lee Montgomery and John David Carson) are the only survivors of a ship that crashes into the rocky beach of an uncharted island during a violent storm. By 1912, David, now a seemingly happy 12-year-old boy, begins to enter puberty. By the time he is 17, David is consumed by lust for his mother, which drives a wedge between him and his father to the point where they hunt each other down for the affections of the only woman on the island.

Rating controversy and distribution When the MPAA gave the film an \\"R\\" rating, Scott blasted the decision and urged exhibitors to defy it by running the movie unrated. Scott strongly disagreed with the MPAA's position that incest was a \\"major\\" theme of the film and said he was \\"appalled\\" that his movie was given the same rating as films like Candy Stripe Nurses and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.McBride, Joseph (October 9, 1974). \\"Geo. C. Scott Excoriates MPAA R On His 'Savage Is Loose'; Tells Exhibs To Ignore Rating\\". Variety. 5.

Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote that the film \\"crawls by in slightly under two hours, but they're about as agonizing as any two hours I've ever spent at the movies ...

After being nominated as Ambassador by United States President Barack Obama, Gutman was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 29, 2009, and sworn in as Ambassador on August 14, 2009. Early life and education Gutman is the son of Polish immigrant and Holocaust survivor Max Gutman, who worked in New York's garment district. He attended public elementary schools and then the Bronx High School of Science in New York. Gutman is a summa cum laude graduate of Columbia University (1977) and a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School (1980). Career Lawyer Gutman clerked for Judge Irving Loeb Goldberg on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (1980–1981). After that, he joined the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. He left the firm to clerk for Justice Potter Stewart on the United States Supreme Court. After clerking, in 1982, Gutman joined the Washington, D.C., law firm of Williams & Connolly LLP. He left the firm in 1985 to become Special Assistant to F.B.I. Director William H. Webster, focusing on counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism. Gutman rejoined Williams & Connolly in 1986, and in 1988, Gutman became a partner at the firm, where he focused on commercial litigation, including securities, contracts, antitrust, labor, banking, real estate, intellectual property, insurance coverage, international law, and partnership disputes. Gutman represented a wide variety of clients during his 25-year career, including acting Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and many states' attorneys general in suits against Microsoft Corporation. Gutman also once represented Susan Rosenberg, a former member of the Weather Underground accused, but never indicted or convicted, in the 1981 Brinks robbery in post-conviction, constitutional litigation. Gutman also provided representation to Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, a former Bolivian president, and José Carlos Sánchez Berzain, a defense minister, who were sued in American courts by Bolivians following an attempted coup in Bolivia. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit recently dismissed the case against Sánchez de Lozada and Sánchez Berzain. Politics Gutman has long been active in Democratic politics, working on policy issues, speech writing, constituency work, legal representation, and media. He also has helped raise money for Democratic presidential, gubernatorial, and congressional candidates, including Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000. Gutman served on the legal team representing Gore in the Supreme Court case Bush v. Gore. According to OpenSecrets.org, in 2008, Gutman was part of the Obama National Finance Committee and later a trustee on the Presidential Inauguration Committee. Gutman and his wife, Michelle Loewinger, have contributed at least $86,150 to Democratic candidates, parties and committees since 1989. Gutman contributed the legal maximum of $2300 to Bill Clinton's presidential bid. Both he and his wife contributed the legal maximum of $4600 a piece to Obama's presidential run. Gutman bundled at least half a million for Obama's campaign committee and another $275,000 for his inauguration. Ambassadorship to Belgium Gutman has been dubbed by one Belgian newspaper as \\"the most popular ambassador ever in Belgium\\" and is the second longest serving U.S. Ambassador to Belgium in the last 35 years. The Flemish municipality of Buggenhout erected a monument marking the Ambassador's visit to the municipality. U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt) placed Gutman's poem, given on Memorial Day at Flanders Field, into the Congressional Record. Among his 100+ television appearances in Belgium, Gutman was chosen to present the final award at the Belgian Music Industry Awards. On September 7, 2011, Le Soir, a leading Belgian newspaper, ran a major profile entitled: \\"The Ambassador Who Makes Us Love America Again.\\"Le Soir Magazine, September 7, 2011 Noting the change in Belgian-American relations, one Belgian newspaper stated that \\"there is no doubt that [Ambassador Gutman] would be elected if he were to run at a [Belgian] election.\\" He also had the goal of visiting each of the 589 municipalities in Belgium. His intention was not only to visit managers and politicians, but also ordinary citizens and employees. On May 5, 2013, he completed his tour when he visited the last municipality on his list, Voeren. Gutman left his post as ambassador on July 23, 2013.  Antisemitism speech  Speaking at a legal conference on antisemitism organized by the European Jewish Union on November 30, 2011, Gutman talked about historic antisemitism, as well as a trend he described as \\"a tension and perhaps hatred largely born of and reflecting the tension ... in the Middle East over the continuing Israeli-Palestinian problem\\". He added that \\"an Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty will significantly diminish Muslim anti- Semitism.\\" The comments were then misquoted in what Salon, The Economist and Mother Jones then demonstrated was a \\"woefully inaccurate account of his remarks.\\" Reliance on the misquotes led to high-profile criticism from a number of rival politicians, including Republican presidential candidates Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney and Rick Perry as well as Abraham Foxman of the Anti- Defamation League. Gutman issued a statement saying, \\"I deeply regret if my comments were taken the wrong way\\", highlighting his history of condemning and combating anti-semitism, and making reference to his background as the son of a Holocaust survivor. The subsequent press demonstrated both that Ambassador Gutman had been misquoted and the accuracy of his speech. Lubavitch Chabad leader Rabbi Levi Shemtov also came to the defense of Ambassador Gutman, citing his service to the Jewish community and noting that calling Ambassador Gutman an \\"anti-Semite\\" was like calling Rabbi Shemtov an \\"astronaut.\\" At the end of his ambassadorship, Ambassador Gutman won the European Jewish Union Building's Prize for Friendship and Service to the Jewish Community. Currently, Howard Gutman is on the Regional Board of the American Jewish Committee Washington D.C.  Allegations of sexual misconduct  An alleged State Department whistleblower alleged that an Inspector General's report accused Gutman of soliciting prostitutes and minors for sex while serving as Ambassador, but that Undersecretary of State Patrick F. Kennedy ordered it removed from the report. Gutman denied the accusations as \\"baseless\\" and the State Department adamantly denied that any allegations of questionable or illegal behavior by diplomats have been covered up, and that any proven wrongdoing would be punished administratively or prosecuted criminally. On June 11, 2013, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney confirmed that the allegations were under active investigation by an independent inspector general. Despite these allegations, Gutman served his full term, including representing the United States at the invocation of the new Belgian King on July 21, 2013. On June 21, 2013, the White House announced Denise Bauer as the new nominee to be the next U.S. ambassador to Belgium. After his completion of service, when he was free to talk, Gutman appeared on a popular Belgian talk show, ', and addressed the allegations - calling them \\"nonsense\\" - towards the end of his ambassadorship and explained his recollection of the events in question. Finally, in October 2014, the State Department investigation cleared Gutman and issued the following Statement in apology: \\"The Inspector General's report makes clear there was no wrongdoing and that the allegations wrongfully leaked from internal OIG documents were in fact unsubstantiated. It can't erase the pain these leaks caused those public servants who were falsely accused, but it does vindicate them and puts an end to a painful chapter for many. Most importantly, the report concludes there is 'no systemic problem' in the Department's investigations. The irresponsible leaks did not occur on the watch of this Inspector General, but we appreciate that he has brought this difficult story to a conclusion.\\"  Honors  * : Knight Grand Cross in the Order of the Crown, by RD of King Philippe.

Although the name \\"atrioventricular septum\\" implies any septum between an atrium and a ventricle, in practice the divisions from RA to RV and from LA to LV are mediated by valves, not by septa. Also, there is usually no communication between the LA and the RV. Structure It has a membranous and muscular part. When considering only the membranous septum, it is also known as the \\"atrioventricular component of the membranous septum\\". Development It is formed by the union of the dorsal AV cushion and ventral AV cushion. This septum divides the atrioventricular canal. Clinical relevance In some cases, defects can be identified with an echocardiogram. Incomplete formation of the endocardial cushions can lead to atrioventricular septal defects, such as an ostium primum defect.

During this time, some of his artwork was also published in the press : l'Evénement du jeudi, le Nouvel Obs, Sciences et Avenir and he also produced work for Okapi and Je bouquine. In late 1982, he pencilled La Parisienne in Pilote, again on a script by Berroyer.

Martinac Shipbuilding Corp. at Tacoma, Washington in 1967 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.Coast Guard Historian websiteScheina, p 72 Design and construction details Point Brown was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 After 1990 many in the Point class were refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Brown included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 History Point Brown was homeported at Little Creek, Virginia from 1967 to 1981 where she was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. On 7 January 1968, she escorted distressed FV Avalon to Hampton Roads, Virginia On 14 March 1969, she provided escort following the collision between FV Endeavor and MV African Neptune off the Virginia coast. On 5 March 1970, she towed the disabled FV Our Lady of Fatima 60 miles east of Cape Henry to Hampton, Virginia. On 21 April 1970, she towed the disabled FV Sea Queen to Hampton.

On 29 April 2001 she received beatification from Pope John Paul II and was canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 26 April 2009 in a celebration at which Pope Benedict XVI officiated. Biography Caterina Volpicelli was born in Naples January 21, 1839, to Peter and Teresa de Micheroux. Her family belonged to the Neapolitan high bourgeoisie and she had a deep Christian faith. After an adolescence spent loving theater, music, literature, and after a strong existential crisis, she began to gain awareness of being called to religious life. At first she thought that her vocation was for contemplative life, which she experienced, but she had had to leave due to her frail health. Especially Father Louis from Casoria helped her understand that she was called to live the evangelical counsels \\"remaining in the midst of society.\\" She devoted herself to the diffusion of the Apostleship of Prayer with some assistants. Thanks to Father Ramière, Volpicelli encountered a French foundation that had her same objectives. The French institution was aggregated to the new Congregation of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Jean Jules Chevalier. It was called the \\"Third Order of the Sacred Heart\\" and it was led by Louise-Thérèse de Montaignac. The archbishop of Naples, Sisto Riario Sforza, having understood that the nascent Neapolitan foundation had its own personality confronted with that of de Montaignac, established that the two institutions were to be separated. In 1874, Volpicelli’s foundation received the approval of the archbishop of Naples and was named the \\"Pia Unione delle Ancelle del Sacro Cuore\\" (Pious Union of the Maids of the Sacred Heart). However, Catherina felt the need to receive approval also from the Holy See. The originality and the novelty of the form of her foundation, which desired to be recognized as an authentic religious institution with a public profession of vows, aroused many perplexities and open hostility, especially in the Roman ecclesiastic environment. The various difficulties were overcome, and in June 1890 the “Istituto delle Ancelle del Sacro Cuore di Gesù” (Institute of the Handmaids of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) obtained the Decree of Praise by the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars, without changing its innovative design. Caterina Volpicelli died on December 28, 1894, leaving great uncertainty in the young institution, which would have still needed her charismatic presence. Veneration She was declared Venerable on March 25, 1945 by Pope Pius XII. On June 28, 1999, John Paul II promulgated the Decree on the miracle obtained through her intercession. On 29 April 2001, the same Pope proclaimed her Blessed. On December 6, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI signed the decree recognizing a miracle attributed to the intercession of the woman, a prelude to the process of canonization. She was canonized in St. Peter's Square in Rome on April 26, 2009 by Pope Benedict XVI.Holy mass for the canonization of five new saints Her liturgical commemoration is on January 22. A plaque in her memory has been recently placed in 30 Port‘Alba Street in Naples where she was born; as a religious woman she gave a turn to the religious life of women.

It is one of the primary ways to mitigate the threat of service-provider lock-in in a software as a service model. It also provides a backup in the event that the service-provider suffers a catastrophic failure. The concept requires 3 fundamental components : *The user must be able to initiate and receive backups from the service provider and store them locally *The user must be able to restore the backup to an environment other than that provided by the service provider, preferably locally *The backup must encapsulate all content, metadata, system and application state which allow the easy restoration of the backup into a standard framework either provided and maintained by the service provider or the wider software community. The third component also contains the implication that either the application itself is provided with the backup, or there is a consistent and ongoing application upgrade path to prevent the situation where the restore of a RUB is prevented due to an obsolete version of application software.

It was adapted by Josephine Lovett and Joseph Moncure March. It stars Cary Grant and Sylvia Sidney. Music is credited to W. Franke Harling (although much of it is an adaptation of Giacomo Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly), cinematography by David Abel, art direction by Ward Ihnen. It premiered on December 30, 1932. Plot At Goro's Tea House, we are introduced to Cho-Cho San (Sylvia Sidney) who is bidding farewell to her mother and grandfather. She is about to undergo training as a geisha in exchange for money that will support her family. After the relatives leave, Goro introduces Prince Yamadori, a prospective husband, to Cho-Cho San. When Yamadori finds her withdrawn, Madame Goro explains that Cho-Cho San is high-born and is not yet used to the geisha life style. Meanwhile, on board an American steamship due to arrive in Japan for several months' stay, Lieutenant Barton (Charlie Ruggles) convinces his friend Lieutenant Ben F. Pinkerton (Cary Grant) that once they arrive to skip the American Counsul's party and plan to enjoy themselves instead. Pinkerton looks at a photograph of a blonde woman inscribed to him 'from Adelaide' and hides it in his clothing trunk. Back at Goro's, Mrs. Goro prepares Cho-Cho San for another meeting with Yamadori by dressing her more elegantly. Meanwhile, Pinkerton and Barton enter Goro's, and are greeted by geishas. They are seated and watch a performance of dancing and music played by the geishas, and begin to become intimate with them. Goro interrupts so Pinkerton wanders to a different room and, through a screen, sees a dancing silhouette. Entering further, he discovers Cho-Cho San practicing her dancing. Despite Goro's admonishment, he is immediately enchanted with Cho-Cho San, who runs away to the garden in fear. Pinkerton catches up to her and they talk. Yamadori comes to meet Cho-Cho San again. Goro pretends she is indisposed but a neighboring geisha reveals that she is with a naval officer. Infuriated, Yamadori vows never to set foot in Goro's house again. This makes Goro angry at Cho-Cho San, since Yamadori was Goro's best client. Goro threatens to shame Cho-Cho San's family because she has been disobedient. Pinkerton asks Goro to explain why he is so angry, and Goro tells him that Cho-Cho San was supposed to marry Yamadori. Barton takes Pinkerton aside and tells him that \\"marriage\\" to Japanese is just a formality: when husbands desert, the geishas can automatically be considered divorced. Realizing how easy the situation is, Pinkerton informs Goro of his intention to marry Cho-Cho San. Cho-Cho San's relatives assemble at the couple's new house, and the marriage takes place as a tea ceremony. Afterwards, Cho-Cho San prays at her home altar, adorned with a picture of her ancestors. Pinkerton asks Barton to send the relatives away, while he gets to know Cho-Cho San better and shows her how to kiss. Several days later, Pinkerton arrives home, where Cho-Cho San greets him with honors. He gives her a translucent veil. She offers him drink and a pipe to smoke. He asks for a change of pants and Cho-Cho San obliges. While searching for the pants within Pinkerton's trunk, Cho-Cho San discovers the picture inscribed to Pinkerton by a blonde woman (which Pinkerton hid in the earlier scene). With a serious face, she brings it to Pinkerton and asks if he is in love with that woman. He denies it; she embraces him, happy again, but he maintains a serious face. Several weeks later, the home altar now shows a picture of Pinkerton. Cho-Cho San happily receives Pinkerton and Barton. In an aside to Barton, Pinkerton explains that he hasn't had the courage to tell Cho-Cho San that he's leaving the following day. Barton suggests they all have dinner at the hotel. While eating, the commander of the naval vessel visits the table, mentioning they are due to leave tomorrow. Cho-Cho San is taken aback. Returning home, Cho-Cho San is upset, so Pinkerton sings to her \\"My Flower Of Japan\\". The following day, Pinkerton is leaving but asks Cho-Cho San not to see him off at the dock. Cho-Cho San asks about the girl in the picture but Pinkerton says he loves only Cho-Cho San and promises to come back in the spring. \\"When the robins nest again?\\" asks Cho-Cho San and Pinkerton affirms. The scene cuts to the next spring, and Butterfly happily holds her infant son. She points out that a robin has nested and speaks to her son, revealing his name as \\"Trouble\\" for now, but when Pinkerton returns, it will be changed to \\"Joy\\". The scene cuts to a robin building a nest. It is in the garden of a house owned by Pinkerton and the woman, Adelaide, from the photograph. A ring on the fourth finger of her left hand indicates that she is engaged. She remarks that it is now spring to Pinkerton, who looks troubled. In response, she mentions that ever since he's returned from Japan he has been different. He offers to tell her something that might upset her and she agrees. The scene ends. In Cho-Cho San's home, her grandfather asks her to marry Yamadori, but Cho-Cho San explains that, unlike in Japan where desertion is ground for divorce, in the United States divorce can only be effected by a judge after a period of years. He asks her to return home, if only for the sake of the child, but she rejects her grandfather's ways, saying that she and the entire house belong to Pinkerton. Angrily, her grandfather disowns her and asks that she never enter his house again. Meanwhile, Pinkerton and his newly married wife Adelaide walk down the marriage aisle to the strains of Mendelssohn's music and rice being thrown by guests. Back in Japan, Cho-Cho San remarks that the robins have nested three times. She goes to see the American consul and asks about the nesting habits of American robins. Understanding what has happened, he explains that, in the United States, they nest only once in three years. Relieved, Cho-Cho San leaves happily. The consul sends a telegram to Pinkerton asking him to come. Meanwhile, Cho-Cho San goes to a temple to pray. Cho-Cho San sees a naval ship in the distance and is overjoyed at Pinkerton's imminent return, explaining it to her son. At the ship dock, Pinkerton arrives with Barton and is met by Adelaide. Barton mentions that the Consul will be having a party that night, and Pinkerton thinks that's why he sent the telegram. Cho-Cho San suggests to Suzuki that they surprise Pinkerton: Suzuki will be with Trouble in the next room and only bring him out at Cho-Cho San's clap. They sit down by the window to watch for Pinkerton's approach. Suzuki and Trouble fall asleep, but Cho-Cho San continues to watch all night through the morning. Suzuki wakes and encourages Cho-Cho San to go to bed. Dejected, she still believes Pinkerton will come, despite Suzuki's warnings that \\"men always forget.\\" In their hotel room, Pinkerton explains the situation to his Adelaide. She suggests that once he talks with Cho-Cho San, all will be cleared up. He asks her to accompany him and she assents. Pinkerton and Adelaide arrive at Cho-Cho San's house. He asks Adelaide to wait. He goes up to the house and is greeted by a wildly happy Cho-Cho San. Her happiness turns serious as he explains that he must leave soon and is never coming back. Cho- Cho San sees a woman waiting, and realizes that Pinkerton has married another woman – the woman she had seen in the picture. In tears, she bids him goodbye. Crying, she tells Trouble that his father has taken another woman, while Trouble fidgets with an ancestral heirloom, a knife. She then tells Suzuki to take Trouble to his grandfather, who will raise Trouble \\"in the ways of his ancestors.\\" She tells Suzuki she will follow after she prays. As she prays, she recalls the American marriage vow \\"till death do us part\\". She unsheathes the knife and sees the inscription \\"To die with honor when one can no longer live with honor.\\" Wrapping the veil Pinkerton gave her around her neck, she stabs herself. Her dying words are \\"I love you for always.\\" Cast * Sylvia Sidney as Cho-Cho San * Cary Grant as Lieutenant B. F.

DCI currently supports initiatives for children in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Nicaragua. It works to accomplish its mission through five core programs: its flagship \\"Sun Child Sponsorship\\" Program, Healthcare for the Underprivileged Program, Orphan Support Program, Blindness Prevention Program, and its \\"Journey for Rights and Sight\\" – an ongoing series of awareness-building events throughout the United States and beyond. DCI works to implement its mission with a number of partner organizations including Rights and Sight for Children (Bangladesh), Diabetic Association of Bangladesh (Bangladesh), Ispahani Eye Hospital (Bangladesh), Tauri Foundation (Bangladesh), Kalinga Eye Hospital and Research Centre (India), Nepal Netra Jyoti Sangh (Nepal), and New Haven/León Sister City Project (Nicaragua). Mission DCI describes its mission using two phrases: \\"Rights and Sight for Children\\" - to protect child rights, stop child labor, and help families lift themselves out of poverty through education, healthcare, vision care, and income-generating opportunities; and \\"Children Helping Children\\" - to connect American youth to less fortunate children in other countries, educating them about the challenges facing children worldwide and inspiring them to take leadership roles in humanitarian causes. History Distressed Children & Infants International (DCI) was founded on May 23, 2003, at Yale University by current Honorary Executive Director Dr. Ehsan Hoque and Board Chair Dr. Nina Hoque at the Yale School of Medicine. DCI was officially recognized as a non-profit charitable organization by the United States Government and the Office of the Connecticut Secretary of the State in 2005. Programs Sun Child Sponsorship Program DCI's Flagship \\"Sun Child Sponsorship\\" Program was inaugurated in Bangladesh in 2005 and operates in the regions of Patuakhali, Feni, Habiganj, Nilphamari and Dhaka. According to DCI, the program utilizes a comprehensive poverty alleviation model that focuses on individual children while bringing lasting change on a community-wide scale. The program's primary objective is to provide severely underprivileged children with the resources they need to stay in school instead of having to enter the labor force, and thereafter keeping them on track to become independent and productive citizens through education and training opportunities. In addition, the program provides health care as well as family and community support in the form of small business development and adult education. Healthcare for the Underprivileged Program DCI's Health for the Underprivileged Program has operated in Dhaka, Bangladesh since 2008. Through a free clinic located within Kallayanpur slum, DCI provides free preventive and curative treatment, including maternal health care, to a community of approximately 9000 slum residents. The clinic operates six days per week and provides free treatment and medicine. Additionally, DCI employs social workers who visit homes to identify health needs and connect patients, especially women and children, with appropriate treatment. The workers educate women on how to better take care of their health care needs and provides information about hospital delivery of newborns. The clinic also runs awareness classes for adolescent girls with the goal of preventing child marriage and teaching female health and hygiene skills. Blindness Prevention Program DCI's Blindness Prevention Program was launched in 2007, with the objective of preventing and treating vision loss among underprivileged children and their families. Through this program, DCI conducts free eye screening camps and awareness campaigns for the visually disabled in all of its project locations in Bangladesh, as well as providing eyeglasses to correct refractive errors and arranging free cataract surgeries for children and adults. Similar efforts are also supported with partner organizations in India and Nepal. Orphan Support Program DCI's Orphan Support Program was established in 2010 to provide comprehensive support to orphaned children to give them the opportunity to enjoy a normal childhood and grow into well-rounded, independent and productive adult citizens. The program delivers support through DCI's own orphanage facility in Dhaka, Bangladesh, as well as supplemental support to local government-run orphanages. Journey for Child Rights & Sight and International Conference DCI regularly holds events throughout the United States to raise awareness about issues affecting children such as child poverty, child labor, and preventable childhood blindness. In 2006, DCI hosted its first \\"Conference on Child Rights & Sight\\" at Yale University: an international conference that gathers speakers and leaders from around the world to address issues of child rights - in particular child labor - and diseases that affect vision, and discuss creative solutions. As of 2020, DCI has held seven international conferences at Yale University: in 2006, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019. The most recent 7th International Conference on Child Rights & Sight took place at Yale University on Saturday, October 26, 2019. Patrons and Goodwill Ambassadors DCI's Patrons and Goodwill Ambassadors include Bangladeshi actress Babita Akhtar and Bangladeshi singer Sabina Yasmin. Financial Accountability and Transparency According to DCI, 91% of its funds go to program services (childcare, orphan support, blindness prevention, etc.), 6% goes to fundraising, and 3% goes to management and administration. DCI states that 100 percent of all proceeds from program contributions are used to cover the costs of DCI programs and services, with no portion being used to cover administrative or fundraising costs. DCI follows rigorous standards of accountability and transparency to maximize the benefit to underprivileged communities and provide donors with full confidence in the positive impact of their charitable giving. All tax returns of the organization are published on DCI's website.

Sutton was found guilty and given a sentence of 30 to 120 years in Attica State Prison.

Sutton still had to receive a suspension of a separate 30-year-to-life sentence he had received in Brooklyn in 1952 and then could be released on parole from a 1930 conviction.Staff. \\"A JAIL TERM LIFTED, SUTTON CRIES IN JOY\\", The New York Times, December 2, 1969.

It serves as a breeding ground for birds (primarily Cape cormorants) and yields guano, which is collected and sold.  History  Bird Island was conceived and constructed by Adolf Winter, a German who emigrated to South West Africa (now known as Namibia) in 1912. Winter took a train from Swakopmund to nearby Walvis Bay and saw a natural offshore formation called Bird Rock, covered in guano from many birds. On the return trip, he noticed the guano had been washed away by the sea and saw a business opportunity. Bird Island began as a wooden platform measuring four meters square, three meters above the sea. Winter finished this initial construction in March 1930. One year later he had enlarged the platform to 16 meters square, and by August 1931 had extended it to 1600 square meters. Guano was collected and sold annually, and expansion of the platform continued at a slower pace until 1937, when a large shipment of timber allowed building the platform out to its current size of 17,000 square meters.  Economics  Arrangements for transporting guano to shore The guano collected from Bird Island is considered high quality for its high nitrogen content relative to other guano collection facilities in the region. It is cleaned in Swakopmund to remove feathers and other debris, ground to a powder, and exported to Belgium for US$285 per ton.Plaque at the National Marine Aquarium of Namibia, Swakopmund The platform yields approximately 650 tons of guano annually.

In the 1970s, various Native American tribes took unprecedented action to initiate gaming enterprises.Harvard. The State of the Native Nations. New York: Oxford UP, 2008. Print. In doing so, they created not only a series of legal struggles between the federal, state, and tribal governments, but also a groundbreaking way to revitalize the Native American economy. Native American gaming has grown from bingo parlors to high-stakes gaming, and is surrounded by controversy on many different levels. Disputes exist concerning tribal sovereignty, negative effects of gaming, and a loss of Native American culture.Cattelino, Jessica R. High Stakes: Florida Seminole Gaming and Sovereignty. Durham: Duke UP, 2008. Print. In the United States, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was passed in 1988 to secure collaboration between the states and tribes and also for the federal government to oversee gaming operations. Native American gaming has proven to be extremely lucrative for several tribes, but it has also been unsuccessful in some instances. Native American gaming is contingent upon and only beneficial to its respective reservation.Harvard. The State of the Native Nations. New York: Oxford UP, 2008. Print.5 Success Gaming can be extremely successful because it stimulates the economy, increases tourism to reservations, reduces unemployment, raises incomes, and increases tribal independence while reducing dependence upon welfare. It has created over 300,000 jobs in the United States. Tribes in only 30 states are eligible to operate gaming enterprises because 16 states have no federally recognized tribes, and five states (Massachusetts, Texas, Missouri, Rhode Island, and Utah) prohibit Native American gaming.Darian-Smith, Eve. New Capitalists: Law, Politics, and Identity Surrounding Casino Gaming on Native American Land. Belmont: Thomson Wadsworth, 2004. Print. 224 of the 550 tribes in 28 states operate the 350 Native American gaming enterprises nationwide,Waldman, Carl. Atlas of The North American Indian. 3rd ed. New York: Infobase, 2009. Print. and 68% of Native Americans belong to a tribe with gaming operations. According to the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, these enterprises earned $19.4 billion in 2005. As compared to the $4.5 billion earned by Native American gaming revenues in 1995, these enterprises have shown substantial growth in just 10 years. These enterprises, earning $19.4 billion a year, account for 25.8% of the nation's $75 billion revenue (brought in by the total gaming enterprises in the country). In addition, Native American gaming is the source of 400,000 jobs, and the profits from the enterprises often go toward programs that create jobs. For example, 75% of the profit generated by Cherokee Nation Enterprises in 2005 was given to the Jobs Growth Fund, which expands businesses within the Cherokee Nation to create more jobs.SMITH 8 Revenues, by law, must go toward improving reservation communities. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires that revenues go toward tribal government operations, promotion of the welfare of the tribe and its citizens, economic development, support of charitable organizations, and compensation to local non-Native governments for support of services provided by those governments. Tribes have boosted their socioeconomic status in the past several years by improving their infrastructure, but due to the lack of federal and state funding, have only been able to do so as a result of gaming enterprises. For instance, tribes often build casino-related facilities that draw visitors such as hotels, conference centers, entertainment venues, golf courses, and RV parks. Once a reservation has established a strong economic foundation, it can draw in businesses that are unrelated to gaming. A common trend is that casinos stimulate the economy, and other business sustain it. For instance, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians built in a water-bottling plant on the reservation, and along with three other tribes, invested in a hotel in Washington, DC. The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska is involved in a number of businesses, some of which are internet media, home manufacturing, used autos, and gas stations. The Morongo Band of Mission Indians, a small band in California, has opened a Shell station, A&W; drive-in, Coco's Restaurant, a water-bottling plant, and a fruit orchard operation. In addition to involvement in private corporations, Native nations have enough sustainability to bolster government programs. Some of these projects include, but are not limited to: providing law enforcement, fire fighters, schools, translators for emergency response, college scholarships, assistance with mortgage down payments, protection for endangered species, monitoring for water quality, care for elders, police cars, foster-care improvements, and health clinics. Tribes sometimes distribute funds on a per capita basis to directly benefit its citizens.Waldman, Carl. Atlas of The North American Indian. 3rd ed. New York: Infobase, 2009. Print. 281 Because these have sometimes shown negative effects such as a dependence on tribal government, low attendance in school, and an unwillingness to work, some tribes have experimented with decreasing per capita payments as punishment. To clarify, the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation Tribal Council deducted at least $100 from families' payments if children have low school attendance. This ordinance resulted in a 30% increase in graduation in three years, a substantial increase. Furthermore, the Las Vegas Paiute Nation deducted funding for jail provision from the offender's payments because the Nation itself does not have a jail and must rent it from other governments. Punishments such as these provide an incentive for morality through a direct link to financial assistance from the payments themselves. States also benefit from Native American gaming enterprises. States cannot tax reservations, but they can, under IGRA, negotiate a compact and demand compact payments. Tribes usually pay near or less than 10% of profit to states. The state of Michigan earned an estimated$325 million from tribes spanning from 1993-2003. Laws require a tribe to agree to a state compact if they request one, but the IGRA says nothing about local governments. However, many tribes do negotiate with local governments. They place a strain on traffic and emergency services, and a tribe not uncommonly tries to compensate for that. Native Americans pay $50 million annually to local governments across the nation. In addition, non-Natives hold 75% of the 300,000 jobs that belong to Native American gaming. With gaming profits, the Creek Nation of Oklahoma has built its own hospital staffed by Native American doctors and nurses. Other tribes establish health clinics, dialysis centers, and fitness centers to deal with the problem of Native American disease and epidemics. Many tribes work toward securing hope for the future by improving schools. The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe built two schools that teach fluency in English as well as Ojibwe language. Failure There have been many past attempts to revitalize Native American economies, but most of them have failed. Two of the more successful ventures, besides gaming, include selling gasoline and cigarettes for a much lower price than can be found off the reservation. Tribes are able to sell cheaper goods because there is no state tax. Lower prices draw in non-Natives from off-reservation sites, and tribes are able to earn a considerable profit. Seminole annual income grew from $600,000 in 1968 to $4.5 million in 1977. Smokeshops account for most of this substantial increase. Less effective efforts by the Seminole Nation to boost the economy include cattle raising, craft selling, and alligator wrestling. Cattle operations are popular among the Seminole tribe: with their 7,000 head herd, Seminoles are the largest cattle operators in the state of Florida and the twelfth largest in the United States. However, cattle operations are not overwhelmingly successful because they have been known to benefit the individual rather than the tribe. In addition, cattle operations led to government dependency and debt. Another economic endeavor is craft sales. Some individuals create traditional Seminole crafts and sell them, but this market does not leave a huge impact on the tribal economy. Instead, it benefits the individual as a supplementary income. Alligator wrestling is yet another moneymaker but is not relied upon. Alligator wrestling originated in the 1920s and became synonymous with Seminole culture. It has been denigrated as exploitative, though, and is quite risky. Consequently, alligator wrestling has become less prevalent with the growing popularity of Native American gaming. If a Native American casino is unsuccessful, its failure is often linked to its geographic location. The size of a tribe is usually insignificant. This argument follows the logic of a free market economy. Tribes with a strong economic base find it easier to draw in new businesses and consumers. Tribes in remote locations suffer because they lack a consumer base to support new and existing businesses. For example, the Morongo Band of Mission Indians is very small, but their gaming enterprises are overwhelmingly successful. In contrast, the Sioux Nation, a very large nation, has struggled to achieve success with gaming enterprises. Regardless of its thousands of members and approximately 12 gambling halls, the Sioux Nation is unable to benefit from gaming enterprises because it is too isolated from potential customers. Another example is found in San Diego County. Four tribes in San Diego County had ambitious plans for a $100 million-plus resort and convention center but preemptively scaled back this idea because they are in an inconvenient location. Far away from other civilization and in close proximity to each other, the tribes concluded their chances of an overwhelming success were slim. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the second largest reservation in the United States, suffers from extreme poverty. It is the poorest county in the United States and has attempted to revitalize its economy through the gambling industry. However, these attempts have failed. Its casino created a mere 80 jobs, but this figure is insignificant since the unemployment rate on the reservation is up to 95%. The reservation has higher unemployment, diabetes, infant mortality, teen suicide, dropout, and alcoholism rates than the country on a whole. Many homes are dilapidated, overcrowded, and without water, plumbing, and electricity. Pine Ridge's failed attempts are predictable considering the closest major city, Denver, Colorado, is 350 miles away.Schwartz, Stephanie M. \\"WAMBLI HO, VOICE OF THE EAGLES: SPECIAL REPORT.\\" Native Village. 2002. Web. 11 Oct. 2009. .  Impact on native cultures  With Native American gaming has come the image of a \\"rich Indian.\\" This depiction contrasts other images of Native Americans portrayed as savage, pure, connected to nature, and spiritual. The reality (that some Native Americans are powerful entrepreneurs) contradicts the notion of what a Native American is \\"supposed to be.\\" \\"Rich Indian\\" propaganda even circulated in response to Proposition 5 in California in 1998 that perpetuated the stereotype that \\"the only good Indian is a poor Indian.\\"Los Angeles Times, October 27, 1998 Eve Darian-Smith and others have asserted that the impact of gaming on Indian culture in general is a loss of a cultural myth. According to Ronald Wright, these ideas are based on stereotypes and are \\"construed by the dominant society in an effort to control and justify the enduring inequalities and injustices that permeate our legal system and social landscape.\\" One perspective is that Native American gaming is not so much damaging Native culture as it is merely changing a cultural myth, the way the general population perceives Native Americans. Additionally, Native American gaming can be viewed as a means to rejuvenate and preserve tribal culture. For instance, many tribes use revenues generated from gaming toward museums and cultural centers. Tribes are not only able to fund themselves independently but can also afford to preserve their individual histories. Controversy Morality of Native American gaming There is some controversy of Native American gambling because it is argued that it contributes to a moral decay. Gambling, it is argued, promotes crime and pathological behavior. Gambling addictions as well as drug and alcohol abuse are sometimes associated with Native American gaming. In 1962, the total estimated sums in the United States totaled $2 billion. This figure jumped to $18 billion in 1976, to $80 billion in 1985, and to $400 billion in 1993. In 2000, the total estimated sums wagered in the United States was $866 billion. In 2000, the commercial take was 10%, so the gaming industry earned approximately $70 billion, even accounting for the fact that gamblers win some money back. That is over three times the $22 billion in total revenues generated by all other forms of entertainment combined: tickets to movies, plays, concerts, performances, and sports events. Moreover, Native American gaming contributes to only a fraction of gambling in the United States. Native American casinos bring in only 17% of gambling revenue, while non-Native casinos raise 43%. TIME magazine controversy In late 2002, TIME magazine printed a special report entitled \\"Indian Casinos: Wheel of Misfortune\\" that infuriated Native Americans nationwide. Ernie Stevens, Jr., Chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association, wrote a letter to the editor of TIME in response to the report. Native American gaming in popular culture Native American gaming has appeared many times in literature. The first appearance of Native American gaming was in John Rollin Ridge's 1854 novel The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta. Christal Quintasket wrote about Native American gaming in her 1927 novel Cogewea, the Half-Blood. Gerald Vizenor writes on this theme in Bearheart: The Heirship Chronicles, The Heirs of Columbus, and Dead Voices. Leslie Marmon Silko wrote a 1977 novel called Ceremony that focuses on gambling. Louise Erdrich, a prominent Native American author, wrote Love Medicine, Tracks, and The Bingo Palace. Traditional, ritual gaming is a common theme in these pieces of literature and provide literary, rather than fact- based, accounts of Native American gaming.Pasquaretta, Paul.

At some point, Peña went to Mexico, but returned in the 1830s to reoccupy his property. In 1841, he applied for the land he had been using and was granted two square leagues by Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado. At the time, Peña was teaching school in the small community at Santa Clara. In 1847, Peña sold the entire the rancho, except for a small plot for himself, to Secundino Robles and his brother Teodoro.

He was born in Santa of Pontus in 1885, and died in Nea Santa, Kilkis (Greece) on the 10th of February 1937 when he fell from his carriage and was trampled on by his horses. He is regarded as one of the most famous of freedom fighters in the region of Santa and Pontus as a whole. He first appeared as a freedom fighter during the Russian occupation of Pontus (1918) at a time when battles on the mountains of Santa were difficult. He influenced a generation of men who have now become legend. His Rise At the time, Sapan Musa, Sait aga and Kalfas of Gemoura were the leaders of the Turkish tchetes. The most formidable however was Suleyman Kalfas from nearby Gemoura. At some stage, they had all attempted to destroy Santa, however each had failed due to the persistence of Euclides' freedom fighters, and freedom fighters from Tsiripanton as well as those from other villages. Euclides and thirty of his village folk, in particular those from Galiena came in contact with the Trapezuntine association ‘Enosis' (Union) and immediately armed themselves. They also waited for help from a Greek body that was said to have been preparing itself in the Caucasus. Theodosis Himonidis travelled from Trapezunta to Santa to organise a general assembly in order to organise a central committee for defense. Himonidis was elected president. Giannis Spatharos General, and Abraam Kalaitzidis, Christos Sevastidis and Euclides Kourtidis were elected deputies. Euclides Kourtidis was the captain of the freedom fighters of Ischantanton, and was assisted by Georgios Goniadis and Pericles Koufatsi. Euclides and his assistants dug pits which were guarded day and night with a change of guard. They consisted of over two hundred men who were well armed with an assortment of rifles and whatever else they could find, including empty grenades which they found and filled with dynamite. Recollections Agathaggelos Fostiropoulos in his recollections, wrote in the newspaper ‘Macedonia', the following about an incident involving Euclides Kourtidis on the mountains: \\"On New Year's Day 1919, while the students of the Urban Faculty of Imera were returning from an excursion to neighbouring Kromni, they crossed paths with Euclides Kourtidis near the Byzantine Monastery of St. George. The young teacher immediately gave a sign and they all echoed the following song. ‘Mother I tell you, I cannot work for these Turks no more...' The armed men listened intently to the students singing and were overwhelmed with emotion, and some broke down in tears.\\" Kromnaean Zacharias Mousikidis reported in the journal ‘Pontiaki Estia' (Issue 88), that at the beginning of September 1921, one hundred freedom fighters had gathered at Magara with three hundred women and children of Santa. They were suddenly encircled. The Turks of Suleyman Kalfa attacked them and asked them to surrender. Dimitrios Tsirip, second in command to Kourtidis came forward and shouted that they would not surrender. He was then fired upon, a bullet striking him in the head thus killing him. Zacharias Mousikidis in his narration, continues: \\"As soon as Euclides saw that his commander was killed, devised the following plan. Ten lads had pistols with 10 cartridges. These pistols were automatic, and when fired, gave the impression of a machine-gun. Euclides therefore ordered his men to fire all pistols at once in order to shock the Turks. As the pistols fired, two hand made grenades were also thrown thus shocking the Turks who fled in fear.\\" External links *Euclides Kourtidis Category:1885 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Greek soldiers ","title":"Euclides Kourtidis"},{"id":"24658829","title":"Richard Meyer (tennis)"},{"id":"24658879","text":"The 1972–73 Australian region cyclone season was an above-average tropical cyclone season, in terms of activity.

It is the most compact cyclone or equivalent-strength hurricane on record in the Australian basin, with gale-force winds extending only from the centre and was the most compact system worldwide until Tropical Storm Marco of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season broke the record, with gale-force winds extending only from the centre. After forming over the Arafura Sea, the storm moved southwards and affected the city with Category 4 winds on the Australian cyclone intensity scale, while there is evidence to suggest that it had reached Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale when it made landfall. Tracy killed 71 people, caused 837 million in damage (1974 dollars) and destroyed more than 70 percent of Darwin's buildings, including 80 percent of houses.

Systems Severe Tropical Cyclone Ray Severe Tropical Cyclone Joan On the morning of November 30, 1975, satellite imagery showed a large cloud mass in the Timor Sea. The satellite photograph received on the morning of December 1 showed that significant organization had occurred in the cloud mass during the previous 24 hours. It was deemed at 0115 UTC that the system be named the developing cyclone Joan, located about 310 km west-northwest of Darwin. Joan's movement in the following 48 hours was towards the southwest at an average 5 km/h. The first evidence of the increasing strength of Joan came as the cyclone moved west-southwest past the northernmost areas of Western Australia on December 3. The cyclone's generally west-southwesterly track after December 2 took it away from the coast until 0900 6 December when it was about 420 km north of Port Hedland and the system turned southward. At about 2200 UTC December 7, 1975, the eye of tropical cyclone Joan crossed the coast about 50 km west of Port Hedland. The cyclone was travelling south-southwest at about 14 km/h and crossed over or adjacent to the homesteads on the pastoral properties Mundabullangana, Mallina, Coolawanyah, Hamersley, and Mount Brockman. As cyclone Joan crossed the coastal plain and the Chichester Range only a slow moderation of its intensity seems to have occurred, but as the cyclone crossed the Hamersley Range the available evidence suggests that a rapid weakening took place. Tropical cyclone Joan was the most destructive cyclone to affect the Port Hedland area in more than 30 years. The city was subjected to sustained winds exceeding 90 km/h for about 10 hours with winds in excess of 120 km/h for three hours. The maximum measured wind gust of 208 km/h on December 8, 1975, is the fourth highest on record in Australia. Severe property damage occurred at Port Hedland and at other settlements close to the cyclone's path. Subsequent flooding damaged roads and sections of the iron ore railways, particularly that of Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd. Sheep losses were heavy but, remarkably, no loss of human life or serious injury was reported.

Tropical cyclogenesis in the season began when an unnamed tropical cyclone developed well west of Australia on 19 November and lasted until 23 November after moving in a generally southward direction throughout much of its duration. Cyclone Peter developed over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 29 December. During and in the few days after landfall in Queensland on 31 December, the storm produced heavy precipitation in the state and became the rainiest tropical cyclone in Australia. Severe flooding occurred in the Cairns area, leaving two fatalities and about $10 million in damage. Gordon became the first system to enter from another basin, entering from the South Pacific on 9 January. The storm dissipated shortly after striking Queensland on 12 January, bringing rainfall and rough seas. Cyclone Kerry remained in the Australian region from 12 February to 3 March, making it the longest-lived tropical cyclone in the basin on record. Hazel was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category 4 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. The storm brought rough seas and strong winds to Western Australia, resulting in $20 million in damage and 15 deaths after a fishing boat capsized. None of the subsequent tropical cyclones significantly effected land. Tropical cyclogenesis concluded with the formation of Kevin on 2 May, which dissipated on 12 May. Overall, the tropical cyclones of this season collectively caused 17 deaths and over $30 million in damage.

Thirteen cyclones entered or formed in the Australian region, which was equal to the 1970–71 to 2001–02 average of 13 per season. By region, three cyclones developed over the Perth TCWC, three formed in the Darwin TCWC, and just one originated over the Brisbane area. Thus, seven cyclones developed in the Australian region – defined as the southern hemisphere between 80°E and 160°E – until Météo-France's Réunion area of responsibility and BOM adjusted the boundary eastward to 90°E in 1985. This was slightly below the 1952–53 to 1970–71 average of eight per season. There was a total of eleven coastal crossings, which is either a landfall or a tropical cyclone moving from land to sea. This was well above the 1949–50 to 1974–75 average of five per season. This was the first and only season that reconnaissance aircraft flew into cyclones in this basin. A WP-3D Orion operated by the United States's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) flew into Cyclone Kerry on three occasions – 21 February, 22 February, and 4 March. Another flight mission was conducted for observing Cyclone Rosa as the storm was making landfall in Northern Territory on 26 February. Overall, the tropical cyclones of this season resulted in 17 deaths and slightly more than $30 million in damage. Activity began in November 1978, when Tropical Cyclone 01S formed the Australian region in the Perth TCWC area on 18 November. The next cyclone, later designated as 03S, developed about a month later on 20 December. In addition, Peter formed on 29 December. January also featured two more cyclones, Greta and Gordon, the latter of which entered the basin from the South Pacific on 9 January. Likewise, there were two tropical cyclones in the month of February, Rosa and Kerry, both of which existed simultaneously for almost three weeks. Hazel and Ivan originated in March. The former was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of . April was the most active, with three cyclones originating or entering the basin during that month. The last storm, Kevin existed in May between 2 May and 12 May, after the end of the modern day season, which is 30 April. Systems Cyclone 01S An unnamed cyclone, later designated as 01S, developed about 185 kilometres (115 miles) north of North Keeling on 19 November at 12:00 UTC. After six hours, the storm intensified into a Category 1 cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. The cyclone headed southwestward and intensified further on 20 November, peaking with 1-minute sustain winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) by 06:00 UTC. Early on 21 November, the system curved west-southwestward, before turning on the following day. Thereafter, the storm began weakening and dissipated early on 23 November, while situated about 1,210 km (750 mi) southwest of Cocos Islands. Cyclone 03S Another unnamed cyclone, designated as 03S, developed on 20 December while located about 1,055 km (655 mi) west-northwest of North Keeling. The storm strengthened and became a Category 1 cyclone about twelve hours later. After initially moving east- southeastward, the system re-curved to the west-southwest by 21 December. Further intensification occurred, and by 00:00 UTC on 22 December, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85 km/h (55 mph). Thereafter, the cyclone slowly weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity on 24 December. Several hours later, the system entered the southwest Indian Ocean basin, where it dissipated on 26 December. Severe Tropical Cyclone Peter A weak low pressure area over the Arafura Sea developed into Cyclone Peter on 29 December. Peter moved southeastward and deepened while brushing Arnhem Land. Initially a tropical low, it strengthened into a Category 1 cyclone by 12:00 UTC on 29 December. Peter intensified further on 30 December and became a Category 2 cyclone. On the following day, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph). Peter weakened to a Category 1 cyclone before making landfall near the mouth of the Edward River in Queensland. While crossing the Cape York Peninsula, the storm weakened slowly. After reaching the Pacific Ocean near Cooktown, the storm decelerated and meandered offshore, but dissipated about 105 km (65 mi) north of Cape Melville. While trekking slowly offshore the east coast of Queensland, the storm dropped very heavy rainfall, peaking at 1,947 millimeters (76.7 inches) at Mount Bellenden Ker, making it the wettest tropical cyclone on record in Australia. Severe flooding occurred, especially in the Cairns area. The most severe damage was dealt to sugar cane, which suffered 70 to 90 percent destruction. Some flights were canceled at the Cairns Airport due to standing water. Floodwaters forced at least 50 people to flee their homes in Cairns. A number of roads, including major highways, were flooded throughout coastal areas of Far North Queensland. Rainfall and winds also resulted in many power and telephone service outages through the region. There were two fatalities and damage reached approximately $10 million. Tropical Cyclone Greta A weak low pressure area associated with the remnants of Peter developed into a tropical disturbance over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 8 January. After six hours, the disturbance intensified into a tropical low, which was named Greta. Moving east-northeast, the system strengthened into a Category 1 cyclone late on 9 January. By 00:00 UTC the next day, Greta became a Category 2 and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). A few hours later, the system made landfall to the south of Weipa, Queensland. The city of Weipa recorded a barometric pressure of , the lowest in relation to Greta. While traversing the Cape York Peninsula, the cyclone weakened, falling to Category 1 intensity by midday on 10 January. Eventually, Greta curved southward and briefly moved offshore, before making another landfall near Princess Charlotte Bay early on 11 January. The storm curved west-southwestward and soon weakened to a tropical low. After re- emerging into the Gulf of Carpentaria again on 12 January, Greta almost immediately weakened to a tropical disturbance. The storm then meandered offshore Gulf Country before dissipating around 00:00 UTC on 13 January. Greta brought rainfall to portions of the Cape York Peninsula flooded during the passage of Cyclone Peter, but the former resulted in much less damage than the latter. Tropical Cyclone Gordon Cyclone Gordon developed over the South Pacific basin on 2 January, where it peaked as a Category 3 cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of on 7 January. However, between 7 January and 8 January, satellite imagery indicated a significant weakening trend. Upon reaching the Australian region early on 9 January, Gordon had deteriorated to a Category 1. Around that time, the cyclone attained its peak intensity while in the basin, with maximum sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Weakening continued, with Gordon decreasing to a tropical low on 10 January, following by to tropical disturbance intensity on 11 January. Several hours later, Gordon made landfall near Proserpine, Queensland, and promptly dissipated. Some coastal towns in Queensland observed up to in a 24‑hour period. However, there was no flood damage. Rough seas and strong winds resulted in some beach erosion. Severe Tropical Cyclone Rosa A persistent cluster of clouds over the South Pacific basin developed into a tropical low, named Rosa, near the Solomon Islands on 12 February. Shortly thereafter, Rosa entered the Australian region. Initially, the system remained weak and moved across the Cape York Peninsula on 16 February. Upon reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria, the storm slowly strengthened and moved in an erratic motion. Early on 26 February, Rosa peaked with maximum sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of . A reconnaissance flight into the cyclone recorded winds of at an altitude of , while located about 35 km (20 mi) northeast of the eye early on 26 February. The cyclone then made landfall near Bing Bong. Northern Territory, at the same intensity. Rosa moved west-southwestward across Australia and dissipated offshore Western Australia near Exmouth on 4 March. Observation stations in the southwest Gulf of Carpentaria reported abnormally high tides. At Bing Bong, the water level rose an estimated above the spring high tide mark. On Groote Eylandt island, a tide gauge was washed away. These weather stations suffered thousands of dollars in damage. Trees in extensive tracts of forests were felled, especially in the Roper-McArthur district, which stretches from the Roper to McArthur rivers. On North Island, located within the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands, a stranded light aircraft was destroyed. Severe Tropical Cyclone Kerry Kerry developed over the South Pacific basin from a low pressure area on 12 February. After later striking Makira in the Solomon Islands on 15 February, Kerry reached the Bureau of Meteorology's area of responsibility on 16 February as a Category 2 cyclone. Shortly thereafter, the system became a Category 3 cyclone. Reaching Category 4 on 18 February, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). After peak intensity, the storm began to move erratically, executing multiple cyclonic loops and decelerating between 20 February and 25 February. At that time, Kerry weakened significantly due to dry air, falling to Category 3 on 21 February and Category 2 on 24 February. The storm curved southwestward by 26 February and deteriorated to a Category 1 later that day. Shortly thereafter, Kerry turned westward and began approaching the east coast of Queensland. Late on 28 February, the cyclone struck the Whitsunday Islands as a Category 1 and later made multiple landfalls on the mainland as a tropical low on 1 March. Kerry curved northward several hours later and re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean. The storm reintensified into a Category 1 on 2 March, before a trough forced the cyclone to curve southeastward. Kerry again weakened while traversing above the Great Barrier Reef and finally dissipated on 5 March. In Queensland, much of the damage occurred in the vicinity of Mackay, where a wind gust of was observed. Twenty-seven homes were damaged, one severely, and a warehouse lost a large section of its roof. Wave heights up to in the city caused about $1 million (1979 AUD) in damage to boats at the harbor. On Brampton Island, the resort's staff quarters building was deroofed and many trees were downed throughout the island. Severe Tropical Cyclone Hazel Hazel grazed the Western Australia coast on March 13, 1979. Fifteen crewmen drowned when their fishing boat sank during the storm. The storm caused $41 million in damage, among the costliest Western Australian cyclones. Tropical Cyclone Ivan Ivan existed from 16 March to 21 March. Tropical Cyclone Stan Stan existed from 6 April to 15 April. Tropical Cyclone Jane A tropical disturbance formed about 220 mi (135 mi) west-southwest of Cocos Island early on 8 April. Early on the next day, the disturbance strengthened into a tropical low, which was named Jane. The storm only intensified slightly further and later peaked with a minimum barometric pressure of . Jane dissipated by 14 April. Severe Tropical Cyclone Idylle Idylle hit the Southern Coast of Western Australia. Tropical Cyclone Kevin Kevin existed from 2 May to 12 May. As it churned in open ocean, it took an unusual \\"zig-zag\\" path. Kevin did not strengthen much and dissipated out to sea.

She is known for appearing on New Zealand television series Sensing Murder. On the show, she works as a psychic detective to help find evidence relating to unsolved murder cases. Webber also writes a regular column, titled Life After Deb, in Australian magazine Woman's Day.  Controversy  Critics have pointed out her show uses cold reading and other techniques used by entertainers like Derren Brown. In a survey of various psychic's social media accounts in June 2020, investigator Susan Gerbic found that not only had Webber not predicted the Covid-19 pandemic but she planned a family vacation in Europe and Ireland which had to be interrupted. To which Gerbic noted in response to all the psychics she reviewed not seeing the pandemic coming, '\\"Oh, so, what good are you then?\\"'  Caught on Hidden Camera  On 13 August 2004 Australian Channel 7 broadcast a show called \\"Caught on Hidden Camera\\", in which they asked Webber to give readings to three people. The three asked to contact deceased relatives that did not exist. Webber claimed she was able to 'contact' these people. This was later screened in New Zealand on the show Eating Media Lunch as \\"Sensing Bullshit\\".  TVNZ psychic disagreement  Webber was involved in controversy regarding a high-profile missing child case in New Zealand in October 2009. The family of missing child Aisling Symes were introduced to Sensing Murder medium Webber by state broadcaster Television New Zealand (TVNZ), a move which was criticised in the media due to Aisling only having disappeared two days previously. One policeman said when questioned if the New Zealand police would use comments made by Webber on television show Breakfast: \\"I'm totally aghast - it seems like a totally commercial play\\". TVNZ responded with the following statement: \\"We're not trying to push a psychic message to make money and get ratings\\". Hundreds of e-mails were sent to the station.

The book was written in French and translated into English by Haakon Chevalier. It covers his family history, his early life, and his early work up through the 1930s, concluding just after Dalí's return to Catholicism and just before the global outbreak of the Second World War. The book is over 400 pages long and contains numerous detailed illustrations. It has attracted both editorial praise as well as criticism, notably from George Orwell. Contents Sant Pere in Figueres, where Dalí was baptised and took his First Communion. Dalí opens the book with the statement: \\"At the age of six I wanted to be a cook. At seven I wanted to be Napoleon. And my ambition has been growing steadily since.\\" According to Time, Dalí wrote with a highly detailed, methodical style that layered words the same way as paint. For example, he states in an early section about his childhood home: Dalí states in the book: *At the age of five years, he encountered an almost dead bat covered with ants and then put it in his mouth, bit it, and then tore the bat almost in half. *As a young child, he wore a king's ermine cape, a gold scepter, and a crown and then posed for himself with a mirror. He tucked his genitals inside the outfit to look more feminine. *He stood out dramatically from the poor children in his school by carrying a flexible bamboo cane adorned with a silver dog's head figure and a sailor suit with gold insignia. *Due to a \\"refined Jesuitical spirit\\", he remained a virgin until age 25. As an adolescent, he resisted the sexual advances by his girlfriend for five years until he left her, doing so mostly out of his enjoyment of being in control. *He became interested in necrophilia, but was then later cured of it. *While walking down the Boulevard Edgar-Quinet in Paris in 1934, he became so disgusted at the sight of a blind double-amputee that he kicked him. Reception surrealist artist Man Ray in Paris on June 16, 1934 (photograph by Carl Van Vechten). Time stated that Dalí's autobiography was \\"one of the most irresistible books of the year.\\" The magazine called it \\"a wild jungle of fantasy, posturing, belly laughs, narcissist and sadist confessions\\", while also commenting that \\"[t]he question has always been: Is Dalí crazy? The book indicates that Dalí is as crazy as a fox.\\" Essayist, journalist, and author George Orwell wrote a notable criticism of the book titled Benefit of Clergy: Some Notes on Salvador Dalí in 1944. Orwell categorized Dalí's book among other recent autobiographies that he considered \\"flagrantly dishonest\\", and he stated that \\"his autobiography is simply a strip-tease act conducted in pink limelight\\". He denounced Dalí's accounts of physical abuse against various women in Dalí's early life. He wrote \\"[i]t is not given to any one person to have all the vices, and Dalí also boasts that he is not homosexual, but otherwise he seems to have as good an outfit of perversions as anyone could wish for\\" and \\"[i]f it were possible for a book to give a physical stink off its pages, this one would\\". He also commented that \\"[o]ne ought to be able to hold in one's head simultaneously the two facts that Dalí is a good draughtsman and a disgusting human being\\", defending aspects of Dalí's surrealist style.Benefit of Clergy: Some Notes on Salvador Dali. George Orwell Online Library. First published: The Saturday Book for 1944. — GB, London. — 1944. Copy retrieved October 11, 2009. In July 1999, an article by Charles Stuckey in Art in America stated that Dalí's book \\"arguably revolutionized a literary genre\\". He argued that Dalí's book had been intended as slapstick humor and has been generally misinterpreted by critics. He also wrote: Influences American writer and humorist James Thurber wrote a semi-autobiographic article for The New Yorker called The Secret Life of James Thurber on February 27, 1943. In the article, Thurber referred to Dalí's title and parts of his style in comparison to his own life. In particular, Thurber noted with dismay that his own autobiographical book, My Life and Hard Times, sold for only $1.75 a copy in 1933 while Dalí's book sold for a full $6.00 in 1942.JAMES THURBER AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION .James Thurber. “The Secret Life of James Thurber”.

Benson company and in 1906 he became secretary, assistant, and play-reader to Granville Barker, with whom he stayed until 1915. Later career and writing Although he continued to act occasionally for many years, his theatrical interests gradually moved towards direction. He produced 14 plays for the Incorporated Stage Society and almost all of the revivals of the Phoenix Society (1919), of which he was one of the four founders. He translated plays by Giraudoux and Cocteau into English. In his spare time Wade formed extensive collections of the works and fugitive pieces of his favourite living writers – W. B. Yeats, Henry James, Joseph Conrad and Max Beerbohm, hunting out their anonymous contributions to periodicals and copying them out by hand in the British Museum. When in the 1940s Henry James began to be read and studied again, Allan Wade’s collection and knowledge proved invaluable to the scholars and in 1948 he edited and introduced James’s then unknown dramatic criticism as The Scenic Art. Wade was a friend of Yeats and in 1908 his interim bibliography appeared in Bullen’s collected edition of Yeats' works and he later he published the standard Bibliography. He went on to collect, edit and annotate the Letters of W.B. Yeats (1954) and at the time of his death was far advanced in collecting and editing the Letters of Oscar Wilde.

Polacco is well known for writing and illustrating stories depicting events from her childhood in Michigan. Meteor! was published in 1987 by The Trumpet Club, commonly known for publications of children's books from grades PreK-6. The story is about Patricia, her brother Richard, and Cousin Steve as young children spending time with their grandparents on their farm in Michigan. It seems to be a normal summer night until a flash from the sky and a crash in the yard. According to Publishers Weekly, \\"Based on a true event, this enchanting book overwhelmingly expresses the magic that suddenly pervades a small town, from the funny folksy way the story is told to the imaginative, full color illustrations.\\"Reviews Booklist says, \\"Polacco’s full-color pictures are completely in tandem with the telling\\". Story The book tells the story of Patricia, her brother Steve, and her cousin Steve spending the summer at their grandparents' farm in Union City, Michigan. Late one night while sitting in their cozy home, a bright light falls from the sky landing in the Gaw's farm with a loud crash. Curiosity overcomes the family as they set foot outside to find a fallen star in their backyard. One line in the book reads, “Of all the places on earth a meteor could have fallen, it landed smack-dab in the middle of our yard, Gramma exclaimed.” This was such a huge deal for the residents of Mudsock Medow. Word gets around quickly, and before long there is a carnival at the Gaw farm. There is a band, a circus, a hot air balloon, and more. The entire town gathers to celebrate the meteor. Many residents touched the meteor claiming it was magical. It seemed like magic to all that the fallen star, which flew through the galaxy, had landed in Union City and brought such joy to all. Inspiration Patricia Polacco's stories are mostly life experiences. She draws her ideas from her entire life. Her books are based on family stories as well. She learned stories from her family, which she uses as inspiration for her books. The tales in her books are also from experiencing the cultural traditions from both sides of her family. Meteor!, for example, was written because of the special encounter her mom had when she was a young girl on her grandparents' farm in Michigan. References *Eduplace.com. Houghton Mifflin Reading.

Marten Beach is adjacent to Lesser Slave Lake Provincial Park, Carlver Creek to the north and Marten Creek to the south.  History and attractions  The hamlet was founded by Herb Johnson of Plamondon, Alberta and his wife Stevie in the middle of the 20th century. He subdivided his property into the current hamlet and the neighbouring Diamond Willow Resort campground, which he then used for subsequent income. There have been proposals to turn the hamlet into a village, yet this has not proved popular as yet with residents. The names of the roads in the community boast connections to the founder, such as 'Johnson Drive' or 'Herb Crescent'. Other attractions in the area include the Bird Observatory within the provincial park, Marten Mountain, Lily Lake, the 'Oilman's' Sand Dunes, and sandy beaches along the lakeshore.

It was released on his 1976 album On the Road to Kingdom Come. The song tells the story of a poor farm boy anxious to marry the daughter of the town's mayor, even if he must go so far as to blackmail the mayor to get his way. Plot Set in \\"the little town of Candor\\" (possibly referring to Candor, NY, though more likely playing on the other meaning of the word; frank honesty), the narrator introduces himself by stating that his father is a farmer and that his mother is \\"a neighbor who goes visiting around.\\" However, none of that seems to bother the narrator as his focus is on the mayor's daughter, Coleen. The mayor is against the courtship of the two and plans to see his daughter married \\"to a better man than a boy with farmer's hands.\\" One day, the narrator decides to work things out with the mayor. He searches for him at his home and office with no success, only to discover the mayor out in the countryside having an affair with the narrator's mother. The narrator becomes angry with the mayor and decides to blackmail him by stating that he will keep this incident a secret to protect him in his upcoming re-election as long as the mayor promises to let him be with Coleen. The Mayor agrees, reasoning that \\"this piper must be paid.\\" One month later, the mayor is re-elected, and to celebrate, he decides to take his family (including Coleen) on a \\"month-long foreign vacation.\\" The narrator waits for their return; when they finally do return, Coleen is not with them. The mayor states that Coleen decided to stay to finish her schooling and tells the narrator that he will no longer be seeing his daughter. In an ironic twist, the mayor also reveals his long-kept secret—in that he is, in fact, the narrator's real father (\\"Of course, dear son, where do you think you came from in the first place?\\") and that they are \\"two of a kind.\\" Chorus The song's chorus is heard three times throughout the song, and in shortened form two more times. The first two times the chorus is heard, it foreshadows the song's ending with the revelation that the mayor's daughter may be traveling overseas: : The Mayor of Candor lied : When he offered me his only daughter : The Mayor of Candor tried : To take her across the water : What a thing to do to a young man in love : What a thing to do to your daughter.

S. Ridley proposed the Ridley-Jopling classification of leprosy (1962), and wrote the widely read textbook of \\"Handbook of Leprosy\\" which had a fifth edition. He had a wide understanding of leprosy problems based on his experiences as the director of Jordan hospital, a leprosy hospital (1950–1967) in England and wrote various articles including \\"leprosy stigma\\". Life Early life He was born in Pozzuoli, near Naples, Italy and educated at Norman Court School, New Barnet and Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys, Barnet. He graduated from London University (St. Barthlomew's Hospital) in 1936 and studied medicine and obstetrics, as an intern, ending as a ship doctor traveling to the Far East. Later in 1938, he went to Hartley, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Africa with his wife, and chiefly engaged in medicine and obstetrics. He transferred a patient with leprosy in his government car to a leprosarium and became interested in the disease. During World War II, he went into the volunteer Medical Corps. In August 1947, he returned to London with his family at age 36 and took postgraduate studies, specializing in tropical medicine. After the war, some of Hansen's disease patients came from other countries, and he took the new post of the director of Jordan Hospital specializing in leprosy. The number of beds was only 24. After 17 years, it closed and a few patients were transferred to other facilities. The Jordan Hospital(1950~1967) Together with Ridley, he established the Ridley-Jopling classification of leprosy, which is the standard of classification, although WHO added a simple classification of multibacillary leprosy and paucibacillary leprosy for practical reasons. He was interested not only in the classification, but also in leprosy reactions, and he finally found the designator of Erythema Nodosum Leprosum, asking any visitors to his hospital.Mosuke Murata, the designator of erythema nodosum leprosum.

Ahmed Lütfullah (early 17th century – 27 February 1702), better known by his court title of Münejjim Bashi (; \\"Chief Astrologer\\"), was an Ottoman courtier, scholar, Sufi poet and historian. His chief work is the Jamiʿ al-Duwal, a world history particularly valuable for the history of the medieval Muslim dynasties of the regions around the southwestern shore of the Caspian Sea (Adharbayjan, Shirvan, Arran, Derbent). In Turkish literature, he is referred to also as Ahmed Lütfullah. Biography His father Lütfullah was a native of Ereğli, Konya, but Ahmed was born in Salonica sometime in the first half of the 17th century (in 1631 according to the Encyclopædia Britannica).. He was educated at the Mevlevi dervish lodge in the quarter of Kasımpaşa, spending 15 years there under the supervision of Sheikh Halil Dede. After studies on astronomy and astrology, he advanced to the position of chief court astrologer (müneccimbaşi) in 1667/8. He enjoyed his greatest prominence under Sultan Mehmed IV (reigned 1648–87), who in 1675/6 raised him to the rank of musahib-i padishahi (\\"imperial companion\\"), signifying his admittance to the innermost circle of the court.Mihail Guboglu – Cronici turceşti privind ţările române Vol. II –Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste România, Bucureşti 1974 He retained the post until Mehmed IV's deposition in November 1687, when he was exiled to Egypt, where his adopted son Moralı Hasan Pasha served as governor. After some time he moved to Mecca, where he became the sheikh of the local Mevlevi lodge. In 1693/4 he moved to Medina for seven years. In 1700, he was recalled to Istanbul to work again as chief astrologer, but declined the offer because of his old age. He returned to Mecca, where he died on 27 February 1702. His tomb was located near the mausoleum of Khadija, the first wife of Muhammad.  Works   The Compendium of Nations  Münejjim Bashi's main work is the Jamiʿ al-Duwal (\\"The Compendium of Nations\\"), written in Arabic. It was begun at the behest of Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa, who instructed him to prepare a comprehensive historical work.Hatice Arslan-Sözüdogru - Müneccimbasi als Historiker - Islamkundliche Untersuchungen Band 289, Klaus Schwarz Verlag, It is a world history, beginning with Adam and ending in Ottoman times, in the year 1678. It is divided into three parts: the history of Muhammad, the history of pre- and non-Islamic dynasties, and the history of Islamic dynasties, concluding with the history of the Ottoman dynasty until 1678. His work is especially valuable as it preserves information from several sources now lost, especially on many minor Muslim dynasties overlooked by major historians. This is particularly the case on his use of the lost Taʾrikh Bab al-Abwab (\\"History of Derbent\\"), which provides much information on the dynasties of eastern Transcaucasia, Arran and Adharbayjan. His pre-Islamic section is also notable, as he used Roman and Jewish sources, as well as West European chronicles, and was the first Islamic historian to deal with dynasties like the Babylonians, the Seleucids and the Assyrians. His work also includes sections on India and China. Although several manuscript copies of the original Arabic work are known to exist, the Jamiʿ al-Duwal was for long best known and accessible through a Turkish translation by Ahmed Nedim in the 18th century, known as Saha'if al-Akhbar (\\"The Pages of the Chronicle\\"). Although epitomized, Nedim's version \\"is very readable and not composed in the highflown literary style that prevailed in his period\\". The work notably provided the main material for Vladimir Minorsky's magisterial Studies in Caucasian history (London 1953) and A history of Sharvan and Darband (Cambridge 1958). The original manuscript, considered lost for a long time, is kept partly at the Library of the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne and the rest at the Library of the Topkapi Sarayi Museum in Istanbul. In his Chistory, Münejjim Bashi follows the method used in Islamic historiography by Ibn Khaldun, indicating his sources and submitting them to a critical investigation.

Life François Poullain de la Barre was born on July 1647 in Paris France, to a family with judicial nobility. After graduating in 1663 with a master of arts, François Poullain de la Barre spent three years at Sorbonne where he studied theology. In 1679 François Poullain de la Barre became an ordained Catholic a priest. From 1679 to 1688, François Poullain de la Barre led two modest parishes, Versigny and La Flamengrie in Picardy in northern France. In 1688 François Poullain de la Barre left Picardy and his priesthood to return to Paris. At the time the Catholic Church was critical of Cartesianism. By 1689 he moved to Geneva where he converted to Calvinism, a branch of Protestantism. In the following year 1690, François Poullain de la Barre married Marie Ravier. After a year tutoring he got a position teaching at a local Genevan university. After the Edict of Fontainebleau revoked the Edict of Nantes, he was exiled in the Republic of Geneva, where he obtained the citizenship (bourgeoisie) in 1716.Poullain de la Barre, François, in the Historical Dictionary of Switzerland. François Poullain de la Barre spent the remainder of his life in Geneva, where he died on May 4, 1723.  Work  During a physiology conference in 1667 a friend of François Poullain de la Barre introduced him to Cartesianism, a philosophy created by philosopher René Descartes. François Poullain de la Barre later adopted the philosophy and applied Cartesian principles to feminist thought. François Poullain de la Barre used Cartesianism to the 'question of women' and wrote many texts of social philosophy which denounced injustice against woman and by the inequality of the female condition. Opposing the discrimination they experienced and as one of the champions of social equality between women and men. Six years after his introduction to Cartesianism François Poullain de la Barre published a three part series on the female condition. In 1673 he published On the Equality of the Two Sexes, \\"A Physical and Moral Discourse, Which Shows That it is Important to Rid Oneself of Prejudice\\". Arguing the difference between men and women goes beyond the body, but is in the \\"constitution of the body\\". François Poullain de la Barre rejects the idea that the minds of men and women differ, historically proclaiming \\"the mind has no sex\\". In claiming sexual difference lies in part through the \\"constitution of the body\\" François de la Barre argued the unequal treatment that women experience in religious, educational and the effects of the environment create a perceived apparent innate difference of the sex. In François Poullain de la Barre assessment this does not have a natural basis, it is not essential nor is it innate, but proceeds from cultural prejudice, and social constructionist in affect. François Poullain de la Barre advocates for the female education, underscoring that women receive a true and quality education. and also says all careers should be open to them, including scientific careers.http://blog.le-miklos.eu/wp- content/Poullain-EgaliteDesDeuxSexes.pdf In 1674 he published On the Education of Ladies, \\"To Guide the Mind in Sciences and Morals\\", François Poullain de la Barre continues reflection on the education of women, but utilizes Socratic dialogue. In this he addresses the historical constrains at the time. In 1675 François Poullain de la Barre published the third in his series On the Excellence of Men, \\"Against the Equality of the Sexes\\" was, despite the title, a rebuttal of those opposed to sexual equality.  Responses and critiques  Opinions about Poullain de la Barre's place in the history of feminism vary considerably from one author to another. But his theory is used by other authors. Pierre Bayle has advanced the theory that Poullain may have refuted his own thesis because he felt threatened, but the arguments antifeminists advanced are doubtful of this refutation. Simone de Beauvoir includes a quotation from Poullain de la Barre in an epigraph to The Second Sex in 1949: \\"All that has been written about women by men should be suspect, for the men are at once judge and party.\\"  Bibliography  *De l’Égalité des deux sexes, discours physique et moral où l’on voit l’importance de se défaire des préjugés, Paris, Chez Jean du Puis, 1673 ; Fayard, 1984. *De l’Éducation des dames pour la conduite de l’esprit dans les sciences et dans les mœurs, entretiens, Paris, Chez Jean du Puis, 1674 ; Université de Toulouse Le Mirail, Toulouse, 1980, 1985. *De l’Excellence des hommes contre l’égalité des sexes, Paris, J.

The 190th overall episode of the series, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 14, 2009. In the episode, Butters pays a girl $5 to give him his first kiss, which prompts Butters to start his own \\"kissing company\\" and eventually become a pimp. The episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker. \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\" received particular attention for a scene in which Butters visited an ACORN office seeking benefits for his prostitutes, a reference to the real-life 2009 scandal. The episode received generally positive reviews and was seen by 2.56 million overall households, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode was rated TV-MA-LS in the United States. Plot Tired of being the only boy in his class to have never kissed a girl, Butters purchases his first kiss from Sally Darson, who sells kisses for $5. Having won the respect of his classmates, he devises a plan to advertise Sally's services to other unpopular boys at the school. Sally gives Butters a 40 percent cut for his advertising and managing services, and Butters soon turns the venture into a full-fledged \\"kissing company\\" by recruiting more girls to fill in during times in which Sally is busy. Upon learning about Butters' business, Kyle tells him that he is \\"nothing but a common pimp\\". Oblivious to what the word means, Butters attends a pimp convention where he seeks advice from more-experienced pimps, including one called Keyshawn. Afterward, he starts to mimic the pimp jargon, such as referring to Sally as his \\"bottom bitch\\", and incorporating \\"Do you know what I am saying?\\" into his conversations. To combat the apparent rise in prostitution, Sergeant Yates of the Park County Police goes undercover (albeit poorly disguised) as a female prostitute named \\"Yolanda\\". During stings, to the bewilderment of the police, Yates waits until he is done engaging in actual sex acts with his male patrons before making an arrest. After he engages in group sex with numerous members of the fraternity house Alpha Tau Omega and doing business for Keyshawn, Yates' fellow officers begin to openly suggest to Yates that he is getting too carried away with his duties, as Yates now also has a pimp, Keyshawn. Meanwhile, Butters' reputation as the respectful \\"new pimp\\" spreads throughout the county, prompting actual adult prostitutes to seek employment with him. Repulsed at what Butters is doing, Stan and Kyle try to persuade him to stop, but Butters ignores them, paying Clyde to keep Stan away from him, and brushing off Kyle's protests in an almost threatening manner. As his workforce expands, Butters starts offering health care and other benefits to his employees, attracting more and more adults. To this end, he visits the local ACORN office to apply for low-income housing benefits, seek mortgage loans, and inquire about the tax-status of his business. Butters is initially refused until he identifies the boss as a client of some of the real prostitutes working for Butters. Sergeant Yates, still undercover, seeks employment with Butters. But Keyshawn soon appears outside and begs for \\"Yolanda\\" back, asking for her hand in marriage. Butters insists that he cannot force \\"Yolanda\\" to work for him, claiming it would interfere with the \\"true love\\" Keyshawn and \\"Yolanda\\" share. \\"Yolanda\\" accepts the proposal, and Butters decides to quit his job as a pimp. To the delight of his employees, he encourages them to function under the self-management of the company so they can keep whatever they earn for themselves. While \\"Yolanda\\" and Keyshawn are shown celebrating their first anniversary together in a small chalet in the mountains in Switzerland, Yates suddenly decides to spring his sting operation. Revealing his true identity, he pulls out his gun and badge and informs Keyshawn that he is under arrest. Production and cultural references \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on October 14, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. The scene in which Butters visits the ACORN office seeking benefits for his prostitutes is a reference to the real-life 2009 scandal in which activist James O'Keefe secretly filmed himself posing as a pimp during meetings with ACORN employees. The scene generated the greatest amount of media attention for \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\" after its original broadcast. The pimp convention includes references to Pimps Up, Ho's Down, an HBO documentary about the pimping lifestyle, featuring real-life pimps. The scene in which the lieutenant calls his john a \\"nasty fucker\\" during sex, mirrored a scene from the documentary, Hookers at the Point. The song that plays during the lieutenant's stripper scene at the fraternity party is \\"Fuck the Pain Away\\", by Peaches. Reception In its original American broadcast on October 14, 2009, \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\" was watched by 2.56 million overall households, according to Nielsen ratings. It received a 1.7 rating/3 share, and a 1.3 rating/4 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. In a surprise, South Park was outperformed in the 18 to 49 age group by the Bravo reality television series Top Chef, which was seen by 2.67 million viewers. \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\" also tied for the evening in the 18–49 rating with the Syfy reality television series Ghost Hunters (2.9 million household viewers) and only slightly outperformed the Discovery Channel popular science television program MythBusters (2.69 million household viewers), which surprised TV by the Number's Robert Seidman. \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\" was also outperformed by the Spike TV mixed martial arts competition series The Ultimate Fighter, which was watched by 2.82 million household viewers and had the highest cable ratings for the night in the 18 to 49 age group. \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\" received generally positive reviews. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10 rating. He said although it started slow, \\"once this episode found its legs, it was non-stop funny.\\" Isler praised the South Park writers for coming up with a surprisingly funny plot, and said it ranked among Butters' best moments in the series. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said it was good to see an episode focused strictly on comedy, after a string of episodes focusing on social satire. Delgado said the premise of the episode was absurd and over- the-top, but appreciated that South Park was continuing to push boundaries by mocking such issues as prostitution. The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell said the episode \\"was pretty damn funny, but I'm predisposed to Butters in general as well as the wide world of pimping.\\" Wired writer Chris Kohler said the topical and timely jokes in \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\", such as the satire on ACORN, were a strong example of what kept South Park funny and relevant. Not all reviews were positive. Sean O'Neal, also of The A.V. Club, gave the episode a C grade, and said \\"It was basically one note held for the run of the ep, in service of a simple little story without many surprises.\\" O'Neal said the subplot involving the police was \\"similarly repetitious\\", but he liked how the two plots came together to resolve each other. Home release \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's thirteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 16, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios, which discussed the process behind animating the show with Inside Xbox host Major Nelson. The episode was also released on the two-disc DVD collection A Little Box of Butters.

Although the Hebrew Bible is the result of a developmental process, canonical criticism focuses on the final form of the text. Canonical criticism, sometimes called canon criticism or the canonical approach, is a way of interpreting the Bible that focuses on the text of the biblical canon itself as a finished product. Brevard Childs (1923-2007) popularised this approach, though he personally rejected the term. Whereas other types of biblical criticism focus on the origins, structure and history of texts, canonical criticism looks at the meaning which the overall text, in its final form, has for the community which uses it. Description Canonical criticism involves \\"paying attention to the present form of the text in determining its meaning for the believing community.\\" According to James Barr, it involves concentrating authority \\"in the canonical text, and not in the people or events out of which that text came.\\" Brevard Childs says that the canon \\"not only serves to establish the outer boundaries of authoritative Scripture,\\" but \\"forms a prism through which light from the different aspects of the Christian life is refracted.\\"Brevard S. Childs, Biblical Theology of the Old and New Testaments (Augsburg Fortress, 1993), p. 672. He also notes that \\"the tradents of the tradition have sought to hide their own footprints in order to focus attention on the canonical text itself and not on the process.\\" However, Childs refuses to speak of canonical criticism as if it were on a level with form criticism or redaction criticism. According to Childs, it represents an entirely new departure, replacing the entire historical-critical method. John H. Sailhamer views the \\"canonical approach\\" as including the \\"canon criticism\\" of Childs, as well as composition criticism, redaction criticism, and text linguistics.  Origins  Canonical criticism is a relatively new approach to biblical studies. As recently as 1983, James Barr could state that canon had no hermeneutical significance for biblical interpretation.James Barr, Holy Scripture: Canon, Authority, Criticism (Westminster John Knox, 1983), 67. Childs set out his canonical approach in his Biblical Theology in Crisis (1970) and applied it in Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture (1979). The phrase \\"canonical criticism\\" was first used by James A. Sanders in 1972.James A. Sanders, Torah and Canon (Fortress Press, 1972) Childs repudiates the term because > It implies that the concern with canon is viewed as another historical- > critical technique which can take its place alongside of source criticism, > form criticism, rhetorical criticism, and the like. I do not envision the > approach to canon in this light. Rather, the issue at stake in canon turns > on establishing a stance from which the Bible is to be read as Sacred > Scripture. Canonical criticism arose as a reaction to other forms of biblical criticism. John Barton argues that Child's primary thesis is that historical-critical methods are \\"unsatisfactory theologically.\\" According to Barton, Childs' approach is \\"genuinely new,\\" in that it is an \\"attempt to heal the breach between biblical criticism and theology,\\" and in that it belongs more to the realm of literary criticism than that of 'historical' study of texts. Sanders argues that canonical criticism is biblical criticism's \\"self-critical stance\\": > It is not only a logical evolution of earlier stages in the growth of > criticism but it also reflects back on all the disciplines of biblical > criticism and informs them all to some extent.\\" He also suggests that it places the Bible \\"back where it belongs, in the believing communities of today\\": > Canonical criticism might be seen in metaphor as the beadle (bedelos) who > now carries the critically studied Bible in procession back to the church > lectern from the scholar's study. Barton has noted parallels between canonical criticism and the New Criticism of T. S. Eliot and others. Both schools of thought affirm that \\"a literary text is an artefact,\\" that \\"intentionalism is a fallacy,\\" and that \\"the meaning of a text is a function of its place in the literary canon.\\" Criticism The canonical approach has been criticised by scholars from both liberal and evangelical perspectives. On the one hand, according to Dale Brueggemann, James Barr accuses Childs of \\"aiding and abetting\\" fundamentalists. Although Childs' approach is \\"post-critical\\" rather than pre- critical, Barr argues that the vision of a post-critical era \\"is the conservative dream.\\" Barton, however, notes that > Whatever else Childs is doing, he is not taking us 'back to the canon', for > no one has ever been aware of the canon in this way before. It is only after > we have seen how varied and inconsistent the Old Testament really is that we > can begin to ask whether it can nonetheless be read as forming a unity. Conservative scholars, on the other hand, object to the way canonical criticism bypasses \\"vexed questions relating to the historical validation of revelation.\\" Oswalt suggests that canonical critics blithely \\"separate fact and meaning\\" when they suggest that we are called to submit to the inspired truth of the text, despite the community's inability to admit where they really got it. Barton also suggests that there is tension between \\"the text itself\\" and \\"the text as part of the canon\\". That is, the canonical approach stresses both the text in its final form as we have it, as well as the idea that \\"the words which compose the text draw their meaning from the context and setting in which they are meant to be read.\\" Barton argues that \\"the canonical approach actually undermines the concern for the finished text as an end in itself, and brings us, once again, nearer to traditional historical criticism.\\" Applications Childs applies his canonical approach to prophetic literature, and argues that in Amos, \\"an original prophetic message was expanded by being placed in a larger theological context,\\" while in Nahum and Habakkuk, the oracles are assigned a new role through the introduction of hymnic material, and they \\"now function as a dramatic illustration of the eschatological triumph of God.\\" Jon Isaak applies the canonical approach to 1 Corinthians 14 and the issue of women being silent in the church. Isaak argues that > In the canonical approach, theological concerns take precedent over > historical interests.

When he began high school he started to play the trumpet and became a member of the Staffordshire County Music School as a chorister in the Staffordshire County Youth Choir and became the principal cornet player of the Staffordshire County Youth Brass Band. He was a member of multiple brass bands including The Northern Brass Ensemble and Greenway Moor Brass Band, and consequently learned the early musicianship for which his singing has become known. In 1979 he went on to study voice at the Royal Northern College of Music and in 1985 at the National Opera Studio in London. Whilst studying in Manchester he was a regular member of the BBC Northern Singers Career His early career saw him honing his craft singing oratorio throughout Britain and Europe and performing with all the major British opera companies including English National Opera, Welsh National Opera, Opera North and Glyndebourne Festival Opera singing light lyric roles such as Almaviva in Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Iopas in Les Troyens, various Mozart roles, The Novice in Billy Budd and Nanki Poo in The Mikado. His first major break was going on to sing Almaviva at ENO whilst covering, and then performing the same role in two tours with WNO. He made his Royal Opera House, Covent Garden debut as Beppe in I Pagliacci. His major European break was whilst covering Tamino in Die Zauberflöte at Glyndebourne. After singing an orchestral stage rehearsal, the then GMD of Leipzig Opera booked him to sing Tamino in Leizig and he became the first British singer to sing there in the post war era. This was immediately followed by singing the same role in Scottish Opera, La Monnaie in Brussels and the Salzburg Festival. In 1993 Banks made his US debut singing the title role in Bernstein's Candide at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and this was the start of a fruitful association with the major companies of the US that has seen Banks sing the roles of Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini, composers that have become synonymous with this artist, singing roles at The Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, LA Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Santa Fe Opera, Opera Colorado in Denver, New York City Opera and orchestras throughout the States. Although primarily known for his bel canto interpretations, Banks has a diverse repertoire, singing the music of Bach, Britten, Handel, Mozart, Berg, Stravinsky (including one of his signature roles, that of Tom Rakewell in The Rake's Progress) Rimsky-Korsakov, Elgar and Gilbert and Sullivan to name but a few. Banks is a regular stage artist throughout Europe singing at houses including ROH, Paris Opera, Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, Bayerische Staatsoper, Berlin Staatsoper, Frankfurt Opera, Stuttgart Opera, Het Muziektheater, Amsterdam, Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris, La Monnaie, Brussels, Teatro Comunale di Bologna, Teatro alla Scala, Milan, and Teatro San Carlo in Naples. Most recently, Banks' engagements include the Bayerische Staatsoper as Don Narciso (Il turco in Italia), Count Almaviva (Il barbiere di Siviglia) at The Metropolitan Opera where he was praised by his nuanced and agile singingSmith, Steve. \\"Figaro to the Rescue: Don’t Trip Over His Groupies\\", The New York Times, 6 October 2009.

It is located along the Mackenzie Highway (Highway 35), approximately south of the Town of High Level. Paddle Prairie Metis Settlement is the largest of eight Metis Settlements in the Province of Alberta. The community is rich in timber, natural resources and agricultural land. The community is also known for constructing solar power generating units for several of its community buildings. History The Great Depression of the 1930s saw much deprivation among the nomadic Métis population of Alberta, estimated at about 11,000 in 1936. A royal commission was formed to investigate the living conditions of Alberta's \\"half-breeds\\" (as the Métis were known), who were then squatting on road allowances with no ready sources of cash income, or trapping in remote areas without access to education or health services. Métis children in urban areas were driven away from public schools by the ridicule and humiliation of white pupils, with an estimated 80% of the provincial Métis population receiving no education whatsoever. This Ewing Commission saw agriculture, particularly stock-raising, as the means by which the Métis could be made into \\"self-supporting citizens\\". Farm colonies, in which the Métis themselves would provide most of the physical labour, would be a suitably inexpensive relief scheme for the cash-strapped Alberta government to implement. Following these recommendations, the 1938 Metis Population Betterment Act enabled unoccupied Crown land to be set aside for the creation of new Métis settlements. Eleven were originally created by Order-in-Council through 1938 and 1939 – Wolf Lake, Utikuma Lake (now Gift Lake), Cold Lake, Marlboro, Keg River (now Paddle Prairie), Big Prairie (now Peavine), Touchwood, Goodfish Lake (now Kikino), Elizabeth, Fishing Lake, and East Prairie. Caslan (now Buffalo Lake) was the final addition, reserved for Métis veterans returning from World War Two before being thrown open to general settlement in 1951. Settlement at Paddle Prairie progressed rapidly. A 1941 report of the Alberta Bureau of Public Welfare recorded nineteen heads of families resident in the area, with a total population of 72. The settlement's central village was established at its approximate geographic center, the Paddle Prairie proper, an area of open land and productive soil, where a lumbering operation produced 91,372 board feet of rough sawn lumber. From here, of road was cleared to a landing on the Peace River, suitable for the unloading of supplies. Geography The largest and most northerly of Alberta's Metis settlements, Paddle Prairie consists of approximately seventeen townships. It is bounded by the Peace River on its eastern border, where the La Crete ferry still operates.

Delpino introduced a very broad view of plant ecology and was the first to suggest pollination syndromes, sets of traits associated with specific kinds of pollinators. He wrote Pensieri sulla Biologia Vegetale (Thoughts on Plant Biology) in 1867 and this failed to gather sufficient notice due to it being written in Italian. He corresponded with Charles Darwin and was one of the first to speculate on the idea of \\"plant intelligence\\". Life and career Delpino was born in Chiavari, the first child of Enrico Delpino and Carlotta Enrico. He was baptized by Antonio Maria Gianelli, who was then a priest in the parish of St. John the Baptist. As a child, Delpino was forced to spend long hours in the garden to improve his strength. Delpino later recollected that he became a naturalist because of this - \\"What could a child do who was left to himself for so many hours in complete solitude? I spent all my time studying the habits of ants, bees and wasps. I discovered the curious nesting habit of a large black bee (Xylocopa violacea).\\" Portrait from the late 1800s Delpino's early studies after high school were in mathematics and natural sciences at Genoa but he had to drop out in 1850 upon his father's death. Economic worries forced him to seek work and he became an official in the Customs House of Chiavari and later made botanical trips to Constantinople and Odessa. He moved in 1867 to Florence to assist Filippo Parlatore, In 1871 he was appointed as professor of natural history at the Forestry School in the Royal Institute of Vallombrosa. In 1875, he moved to the University of Genoa to head the botany department there. Delpino wished to travel around the world and boarded the warship Garibaldi as a naturalist with the Prince Tommaso di Savoia. He returned, however, after reaching Brazil and travelling around Rio de Janeiro. In 1884 he moved to Bologna and in 1894 to the University of Naples where he stayed until his death. Delpino was one of the founders of modern floral biology along with Hermann Müller and corresponded with Charles Darwin from 1867 onwards. Delpino looked at the interactions of plants and the environment and the results in terms of physiology and structure of the plants. One of Delpino's pioneering researches was in the evolution of plant relationships with ants. This research was prompted by a dispute with Darwin on the function of extra-floral nectaries. According to Darwin, these were excretory in function. Delpino noted that the nectaries provided sweet substances and observed that ants provided defence to many of these plants and identified nearly 80 plants with ant associations. Darwin unfortunately could not read many of his works in Italian and was only able to examine some parts with the help of his wife. Delpino was also a keen observer of plant growth and behaviour and in his studies he examined the definition of intelligence and noted that the denial of intelligence to plants was a \\"serious mistake, born of a superficial appreciation of the facts. The solutions implemented by plants, in fact are successful in achieving the same results of animal locomotion and with the same perfection. In this I do not see any difference in the degrees of intelligence exhibited by animals and plants.\\" In 1869 Delpino criticised Darwin's theory of pangenesis,F. Delpino 1869. On the Darwinian theory of pangenesis. Scientific Opinion: A Weekly Record of Scientific Progress at Home & Abroad 2: 365–67, 391–93, 407–8 (Translated from Rivista contemporanea Nazionale Italiana.

Scientific Opinion: A Weekly Record of Scientific Progress at Home & Abroad, 2 (20 October): 426. Delpino believed in a teleological and vitalist interpretation of evolution. He has been described as trying to \\"reconcile Darwin's theory of evolution with a spiritual finalism.\\"Birx, H. James. (2006). Encyclopedia of Anthropology, Volume 1. Sage Publications. p. 687. His thought process was teleological and assumed that nature had a purpose. Giovanni Canestrini described Delpino as a \\"Darwinian fully displayed\\" but was embarrassed about his belief in vitalism.Kohn, David. (1985). The Darwinian Heritage. Princeton University Press. p. 717. Delpino pioneered the concept of pollination syndrome and believed that flower biology could assist in taxonomy.M.C.F. Proctor, P. Yeo & A.

It was one of thirty-two Air Service training camps established after the United States entry into World War I in April 1917.William R. Evinger: Directory of Military Bases in the U.S., Oryx Press, Phoenix, Ariz., 1991, p. 147. After World War II, the property was sold to the city of Americus. Most of the airfield was developed into a civil airport. In 1948 a portion of Souther Field was chartered for the South Georgia Trade and Vocational School (later South Georgia Technical College). History The base was named Souther Field, being named after Henry Souther, of Hartford, Connecticut. Souther was head of the Aircraft Engineering Division of the Air Service when he died in August 1917 after a brief illness contracted while acting as director of Langley Field, Virginia. At Langley, he was experimenting and testing aircraft with various engines when he died.Location of U.S. Aviation Fields, The New York Times, 21 July 1918 World War I Its history begins in 1918, when on 19 January, the War Department leased north of the center of Americus, Georgia from Sumter County for a primary training airfield and an aviation supply depot. The Air Service named the facility Souther Field in honor of Major Henry Souther who served as consulting engineer on many of the World War I aviation projects. Major Souther had been killed earlier in the line of duty at Fort Monroe, Virginia. The contract for construction of the airfield and base was let on 7 February 1918 to J.B. McCray Company of Atlanta, and work was begun on the 19th. The flying field and the station area had to be graded and cleared before any construction could be done. There were about 1,200 men involved in the construction work. When completed, the base consisted of warehouses, accommodations for 2,000 officers and men, 15 wooden hangars, and a hospital plus other structures. The first aircraft to land on the field were Standard J-1s powered by Hall Scott motors from Maxwell Field, Alabama. However, Curtiss Jennys, manufactured in Canada, became the first aircraft assigned to the field. Shortly thereafter, 71 more Jennys from the Curtiss factory in Buffalo, New York also arrived. The first 25 cadets reported on 29 May 1918. An additional class of 25 cadets arrived every week until the signing of the armistice. The high-water mark saw 125 officers, 1,400 men, and 147 aircraft at the field. Souther logged more flying hours than any other Army airfield during the war. Souther Field was accepted by the Army and officially opened on 4 July 1918. When completed, the facility had schools, a YMCA, a fire department, electric lighting, underground sewers, water lines, telephones, a railroad spur, hospital, post office, barracks, mess halls and other infrastructure. On 17 June a small cyclone struck the airfield from the northeast. Training units assigned to Souther Field were:Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War, Volume 3, Part 3, Center of Military History, United States Army, 1949 (1988 Reprint) * Post Headquarters, Souther Field - October 1919 * 5th Aero Squadron, May 1917 : Re-designated as Squadron \\"A\\", July–November 1918 * 116th Aero Squadron, March 1918 : Re-designated as Squadron \\"B\\", July–November 1918 * 236th Aero Squadron, April 1918 : Re-designated as Squadron \\"C\\", July–November 1918 * 237th Aero Squadron, April 1918 : Re-designated as Squadron \\"D\\", July–November 1918 * Flying School Detachment (Consolidation of Squadrons A-D), November 1918-November 1919 After the end of the conflict, the War Department deactivated the field and sold its surplus airplanes to the public. The main activity at the airfield had become the surplus airplane auctions. Souther Field was completing its transition from a pilot training base to a mecca for would-be barnstormers looking for a deal on an airplane still in the crate. The auctions were continuous. Big-time buyers could snap up a load of Jennys for about fifty dollars apiece. Altimeters could be bought in lots of 200 for around a dime each and propellers were going for around twenty-six cents. One of the surplus aircraft buyers was none other than Charles Lindbergh. In May 1923, Lindbergh paid $500 for a Jenny with a brand- new OX-5 engine, a new paint job, and an extra 20 gal. gasoline tank. He had over 100 Jenny airplanes to choose from. Lindbergh took the plane out to the field and taxied around for a while, getting the feel of it. Although he had some dual instruction time to his credit, he did not advertise the fact that he had not actually soloed. After nearly dinging up the plane with an attempted takeoff, he taxied back to the hangars and asked Mr. Messer if he would ride with him. A few hours later, Messer exited the craft satisfied that his student would do fine but he suggested that Mr. Lindbergh wait till later in the afternoon when the wind had calmed. Later that day, Charles Lindbergh made his first solo flight above the cotton fields near Americus. A few days later, he boarded the plane again and set off for Montgomery to begin his barnstorming career. In 1928, Sumter County purchased the property. World War II Scenes of Souther Field during 1944 William J. Graham of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania founded the Graham Aviation Company in April 1938. By the end of 1940, Graham Aviation managed eight airports in western Pennsylvania and operated several pilot schools as well as one flight instructor school. The Army Air Corps asked Graham if he would consider establishing a Contract Pilot School. A pilot, who had trained at Souther during World War I, suggested the former airfield to Graham for his school. Graham and his staff came to Americus and inspected the site. Finding it satisfactory, he leased the property from Sumter County. Construction of the new contract training field began in December 1940 initially consisting of one barracks, a mess hall, a workshop hangar, and a steel hangar. The necessity of removing the concrete foundations of the World War I buildings slowed construction. The Instructor training program began on February 1, 1941 with five St. Louis Steel Car Company PT-15s. The PT-15 is virtually indistinguishable from the PT-17 Stearman except by the trained eye. The Air Corps bought a total of 14 for evaluation purposes. On 15 March the school received its first 10 PT-17 Stearmans. Officially the 56th Army Air Forces Flying Training Detachment, the school's contract called for training classes of 50 students. The first class began ground school on March 22, 1941. Meanwhile, the Army Air Corps modified Graham's contract for the training of British Royal Air Force cadets. The first class of RAF students arrived from Canada on a train in early June. Local citizens warmly greeted the Brits as they bused through Americus to the school. Maintenance hangar at Souther Field, Georgia, 1943 Jack Currie, a young RAF cadet who soloed at Souther in early 1942, survived the war, and wrote a successful series of books about his experiences. One of his books, \\"Wings Over Georgia,\\" recounts in detail his training at SoutherCurrie, Jack. (1995). Wings Over Georgia. Crecy Publishing. p 59. With the United States entry into the war, the Defense Plant Corporation bought Graham's investment in Souther. An enlargement of the school facilities also got underway for the planned increase in training. Ultimately, the school occupied with three hangars. The cantonment area contained two two-story barracks, a recreational ball, an exchange, administration building, Link trainer building, ground school building, mess hall, cold storage plant and a hospital. The school had two auxiliary fields. The British cadets departed Souther in the fall of 1942 with the training of American cadets resuming on September 13, 1942. By the end of 1942, the number of PT-17s present had increased to 107. From January 1, 1943 to January 31, 1944, 2,073 students trained at Souther. The school reached its peak in the winter of 1943/44 with 600 cadets on board and over 450 civil employees that included over 100 flight instructors. Aircraft present reached its zenith with 122 PT-17s, four Fairchild PT-19s, and one BT-13 Valiant, used by the instructors and staff. When the last class graduated in October 1944, the school closed. In 1944 Souther Army Airfield became a site for German prisoners of war, who worked on the farms in the area. The army deactivated Souther Field at the end of World War II and deeded the land to Americus.

Biography Pedro de Melo served in many military roles in Spain before moving to South America in 1770. He was designated as governor when the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was created. He was member of the Real Audiencia and worked for the creation in 1794 of a Royal Counsel with viceroy Nicolás Antonio de Arredondo. He was designated viceroy after the resignation of Arredondo, on 16 March 1795. He kept the main policies of previous viceroys: improve the streets of Buenos Aires, or fortified defenses for Montevideo, but he had to face Portuguese incursions on the Banda Oriental. He created laws to deal with the shortage of bread, improved the viceroyal residence, and received ships from the Pacific Ocean. Pedro de Melo was interested in expanding the colonization towards the coastline of Patagonia, ordering Félix de Azara to design plans for that purpose. However, Pedro de Melo died before being able to futfill them. Pedro de Melo died on 15 April 1797, still being viceroy. The Real Audiencia took power for a brief period, to prevent a power vacuum in the meantime that the news arrived to Spain and a new viceroy was designated.

A career soldier, Whiteley was commissioned in 1915 into the Royal Engineers from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. During the First World War he served in Salonika and the Middle East. In May 1940, during the Second World War, he was posted to General Headquarters (GHQ) Middle East in Cairo as Brigadier, General Staff (BGS) (Operations) under General Sir Archibald Wavell. In March 1942 he became Chief of Staff of the Eighth Army, participating in the Battle of Gazala and the First Battle of El Alamein. In September 1942 Whiteley joined Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower's Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) as the British Deputy Chief of Staff. When Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord in January 1944, Whiteley was one of three key British staff officers Eisenhower brought to England to staff the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). Whiteley initially became Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence (G-2) at SHAEF before becoming deputy to the Assistant Chief of Staff, Operations (G-3), Major General Harold Bull in May 1944. After a few months in Germany as Assistant Chief of Staff in the Control Commission, Whiteley was appointed Army Instructor at the Imperial Defence College to initiate the post-war courses under General Sir William Slim as Commandant. In 1947 Whiteley was selected for an exchange of appointments with Canada, and became Commandant of the Royal Military College of Canada. He was DCIGS under Slim from 1949 until 1953, when he was promoted to full general, and took up his last appointment, as chairman of the British Joint Services Mission, Washington, D.C. and UK Representative on the NATO Standing Group from 1953 to 1956. Early life and interbellum John Francis Martin Whiteley was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned in 1915 in the Royal Engineers. During the First World War he served in Salonika and the Middle East. He was awarded the Military Cross, and a mention in despatches. Whiteley graduated from the Staff College, Camberley in 1928. Second World War Middle East When the Second World War began, Whiteley was serving in the War Office as a General Staff Officer, Grade 1 (GSO1). In May 1940 he was posted to General Headquarters (GHQ) Middle East in Cairo as Brigadier, General Staff (Operations) under General Sir Archibald Wavell. In February 1941, Whiteley conducted a series of meetings with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's emissary to Britain, William J. Donovan, who had been sent to the Middle East on a fact-finding mission. Following the passage of the United States Lend-Lease Act on 11 March 1941, Whiteley was sent to Washington, D.C. in May 1941 to present the President with Wavell's requirements. Whiteley's mission was fairly successful, and resulted in sixteen ships a month for the remainder of the year delivering supplies to the Middle East. Although not all of the requested items could be supplied, by the end of July store and equipment including nearly 10,000 trucks, 84 M3 Stuart tanks and 174 combat aircraft had arrived. Whiteley returned via London, where he briefed the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir John Dill and the prime minister, Winston Churchill, on his mission to the United States. Churchill expressed his displeasure with the progress of the Western Desert Campaign, which resulted in Wavell's replacement by General Sir Claude Auchinleck in July 1941. In October 1941 Whiteley became Auchinleck's envoy to London to brief the Prime Minister on the plans for Operation Crusader and the reasons why Auchinleck was resisting pressure to advance its date. During Operation Crusader, Auchinleck relieved the commander of the Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Alan Cunningham, replacing him with his Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS), Major General Neil Ritchie. Amid doubts about Ritchie's suitability for the post, Auchinleck and his new DCGS, Brigadier Eric Dorman-Smith, decided that Whiteley should become Chief of Staff of the Eighth Army. Whiteley assumed his new post on 28 March 1942. His time in the post saw British fortunes fall to their lowest ebb, with the disastrous Battle of Gazala and the fall of Tobruk. Auchinleck assumed personal command of the Eighth Army on 25 June, and Whiteley was superseded by Dorman-Smith to some extent. However, Whiteley remained in the job until after the First Battle of El Alamein, when he was replaced by Brigadier Freddie de Guingand. In Auchinleck's opinion, Whiteley had proved himself a disappointment as Chief of Staff of the Eighth Army, but still recommended him for promotion on the basis of his performance at GHQ. North West Europe Whiteley joined Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower's Allied Forces Headquarters as the British Deputy Chief of Staff, working with the American Deputy Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Alfred Gruenther, and the Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Walter Bedell Smith. As such, Whiteley, who was duly promoted to major general in February 1943, was involved in the planning and direction of the Tunisian Campaign and the Allied invasion of Sicily. In August 1943 he acted as an envoy once more, travelling to London to brief Churchill on plans for the Allied invasion of Italy. When Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord in January 1944, Whiteley was one of three key British staff officers he wanted to take with him to England to staff the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), the others being Kenneth Strong and Humfrey Gale. Eisenhower encountered resistance to this from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Alan Brooke, who agreed to transfer Whiteley and, reluctantly, Gale, but not Strong. Accordingly, Whiteley initially became Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence (G-2) at SHAEF, with American Brigadier General Thomas J. Betts as his deputy. However Eisenhower eventually had their way and Strong assumed the post on 25 May 1944. Whiteley then became deputy to the Assistant Chief of Staff, Operations (G-3), Major General Harold Bull. Whiteley remained in this post for the rest of the war. Whiteley remained on good terms with the staff at 21st Army Group, particularly de Guingand, who was now its chief of staff, although the relationship between the two headquarters was often stormy. In December, during the Battle of the Bulge, Whiteley and Betts visited the U.S. First Army headquarters and were unimpressed with the way that it was handling the situation. Strong, Whiteley and Betts then recommended that the American armies north of the Ardennes be transferred to Montgomery's command. Smith realized the military and political implications of this, and knew that such a recommendation had to come from an American officer. Smith's immediate reaction was to dismiss it out of hand, and tell Strong and Whiteley that they were fired and should pack their bags and return to the United Kingdom, but that night Smith had second thoughts. The next morning he apologized, and informed them that he would present their recommendation to Eisenhower as his own. Eisenhower immediately ordered it. This decision was greatly resented by many Americans. Post-war After a few months in Germany as Assistant Chief of Staff in the Control Commission, Whiteley was appointed Army Instructor at the Imperial Defence College to initiate the post-war courses under General Sir William Slim as Commandant. In 1947 Whiteley was selected for an exchange of appointments with Canada, and became Commandant of the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. His next appointment was as Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff at the War Office under Slim and he served in this post from 1949 until 1953. In 1953 Whiteley was promoted general and took up his last appointment as chairman of the British Joint Services Mission in Washington, D.C. and UK Representative on the NATO Standing Group. It fell to him as the representative of the British Chiefs of Staff to conduct the discussions on the introduction of tactical atomic weapons and the consequent adjustments to defence plans. In retirement, Whiteley and his wife settled in Wiltshire, at The Mill House, Steeple Langford. He died on 20 May 1970.

Gerbilling, also known as gerbil stuffing or gerbil shooting, Master G'ing, is a rumoured sexual practice of inserting small live animals (usually gerbils but also mice, hamsters, rats and various other rodents) into the human rectum to obtain stimulation. Some variations of reports suggest that the rodent be covered in a psychoactive substance such as cocaine prior to being inserted. Overview According to folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand, accounts of gerbilling were first recorded in 1984 and initially were said to involve a mouse and an unidentified man. In subsequent versions of the story, the animal was a gerbil and the story applied to several male celebrities. Rumors surrounding various male celebrities engaging in gerbilling have become persistent urban legends. As of the mid-1980s, there were no reports in peer- reviewed medical literature describing gerbilling among the variety of rectal foreign objects removed from people's bodies.Adams, Cecil (1986). \\"Is It True What they Say About Gerbils?\\" The Straight Dope, March 28, 1986. Mike Walker, a National Enquirer gossip columnist, spent months attempting to verify the gerbilling rumors about a celebrity. \\"I've never worked harder on a story in my life,\\" Walker told the Palm Beach Post in 1995. After much investigation, he was unable to find any evidence that a gerbilling incident ever happened: \\"I'm convinced that it's nothing more than an urban legend.\\" Dan Savage, a sex-advice columnist who frequently discusses unusual sexual practices, stated in 2013 that he has never received a first-hand or even a second-hand account of the practice. According to the editors of Snopes.com, gerbilling is an unverified and persistent urban legend.

Edwards (November 5, 1948 – May 28, 2009) was the director of bands for Prairie View A&M; University. Early life and education Edwards was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee on November 5, 1948 to George and Beulah Edwards. He was baptized at Second Missionary Baptist church by Rev Paul A. McDaniels and served faithfully until leaving to attend Florida A&M; University, (FAMU) Tallahassee, Florida. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in Music (1970) and he joined Kappa Kappa Psi band fraternity (1969), and Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. While at FAMU, he played as part of famed Marching 100, performing under the legendary Dr. William P. Foster, where he received a number of distinctive awards and opportunities; some of which were his selection as Student Arranger, the Outstanding Senior Award, and having his arrangements played by the Marching 100 at Super Bowl III. In the mid-1970s, he directed the jazz band at Kirkman Technical High School in his hometown of Chattanooga, where he frequently arranged popular pieces for his students. Mr. Edwards later received a Masters in Music Education from Michigan State University (1976). At Michigan, many of his marching band arrangements were performed and recorded by the Michigan State University Spartan Marching Band. From 1975-1978 he traveled with Lansing Community College Suitcase Theater as Musical Director, touring the Netherlands, Germany, Wales, Scotland, Denmark, Belgium, and Japan. On January 1, 2009, George Edwards led the \\"Storm\\" in the 120th Tournament of Roses Association Rose Parade in Pasadena, CA where they were the first Black College Band to perform in the Rose Bowl's Parade pilot program to include bands from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the parade each year. In 1980, the Grambling Marching Band was the first HBCU band invited to the Rose Bowl Parade and the first HBCU band to lead the parade. Prairie View A&M; University In 1978, Edwards came to Prairie View A&M; University as Assistant Director of Bands, and served in capacity of music arranger. In 1984, Edwards rose to the position of Head Director of the Prairie View A&M; University Marching Band and Jazz Band. Professor Edwards took the struggling marching band of 25 and helped them become a world-renowned, first-class composition of musical athletes. Under his leadership, the band acquired the nickname “The Marching Storm.” His technique and passion for the art of marching band was characterized by his quest for perfection, and the motto that the band came to live by was: “Make It Happen!” Through Professor Edwards direction, the Marching Storm became the first marching band to debut its drumline, known as the McFunk B.O.X., in a showstyle half-time event at the football games. Edwards incorporated some of the FAMU concepts of innovative formations and fast-stepping, while adding unique framing, drum routines, and their majorettes, the Black Foxes, to create a half-time show that provided the \\"Storm\\" with national recognition and their pick of the best of the best high school band members from across the nation. For 30 years Professor Edwards collaborated with friend and associate, Dr. Margaret Sherrod on music arranged especially for the jazz and precision high kick choreography of the “Black Foxes” majorette line that he always urged to live up to their reputation as a “Class Act.” Skyrocketing to national acclaim, the Storm performed, appeared, or were featured as part of the following activities: * 2001: Performed in President George W. Bush's Inaugural Parade in Washington, D.C. * 2004: The Marching Storm Band and the Black Foxes were featured in the Black College Band Exhibition, \\"And the Band Played On,\\" which was seen by more than 30,000 at the Dallas Museum of African-American History * 2004: The PVAMU Drum Line, \\"The Box\\" and the \\"Black Foxes,\\" were featured performers with Beyoncé at the Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving Day game * 2004–2007: Featured in the Dallas Weekly; Urban Sports News * 2004: Featured on numerous occasions in The Dallas Morning News * 2005: Featured in British Broadcasting New Radio Special, \\"Marching All Together\\" * 2005: Featured in The Times * 2006: The band performed at the Essence Music Festival in Houston * 2006: Invited to perform at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (a lifelong goal of Professor Edwards), but were unable to raise the $400,000 necessary for the trip to New York City * 2007: Featured article and video in The New York Times * 2008: \\"The Box\\" was flown to Los Angeles for a command performance for executives from Honda Corporation and The Tournament of Roses Parade * 2008: The Marching Storm Band and the Black Foxes performed at the Texas A&M; University-University of Miami football game at Kyle Field in College Station and received overwhelming accolades from ESPN television commentators * 2009: George Edwards led the \\"Storm\\" in the 120th Tournament of Roses Association Rose Parade in Pasadena, CA where they were the first Black College Band to perform in the Rose Bowl's Parade pilot program to include bands from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the parade each year Professor Edwards has received countless awards for his outstanding work in the field of music, the most remarkable being a Senate Resolution from the Texas State Legislative presented in Senate Chambers by Sponsors, State Senator, Rodney Ellis, and state Representative Garrett Coleman. Death He died following a car crash in Houston, Texas. Legacy Professor Edwards was an innovator who was dedicated, committed, and passionate about music and its performance. Professor Edwards spoke in a language that only band members understood; with words like: “Chop chop Chief” “What’s up Chief” “Drop down and give me twenty” “I know you don’t have a doo rag on your head” “Get on the Bus” “In the Hole Band…last time” “Chief, pull your pants up” “Do you see this knucklehead” He was demanding of his band members to ensure they achieved their maximum potential as performers, students, and as people; was a surrogate parent to many of his students; and will remain in history as one of the top college band directors.

Biography He began his career on New York City's WRKS 98.7 Kiss FM radio station in 1982. He was one of the first hip-hop artists to become established, which also includes Run-D.M.C., LL Cool J, Salt-n-Pepa, and Slick Rick. “Hip-hop was fun and energetic during this time. Hip-hop was just growing, so there was a lot of creativity and great live performances,” says Chuck. “Run-DMC and Whodini were some of the best live performances during this time”.The Source Magazine, November 2004, \\"Hip Hop Iconz Volume 9: Chuck Chillout Breaking The Ice,\\" pp. 78–80. After leaving Kiss FM in 1989, Chuck joined 107.5 WBLS FM in 1990 for two years. Chuck worked in 1995 by becoming one of the first DJs to play hip hop music in Japan. Hip-hop artists such as Busta Rhymes, A Tribe Called Quest, and Run-D.M.C. became known in Japan as a result. \\"Hip hop was very popular in Japan\\", said Chuck, \\"The people there knew the history of the artist I was playing as well as mine. Japanese people were totally into the culture\\". In 1989, he released an album with emcee Kool Chip called Masters of the Rhythm, which was released by Mercury/PolyGram Records. The album featured two regional hits, \\"Rhythm is the Master\\" and \\"I’m Large.\\" In 1996, Chuck helped DMX for his debut smash hit, \\"Get at Me, Dog\\". Chuck established Full Blast Promotions in 1999. \\"I established Full Blast Promotions in New Jersey because there was a need for a premier record pool in New Jersey,\\" Chuck stated. Chuck's affiliation with old- and new-school hip hop and R&B; has helped him remain a popular DJ. Most recently, his participation in the Essence Music Festival and cruise helped his career.

It embraced the limitations of the display technology that it was displayed on by only using horizontal and vertical strokes. This meant that some of the letters had little resemblance to the letters they were supposed to represent. New Alphabet was notably used on the cover of Joy Division's 1988 compilation album Substance. History New Alphabet was a personal, experimental project of Crouwel. The typeface was designed to embrace the limitations of the cathode ray tube technology used by early data display screens and phototypesetting equipment, and thus only contains horizontal and vertical strokes. Conventional typefaces can suffer under these limitations, because the level of detail is not high enough, restricting legibility. Crouwel wanted to adapt his design to work for the new technologies, instead of adapting the technologies to meet the design.Jan Middendorp, Dutch Type, 010 Publishers, Rotterdam (2004), p. 120. Since his letter shapes only contain horizontals and verticals, some of the glyphs are unconventional, while others bear virtually no resemblance to any version of the letters they represent (in some examples, the frequently appearing a glyph looks like a J, K looks like a t, numeral 1 resembles a 7, numeral 8 resembles capital H, and the x glyph looks like a capital I). Because of this, the typeface was received with mixed feelings by his peers. Most of the letters are based on a grid of 5 by 7 units, with 45-degree corners. Each glyph is represented by two or more sides of a square, with ascenders, descenders or tittles added where necessary. Glyphs with three horizontal bars (E, 3) are represented faithfully, while those with three vertical bars (M, W) are not, instead being represented by underlined N and V glyphs respectively. There is no differentiation between uppercase and lowercase glyphs. Many of Crouwel's peers were of the opinion that the design was too experimental and that it went too far. The typeface received a lot of newspaper coverage, which sparked a lively debate over typefaces as an art form, compared to their practicality in everyday use.Jan Middendorp, Dutch Type, 010 Publishers, Rotterdam (2004), p. 121. Crouwel largely agreed with the criticism and noted that it was mostly an exercise in theory, stating in 2009: \\"The New Alphabet was over-the-top and never meant to be really used. It was unreadable.\\" New Alphabet was one of 23 digital typefaces acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in January 2011 for its Architecture and Design Collection. This collection of typefaces were some of the first acquired by MoMA, and were on display in a 2011-2012 exhibition called Standard Deviations: Types and Families in Contemporary Design, or Standard Deviations. Usage New Alphabet was featured on the album cover for Joy Division's 1988 compilation album Substance, where the album title is spelled out with characters corresponding to \\"subst1mce\\". Brett Wickens, who contributed to the cover, claimed this was for aesthetic reasons. The 1991 album reissue featured different artwork, although in the same style: the word \\"substance\\" was not spelled out; rather, the artwork featured a large green \\"S\\" in the New Alphabet typeface. Digital New Alphabet New Alphabet was digitized in 1996 by Freda Sack and David Quay from The Foundry in London. It is part of the Architype 3 Crouwel Collection, and it consists of three weights. The original concept wasn't limited to three weights, but was intended as a parametric system, giving the possibly to make many different shapes by changing the parameters in the machine. In 2015, Joshua Koomen developed, based on the original instructions, a digital version of New Alphabet in the form of a web-app. The application enables the user to produce any possible setting for the New Alphabet.

In 1768, British officials alleged that Bostonians locked a customs official in the Libertys cabin while the cargo of Madeira wine was unloaded in an effort to evade the Townshend Acts. In retaliation, the British government confiscated Liberty, and it was towed away by HMS Halifax. Charges against Hancock were eventually dropped, but Liberty remained confiscated. The ship was refitted in Rhode Island to serve as a Royal Navy ship named HMS Liberty and then used to patrol off Rhode Island for customs violations. On 19 July 1769, the crew of Liberty under Captain William Reid accosted Joseph Packwood, a New London captain, and seized and towed two Connecticut ships into Newport. In retribution, Packwood and a mob of Rhode Islanders confronted Reid, then boarded, scuttled, and later burned the ship on the north end of Goat Island (although a small monument to the event, located in Equality Park on Broadway, states the sloop was dragged to the site of the park and burned there) in Newport harbor as one of the first overt American acts of defiance against the British government.Ships of the World Series, Vol. 799: Warships of the World to 1900, Lincoln P.

He was the first Assistant Commandant of the Central Flying School in the years before the war. Early military career In 1892, Cook who was a captain, was appointed adjutent of the Cork Artillery (Southern Division) in Ireland. He continued at Cork until 1897. In 1901 Cook was attached to the Jubaland Force as an interpreter with responsibility for mapping and as an intelligence officer. He took part in the Ogaden Punitive Expedition of 1901. In September 1901 he was promoted to major. Ten years later, in December 1911, Cook was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Aviation Cook joined the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain on 14 December 1909. He was one of the first people in England to learn to fly, taking lessons in 1910 and gaining his Royal Aero Club aviator's certificate (number 42) at Beaulieu on 31 December 1910. Following the creation of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in May 1912, Cook was seconded from the Royal Artillery to the RFC's Central Flying School (CFS) as an instructor in theory and construction. After the Commandant, Captain Godfrey Paine RN, Cook was next most senior officer at the School and by August he was being described as the Assistant Commandant. While at the CFS, Cook was involved in teaching theory. In September 1912 he was awarded a Royal Aero Club Special Certificate for carrying out a series flights and aerial manoeuvres which were of special merit in the early years of aviation. In December 1912, Cook spent some time in India, visiting Agra where he made observations on the ability of birds to soar and theorized on the effect of sunlight on air.

Formed as Watford Rovers in 1881, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1886. In the same year, they also entered the county-wide Herts Senior Cup, reaching the final six times over the next ten years. Watford Rovers became West Hertfordshire in 1893, and joined the Southern League for the 1896-97 season. The team started to change from one entirely of amateurs, to one including paid professionals. In 1898, West Hertfordshire merged with Watford St Mary's to form Watford Football Club.Jones, Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who p. 9 The club participated in the Southern League from 1896 until 1920, experiencing considerable success. They won six league titles in this period, including the Southern League First Division in 1914-15.Jones, Watford Season by Season pp. 60-61 After the resumption of Southern League football following a four-year hiatus due to the First World War, Watford missed out on a second consecutive title in 1919-20 on goal average. They joined the Football League Third Division in the 1920-21 season, and following its subsequent reorganisation became founder members of the Third Division South in 1921.Phillips pp. 52-53 Watford remained in the Third Division South for the next 37 years, and experienced scarce success. Fred Pagnam finished as the Division's top scorer in 1922-23,Jones, Watford Season by Season p. 69 the club reached the final of the Third Division South Cup in 1935 and 1937 (winning on the latter occasion),Jones, Watford Season by Season pp. 92-98 and Len Dunderdale scored 21 goals for Watford in 1938-39 despite leaving midway through the season.Jones, Watford Season by Season p. 101 The team started to progress after the reorganisation of the Football League into four national divisions in 1958. They won promotion to the Third Division in 1960, the Second Division in 1969, and reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1970. However, the league progress was reversed with two relegations over the next five years, and in 1976-77 Watford were briefly bottom of the entire Football League. A turning point in the club's history came in the late 1970s. Singer, shareholder and lifelong Watford supporter Elton John became chairman in 1976, and appointed Graham Taylor as manager in 1977. The club achieved consecutive promotions between 1977 and 1979, and reached the First Division for the first time in their history in 1982.Phillips pp. 196-223 Furthermore, in 1982-83 Watford finished second in the First Division, and Luther Blissett was the division's top scorer with 27 goals. Consequently, Watford qualified for the UEFA Cup in 1983-84\\\\. They also reached their first FA Cup final, losing 2-0 to Everton at Wembley Stadium. Following Taylor's departure in 1987, Watford were relegated in 1988.Jones, Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who pp. 275-276 Watford remained in English football's second tier for eight seasons, until they were relegated in 1995-96. Taylor returned as manager in 1997, and for the second time in his career led Watford to consecutive promotions, although he was unable to prevent relegation from the Premier League in 1999-2000. In the 21st century Watford have reached two FA Cup semi-finals, one League Cup semi- final, and spent a further season in the Premier League after winning the 2006 Football League Championship play-off final under the management of Aidy Boothroyd. The birth of Watford Football Club The club was formed as Watford Rovers in 1881, when George Devereux de Vere Capell, Earl of Essex and owner of Cassiobury Park, gave a group of boys permission to use the grounds for football. However, the agreement stipulated that the team could not play organised competitive matches on the estate. Members of the group included Henry Grover, the man later recognised as the club's founder, and Charlie Peacock, who played for Hertfordshire, became involved with board meetings at the club, and became the proprietor of the Watford Observer, the local newspaper. Over the next five years the team participated exclusively in friendly matches against schools and local clubs.Phillips pp. 12-15 Matches played when the club was not entering competitions included the first recorded fixture against future rivals Luton Town; a 1-0 home win to Watford on 5 December 1885. In the 1886-87 season, Watford Rovers entered the FA Cup for the first time, although they were eliminated in their opening game. They have competed in at least one competition in every season since.Jones, Watford Season by Season pp. 7-13 From 1886 team participated in the Herts Senior Cup, a competition open to all clubs in Hertfordshire, winning it on four occasions. They also participated in the Hennessey Cup--open to clubs within a radius of Uxbridge--between 1888 and 1891.Jones, Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who p. 11 Rovers' first match against Watford St Mary's was a 7-4 home win on 17 January 1891. The teams met on eleven further occasions prior to their merge in 1898. In total, Rovers and their successors West Hertfordshire won six times, St Mary's four times, and the remaining two matches ended in draws.Jones, Watford Season by Season p. 217 Southern League Goalkeeper Skilly Williams played in every league game during Watford's 1914-15 season.West Hertfordshire joined the Southern Football League in 1896, and started to turn professional the following year. In 1898, they merged with Watford St Mary's to become Watford Football Club. That same year, the club moved on to a ground in Cassio Road. Pressure from the owner eventually forced the manager, Harry Kent, to look for a new permanent ground which he found in 1914 at Vicarage Road, the club's home today. However, they remained at Cassio Road for a further eight years.Notes from a lecture on the club's history given by Edmund Coan, former club press officer, to the Kings Langley Historical Society on 21 January 2009. Reported in the Hemel Gazette 25 February 2009. Watford won the Southern League title in 1914-15, and missed out on retaining their title in 1919-20 on goal average. Along with the rest of the division, Watford left the Southern League in 1920, becoming founder members of the Football League Third Division. In the early years the club was sponsored by Ralph Thorpe, chairman of Wells Brewery and Benskins brewery sponsored the purchase of Vicarage Road earning the team the nickname of \\"The Brewers\\". Another early nickname was \\"the Wasps\\" because of their shirts which bore coloured hoops. The Third Division South years The East Stand formed part of the original stadium when it opened in 1922, but it closed in 2008. The structure stood until 2013 when it was demolished to make way for the new East Stand (called the 'Watford F.C. Community Stand).From 1921–22, the third tier of the Football League consisted of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the Second Division and also battling to hold on to their hard-won league status. There was a re-election system in place which meant the bottom two teams in each of the two divisions had to apply for re-election in favour of the champions of the Northern League and Southern League. Watford moved into Vicarage Road stadium in 1922. They remained in the Third Division South for a further 36 years, and when the league was restructured into four national divisions for the 1958–59, Watford were placed in the new Fourth Division. Up until 1960 the team was known as \\"The Blues\\". After a change of colours to gold shirts & black shorts, the team's nickname was changed to The Hornets, after a popular vote via the supporters club. Progression from and return to the bottom division Watford spent two seasons in the Fourth Division before they gained promotion to the Third Division in 1959-60\\\\. Ron Burgess, the former Tottenham Hotspur player was manager during the promotion season, which was largely attributed to Cliff Holton's 48 goals. Holton was sold to Northampton Town the following year after another 34 goals, which caused enormous unrest among supporters. Burgess sold other players to keep the club afloat, such as Dave Underwood to Fulham. Bill McGarry was Ron Burgess' successor, and brought in new players such as Charlie Livesey (25 goals in one season), Ron Saunders (later to manage several top division sides) and Jimmy McAnearney. An Irish schoolboy named Pat Jennings was signed from Newry Town. After making a large impact in the first team, he was transferred after less than one season to Spurs, again to keep the club afloat. McGarry was succeeded after moving to Ipswich Town by Ken Furphy from Workington Town, in 1964, as player manager. Furphy rebuilt the team originally around the young talent of Dennis Bond in midfield and Keith Eddy in midfield and defence. The team held Liverpool to a draw in the FA Cup, and narrowly missed out on promotion in 1966-67, finishing third. However, Bond was soon sold. Furphy's re-building came to fruition in 1969 with the signing from non-league Pelton Fell F.C. of Barry Endean, who kicked off an unbeaten run after Christmas to help Watford secure the league title in the April home match against Plymouth Argyle. A year later they reached the FA Cup semi-final for the first time, beating First Division teams Stoke City and Liverpool, which prompted hopes that the club could soon be playing First Division football. But they struggled to compete in the higher division, and Ken Furphy was poached by Blackburn Rovers, to be succeeded by George Kirby. Hampered by a lack of funds and the need to sell players to survive (Scullion, Garbett and Franks all joined Sheffield United), Watford fell back into the Third Division in 1972. Watford failed to make an impact in the Third Division, and in 1975 were relegated to the Fourth Division. However, they were adopted by their most famous fan, superstar singer Elton John, in 1973 first as president and from 1976 as chairman. He had a declared ambition to take Watford into the First Division. The first Graham Taylor era When 32-year-old Graham Taylor was named as Watford's new manager at the start of the 1977–78 season, the club had just been purchased by world-famous pop star Elton John (a lifelong fan of the club) and were an unremarkable Fourth Division side.Graham Taylor profile BBC In 1977 the greyhound track that encircled the pitch was removed as it was seen to lower the club's professional reputation by the manager Graham Taylor. Thanks to the efforts of chairman, manager and playing staff, Watford began to progress through the leagues. Elton John has been associated with the club since the 1970s.The first promotion was achieved in 1978, when The Hornets sealed the Fourth Division title by an 11-point margin over their nearest rivals Southend United. Also going up that year were Swansea City, who would enjoy a similar rise through the league (though unlike Watford a similarly quick fall). The 11-point margin that Watford achieved that season was particularly impressive considering that the Football League still only awarded 2 points for a win at the time. A second successive promotion followed, as Watford finished runners- up in the Third Division behind Shrewsbury Town, with Swansea also being promoted again by finishing third. The first season back in the Second Division was tough, as Watford narrowly avoided relegation by finishing 18th. They progressed to a new high of ninth place in 1981, before reaching the First Division for the first time in 1982 as Second Division runners-up. Players in this side included Wilf Rostron, Roger Joslyn, Les Taylor and the club's first ever overseas player Jan Lohman. Players like John Barnes, Ross Jenkins and Luther Blissett were some of the most respected players in the English game during the 1980s. Any doubts that Graham Taylor's team were good enough to stay in the First Division were soon confounded as they achieved comfortable wins over big clubs Everton, West Bromwich Albion and Southampton during the opening weeks of the season, finishing September with an 8–0 demolition of Sunderland. The September win over Albion briefly saw them top the league, and although they soon lost their grip on top spot they were still putting considerable pressure on leaders Liverpool as 1983 dawned. They ended their first top division campaign in fine form, sealing runners-up spot behind Liverpool (champions by an 11-point margin) and defeating the champions 2–1 at Vicarage Road on the final day of the season. There was no title challenge in 1983–84, and the UEFA Cup adventure - the first time the club had experienced European football - lasted to the third round where they were defeated by Sparta Prague of Czechoslovakia after eliminating Kaiserslautern of West Germany and Levski Sofia of Bulgaria. Indeed, much of Watford's season was spent battling relegation before good form in the second half of the season saw them achieved a secure 11th-place finish, thanks largely to the arrival of 20-year-old Scottish striker Mo Johnston who scored 20 goals in 29 league games after his arrival in November. That season, Watford made the headlines once again by reaching the FA Cup final for the very first time in their history. They were paired with an Everton side in what was dubbed 'the friendly final' who won the trophy with a 2–0 scoreline. Watford performed erratically during 1984–85, achieving impressive victories over big clubs including Manchester United, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur as well as holding Liverpool to a 1–1 draw on New Year's Day, but they also suffered some defeats in crucial games which restricted them to an 11th-place finish. They reached the last 16 in both of the domestic cups. 1985–86 began with a heavy 4–0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, but was followed with comprehensive wins over Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion, the teams who occupied the bottom two places in the league at the season's end and finished well short of survival. The generally good form continued throughout the autumn and although it was soon clear that Watford were not going to be a threat in the title race (being dominated by Manchester United until they slipped up and the title was eventually won by Liverpool) they were never in any real danger of relegation. A top five finish seemed a realistic target for some time, although there would be less incentive for this target to be achieved due to English clubs being banned from European competitions as a result of the Heysel disaster on 29 May 1985, in which rioting by Liverpool fans in the European Cup final in Brussels resulted in the deaths of 39 spectators. Watford's best chance of success that season came in the FA Cup, where they progressed to the quarter-finals and were paired with Liverpool, holding them to a goalless draw at Anfield on 11 March 1986. There were high hopes that Watford could triumph in the replay at Vicarage Road six days later, but the Merseysiders won the replay 2–1 in extra time and went on to win the double. Watford eventually finished 12th in the final table and ended the season on a high note by demolishing sixth placed Chelsea 5–1 at Stamford Bridge. 1986–87 was Graham Taylor's final season as manager of Watford before he accepted an offer to take charge of Aston Villa. They fared slightly better in the league than they had in the previous three campaigns, finishing ninth, but enjoyed their best cup run since 1984 by reaching the FA Cup semi-finals where they were eliminated by Tottenham Hotspur in a 4–1 rout at Villa Park. They exacted some revenge on the North Londoners on the final day of the season by defeating them 1–0 at Vicarage Road. Taylor's successor as manager was Dave Bassett, whose Wimbledon club had achieved an even quicker rise to the First Division from the Fourth than the one enjoyed by Watford (three promotions in four seasons) and had just ended their first top flight season in style with a sixth-place finish. However, his task to carry on the good work at Watford was complicated by the fact that established England international John Barnes left the club before the start of the 1987-88 season. The 23-year-old winger moved to Liverpool for £900,000 (then a record Watford sale) on 19 June 1987. Return to the lower leagues After Graham Taylor left, Dave Bassett was placed in charge. The Hornets suffered a terrible start to the 1987–88 season, and Dave Bassett was let go after a short stint of only eight months. Watford were relegated from the First Division at the end of that season. The next season, 1988–89, Watford failed to return to the First Division after they lost Second Division playoffs. Over the next few seasons, Watford never seriously challenged for promotion. Their highest finish was a Craig Ramage-inspired seventh in Division One at the end of the 1994–95 season, but they were relegated the following year. The club did win the FA Youth Cup in the 1988–89 season, beating Man City 2–1 after extra time; David James was in goal for the Hornets. The second Graham Taylor era Graham Taylor returned to Watford as Director of Football in February 1996, with former player Kenny Jackett as head coach, but was unable to stop the club from sliding into Division Two. After a mid-table finish in Division Two at the end of 1996–97, Jackett was demoted to the position of assistant manager and Taylor returned his old role as manager. The transition proved a success; Watford secured the Division Two championship in 1997–98, beating Bristol City into second place after a season-long struggle. A second successive promotion followed in 1998–99, thanks to a playoff final victory over Bolton which secured the club's promotion to the Premiership. The Premiership season started brightly with an early surprising victory over Liverpool, but soon faded away, and Watford were relegated after finishing bottom. Graham Taylor retired at the end of the 2000–01 season (although just months later he returned to football management at Aston Villa), and was replaced in a surprise move by Gianluca Vialli,Vialli unveiled as new Watford manager Telegraph who had recently been sacked by Chelsea F.C.Vialli sacked by Chelsea Telegraph Watford in the 21st century Rookery Stand, 2007 Taylor was replaced by Gianluca Vialli. Vialli made several high-profile signings, and wage bills at the club soared, with Vialli himself earning almost a million pounds a year.

An unexpected run to the FA Cup semi-final, where Watford lost to Premiership Southampton,Watford 1–2 Southampton BBC 3CR also generated vital cash.BBC: Hornets eye stadium repurchase The ongoing financial difficulties saw a large number of players released that summer, including record signing Allan Nielsen and strikers Tommy Smith and Gifton Noel-Williams. To make matters worse, Manchester United loanee Davis was killed in a car-crash on the opening day of the new campaign. This had a huge effect on the team's form at the beginning of the season, and notably on his close friend Danny Webber. But a strong finish to the season saw the club finish in mid-table. The 2004–05 season saw a continuation of the good form of the end of the previous season, with the club well in the upper half of the Championship at the end of September. However, a long run of poor form subsequently saw the club drop steadily towards the relegation zone. Another good cup run further eased the club's financial position, with the team reaching the semi-final of the League Cup, soundly beating Premiership sides Portsmouth and Southampton on the way, before losing narrowly to Liverpool. The club's poor league form, however, came to a head in March, with a run of terrible performances and Lewington was sacked on the 22nd. His sacking was controversial, and many fans were unhappy at the loss of a man who had led the club to two cup semi finals in three seasons, enduring considerable financial hardships. At the age of 34, Aidy Boothroyd was appointed manager of Watford after serving at Leeds United as a coach; 70-year-old Keith Burkinshaw was recruited as his assistant. Boothroyd's inexperience raised concerns among fans, who worried that he would not be able to keep the side in the Championship. However, Watford secured enough points to ensure survival with two games to go in the season. For the next season Boothroyd signed strikers Darius Henderson and Marlon King (initially on a season-long loan), central defenders Clarke Carlisle and Malky Mackay, midfielder Matthew Spring and goalkeeper Ben Foster (also on a season-long loan). Carlisle, King and Spring had both worked with Boothroyd at Leeds United the previous season. Boothroyd's first full season produced one of the stories of the footballing season. Against all odds Watford generally sustained 3rd position all year with Marlon King top scoring in the division and players such as Ashley Young and Ben Foster flourishing. Indeed, a draw at home against Luton Town on 9 April secured Watford a play-off spot. Championship Play-off final 2006.

Watford then beat Leeds 3–0 in the final to gain promotion to the Premier League and an estimated £41m as a result (all 13,000 available season tickets were quickly sold out). Watford had to wait until 4 November 2006 to record their first league win of the 2006-07 season, against Middlesbrough. This was despite continuing good performances by Ashley Young, who was sold to Aston Villa in January for a fee rising to £9.65 million, a record transfer fee for the club.History of Watford FC - Club Records watfordfc.comBBC: Young completes £9.65m Villa move Despite making eight new signings, Watford only recorded five wins in the Premiership, and sat at the bottom of the league table.

During this good run of form, Adam Johnson was subsequently brought back to Middlesbrough and in November and December they had a poor run of form, particularly at home, which led to their closest competitor, West Brom, overtaking them in early January. Watford assured themselves a play-off place on the final day of the season after a draw at Blackpool. In the play-offs, Watford's wretched form continued with Hull City winning 2–0 at Vicarage Road and despite Watford taking the lead at the KC Stadium, Hull ran out 4–1 winners (6–1 on aggregate) to condemn Watford to another season in the Championship.

Education He received his B. S. in Microbiology from Auburn University and a M.A. in Philosophy from University of Texas at Austin. Career In early 2005 Lusk came to pastor Reformed Heritage Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama, from Auburn Avenue Presbyterian Church in Monroe, Louisiana. Peter Leithart, a Cambridge-educated theologian was a former pastor of the church. Yet Lusk's transition affected the Church's denomination, name, and liturgy. The church moved out of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) and into the Confederation of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC) in October 2005 (see Douglas Wilson; Peter Leithart)., since the Evangel Presbytery would not accept Lusk's transfer from the Louisiana Presbytery based on the \\"status and nature of covenant children [which] was the real focus of the discussion\\". One elder from the church spoke to the examining body and: \\" pointed out that these doctrines were not new or strange for the congregation even if they were unique in the presbytery; indeed, they had been believed and taught for quite some time at Reformed Heritage (going back to Peter Leithart’s tenure as pastor in the late 1980s and early 1990s, if not before). It was also pointed out that this was a transfer exam, not an ordination exam, and all [Lusk's] positions had been acceptable in Louisiana presbytery. Catholicity and intra- denominational brotherhood demanded they receive [Lusk].\\" The Evangel Presbytery declined the transfer. The elders from the church asked for a formal reason for the decision but this request was denied them. Lusk states: \\"I think the Evangel committee’s decision against recommending me was borne out of a lack of confidence to play the part of judge in the so-called “Auburn Avenue” or “Federal Vision” controversy.\\" He went on to state, however: \\"I regarded, and continue to regard, all the men who served on Evangel’s committee as exemplary Christian men. They are faithful pastors and servants in Christ’s kingdom. Our disagreement over covenant children does not outweigh the many truths we hold in common.\\" After Lusk's arrival the church session voted to change its name to Trinity Presbyterian Church.

Early life Murtala Hamman-Yero Nyako was born at Mayo-Belwa, Adamawa State on 27 August 1943. His father, Alhaji Hamman-Yero, was a notable merchant and produce buying agent, whose mercantile activities was directly responsible for the establishment of John Holts and Sons Ltd centre at Mayo-Belwa. His mother, Hajiya Maryam Daso, was a housewife who was keen on Islamic studies and herbal medicine. He started his western education at Mayo-Belwa Elementary School in January 1952, proceeded to Yola Middle School in January 1955 and commenced his secondary school education in the same school in January 1958. He was noted whilst there for his academic achievements and sporting prowess. Naval Career Service Nyako joined the Royal Nigerian Navy in June 1963 as an officer cadet, commenced his officer training at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, England in September 1963, was commissioned as a Sub-Lieutenant in September 1965 and completed his initial naval training in September 1965. Nyako returned to Nigeria in October 1966 to serve in the Nigerian Navy until September 1993. During that period, he held a number of on-board and shore appointments. He was at one time a Commanding Officer of a Patrol craft, a Landing craft and the first missile carrying ship of the Nigerian Navy. In February 1976, General Murtala Muhammad appointed Nyako governor of the newly formed Niger State, which had been split out from Sokoto State. He served in this post until December 1977. Later he became the Chief of Naval Operations at the Naval Headquarters, the Flag Officer Commanding the Western Naval Command and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Training Command from where he was appointed the Chief of Naval Staff in January 1990. Two years later, he was appointed the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff and retired from the Service in September 1993 with the rank of Vice Admiral. Post Naval Career and Agricultural Activities Nyako was born a cattle owner as his mother had been allocated some cows for her offspring before he was born. He was, therefore, most involved with cattle rearing and later general agricultural development while he was in the Naval Service. The main issue as he understood it was improving substantially the productivity of Nigeria's agricultural units and the quality of their products. He commenced a sustainable cross-breeding programme of his local cattle with exotic superior sires in 1990 with very satisfactory results. He also got involved in the production of horticultural crops, and his first commercial export of musk melons to Europe using chartered aircraft took place in January 1990. Exotic mangoes from his mango orchard of 50,000 trees were first exported to Europe in 1993. He is also presently involved in the modern production of dates, passionfruit, banana, pasture development, breeding of goats and fish farming. Nyako is the President of the Horticultural Crops Growers Association of Nigeria, the Practicing Farmers Association of Nigeria and the Apex Farmers Association of Nigeria. He is a patron of numerous farmers' commodity associations in the country. Admiral is a successful integrated farmer of international repute. He is sole owner of one of the largest dairy farm in the country, Sebore (EPZ) Farms. In addition, Nyako owns the largest mango farm in the country leading to him being known as Baba Mai Mangoro (BMM). Political career and controversy Nyako entered politics in 2006. He was elected Governor of Adamawa State in April 2007. In February 2008 the Election Petition Appeal Tribunal annulled his election, alleging electoral malpractices. The House Speaker James Barka was sworn in as Acting Governor on 26 February 2008. A fresh election was run, and Nyako was reelected with a landslide victory taking all 21 Local Government Areas, resuming office on 29 April 2008. Soon after, the House initiated moves to impeach Nyako, but was dissuaded after the personal intervention of President Umaru Yar'Adua. The relationship improved, and in March 2010 the Adamawa State House of Assembly passed a vote of confidence in Governor Nyako, describing him as a \\"messiah\\" to the people of the state. In 2012 after the Governor's first tenure, he ran for a second term and was once again re-elected. On July 15, 2014, the governor was impeached as the state House of Assembly deliberated on the report of an investigative panel that probed allegations of financial misconduct against him. The report found the governor guilty of all the 16 allegations of gross misconduct leveled against him by the House. On 11 February 2016 the Federal Court of Appeal declared the impeachment null and void and ordered that all his entitlements accrued from the date of impeachment be paid to him. The judgment was upheld on 16 December 2016 by the Supreme Court of Nigeria but declined to reinstate him.  Accolades Nyako has been a recipient of an honorary Doctorate Degree of Agriculture from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta; University of Technology Minna, (2008); University of Technology, Yola (2009) and the National Awards of Commander of Federal Republic (CFR) in 1993, Grand Commander of the Niger (GCON) in 1999 and another Commander of the Federal Republic (CFR) in 2002.

On the afternoon of 27 July, with pilot Second Lieutenant G. T. Burkett, Lewis destroyed two more Albatros D.Vs over Menen, but was severely wounded by an incendiary bullet. His leg was later amputated. On 26 September 1917 Lewis was awarded the Military Cross as a result of this action. His citation, published on 10 January 1918, read: :Temporary 2nd Lieutenant Thomas Archibald Mitford Stuart Lewis, General List and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Whilst acting as Observer his patrol engaged a superior force of enemy scouts. His Pilot was wounded, but they continued to fight, destroying one enemy machine. He was then severely wounded, but continued to work his gun lying on his back. By this means they were able to destroy a second enemy machine. Afterwards, when returning to our lines with their machine badly damaged, he and his Pilot drove off two machines which were pursuing them, having displayed the greatest gallantry and presence of mind.\\" Lewis was promoted to lieutenant on 5 February 1918, but ceased to be an observer on 30 May, serving as an administrative officer. He was reassigned as a lieutenant (grade B) in the RAF's Technical Branch on 3 February 1919. Later life Lewis retained his interest in aviation post-war being one of the founders of the Cinque Ports Flying Club, based at Lympne Aerodrome, Kent, in 1928. He returned to military service during World War II, being commissioned as a probationary acting pilot officer \\"for the duration of hostilities\\" in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve's Training Branch on 2 February 1941, until resigning his commission on 24 April 1942.

Early life and education Gail Bird Gail Bird was born in 1949 at Oakland, California. Her father, Tony Bird, was from Santo Domingo Pueblo and her mother, Andrea, was from Laguna Pueblo. Tony worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad and her mother worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs Inter-Mountain Indian School in Brigham City, Utah. She and Yazzie Johnson had known each other since childhood. After high school, Bird studied at University of California Berkeley and the University of Colorado at Boulder. Yazzie Johnson Yazzie Johnson was born in 1946 in Winslow, Arizona. His father, Matthew Johnson, was from Leupp, Arizona and his mother, Marilyn, was from Sanostee, New Mexico, both from the Navajo Nation. Both his parents worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs Inter-Mountain Indian School in Brigham City, Utah where he met Gail Bird at age fourteen. He was influenced at an early age by one of the teachers at the School, Dooley D. Shorty, who was a silversmith (and had been a Navajo Code Talker in World War II). Johnson enlisted in the U. S. Army in 1966 and served in Germany and Vietnam. He studied at University of California Berkeley and the University of Colorado at Boulder.  History  They have known each other since they were children and have collaborated in designing and fabricating jewelry since 1972. Bird and Johnson use non- traditional stones, often resembling landscapes and uncommon juxtapositions of materials like pearls, opals and dinosaur bone. To many, they are best known for the thematic belts they make each year (since 1979) for the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA) Santa Fe Indian Market,SWAIA Official Website but they also design elegant earrings, bracelets, rings and necklaces which are shown in galleries and museums across the country. In 1981 they won Best of Show for such a belt at the Santa Fe Indian Marked. They are part of a generation of American Indian artists from the Southwest who have acknowledged and honored the traditions of their respective areas while pushing the creative boundaries and addressing contemporary concerns. Their work is characterized by an extensive knowledge of materials and by their technical skill and keen design sense… Bird and Johnson emphasize, “We see our jewelry as being very traditional in nature. But we carry the traditions further. The stones we use are of a wider variety than those usually associated with Indian jewelry. The symbols and narrative on our pieces are expansions of traditional symbols and stories.” Art dealer Martha Struever, who held the first gallery show for Bird and Johnson in Chicago in 1978, describes their work, “The jewelry they produce is distinct from the work of other American Indian jewelers. Their pieces are frequently dramatic and always wearable. By seeking out stones of unusual color and surface pattern or pearls of various shapes and hues, then juxtaposing them in original compositions, they have created a unique style. After years of visiting prehistoric pictograph and petroglyph sites, Gail and Yazzie realized that these ancient peoples had developed a distinctive set of designs, from which they have drawn much inspiration. Over their career of more than three decades, Gail and Yazzie have developed a body of work that is both distinctly their own and continuously evolving.” In 1981, Bird and Johnson won Best of Show at the Santa Fe Indian Market. More recently, they have become famous for their necklaces which often carry designs on the reverse side of bezel-set stones which reflect symbols that are personalized to the intended wearer. They use an overlay technique, which they describe as \\"underlay\\", that was inspired by Charles Loloma's stone inlay designs on the interior sides of rings and bracelets. The couple live and work in northern New Mexico. The jewelry works of Bird and Johnson are included in the permanent collections of several museums, including the British Museum, the Museum of Arts and Design, the National Museum of Scotland and the Smithsonian Institution. In 2007 the book “Shared Images: The Innovative Jewelry of Yazzie Johnson and Gail Bird” was written about Johnson and Bird’s jewelry work.

The temple built in the 14th century, is situated in Dantewada, a town situated 80 km from Jagdalpur Tehsil, Chhattisgarh. Dantewada is named after the Goddess Danteshwari, the presiding deity of the earlier Kakatiya rulers. Traditionally she is the Kuldevi (family goddess) of Bastar state,History of the temle Dantewada district Official website.Danteshwari Temple Chhattisgarh State Tourism, Official website. The temple is as according legends, the spot where the Daanth or Tooth of Sati fell, during the episode when all the Shakti shrines were created in the Satya Yuga. Every year during Dusshera thousands of tribals from surrounding villages and jungles gather here to pay homage to the goddess, when her idol was taken out of that ancient Danteshwari temple and then taken around the city in an elaborate procession, now a popular tourist attraction part of the 'Bastar Dussehra' festival.Danteshwari TempleCelebration in tribal land The Hindu, Dec 14, 2003. There also a is tradition of lighting Jyoti Kalashas during Navaratris here. Overview Situated in Dantewada, south-west of Jagdalpur, at the confluence of the holy rivers Shankini and Dhankini, both the rivers have different colors, this six- hundred-year-old temple is one of the ancient heritage sites of India and is a representation of the religio-socio-cultural history of the Bastar region. Little is known about this shrine to much of India. The vast temple complex today is truly a standing monument to centuries of history and tradition. With its rich architectural and sculptural wealth and its vibrant festival traditions, Danteshwari Mai temple serves as the most important spiritual center for the people of this region. Legend Shiva carrying the corpse of Dakshayani It is believed that a tooth of Sati had fallen here and Danteshwari Shakti Peetha was established. According to the ancient legend, Goddess Sati committed self-immolation in the fire pit of yagna kund, due to an insult committed by her father Daksha towards her consort Lord Shiva during the Yagna. Raged by the death of Sati, Shiva destroyed the Yagna of Daksha and with the body of Sati in his hands started to do 'Taandav'. Lord Vishnu cut the dead body of Goddess Sati with his Sudarshan Chakra to free Lord Shiva from the grief caused by her death. Parts of the dead body of Goddess Sati were scattered to fifty-two different places, which were consecrated as Shakti Pithas. Architecture The Danteshwari temple was built in the 14th Century. The idol of Danteshwari Mai is chiseled out of black stone. The temple is divided into four parts such as Garbh Griha, Maha Mandap, Mukhya Mandap and Sabha Mandap. Garbha Griha and Maha Mandap were constructed with stone pieces. There is a Garuda Pillar in front of the entrance of the temple.

With Stalin against Tito: Cominformist splits in Yugoslav Communism p. 122.) was a Croatian and Yugoslav communist politician. A member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia until his dismissal, he served as the 4th Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia. Early life Andrija Hebrang was born in Bačevac (part of Gradina) to Andrija Hebrang and Cela Strasser. In World War I, he was stationed in Osijek, Zagreb, and finally the battlefields in Gorizia, Italy where he stayed until the end of the war. Not long afterward, in 1919, he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and became heavily involved in socialist political causes. Political involvement In 1923, Hebrang moved to Zagreb. He was arrested in 1924 for his involvement in protests for trade union rights.Vjesnik:Medijsko podgrijavanje mrznje By the late 1920s, Hebrang had risen to high ranks in the Communist Party and was several times arrested and jailed for his various activities. It was during this time that he became acquainted with Josip Broz Tito. In early 1928, along with several other communists, Hebrang was arrested for communist activities, and was sentenced in Belgrade to 12 years imprisonment and hard labor in Lepoglava and Sremska Mitrovica prisons. In March 1941, shortly after his release from prison, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia. In 1942, he was captured by the Ustaše in house of Ivan Srebrenjak and sent to Stara Gradiška concentration camp, where he was later exchanged along with his future wife, Olga, for several Ustasha officials.Tanner (1997), p. 164 He traveled to Bihać to attend the Anti- fascist Council of the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ). He also helped form the State Antifascist Council of the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH) and served as the vice-president. On 20 September 1943, ZAVNOH unilaterally issued a declaration that Istria, Rijeka, and Italian- occupied Dalmatia were part of Croatia without the prior approval of the national AVNOJ. which angered Yugoslav leader Tito. Andrija Hebrang holding a speech during the third session of ZAVNOH on 8 May 1944 At the third session of ZAVNOH, held on 8–9 May in Topusko several resolutions were adopted which further angered Broz. They included an openness to continue religious education in schools and overtures to a free press. In September 1944, the Executive Board of ZAVNOH established the Telegraphic Agency of Croatia (TAH). Broz immediately sent a telegram to Hebrang on 17 September: :Immediately stop with the work of this so-called telegraph agency - TAH. What does this even mean? You're sliding with full force into separatism. Don't you realize that even federal states have a single telegraph agency. Let your example be the Soviet Union if no other. The following day Broz also sent a telegram to Edvard Kardelj: :Urgently travel to Croatia. They're creating some unbelievable idiocy. First, ZAVNOH adopted a resolution according to which religious education is a mandatory subject in schools. Second, they've founded some telegraph agency - TAH. This all demonstrates that separatist tendencies are fairly strong and this is true of our comrades. With this there is no kidding, for we will have to undertake the sharpest measures. For all this I blame Andrija. Make inquiries and if Andrija is not of this opinion, we will have to immediately remove him from the post of secretary of the CC [Central Committee]. Later years and death Around the beginning of the Tito–Stalin Split in 1948, Hebrang was suspected of being Stalin's prime candidate for replacing Tito. Hebrang was thus blacklisted from the Yugoslav Communist Party and expelled. By March his phones were tapped, and in April he was placed under house arrest, relieved of all official duties. In May, he was accused of collaborating with the Ustashe and the Gestapo to sabotage Yugoslavia and spy for the Soviets after Tito broke with Joseph Stalin. Hebrang was arrested in Belgrade by UDBA agents and accused of numerous treasons, while his wife and small children were put under house arrest. He disappeared under suspicious circumstances. UDBA official Milorad Milatović, who was in charge of the Hebrang case, claimed in 1952 that Hebrang had committed suicide at Glavnjača prison in Belgrade on 11 June 1949, but his body was never recovered and no official death certificate was filed. In the late 1980s, several historians reported that Hebrang had been assassinated in his Belgrade prison cell for political reasons. Afterwards Hebrang family tomb at the Mirogoj Cemetery Not long after Hebrang's arrest, his wife Olga was sentenced to twelve years in prison, and his children were sent to live with his sister, Ilona, in Zagreb. His family changed their surname as the government blacklisted anyone with the surname Hebrang. In 1992, the government of the Republic of Croatia rehabilitated Hebrang as a \\"victim of communism\\". His sons Andrija and Branko were active in the efforts to rehabilitate their father and return his remains.Rehabilitiran Andrija Hebrang, arhiva.net.hr; 13 April 2009; accessed 25 April 2015.

He headed the Gannett newspaper chain from 1957 to 1973. Miller also served as the top official of the Associated Press from 1963 to 1977.Carolyn G. Hanneman, \\"Miller, Paul (1906-1991)\\" at Oklahoma Historical Society Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (retrieved March 9, 2015).Dennis Hevesi, \\"Paul Miller, 84, Former Chairman Of Gannett and the A.P., Is Dead\\", The New York Times, August 23, 1991. Biography Early years Paul Miller was born on September 28, 1906, in Diamond, Missouri, to the Rev. James Miller, an itinerant Protestant minister, and his devoted wife, Clara Miller née Ranne. Over the next thirteen years, the Millers added four daughters and a second son to their \\"brood\\", as Clara once affectionately referred to her children. Between the time Miller was born and the year of his high school graduation in 1925, the family moved no fewer than seven times to small towns in Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, a circumstance that seems not to have affected him then or later. One reason may be that despite his family’s peripatetic lifestyle, the Miller home, wherever it happened to be, seems always to have been a source of warmth, affection and traditional Christian values. Miller showed an early predisposition for writing. His first experiment in journalism occurred with the publication of Vol. I, August 1920, No. 1, of The Boy Sportsman. Miller pronounced it \\"The Official Organ of The Lone Scout Athletic Club,\\" and informed his readers that it would be \\"Published Monthly by Paul T. Miller, Quapaw, Okla.\\" The success – or not – of The Boy Sportsman is unknown as, for whatever reasons, Miller moved on the next year to publish The Boy Athlete: Every Boys Magazine, with his name on the cover as \\"Paul Miller, Editor, Quapaw, Oklahoma.\\" Again, its success, or failure, remains a mystery. Miller’s earliest experiences with newspapering prepared him well for greater journalistic responsibilities. At the age of fifteen, he won a national high school editorial writing contest, and as a senior secured top honors in a similar competition held by the University of Wisconsin. Also in his senior year, he served as the editor of the Pawhuska High School newspaper, The Wah-Sha-She (Osage for \\"the water people\\"), which under his direction earned national recognition by winning several interscholastic publication contests. In addition to his high-school editorship of The Wah-Sha-She, Miller also demonstrated abilities in sports, outside activities, and academics. He was captain of the Pawhuska Huskies football team as well as a Tulsa World selection for all-state tackle in 1924. He was twice captain of the school’s basketball squad as well as all-district center in the 1924 Tulsa basketball tournament. Miller worked periodically as both reporter and city editor for the Pawhuska Daily Journal-Capital – his first experience in the larger world of journalism, and one which provided him invaluable knowledge in newspapering. He graduated from high school in the spring of 1925 with strong enough academic credentials to qualify him for admittance to Oklahoma A&M; College at Stillwater, Oklahoma. In Miller's first semester, he ran for and won the election for president of the freshman class. In his sophomore year, he continued to gain experience as a newspaperman at the same time that lack of money threatened to force him to leave school and get a job. He had already served as assistant sports editor for The O’Collegian when he became its acting managing editor on February 1, 1927, and managing editor on March 29, 1927. Despite these promotions, however, he faced stiff competition from former sports editor Otis Wile in the campus-wide election for editor of the paper. Miller lost the election to Wile by 24 votes out of a total of 1744 votes cast, which was 30% percent higher than the total votes cast for any other elected position. His supporters had cautioned that if their candidate lost the election, Miller would be unable to stay in school – a prophecy fulfilled that nevertheless offered him other opportunities in newspapering. A short column in the May 29, 1927 edition of The Okemah Daily Leader advised its readers that \\"Paul Miller, present managing editor of The O’Collegian, will become editor of The Okemah Daily Leader at the conclusion of this term.\\" Miller remained on the staff of the Okemah Publishing Company for fifteen months, although he moved to Norman, Oklahoma to become a feature writer for the Oklahoma City Times. While losing the election for the relatively high-paying job of managing editor for the O’Collegian had forced him to leave Oklahoma A&M;, his new position with the Times made it possible for him to return to school at the University of Oklahoma. His decision to enroll there may also have been influenced by his parents’ move to Norman, where his father served as executive secretary of Oklahoma Christian Churches. In the late summer or early fall of 1928 the Okemah Daily Leader reported the loss of its \\"popular editor,\\" and noted that he had recently resigned, and was to leave Okemah for Norman where he would \\"enroll as a special student in the state university\\" [and] \\"serve as staff correspondent for the Daily Oklahoman and Times.\\" Miller attended school at the University of Oklahoma from the fall of 1928 to the spring of 1930, while at the same time pursuing his new duties as a correspondent both for the Daily Oklahoman and the Oklahoma City Times. During this time, he became the president of the University of Oklahoma chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, a professional journalism fraternity. The June 17, 1930 issue of the O’Collegian featured a column proclaiming Miller's return to Stillwater: \\"Enlargement of the department of information and service, created at Oklahoma A. and M. college last February by President Henry G. Bennett, has been announced, with Paul Miller added to the staff, effective June 15.\\" The paper went on to say that Miller \\"had wide training and experience in newspaper activities,\\" specifically, the Oklahoma City Times, Daily Oklahoman, Pawhuska Daily Journal-Capital, Guthrie Daily Leader, and Okemah Daily Leader and Weekly Ledger. Two years later, as head of the department, Miller's duties, according to the Oklahoma A&M; college yearbook, The Redskin, were to see \\"to it that the name of the college is constantly kept before the attention of the people of the state. His chief function is the supplying of news matter regarding the school for the state papers.\\" In addition to his staff duties with the department, Miller also wrote for The A. and M. College Magazine, and served on the staff of The Redskin. Associated Press Miller remained in Stillwater and attended Oklahoma A&M; until February 1932, then accepted an offer to work for the Associated Press at Columbus, Ohio. Earlier, while working for the Oklahoma City Times and the Daily Oklahoman in Norman, he had so impressed the A.P.'s bureau chief in Oklahoma City, Leon Durst, that he had written to his superiors: \\"Here is a man the AP should have.\\" From March 1, 1932, until the fall of 1933, Miller worked as a rewrite man and night filing editor for the Associated Press at its Columbus bureau. It was here that he acquired and first applied the knowledge that allowed him to excel as an \\"A.P. man.\\" This was also where he met and married Louise Johnson. Miller received his diploma from Oklahoma A&M; College in 1933. After less than a year of marriage, the Millers began to prepare for the first of many moves they would make throughout their years with the Associated Press. Officials at the A.P.'s New York City bureau had taken notice of Miller's work and requested his transfer to work at the cable desk there. He accepted the promotion, and served as that bureau's cable and general news editor from the fall of 1933 until February 1935. Other promotions occurred in rapid succession. In early 1935, Miller became night desk editor at the A.P.'s Kansas City bureau, a position he held until March 1936. On April 1, 1936, he became the A.P.'s bureau chief at Salt Lake City, Utah. Almost immediately, A.P. operations at Salt Lake City began to improve. He took charge of Associated Press news service and personnel for the entire state of Pennsylvania as chief of bureau with offices at Harrisburg in July 1937. That December, Miller's bureau moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he remained until April 1941 when the A.P.'s general manager, Kent Cooper, reassigned him to New York, initially as Cooper's executive assistant, and later as vice president and director of operations of Wide World Inc. In June 1942, Cooper elevated Miller to the top A.P. posting in the nation's capital, Chief of Bureau, Washington, D.C. Miller would become one of the most successful journalists of the twentieth century, eventually ascending to the presidencies of both the Associated Press and the Gannett Co., Inc. Nevertheless, the ultimate highlight of a long and storied career was always his wartime service in the capital of a nation then engulfed in global war. As he later recalled during an interview following his retirement in 1979: \\"But someone is always saying what do you think you enjoyed most. I really have enjoyed everything. But if you have to say what was the most exciting assignment or years, you certainly have to say Washington...\\" On 29 June 1942, one day after the Germans opened their second summer offensive of World War II in the Soviet Union, Miller wrote to Kent Cooper in New York: \\"I went to work here today. Sincerely yours.\\" The hard-driving bureau chief immediately set about familiarizing himself with his new surroundings. As he later remembered: \\"I'd never been in Washington previously, except for brief visits. I didn't know where anything was. I didn't know anybody. Impressions swirled around in my brain, grew brighter or dimmer, gave way to new and better ones...\\" His most vivid impressions were those he formed of the most influential people in wartime Washington, and which he documented \\"to bridge the gap between a day in June of 1942 and this wintry day in February of 1943 when I finally am getting around to keeping a diary\\". While Miller never did keep a diary, he did assemble files of confidential memoranda dutifully prepared from off-the- record meetings with many of the nation's top military and political leaders. Foremost among them were both wartime presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman; Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall; and Commander- in-Chief, U.S. Fleet (COMINCH)/Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ernest King. Other notable figures who provided Miller with confidential information included British Prime Minister Winston Churchill; Republican presidential nominee Wendell Willkie; Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox; Commander of the China-Burma-India (CBI) Theater General Joseph Stilwell; Chairman of the War Production Board Donald Nelson; former secretary of war and one of Roosevelt's personal overseas representatives, Major General Pat Hurley; U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman; Assistant Secretary of War John McCloy; Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area General Douglas MacArthur; Commander of the Far East Air Forces Lieutenant General George Kenney, and Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, Jr. Arranged chronologically for the three years from March, 1943 to March, 1946, the files contain information regarding both America's military strategy during the last two-and-a-half years of the war and its leaders' visions for the postwar world. Miller's memoranda reveal the thoughts and feelings of men who, despite having learned from long experience with the public to guard their remarks, expressed themselves freely in their off-the-record briefings to the select group of newspaper correspondents, of whom Miller was one. His memoranda also trace the gradual shift from military to political imperatives which surfaced during the final stages of the war. Several significant events marked Miller's Associated Press career in the two years prior to his move to the Gannett Co., Inc. In mid-1945, he directed the A.P.'s coverage of the United Nations Conference on International Organization (UNCIO) in San Francisco, California. Miller also accompanied the first round-the-world Pan American \\"Globester\\" flight in the fall of that year. In June 1947, he returned to his alma mater of Oklahoma A&M;, and delivered the commencement address. Although Miller left the A.P. the following August to join Gannett as executive assistant to the company's founder, Frank E. Gannett, his career with the Associated Press was far from over. In April 1950, he became the first former employee to win election to the A.P.'s board of directors. In 1952, he joined the A.P. Board of Directors' Executive Committee. In 1963, he ascended to the presidency of the Associated Press, and went on to win reelection annually for the next 14 years, although the A.P. changed his title to chairman in 1972. Miller resigned that post in 1977, but remained on the board of directors until 1978. Of his A.P. career, Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of the Associated Press at the time of Miller's death, wrote: \\"Paul Miller was not just AP's chairman. He was its champion, always challenging us to do better but never failing to hail a job well done. He had many interests and many successes but we always knew he loved the AP.\\" The Gannett Co., Inc. Soon after joining Gannett on August 1, 1947, Miller moved his family to the company’s headquarters at Rochester, New York, and soon rose to prominence in its civic affairs. His dedication to community involvement surfaced that year with his mayoral appointment as chairman of the committee responsible for construction of the Community War Memorial, and continued for more than twenty years. A gifted fund-raiser, Miller served the American Red Cross and Community Chest in that capacity for ten years beginning in 1949. By 1959, he had become a Thirty-second Degree Mason, a member of the Rochester Consistory, and a Shriner of the Damascus Temple. Two years later, he received a citation for \\"outstanding service to the cause of brotherhood\\" from the National Conference of Christians and Jews for his role as National Chairman of the Newspaper Brotherhood Week Press Committee. That same year, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed Miller to the Commission on the Celebration of the Centennial of the Morrill Land Grant Act; the following year he became its chairman. In 1964, the newly formed Rochester chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi, elected Miller president. The year after that he became President of the Lend-a-Hand Society, and in 1966 began a three-year appointment to the President’s Committee on Employment of the Handicapped. Miller rose swiftly at Gannett. In 1949, he succeeded Frank Gannett as editor and publisher of the Rochester, New York Times-Union, became the company’s vice-president, and joined its board of directors. On his first European trip as a Gannett executive, Miller represented the American Newspaper Publishers Association at the International Congress of Publishers and Editors at Amsterdam, the Netherlands. While overseas he met with newspapermen in London and Paris, then flew into Berlin on a coal-laden transport plane to report on the condition of that city in the aftermath of the Berlin Airlift. The following year, Miller accompanied a group of newspaper publishers, radio executives, and officials on an eight-day trip to Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina as guests of Pan American World Airways. In Argentina, he interviewed President Juan Perón and First Lady Eva Perón. Miller ended the year as the recipient of the National American Legion Citizenship Medal, the first of many such honors recognizing his community activism. Over the course of the next four years, Miller continued his steady rise at Gannett. In 1951, the Millers were guests of the British news agency, Reuters, for its centennial celebration in London. There he met with Anthony Eden, deputy leader of Britain’s Conservative Party. Afterward, Miller traveled to Paris to interview General Dwight D. Eisenhower concerning reports that he might be a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1952. On December 11, 1951, Miller became both publisher of the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle and executive vice president of Gannett. In 1953, he joined the board of directors of the Gannett Foundation, and received an appointment to the Harvard University committee for selecting candidates for Nieman Fellowships, an award given to mid-career journalists by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. The following year, Miller visited Guatemala in the wake of the anti-Communist counterrevolution, and later submitted a series of eyewitness accounts of conditions and prospects under the then-new government of U.S.-backed strongman, Carlos Castillo Armas. On May 19, 1955, Frank E. Gannett virtually confirmed Miller as his successor at Gannett by naming Miller \\"Operating Head in Fact\\" of the company. Miller’s workload increased considerably in 1956 as he embarked on another South American tour, this time to Venezuela, Panama, Guatemala, and Mexico. He joined the boards of directors of two companies, the board of trustees of a third, and became a member of the Advisory Board on the Pulitzer Prizes. He also received his first of many honorary degrees, this one an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Clarkson College of Technology at Potsdam, New York. In September, Miller embarked on his most ambitious overseas trip when he reported on the Second London Conference over the Suez Canal crisis. In London he met with British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden, who received him at 10 Downing Street. He then flew to Cairo to see for himself if the Egyptians were successfully managing the day-to-day operations of the Suez Canal. In his opinion, they were. Subsequently, he submitted his observations and conclusions in a pamphlet titled \\"Suez Canal Report.\\" Miller began 1957 by writing the first of his weekly editorial columns for the Saturday Times- Union, a practice he would continue with few interruptions until 1979. In April, Miller succeeded Frank Gannett as president and chief executive officer of Gannett. That same month, Miller became president of the Frank E. Gannett Newspaper Foundation – owner of 20% of the stock of the Gannett Co., Inc., – and of radio station WHEC and WHEC-TV. Miller attended the NATO Conference in Paris, France, in December to end the year. In April 1958 Miller joined the boards of directors of the Brand Names Foundation and the Automobile Club of Rochester. A month later, he succeeded to the chairmanship of the Advisory Board of the American Press Institute, and received a Kiwanis Public Service Award. Miller also reported from Israel, France, Switzerland, and Italy in October as a member of the Rochester delegation which first paid a goodwill visit to Rochester’s sister city, Rennes, France. The next May, Miller returned to his adopted home state, and addressed students at the University of Oklahoma on Journalism Day – one of hundreds of speeches he would deliver throughout the remainder of his tenure at Gannett. Recognition for his many contributions to journalism continued as Ursinus College of Collegeville, Pennsylvania, bestowed upon him its Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree in June 1959. The new decade began with Miller’s election to the presidency of the Rochester Convention and Publicity Bureau, and his receipt of the Lester P. Slade Award for \\"outstanding journalistic contributions\\" in January 1960. It continued the following month with his fact-finding visit to Havana, Cuba. The National Conference of Christians and Jews named Miller National Chairman of the Newspaper Brotherhood Week Committee in January 1961, an honor for which he received a citation in April for \\"outstanding service to the cause of brotherhood.\\" That same month Miller hosted the Inter-American Press Association Convention in New York City, and the Civic Committee of the People-to-People Program recognized him with an award for his efforts in establishing the \\"sister cities\\" relationship between Rochester and Rennes, France. In June, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed Miller to a commission observing the 100th anniversary of the Morrill Land-Grant Act; the next year, its members elected Miller chairman of the Temporary Commission on the Celebration of the Centennial of the Morrill Land-Grant Act. 1962 began with a luncheon invitation to the White House from President John F. Kennedy. In February, the National Conference of Christians and Jews renamed Miller chairman of the National Brotherhood Week Press Committee for another year. In June, he departed for a 23-day tour of Russia that featured an interview with the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Nikita S. Khrushchev. Miller completed the trip with a visit to Berlin in the company of his longtime friend, Walker Stone, then editor-in-chief of the Scripps-Howard Newspapers. Upon his return to the United States, Miller wrote and in October published an account of his trip titled \\"Russia: 1962\\". Following its successful publication, Miller delivered six addresses that year to audiences across the country, including serving as Master of Ceremonies at the Rochester Chamber of Commerce 75th anniversary dinner. Over the course of the following year, Miller experienced both \\"triumph and tragedy.\\" In one of his more triumphant moments as a journalist, he was elected president of the Associated Press in January 1963 – an office to which he would be re-elected annually until his resignation as chairman in 1977. Miller then took up where he left off the year before, and beginning in February spoke to numerous appreciative audiences eager to hear about his trip to the Soviet Union. One of his more remarkable addresses occurred on February 11, 1963, when he presented the Fourteenth Annual William Allen White Memorial Lecture entitled \\"Inside a Newspaper Group\\" at the University of Kansas at which time he received its William Allen White Award for journalism merit. Miller delivered his final speech of 1963 in Boca Raton, Florida, to the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association on November 18. President Kennedy died of his gunshot wounds in Dallas, Texas, four days later, and Miller was one of those who attended the funeral in St. Matthews Cathedral, Washington, D.C., on November 25. Shortly afterward, Miller found himself invited once again to a White House luncheon, this time as the guest of President Lyndon B. Johnson. American society changed radically throughout the 1960s, and Miller’s approach to journalism changed with it. In 1963, he conceived the idea of a series of articles to appear in Gannett newspapers that would explore the positive aspects of racial integration in selected communities. Miller’s reward was a Pulitzer Special Citation for Gannett – the first Pulitzer Prize ever awarded to a newspaper chain. And although he helped organize Rochester’s local opposition to militant agitator Saul D. Alinsky’s work in the wake of that city’s riots in the summer of 1964, Miller also visited Rochester’s inner city to speak with black leaders of FIGHT (Freedom, Independence [Integration], God, Honor, Today), a Rochester civil rights organization founded with Alinsky’s support in Rochester. Miller also received the Sigma Delta Chi Fellowship Award in August, and became the president of that organization’s Rochester chapter in September. Miller ended the year by becoming a director of the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair and with two trips to Mexico City. In October, he attended the Inter-American Press Association Convention there; and two months later he was present for the inauguration of President Gustav Diaz Ordaz. For Miller, 1965 was a year of varied activity. That January he attended President Johnson’s Inaugural Ball. Ten days later Miller was in London for the funeral of the Right Honorable Sir Winston Spencer Churchill, although he quickly returned to New York upon hearing of the death of his friend and mentor, former general manager of the Associated Press, Kent Cooper. Miller joined the Board of Trustees of the University of Rochester in February; and in April, Syracuse University presented him with its Distinguished Service to Journalism Award. In June, Miller and the Gannett newspapers received the Mass Media Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and Union College of Schenectady, New York, conferred upon Miller an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree, and made him honorary chancellor of the university. Later that August Miller was a guest of Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey at the Capitol. Miller traveled extensively that fall delivering numerous speeches to professional and civic organizations. In December, he gave the Sigma Delta Chi Foundation Lecture at the University of Michigan, and before the year was out found himself the new president of the Lend-a-Hand Society. Gannett’s fortunes continued to rise as Miller prepared to take the company public. On March 21, 1966, the first issue of TODAY hit newsstands, and its original format became an instant commercial success. The next month, the company purchased the ten weeklies of the Suburban Newspaper Group, headquartered at Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The first public offering of Gannett stock occurred on October 25, 1967 after an expansion program that had resulted in the company owning 53 newspapers in 16 states. Less than a year- and-a-half later Gannett landed on the New York Stock Exchange, and shortly thereafter Gannett stock split 3/2. Throughout the years from 1966 to 1969, Miller’s professional achievements matched his entrepreneurial successes. In May 1966, President Johnson appointed Miller for a three-year term to the President’s Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, and rewarded him the following January with another personal invitation to the White House. In October 1966, Miller attended his second Inter-American Press Association Convention, this time in Lima, Peru. His awards during this period included the Prophet-at-Sight Master Mason Award in 1966; the 1967 Distinguished Service to Journalism Award from the University of Missouri, and election to its journalism school’s Hall of Fame; and the 1968 Distinguished Service to Journalism Award from the Ohio Press Association. Miller received two Honorary Doctor of Laws degrees in 1968, the first from Westminster College, Salt Lake City, Utah, and the second from Niagara University, Niagara Falls, New York. In addition to his other executive responsibilities, four major corporate entities welcomed him to their boards of directors: Bausch & Lomb in 1966; the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Springs, New York, and the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria Corporation in 1968; and the Twentieth-Century Fox Film Corporation in 1969. Also that year, Miller delivered ten major addresses, and attended Sunday worship services at the invitation of President Richard M. Nixon in April, a luncheon for former President Johnson and Mrs. Johnson at the Cape Kennedy Hilton in July, and a White House dinner with other Associated Press executives in October. Miller became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gannett in May 1970 having passed the title of President and Chief Operating Officer to Allen H. Neuharth whom Miller had recruited from Knight (subsequently, Knight-Ridder) Newspapers in 1963 as general manager of the Times-Union and Democrat and Chronicle and key executive on special projects. Miller departed for a month-long trip later that summer to several major European cities including London, Prague, Bucharest, Budapest, Belgrade, Dubrovnik (with side trips to Sarajevo, Sveti Stefan, and Boka Koforsha), Rome, Barcelona, Palma, and Lisbon. And in recognition of Miller’s coverage of the United Nations Conference on International Organization in 1945, President Nixon named Miller to the President’s Commission for the Observance of the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations. Miller’s Pacific-area trip in the summer of 1971 netted him visits to Honolulu, Hawaii; Guam, Manila, the Philippines; Tokyo, Japan; Hong Kong, and Seoul, South Korea. The next two years marked the zenith of Miller’s careers at both Gannett and the Associated Press. In April 1972, Miller became Chairman of the Associated Press. Later that summer, he took a group of A.P. executives to China for three weeks to visit Canton, Chengchow, Beijing, Yenan, Sian, Nanking, Suchow, and Shanghai. Over the course of their stay they met first with the Premier of the People’s Republic of China, Chou En-lai, and later negotiated an agreement for regular news exchange between the Associated Press and the Chinese news agency, Hsinhua. It marked the first time in twenty-two years that an American news agency had a regular news channel with China. And just as he had after his trip to Russia ten years earlier, Miller wrote and spoke extensively about his experiences in China. In January 1973, he accompanied his longtime friend, U.S. Secretary of State William P. Rogers, to Paris for the signing of the Indochina peace treaty. Shortly after his return, Miller became Chairman of the Board of Gannett Co., Inc. at the same time that President Neuharth moved from chief operating officer to chief executive officer. Miller ended the year honored by New York magazine as one of the ten most influential men in the communications industry and by the Rochester Sales Executive Club as Distinguished Salesman of the Year, as an inductee into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, and with another tour of the Pacific. Miller continued to travel extensively and to accrue numerous honors and awards despite his diminished executive role at Gannett. In 1974, as Chairman of both Gannett and the Associated Press, he received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Transylvania University, at Lexington, Kentucky. Miller also delivered the commencement address that perfectly reflected his worldview: Not Cynicism but Hope. Miller returned to China the following year for a second visit, and upon his return U.S. News and World Report named him one of the five most influential newspaper executives in the United States. In March 1976, Oklahoma State University named its new journalism building the Paul Miller Journalism and Broadcasting Building. Two months later, Miller set off on yet another trip to the Pacific, this time traveling to Taiwan (Republic of China), Hong Kong, and Japan. Miller’s final working years signaled the end of an unmatched career in American journalism. His achievements had been the subject of articles in FINANCE-magazine, Time, Forbes, Wall Street Reports, The Wall Street Transcript, Business Week, and others. When in 1957 he succeeded Frank Gannett as president and chief executive officer of Gannett Co., Inc., the Gannett Group included 19 dailies and broadcasting stations in four states. By 1977, it embraced 77 daily newspapers and broadcast stations in 30 states, Guam, and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as interest in a Canadian newsprint company and Gannett-owned Louis Harris and Associates, Inc. Gannett daily newspaper circulation grew from 775,700 to 3,000,000. Gannett revenues grew from $46,000,000 in 1957 to $557,000,000-plus in 1977. On December 31, 1978, after 31 years with the company, Miller retired at age 73 as chairman of Gannett Co., Inc., although he continued to serve as a Gannett director and consultant. At that time he could claim membership in the Gridiron Club; the Metropolitan Club and the Burning Tree Club of Washington, D.C.; the Everglades Club of Palm Beach, and the Gulf Stream Club of Del Ray, Florida; the Augusta National Golf Club, Augusta, Georgia; and the Country Club, Oak Hill and Genesee Valley Club of Rochester, New York. The Millers also belonged to the Third Presbyterian Church, Rochester, New York. They continued to maintain their principal residence near Rochester, but following Miller’s retirement began to spend increasing amounts of time at their second home in Palm Beach, Florida. Later years Miller remained active throughout the ensuing years despite personal tragedy. A little over a year after his retirement he suffered a stroke at his Palm Beach home in January 1980 that limited movement on the right side of his body, and affected his speech. Calvin Mayne, a friend and colleague of Miller’s at the Times-Union, later wrote that it was \\"a great tragedy\\" that after Miller retired, he and his wife, Louise, \\"had so little time to enjoy . . . his retirement.\\" Miller’s successor as president and chief executive officer at Gannett, Al Neuharth, wrote about it in his autobiography: \\"The game of golf, which [Miller] loved so much, now provided him only memories. An unhappy termination of a brilliant career of a many-talented and multifaceted man.\\" Nevertheless, Miller received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 1981 from the School of Journalism, University of Missouri-Columbia, Missouri Center for Professional Journalism. The Millers donated Paul’s papers to the Edmon Low Library, Stillwater, Oklahoma in 1982; and that same year relocated permanently to Palm Beach, Florida, following the donation of their New York home to the Rochester Area Foundation. In 1986, the Gannett Foundation established a $1 million program in Miller’s name for reporting regional or local interest stories from the nation’s capital. Miller returned periodically throughout the 1980s to Oklahoma State University, and marked his final trip to the campus in 1988 with a visit to Old Central where he had worked as a public information officer in the 1930s On August 19, 1991, Miller checked into Good Samaritan Hospital, Palm Beach, Florida, stricken with pneumonia. He died of cardiac arrest two days later at the age of 84. A close friend of Paul’s, former U.S. senator Harry F. Byrd, Jr., later spoke at the memorial services held on August 28, 1991 at the Third Presbyterian Church in Rochester. And finally, a former friend and colleague of Miller’s from the Times-Union delivered the following eulogy: \\"A tall graceful, and handsome man, Miller had a manner so unassuming that it is sometimes difficult to understand that from the 1930s to the 1970s, he stood at the very heart of American journalism, quietly influencing it always to be more professional and more responsible. He clearly was one of the great journalists of his time.\\" References External links * Paul Miller Collection at the Oklahoma State University Library * Paul Miller Editorials at the Oklahoma State University Library Category:1906 births Category:1991 deaths Category:People from Newton County, Missouri Category:American media executives Category:American male journalists Category:Oklahoma State University alumni Category:People from Pawhuska, Oklahoma Category:Writers from Rochester, New York Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:Journalists from New York (state) Category:20th-century American male writers ","title":"Paul Miller (journalist)"},{"id":"24660731","text":"Zakaria Abahassine (born 23 July 1988) is a Finnish football player currently playing for JIPPO.Nousujunassa oli tilaa, hyppäsin mukaan: Zakaria Abahassine‚ jippo.fi, 8 May 2017 His father is Moroccan and his mother is Finnish.

The new constitution came into force in 2009 and replaced the Legislative Council with the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands. History Immediately following the United Kingdom's re- establishment of rule over the Falklands in 1833, the islands were under military law by Naval Administrators appointed by the Admiralty. In the early 1840s, colonists from the UK began to settle on the islands which led Lord Stanley, Secretary of State for the Colonies, to seek authorisation from Parliament to establish a legislative power on the Falklands. On 13 November 1845 Richard Moody, the first Governor of the Falkland Islands, formally inaugurated the Legislative Council in the newly founded town of Stanley. An Executive Council having been inaugurated on 2 April 1845. Suffrage was limited, with much of the membership of the Legislative Council being appointed by the Governor. There were only minor changes made to the Legislative Council over the next century, but in 1948 the Privy Council passed the Falkland Islands (Legislative Council) Order 1948, which introduced universal suffrage to the islands by creating a new Legislative Council consisting of the Governor, acting as Presiding officer, two ex officio officers (the Chief Secretary and the Financial Secretary), four appointed members and four elected members. The new constitution came into force on 4 March 1949, with the first election taking place the same year. In 1964 the number of appointed members was reduced to two and in 1977 the remaining appointed members were replaced by two additional elected members, giving the elected members a majority of the seats. The Argentine military junta invaded the Falklands on 2 April 1982, starting the Falklands War. During their military occupation of the islands, the Argentine government shut-down the Legislative Council and deported several of its elected members (most notably Bill Luxton and his family), describing them as potential troublemakers. British forces liberated the Falkland Islanders from Argentine occupation on 14 June 1982, with civilian rule being restored on 25 June with the return of Governor Rex Hunt. On 18 April 1985 the Falkland Islands Constitution Order 1985 came into force which increased the number elected members of the Council to eight and in 1997 the constitution was amended with regard to voters rights. In 2002 the Falkland Islands became a British Overseas Territory and the Governor was replaced as Presiding officer by the newly created office of Speaker of the Legislative Council. A new constitution came into force on 1 January 2009, which replaced the Legislative Council with the more powerful Legislative Assembly. Powers and composition Under the 1985 constitution, the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council, could make laws for \\"the peace, order and good government of the Falkland Islands\\". The Legislative Council consisted of eight elected members (five from Stanley and three from Camp) and two ex officio members (the Chief Executive and the Financial Secretary). Elections to the Legislative Council had to take place at least once every four years.

History  The Samson Iron Works were founded in Stockton, California and, after becoming known for building farm tractors, were renamed the Samson Tractor Company in 1916 and again the Samson Sieve-Grip Tractor Company in 1917. In the same year, GM, under the leadership of William C. Durant, purchased the company to enter the market for farm tractors and to emulate the success of Ford Motor Company's highly successful Fordson Model F tractor and others. In 1918, GM bought the Janesville Machine Company of Janesville, Wisconsin, another farm implement producer, for $1,000,000 and decided to concentrate production of both companies in Janesville. In 1919, GM decided to shut down operations in Stockton and run both companies as one operation, the Samson Tractor Company Division of General Motors in Janesville. So, expectations at GM were high and they lasted mainly on the modern new Samson Model M tractor. Production of the new four wheel tractor started in May, 1919 at a rate of 10 units per day. It was a good machine and, at first, reasonably priced at $650. But that proved soon unprofitable. So, a rise to $840 followed, thus ending all plans to outsell the Fordson. In 1923, GM closed the Samson division.  Selected Samson tractors  Mainstay of the company before the GM takeover was the Sieve Grip tractor, a large and heavy three-wheeled vehicle with a low slung chassis on which the engine was placed central between the single front and straked rear wheels. The tractor was available with several engine sizes. * 1914 Samson Sieve Grip 6-12; 6/12 hp single- cylinder engine * 1915 Samson Sieve Grip 10-25; 10/25 hp GMC engine * Samson Sieve Grip 12-25; 12/25 hp * Samson Sieve Grip Model 30X (GM) * Samson Model S-25 * 1918 Samson Model M; 4 wheel unit frame design; GM * Samson Model D a.k.a. Samson Motor Cultivator; \\"Iron Horse\\" (attachable to implements, no seat, walk behind type)  Trucks and a car  In addition to building tractors, Samson made trucks and attempted to produce an automobile as well. The Samson truck was built from 1920 to 1923 as a ¾ ton and a 1¼ ton model. It was powered by a Chevrolet 26 bhp engine that had been developed for the Chevrolet 490 passenger car. Success was limited, though. Development for the passenger car started at about the same time. The car was intended as being \\"the first and only farm-designed car\\", meaning that it would meet the farmer's requirements better than the competition, and was named the \\"Whole Family Car\\", as it seated up to nine passengers. The conventional steel ladder frame had a wheelbase of 118 in. The rear bench seat and jump seats of this touring car were quickly removable, thus providing ample payload. Power was delivered by the Chevrolet FB four-cylinder engine, rated at 37 bhp. General Motors announced this new automobile in 1919 and planned to build 2,250 units in its first season and 5,000 for 1920. However, only one prototype was built, making the Samson the only car ever that GM announced but never produced. In 1923, General Motors closed the unprofitable Samson division, transferring the Janesville assembly plant to Chevrolet division. Chevrolet and GMC trucks and SUVs continued to be built at that plant until December 2008, when GM closed the 89-year-old plant as part of its restructuring.

The mill was built in 1873 and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 32698. (Click on \\"Technische gegevens\\" to view.) History A corn and barley mill which stood on this site was burnt down on 26 August 1872. The Molen van Rolde was built to replace it by millwright Hunse of Assen for Mr Smit. The mill has no formal name, taking its name from the town of Rolde. The mill passed through a number of owners and came into the ownership of the Schuiling family in 1892. The windshaft was replaced in 1911. Miller Schuiling advertised for an iron windshaft in De Molenaar of 16 April 1911. A long windshaft cast by Zallandia of Zwolle was obtained and fitted. In October 1928 a sailstock broke in a storm. A replacement was not obtained until 1947 when a second hand pair of sails was obtained from the Krangeweersterpoldermolen at Stedum, Groningen. The mill was put into full repair at a cost of ƒ2,047. The work was financed by the Schuiling brothers, the State of the Netherlands, De Hollandsche Molen, the Algemene Nederlandse Wielrijders-Bond and the Bond Heemschut. In 1955, a further restoration at a cost of ƒ4,125 was financed in the same way, with the province of Drenthe and the Coöperatieve stoomzuivelfabriek en korenmalerij te Rolde also contributing. In 1955, a pair of sails needed replacement. This work was done by millwright Christiaan Bremer of Adorp, Groningen. The woodwork of the winding mechanism was identified as needing replacement in 1961 but the work was not done until 1963. In 1967 the cost of repairs to the mill was estimated at ƒ3,125. On 11 April 1968 the mill was sold to the Gemeente Rolde for ƒ4,900. A new pair of sails were fitted in 1974 by Christiaan Bremer. A restoration of the mill took place in 2000. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) In 2008, the sails were removed and the windshaft was also removed and examined for defects. A new long windshaft cast by firm Geraedts was fitted. New sails were fitted, but retaining the sailstock made by Bremer in 1953 and fitted in 1955, one of the oldest remaining on a Dutch windmill. Description The Molen van Rolde is what the Dutch describe as an \\"achtkante grondzeiler\\". It is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. There is no stage, the sails reaching down almost to ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common sails, which have a span of , are carried in a cast-iron windshaft. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel, which has 47 cogs. The brake wheel drives the wallower (26 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft the great spur wheel, which has 78 cogs, drives the diameter Cullen millstones and diameter French Burr millstones via lantern pinion stone nuts which has 24 staves each.

The strict award guidelines and the notable names on the selection committee (including Nobel laureates) make ENI a coveted award. List of ENI award winners include Nobel laureates like Harold W. Kroto and Alan Heeger. Some websites and magazines have called the ENI award the \\"Nobel prize of energy research\\".http://www.feem.it/getpage.aspx?id=410&padre;=205 The scientific committee of the ENI award includes representatives from Stanford University, MIT, Cambridge, University of Stuttgart, Florida State University, University of Pisa, University of Texas at Austin, and others. The annual ENI award was launched in July 2007, foreseen by the group’s Technological Master Plan. The ENI award extends and replaces the Eni-Italgas Prize, previously known as the Italgas Prize, which in 2006 had reached its XIX edition. Award selection The award’s Scientific Committee – which has the role of evaluating the candidates and assigning the prizes, is of the highest level and comprises researchers and scientists from some of the world’s most advanced research institutes, and includes the Nobel prize-winner Sir Harold Kroto. In subsequent years 63 researchers, from 10 countries, have been awarded: Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United States of America. Included in the number are three Nobel prize-winners. More than 800 researchers from around the world have submitted their research projects, to which should be added the numerous personalities who have guaranteed or been a part of the various evaluation commissions.http://www.eni.it/eni-award/eng/about.shtml The distinguished representatives of the international scientific community who have received the ENI award in the past include Sir Harold W.

They are constructed in several ways, by folding, as in paper airplanes, paper fortune tellers or Origami, or by cutting, decorating or assembling pieces of paper with glue or tape to create a paper doll or paper model.  History  Origami Crane Paper toys date back to ancient times. The history of paper toys can be traced back to the art of origami (or-i-GA-me).The word is based on the Japanese words Ori, which means to fold, and Kami, which means paper. However origami's roots are from China and it spread to Japan somewhere around the sixth century. The craft was for only the rich at first because the cost of paper was very high. They found useful ways to use the folded paper. For example, they would fold it with strips of dried meat or fish and this was called Noshi, which was a token of good luck. Also they would often wrap the glasses of wine at a wedding into butterfly form to represent the bride and groom. As time went by new methods of making paper were developed which lowered the cost of paper. This allowed the art of origami to be more accessible to all people. Paper dolls have been popular toys throughout the last couple of centuries. Unlike the origami and modern paper toys these are usually flat 2d dolls. Often various paper clothes and such things are used to decorate the doll. Much alike the modern paper toys they would often print dolls that resemble popular celebrities, singers, and political figures. They also would print these dolls in magazines for children to cut out and color, they would have a page for the figures and then a page of all the costumes and add-ons.  Modern paper toys  Layout for a paper toy The finished Frankenstein's monster Modern paper toys are made using paper, tape or glue, scissors and a printer. Most modern paper toys are digitally distributed patterns that are printed and cut to be folded into the desired shape. There are many websites and blogs where these downloads are available. There are a wide variety of blank templates that can be downloaded and customized as well. Most often the template will be created in a program such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop or Pepakura and then uploaded as a .pdf, JPG or other image file type.

Bencraft (8 December 1924 – 11 October 2010) was an Australian rules football player and coach with the Sandringham Football Club in the Victorian Football Association. Bencraft, a rover originally from Sandringham, played briefly for the Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League during the 1944 season, playing a total of two senior games. When the VFA resumed competition in 1945, Bencraft played for Sandringham, where he played from 1945 until 1952, and again in 1956. He was a notable member of the club's inaugural premiership in 1946, kicking the winning goal in the club's one- point preliminary final against Williamstown (in which it had come back from a 40-point three-quarter time deficit), then kicking the last goal in its seven- point Grand Final win against Camberwell. He was also a member of the 1947 Grand Final team. Bencraft was appointed senior coach of Sandringham in 1958, and coached there for five years. He led the club to two Grand Finals, including the 1962 premiership – in which the club came from behind to win the Grand Final by one point, after trailing Moorabbin by 44 points at three quarter time. It was his last year in a five-season stint as coach, although he was called on again in 1974 for one more year. Bencraft also had great success as Sandringham's Thirds coach, leading the team to five premierships in twelve seasons; he retired at the end of 1983, frustrated by the fact that the Thirds had been altered from an Under-19s competition to an Under-18s competition that season. Both the main grandstand at Trevor Barker Beach Oval and the Sandringham Best and Fairest award are named after Bencraft, and he is a member of the club's Hall of Fame. He earned his primary living working as a butcher. References  Australian Football: Zebras Back From The Brink * Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007). The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers. 7th ed.

Fruiting in April and May, they are often difficult to locate because of their nondescript brown color. Found in North America and Europe, they appear to favor banks and slopes and sheltered sites. Although D. venosa is considered edible, it may resemble several other species of brown cup fungi of unknown edibility. Taxonomy The fungus was first described as Peziza venosa by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801, from collections made near Klagenfurt, Austria. Jean Louis Émile Boudier transferred it to Disciotis in 1893. Bruno Perco described the form Disciotis venosa f. radicans from collections made in Italy. The specific epithet venosa, meaning \\"veined\\", refers to the veins on the inner cup surface. Common names for the species include bleach cup, veiny cup fungus, and cup morel. Description Young, cup-shaped fruit bodies Fruit bodies produced by this fungus are cup- or disc-shaped, up to wide. The interior surface of the cup, the hymenium, is dark brown. It tends to become folded into vein-like markings, hence the specific epithet venosa; these markings, however, may be absent in young individuals. The exterior surface is a whitish color, covered with pustules. There is a short stipe that anchors the cup to the ground. Although young fruiting bodies are cup-shaped, when they are in diameter, the apothecia split and flatten down to lie in the soil. They are very brittle. The fruit bodies have been estimated to have a lifespan of up to 12 weeks. The flesh of the fungus has a bleach-like odor when it is broken. Microscopic characteristics The spore are elliptical and smooth, with dimensions of 21–24 by 12–14 µm. The asci (spore-bearing cells), are 370–400 by 18–20 µm, while the paraphyses are stout and club-shaped, with tips that are up to 12 µm wide. Edibility Disciotis venosa is edible, and choice, although one author notes that only collectors who have the equipment to check its microscopic characters should consider consuming the species, as it may be confused with several other brown cup fungi. Similar species Species that may resemble Disciotis venosa include the \\"thick cup\\", species Discina perlata (also edible), as well as several species of Peziza. Peziza species generally have thinner flesh than D. venosa, and will turn a dark blue color if a drop of iodine solution is placed on it. Additionally, the tips of asci in Peziza species will stain blue with iodine, a feature that can be observed with a light microscope. Another lookalike, Discina ancilis, has an inner cup surface that is folded, wrinkled, or sometimes smooth, rather than veined. The outer cup surface has small tufts of hairs arranged in clumps. Habitat and distribution This fungus is typically found growing on the ground among mossy or needle-covered soil among conifers; they are often difficult to notice because their brown color typically blends into the background. They have been noted to prefer to grow on banks or slopes rather than flat areas. This species is also referred to as a \\"snowbank mushroom\\" because fruit bodies typically appear around the edges of melting snowbanks. In Europe, the fungus typically fruits from March to May. Disciotis venosa is found in North America and Europe (including Bulgaria, Sweden, Spain, and Wales). It also occurs in Turkey, where it is considered critically endangered.

Formerly known as Lyophyllum montanum, this is a snowbank mushroom, always associated with melting snow along snowbanks and thus glacialis. Originally described by Alexander H. Smith in 1957, this North American species is typically found growing under conifers on mountains. Taxonomy The original specimen was collected in the Medicine Bow Mountains in Wyoming by mycologist Harry D. Thiers. In 1957, Alexander H. Smith, who had received the specimen from Thiers, described it as Lyophyllum montanum, placing it in the genus Lyophyllum because of its dark gray color and gills that became ash-gray (cinereous) with age. However, it later became clear that this species lacked siderophilous granules— iron-absorbing particles that darken when heated in acetocarmine—a trait characteristic of other Lyophyllum species. For this reason, Redhead et al. in 2000 moved the species to the genus Clitocybe as C. glacialis (Clitocybe montana was already used). They speculated that the dark pigmentation may be an adaptation to protect against the higher levels of ultraviolet radiation present in their montane environments. Description Fruiting bodies produced by this fungus have caps that are in diameter; the shape is convex to flattened. The cap surface is initially a silvery-gray (defined as canescent), but becomes yellow or yellow-brown with age. Younger specimens may have a whitish surface bloom which may slough off in age. The gills of C. glacialis The gills are gray or dark gray, and closely spaced together; the attachment to the stem is adnate (broadly attached to the stem slightly above the bottom of the gill) to almost free (unattached to the stem). The stem is long by thick, and roughly the same width throughout, or slightly enlarged at the base. Microscopic characteristics Viewed in deposit, such as with a spore print, the spores appear white. Microscopically, the spores are smooth-walled, elliptical or oblong, with dimensions of 5.5–7 by 3.5–4.5 µm. Edibility The species is categorized as edible. Its odor is pleasant, but its taste is not distinctive. Similar species Clitocybe albirhiza is a brown colored mushroom with similar stature, but it may be distinguished by the white rhizomorphs at the base of its stem, as well as fibrils on the cap that are arranged in zones. Melanoleuca angelesiana is another species found in the same environment; mature specimens of both species resemble each other. They are easier to differentiate when young, however, as C. glacialis has a silvery-grey bloom that is lacking in M. angelesiana. Habitat and distribution This mushroom is found at high elevations from late May until early August. It is referred to as a \\"snowbank mushroom\\" because fruit bodies typically appear around the edges of melting snowbanks. The species has been found in various locales in North America, including Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Alberta.

Found in the mountains of western North America, it is found growing on the ground under conifers, usually near snowbanks. Description The cap of H. subalpinus is typically in diameter, with a convex shape that becomes flattened in age; sometimes it develops a central umbo (a rounded elevation resembling a nipple). The cap is sticky, white, and the cap margin often has fragments of the veil adhering. The flesh is soft, thick and white. The gills, which are attached decurrently to the stipe (running down the length of the stipe), are narrow, packed closely together, and white-colored. The stipe is white, long and thick at the apex; when young the base of the stipe is bulbous but as it grows it thins and becomes almost the same width as at the top of the stem. A membranous annulus is present, placed low on the stipe. Microscopic characteristics The spores are white in deposit; microscopically, they are ellipsoid and smooth, with dimensions of 8–10 by 4.5–5 µm. There are no cystidia present in the gills of this species, and clamp connections are present on the hyphae. Edibility Hygrophorus subalpinus is said to be edible, but bland. David Arora notes that it \\"does not have the greatest texture and flavor\\". Similar species The external appearance of Hygrophorus ponderatus resembles H. subalpinus, but the former species has a sticky or slimy cap surface, a veil that appears to be made of fibers (rather than a membrane), and narrower gills. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of H. subalpinus grows in large clusters under conifers, often near snowbanks, and typically at high elevations, such as on mountains. It is found in North America, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Northwest.

The mushrooms produced by the fungus are relatively large for the genus Mycena, with convex grayish caps up to in diameter and stems up to long. The gills on the underside of the cap are whitish to pale gray, and initially closely spaced before becoming well-spaced at maturity after the cap enlarges. The mushrooms are characterized by the dense covering of white \\"hairs\\" on the base of the stem. M. overholtsii is an example of a snowbank fungus, growing on well-decayed conifer logs near snowbanks, during or just after snowmelt. Formerly known only from high- elevation areas of western North America, particularly the Rocky Mountain and Cascade regions, it was reported for the first time in Japan in 2010. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown. M. overholtsii can be distinguished from other comparable species by differences in location, or spore size. History and naming The species was first described by mycologists Alexander H. Smith and Wilhelm Solheim in 1953, on the basis of specimens collected in the Medicine Bow Mountains of Albany County, Wyoming. The specific epithet honors the early 20th-century American mycologist Lee Oras Overholts. It is commonly known as the \\"snowbank fairy helmet\\", or \\"fuzzy foot\\", although it shares the latter name with Tapinella atrotomentosa and Xeromphalina campanella. M. overholtsii has been given the Japanese name yukitsutsumikunugitake. Description Mycena overholtsii produces some of the largest mushrooms of the genus Mycena. They have caps that are in diameter, and convex in shape, developing an umbo (a central protrusion resembling a nipple) in maturity. The cap surface is smooth, moist, and marked with radial striations. The caps are somewhat hygrophanous, and depending on age and state of hydration, range in color from brown or grayish-brown, to dark or bluish-gray. The mushroom flesh is thin and watery, with a light gray color. The gills have an adnate, adnexed, or shallowly decurrent attachment to the stem, and are initially closely spaced before becoming well-spaced at maturity. They have a whitish to pale gray color, and will stain gray when they are bruised. There are three or four tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem) interspersed between the gills. The stem is long by thick, and tapers upward so that the stem apex is slightly thinner than the base. It can be straight or curved, has cartilage-like flesh, and is hollow in maturity. When growing on soft, well-decayed wood, the stem often penetrates deeply into the substrate. The stem is pinkish-brown in color, and the lower half is tomentose – densely covered with white, woolly hairs. The mushroom has a yeast-like odor and a mild taste; its edibility is unknown, but it is not considered poisonous. Microscopic characteristics Viewed in deposit, as with a spore print, the spores appear white. Microscopically, the spores are roughly elliptical, sometimes appearing bean-shaped, with dimensions of 5.5–7.0 by 3.0–3.5 μm. They are thin-walled and smooth, and bear an indistinct hilar appendage. The spores are amyloid, meaning they will absorb iodine and turn black to blue-black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), which are scattered and interspersed with basidia, are roughly cylindric to fusoid (spindle-shaped), smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 45–65 by 2–5.5 μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are uncommon, and similar in appearance to the cheilocystidia. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (a fungal tissue type in which the hyphae are gelatinous and lie flat) with mostly smooth hyphae that are 1.5–3.5 μm in diameter. The cap flesh is dextrinoid, meaning it will turn reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of M. overholtsii. Similar species Other similar mycenas that grow in clusters on wood include M. maculata and M. galericulata. The fruit bodies of M. maculata often develop red stains as they mature, but this characteristic is inconsistent and cannot be reliably used for identification. Its spores are larger than that of M. overholtsii, measuring 7–10 by 4–6 μm. M. galericulata is very similar in appearance to M. maculata, but does not undergo reddish staining; its spores are 8–12 by 5.5–9 μm. Another similar species is M. semivestipes, which can be distinguished by its bleach-like odor, an eastern North American distribution, fruiting season during summer and autumn, and small spores measuring 4–5 by 2.5–3 μm. Habitat and distribution This species is sometimes found singly, but more often in clusters on well-rotted conifer logs and stumps (often Douglas-fir) near melting snowbanks, or sometimes in moist snow chambers formed by receding snow. Cool nighttime temperatures reduce the snowmelt rate, and help ensure that spores released by the mushroom will be dispersed into the soil. The mushroom is common in western North America, particularly the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains and the Cascade mountains. It has been reported in four US states: South Dakota, California, Washington and Wyoming, but is not known in Oregon. It is also found in western Canada. The mushroom is restricted to areas with minimum elevations of . In 2010, it was reported growing in the boreal coniferous forests of Hokkaido, Japan, in plantations of Sakhalin fir (Abies sachalinensis), as well as in natural forests dominated by both Sakhalin fir and Jezo spruce (Picea jezoensis). In North America, the mushroom usually appears between March and July; Japanese collections were made in May. The fruiting period can be prolonged, especially in areas with heavy snowfall, or at high elevations where the snowmelt is delayed.

The fruit bodies of this species resemble small, black, goblet-shaped shallow cups up to wide, with stems up to long attached to black mycelia. Fruit bodies, which may appear alone or in groups on the ground in conifer duff, are usually attached to buried woody debris, and are commonly associated with melting snow. Plectania nannfeldtii is found in western North America and in Asia, often at higher elevations. Similar black cup fungi with which P. nannfeldtii may be confused include Pseudoplectania vogesiaca, P. nigrella, and Helvella corium. Taxonomy The species was first described by British mycologist Fred Jay Seaver in 1928, who called it Paxina nigrella in his monograph of the cup fungi of North America. The type specimens were found in 1914 in Tolland, Colorado, by mycologist Lee Oras Overholts; further collections were reported from Colorado and California in 1930. The species has also been referred to as Macropodia nigrella, Helvella nigrella, and Macroscyphus nigrellus. In 1957 Richard Korf transferred the species to its current name, changing the specific epithet in the process as Plectania nigrella was already in use (it is a synonym of Pseudoplectania nigrella). The name chosen by Korf honors the Swedish mycologist John Axel Nannfeldt, responsible for some early advances in the understanding of this fungus and other cup fungi. P. nannfeldtii is classified in Korf's section Plectania of the genus Plectania because of its ellipsoid ascospores. Vernacular names for the species include the \\"black felt cup\\", \\"Nannfeldt's Plectania\\", or the \\"black snowbank cup fungus\\". Description Fruit bodies grow on rotting wood. The fruit body of Plectania nannfeldtii is shallowly cup- or goblet- shaped and may be up to in diameter. The edges of the cup are somewhat wavy, and remain curled inward until they flare out when they are very old. The external surface is covered with delicate blackish-brown hairs, while the color of the surface underneath is also brownish-black. The surface wrinkles when the fruit body is dry. The internal, convex surface of the cup contains the spore-producing tissue layer known as the hymenium; it is black. The stem is thin and may be up to long with a diameter of 2–3 mm, tapering towards the base. Like the fruit body, it is covered in delicate brownish-black hairs, and it is similar in color to the outer surface of the cup. The dense, coarse mycelium at the base of the stem is black. The flesh is thin and blackish- gray. Edibility has not been determined for this species. Microscopic features In mass, the spores are white. The spores are hyaline (translucent), ellipsoid, with dimensions of 30–35 by 15 µm. Opinions are divided about the distribution of oil droplets in the spores: Miller says that the spores typically have two oil droplets at either end, Trudell and Ammirati, in their field guide to mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest, says that the spores \\"lack large oil drops\\", while Evenson claims that there are \\"numerous tiny oil drops.\\" The walls of the spores have thin horizontal ridges that are cyanophilic, that is, they are visible with light microscopy when stained with methyl blue. The spore-bearing cells, the asci, are about 500 µm long and 20 µm wide. The asci are operculate, that is, with a flap at one end that opens to discharge the spores. Interspersed between the asci are numerous sterile, filamentous dark-brown cells called paraphyses that are slightly enlarged on one end, and 380–420 µm long by 4–5 µm wide. Similar species Based on external appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii is similar to Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species may be difficult to distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P. vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14 µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P. nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem. Habitat and distribution Plectania nannfeldtii is typically found at higher elevations in coniferous forests growing on wet twigs or other rotting woody debris, often in or near snow. It often begins its development underneath the snow, reaching maturity as the snowbank recedes to expose it; one source suggests that its metabolic heat may help it melt a path through snow as it grows. It may grow singly, scattered or in clusters, and has been noted to have a preference for the wood of Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa as well as other conifers. In North America, it is found in the Western United States and Canada, where it fruits from late May to early August; it is common in the Sierra Nevada and in higher elevations of the Pacific Coast Ranges. Its distribution also includes China and Japan.

Niazi), , is a retired four-star rank admiral who served as the Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) from 1979 to 1983 in Pakistan Navy. He is renowned for being the commander of the submarine PNS Ghazi during the second war with India in 1965, for which he was decorated. In 1979, he took over the command of the Pakistan Navy as its Chief of Naval Staff and worked in close coordination with President Zia-ul-Haq on the matters of national security throughout the 1980s. Biography Naval career and between wars Karamat Rahman Niazi was born in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, British India, to a Pashtun noble family who belonged to the Niazi tribe. After graduating from a local high school, he commissioned in the Pakistan Navy as a midshipman in 1948 in Operations Branch and initially did his training at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Darmouth in the United Kingdom. Upon returning, he was promoted as sub- lieutenant and his career in the Navy progressed extremely well, eventually being promoted to lieutenant-commander in 1962. In 1963, Lieutenant-Commander Niazi was directed to the United States to complete a training on the submarine operations, and qualified for his training from the , alongside with then-Lieutenant Ahmad Tasnim. Upon commissioning of PNS Ghazi in the Navy in 1963, Niazi was promoted as commander and was the first commanding officer of the nation's first submarine, Ghazi. On 2 September in 1965, Ghazi was deployed off to Bombay coast under Niazi's command, initially covertly patrolling the Rann of Kutch coastal areas. However, his mission was to remain off the Bombay coast and engage only major warships of the Indian Navy which were close to the Karachi coast. After the naval shelling by the Pakistan Navy of Dwarka, India, Ghazi again returned to patrol off the Rann of Kutch area and identified two warships, but did not engage with them. On 17 September 1965, Commander Niazi ordered the firing of three Mk. 14 torpedoes at the INS Brahmaputra when it was identified by its navigator officers. He ordered an increase in depth to evade the counterattack, as there were three distant explosions were heard. Niazi logged the explosions in the war logs, but Brahmaputra was not sunk nor had it released any depth charges, as no homing signals were detected by the submarine's computers. After a ceasefire was enforced by the two nations, Niazi decided to continue patrolling the Arabian sea and safely reported back to it base on 23 September 1965. At Navy NHQ, Niazi submitted his mission report, but did not submit an inquiry report of three mysterious explosions that were heard during the course of the mission. Niazi and Lieutenant-Commander Tasnim were public decorated with Sitara-e- Jurat by President Ayub Khan for their actions.\\"Pakistan Navy Submarines: A Silent Force to Reckon with!\\" Pakistan Defence website, 20 September 2009 Niazi commanded Ghazi until 1967 before being promoted to captain and taking a staff assignment at Navy NHQ. In 1971, he was promoted to commodore and temporarily held the rank of rear-admiral to assume the Submarine Command during the third war with India. In 1972, Commodore Niazi assumed the command of the Pakistan Fleet before being selected to attend the National Defence University in Islamabad to complete a master's degree in strategic studies, also in 1972. Upon graduating in 1976, his promotion in the Navy was extremely quick due to the dismissal of senior flag ranking officers. He was immediately promoted to two-star rear-admiral, becoming the senior fleet commander as the head of the Pakistan Fleet. In 1977, he was promoted as vice-admiral and appointed Vice Chief of Naval Staff (VCNS), where he was instrumental in incorporating new ideas on anti-submarine warfare methods. Chief of Naval Staff Vice-Admiral Niazi was promoted as four-rank admiral in the Navy and assumed command of the Navy from Admiral Mohammad Shariff as its Chief of Naval Staff on 22 March 1979. Admiral Niaz was honored with Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Military), which is awarded to all the services chiefs upon taking over their respective commands by the President. As Chief of Naval Staff, he played a crucial role in stabilizing the administration of President Zia-ul-Haq and was appointed martial law administrator under President Zia. Admiral Niazi worked in close coordination with Zia on the national security issues, including those involving internal security. After the Soviet Union intervened in neighboring Afghanistan, Admiral Niazi gave authorization to the Navy's depot command in Karachi to store arms and weapons bought by the United States under a covert operation to secretly armed the Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviet Union. His interests in the country's economy was also noted when aiding in preparation of federal budgets. During the same time, he maintained close ties with the People's Republic of China and held discussion on upgrading the existing naval infrastructure in the country.His tenure last only three years, and he retired on 22 March 1983, handing over command of the Navy to Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan. Post-retirement After his retirement, Admiral K.R. Niazi lived a very quiet life and lives on military pensions. He did not seek public office, but became a member of Tablighi Jamaat in his later life serving on missionary activities throughout his life. On 23 January 2008, Admiral Niazi was among the retired senior military officers from the Ex- Servicemen Association who called for President Parvez Musharraf's resignation in order to pave the way for a complete restoration of democracy and law and order in the country. In 2009 and 2014, it was reported that Admiral Niazi had been secretly monitored by the FIA for his alleged and controversial activities in the country, though no charges were ever leveled against him.

Construction started in the 12th Century and ended officially in the 16th Century. They measured 5 kilometers (with about 4 kilometers still standing) around the old town. The Nuremberg Castle together with the city wall is meant to be one of Europe's most considerable medieval defensive systems.Günther P. Fehring, Anton Ress: Die Stadt Nürnberg. 2. Auflage bearbeitet von Wilhelm Schwemmer. Deutscher Kunstverlag, München, , S. 152ff. The city wall is one of the most important art and architectural monuments in the city of Nuremberg. In the north, the extensive castle complex is fully integrated into the fortification.  The first walls  The first fortifications are believed to date back to the 11th century.http://norica.by.ru/baedeker/besicht6.html In the 13th century, the districts on both sides of the Pegnitz, the Sebalder and the Lorenzer Siedlung, were fortified separately. On the Sebald side, next to the castle and the Tiergärtner Tor in the north, especially the Laufer Schlagturm in the east has been preserved. On the Lorenz side there is still the White Tower in the west of the old town. Remnants of the old city moat have been preserved in various locations. It was not until 1320–1325 that the two parts were brought together across the river by walls: the executioner's tower and the water tower still stand to the west, and the debtor's tower to the east.  The present city wall  The present city wall was completed in 1400 as a five kilometers long, crooked parallelogram. Four gate towers were built at its four corner points. The city wall was divided into the actual city wall (also called the high wall), the ground-level and 15-meter-wide kennel in front of it, the kennel wall rising from the moat and the dry moat. A total of about 130 moat and wall towers can be identified on old depictions from the time. A moat was built from around 1430 following the Hussite Wars and was an average of 12 meters deep and up to 20 meters wide, but never filled with water. In 1452 the construction of the moat was completed. Seven gates provided access to the city: it consisted of the towers (Laufer Tor, Frauentor, Spittlertor and Neutor) and two pedestrian passages (Hallertürlein on the north bank of the Pegnitz in the west and Wöhrder Türlein in the east). There was also the Vestnertor leading to the castle. Where the Pegnitz leaves the city, it was imposingly spanned by the Fronveste from 1489/94; in the east the Tratzenzwinger secured the river entry.  Extensions  From 1500, the walls were redesigned for updated defensive procedures. Old towers were rebuilt or demolished and new towers and bastions were built. The redesign began with the entry and exit of the Pegnitz and ended at the wall north of the Frauentor. In 1527 the Küblerzwinger (also called Dürerbastei) was built in the northeast and the Tucherzwinger, each as a round bastion, in the southwest; 1538–45 the castle bastions (Vestnertor-, Great and Lower Bastion)http://www.nuernberg- aha.de/architektur/renaissance/renaissance_burgbasteien.html were built in the north and west of the castle. In 1556–64 the four gate towers were encased and given their present-day impressive appearance: the Laufertorturm (Laufer Tor in the northeast), the Frauentorturm (Frauentor in the southeast), the Spittlertorturm (Spittlertor in the southwest) and the Neutorturm (Neutor in the northwest). In 1611-14, the Zwingermauer south of the Laufer Tor was renewed and the Wöhrdertor bastion was erected, which was demolished in 1871. After that, the city wall was not adapted very much to the developing state of defence technology. Instead, from as early as the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg had protections in the form of entrenchments far from the city limits.  In modern times  A long period of economic stagnation till the industrial revolution in the 19th century had a museum like preservative effect on the building stock of Nuremberg. When Bavaria took over in 1806, the city retained its fortress status. The five main gates were guarded and three other gates were locked at night. The traffic to the suburbs grew steadily, but by 1866 only seven further city gates were approved for construction in a neo-Gothic style. An application made by the city to de-fortify in 1863 was rejected, as Munich's fortresses were viewed as a stabilising factor in the face of social unrest. On July 12, 1866, the demolition was approved, also in anticipation of a Prussian occupation. In the following years there were repeated arguments about the preservation or demolition of the city wall, for the time being the king reserved the final decision on any structural change. In 1869 the first wall was demolished and further demolitions followed. Due to the growing traffic, the seven newly built gates were torn down from 1877 to 1891. Further breakthroughs in the wall were created: the Sterntor in 1869, the Wöhrder Tor in 1871, the Hallertor in 1881 and the Fürth Gate in 1894 in the form of a bridge. During the Second World War, the city fortifications were severely damaged by air raids. On October 3, 1944, for example, the Fronveste on the Pegnitz was badly hit in a daytime attack.G. W. Schramm: Die Zerstörung, in 3 × Nürnberg, Verlag A. Hofmann, Nürnberg 1990, S. 79. After the war, the destruction was partially repaired. In the 1960s, parts of the Frauentorgraben in the south were filled in. During the construction of the U2 underground line, this section of the trench was exposed again in 1987. Plans for an extensive redesign of the area of the Königstor / Marientor wall in 1967/68 was not implemented.  Current condition  Even though it has been heavily restored or rebuilt in parts, the city wall has been almost completely preserved and surrounds the old town. The largest gap is over 310 meters at the Laufer gate tower (). The preservation of the wall is an ongoing process; in 2005, for example, the Maxtor wall in the \\"Küblerzwinger\\" area was restored.http://www.viezens.de/pdf/MTMN.pdf Behind, on and in front of the wall and in the partially preserved ditch there are mostly publicly accessible walking paths. The moat itself is largely designed like a park. The mighty bastions to the west and north of the castle are set up as castle gardens and are generally accessible in the warm season. At the end of the Second World War there were still 88 towers, today there are 71,http://www.burgen.strasse- online.de/4-colmberg-nuernberg/4-25-profanbauten-in-nuernberg/index.html Many of these are used by organisations, associations and private individuals, for example as youth centers, advice centers, museums, artists' meeting places and rooms for students, and in this way some of them are open to the public. 1997–2003, the Museum Tower of the Senses was planned and implemented in the Mohrenturm (Green B) at the west gate. In contrast to Rothenburg ob der Tauber, for example, a medieval wall with walkable battlements does not shape the picture. Rather, four thick towers form corner pillars, between which the walls extend.

New York: a Novel (2009) is an historical novel by British novelist Edward Rutherfurd. The United States edition is published by Doubleday under the title New York: The Novel. Synopsis The novel chronicles the birth and growth of New York City, from the arrival of the first Dutch and other European colonists in the 17th century to the summer of 2009. Rutherford builds his novel on the histories of fictional families who live there. In New York, these families represent the successive waves of immigrants who have made the city multicultural. The early Dutch founders of New Amsterdam are typified by the Van Dyck family, who prosper in trade with the Native Americans; both the local Algonquian tribes, especially the Lenape, and the Iroquoian language Mohawk who lived farther up the Hudson Valley and primarily along the Mohawk Valley. The Van Dycks soon unite with the English Thomas Master family (he also has a natural Native American daughter, whom he brings with him from Puritan New England). Van Dyck-Master descendants continue to live in New York through the entire saga, providing one of the unifying narrative strands. The character Quash is an enslaved African, who was brought forcefully to New Amsterdam and is held by Thomas Master; his descendants become part of the New York cultural mix. As the novel progresses, more families are introduced: the Irish O'Donnels, German Kellers, Italian Carusos, German-Jewish Adlers, and Puerto Rican Campos. Through their intertwining stories, Rutherfurd explores the various cultural traditions of the national groups and intercultural relations, which play out against the development of the city. Rutherfurd breaks the narrative into sections by date, twenty-seven in all. Most dates comprise one chapter; a few dates continue through two or three chapters. A set of three well-drawn maps of Manhattan Island helps the reader follow the action as the city develops. A fourth map of the New York City region provides a larger geographical context. Critical reception Brigitte Weeks of The Washington Post praised the novel and advised readers against trying to determine the accuracy of every name or event: > But analyzing the veracity of every incident will spoil the fun, and what > makes this novel so entertaining is the riotous, multilayered portrait of a > whole metropolis. Rutherfurd offers the reader a chance to watch a rural > outcrop grow into one of the world's greatest cities in a mere 350 years.

He is notable for commanding the Pakistan Navy in naval events in the war with India in 1971 and was dismissed from his military service and relieved from the command of the Navy over the allegations proved in the light of War Enquiry Commission by the Judge Advocate General of Navy. His termination came along with the commanders of army, Lieutenant-General Gul Hassan and air force Air Marshal A.R. Khan in 1972. He was succeeded by the Vice-Admiral Hasan Hafeez Ahmed following his termination. Biography Muzzafar Hassan was born in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, British India, in 1920 and it is known very little of his early life that is primarily sourced from the military literature published on combined military histories of India and Pakistan. After attending the Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC), he gained commissioned as a Midshipman in the Royal Indian Navy in 1941 in the Executive Branch. He participated in the World War II as an officer in the Royal Indian Navy on the behalf of the United Kingdom on the European front, and was sent to attend the Britannia Royal Naval College after the end of World War II in 1945. After graduating in the staff course degree, he returned to British India and subsequently promoted as Lieutenant in the Royal Indian Navy and decided to opt for Pakistan as an aftermath of partition of British India, also the same year. Hassan was among the first twenty naval officers who decided to join the Royal Pakistan Navy (RPN) as a Lieutenant with a Service number PN.0073 that was listed in the seniority list sent by the Royal Indian Navy to Pakistan's Ministry of Defence. He was said to be an excellent hockey player in the navy where he captained the navy's hockey team against the Indian Navy's hockey team; the RPN's hockey team won by a margin of five goals to one secured against RIN's team. In 1952, he was promoted as Commander and commanded the destroyer, the PNS Tughril along with PNS Tippu Sultan commanded by Captain M.A. Alvi. There, he accompanied Governor of Punjab, Abdur Rab Nishtar, on a Hajj mission led by Pakistan Navy in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. His career in the Navy progressed in the 1960s when he was promoted as Rear-Admiral in 1965 after participating in the second war with India. In 1967, he was appointed as Commander of Western Naval Command and Commander Karachi (COMKAR) in 1968 at the Navy NHQ. In 1969, his nomination to command the Navy was approved when Admiral S.M. Ahsan was promoted as Governor of East Pakistan with a promotion to the rank as Vice-Admiral. As Commander-in-Chief of Navy, he frequently paid visit to East Pakistan to review the operational readiness of the Navy in 1969–71. During this time, he also served as military adviser to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). In 1971, he led the Pakistan Navy against the Indian Navy but the war ended with the devastating effects on Pakistan Navy which lost the number of warships off the coast of Karachi with no cover from the Pakistan Air Force (PAF). The Navy NHQ was located in Karachi which came under intense attacks by the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force which crippled the Navy. The casualties inflicted to Navy included the 408 personnel dead at sea and ~3,000 personnels including 1300 naval officers were held as prisoners of war. Many of his requests to retaliate against the Indian Navy were rebuffed by the Air Marshal Abdul Rahim Khan who reportedly quoted: \\"Well, old boy, this happens in war. I am sorry your ships have been sunk. We shall try to do something in the future.\\" After the war, he was subsequently dismissed from his military service and relieved from the command of the Navy on 22 December 1971 along with the chiefs of army and the air force. He, alongside with Lieutenant-General Gul Hassan and Air Marshal Abdul Rahim Khan were forcefully retired from their commission on 3 March 1972 in a stand up military trial led by the combined JAG Branch. After his dismissal from the military service, Hassan permanently settled in DHA Society in Karachi and was the first president of the Defence Society Residents Association (DSRA)–a neighborhood watch– from 1981 to 1990. Throughout his retirement, he avoided the news media to offer any comments on the fall of Dhaka and died of an old age from a prolonged illness and died in 24 June 2012. The news of his death went unnoticed in the media and was buried in Karachi War Cemetery.

Plot The story is set in the Australian Outback during the 1920s and deals with one year in the life of the Carmody family. Paddy Carmody, Australian-born son of Irish migrants, is an itinerant worker, travelling the country with his wife Ida and son Sean in a horse-drawn wagon. Whilst Ida longs to settle in a place of their own, Paddy is unwilling to abandon his way of life and continues to pick up work where he can. He takes cattle-droving jobs and also sheep- shearing – which he doesn't like, but pays well. At one point, he joins a shearing team with Sean as tarboy and Ida as the shearers cook. They meet various colourful outback characters, ranging from prosperous graziers to drunks, including Rupert Venneker, a well-educated Englishman in self-imposed exile. Along the way. Sean develops from boy into young man. Venneker marries and settles in a small town. And the Carmodys continue on their way. Background The book was based on stories Cleary had been told by his father, who ran away to Queensland when he was a teenager. Additional research was provided by C. E. W.

He is also one of the founder leaders of the group. He was born at Jerai Gaon in Tinsukia district of Assam. Arrest Chetia was first arrested in March, 1991 in Assam but was released by then Chief Minister Hiteswar Saikia. Later on 21 December 1997 he was again arrested in Dhaka under the Foreigners Act and the Passports Act for illegally carrying foreign currencies and a satellite phone. He was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by a Bangladeshi court and was being held at Kashimpur Jail in the outskirts of Dhaka. Charges Chetia was charged with: * Illegally entering Bangladesh using a forged passport * Possession of illegal foreign currency from 16 countries * Illegal possession of arms. He was also wanted by the Assam Police for various cases including killing, kidnapping and extortion. Extradition Since his arrest in 1997, the Government of India has asked Bangladesh to extradite Chetia. The request was refused by Bangladesh on the ground that the two countries do not have an extradition treaty. However, India is still hopeful that the Sheikh Hasina government would accede to the request in view of its tough resolve against terrorism. The Union Home Affairs joint secretary (north east) has recently said that Chetia will most probably be handed over to the Government of India by the Government of Bangladesh, by December 2013. After the 15th India-Bangladesh Home Secretary-level meeting at Dhaka, Bangladesh Home Affairs Secretary Mozammel Haque Khan has confirmed that Bangladesh has agreed to hand over Anup Chetia to India, which will send back Nur Hossain, prime accused in a case of seven murders in Narayanganj. Seeking Political Asylum On 7 December 2008, Chetia had written to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees urging it to grant him refugee status and political asylum in Bangladesh. In a letter to António Guterres, head of the Geneva-based UNHCR, Chetia pleaded that he had already completed seven years of imprisonment and hence was no longer a convict to be held in a jail. ULFA also appealed for political asylum in a safe country. Present status Although Chetia was the General Secretary of ULFA, political analysts in the region doubt his current influence within the organization. On 11 November 2015, Anup was handed over by Bangladesh Government to India. Anup Chetia has been released from the Guahati jail on bail on 24 December 2015.

The Army Air Field was established in 1942 for the preparation of aircrew using North American B-25 Mitchell twin-engine bombers, and a suitable target area was established using Lake Issaqueena, northwest of Calhoun, South Carolina and Clemson University, completely within the Clemson Experimental Forest. Bombing Range Road is still located off of State Highway S-39-291, southwest of Six Mile, South Carolina and west of Lake Issaqueena. History \\"On December 9, 1939, the Department of Agriculture and Clemson Agriculture [sic] College entered into a cooperative and license agreement. On June 27, 1942, the college granted the War Department an occupation permit for lands to develop the range. The War department [sic] also purchased an additional 265 acres within the boundaries of the target. The total area for the range summed 4,096 acres.\\" Three ranges were designated, the Practice Bombing Range, a land range, the Skip Bombing Range, and a Potential 3rd Target Range to the north which was apparently not used. Water targets with bullseyes, suspended on cables stretched across the lake were used for the skip-bombing practice in which low-flying bombers literally \\"skipped\\" their bombs off the water just like skimming a stone, the purpose of which was to allow accurate striking of target vessels on the water. A yellow dye was placed in the water immediately surrounding the target and used for scoring purposes, accomplished by visual approximation. The land range was used for medium-altitude target practice and had a impact area and included three circles with markers and three spotting towers. It consisted of located on top a hill east of the Keowee River and west of Lake Issaqueena. Munitions used were primarily M38A2 100-pound Practice Bombs (about 14 pounds without sand), with M1A1 Spotting Charges in the tailfin box. Use of the range came to an end in September 1945 with the conclusion of wartime training and all personnel except for two caretakers were withdrawn. On December 17, 1945, the range was declared excess to the needs of the Army Air Force. Control of the Issaqueena Bombing Range was transferred from Greenville AAB to Shaw Field, later Shaw AFB, Sumter, South Carolina on January 14, 1946 with the deactivation of the Greenville operation. By May 1946 most of the structures and military property had been removed. First remediation In 1954, Lake Issaqueena was drained for ecological renewal and numerous (\\"many thousands\\") sand-filled M38A2 100-pound Practice Bombs were seen in the lake bottom. The exposed bombs were disposed of in 1955. The lake was not completely drained and therefore the possibility of additional practice bombs in deeper portions of the lake exists. Second remediation Concerns about possible hazards left from the wartime use led to the United States Army Corps of Engineers conducting a site inspection in 2006. This was to \\"discern the presence or absence of munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) and munitions constituents (MC) within the three designated Munitions Response Sites (MRS).\\" The SI was conducted from August 21, 2006 to August 25, 2006, and September 6, 2006. \\"The work was performed under Contract No. W912DY-04-D-0005, Task Order No. 0008 from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville (USAESCH).\\" References *Mueller, Robert, \\"Air Force Bases Volume 1: Active Air Force Bases Within the United States of America on 17 September 1982\\", United States Air Force Historical Research Center, Office of Air Force History, United States Air Force, Washington, D.C., 1989, Library of Congress card number 88-600231, , page 528. *Sheppard, Mark, \\"A Mitchell Resurfaces\\", \\"Aeroplane\\", London, U.K., March 2006, Volume 34, Number 3, No. 395, pages 13–15. *U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southeast and Pacific IMA Region, \\"Final Site Inspection Report - Lake Issaqueena Bombing Range, Pickens County, South Carolina\\", FUDS Project No. IO4SC004201, August 2007, prepared by Parsons, 5390 Triangle Parkway, Suite 100, Norcross, Georgia 30092, for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Charleston District, 69-A Hagood Avenue, Charleston, South Carolina 29403-5102, and U.S. Army Engineering & Support Center, Huntsville, 4820 University Square, Huntsville, Alabama 35816-1822, Chapter 2, \\"Property description and history\\", pages 2–1/4.
